												I backed this game on Kickstarter very early on, basically after having read the words ""turn based strategy"" and ""vikings"" and had very high hopes for the project.During the first hour of play I was entusiastic and impressed with the artwork, the graphical style, the music and the combat system. It runs well, I encountered no major bugs, and the story starts very intense and engrossing.Now, after nearing the end of my first (and, most likely, only) playthrough I can sum up my personal experience with a single sentence: I learned to *thoroughly* hate this game.I'm terribly sorry, I desperately wanted to like this, but with every tedious, frustrating and boring hour of gameplay I had to concede, that just about *every* design choice made by Stoic seems to go diametrically against my personal preferences.Trying to cast an objective vote, I'd rate it about 5 out of 10, because there are undoubtedly many things good about the game, but the essence of what it's about - having fun, being motivated and enjoying the time spent playing - simply doesn't happen.TBS is the very definition of a railroaded game. More than that, it actually *feels* like more than half of the time I'm actually watching pointless, endlessly repeating nice backgrounds scrolling past, while nothing happens. Events are scarce, and when they happen, they kill my motivation and the RPG aspect. Because, frankly, I'm NOT making decisions. I'm playing a random guessing game, in most cases with absolutely *no* clue on what the consequences of the 4 ""choose your answer"" alternatives *might* even be. I hate playing a game where I don't even know the rules, and I hate winning every battle and then losing my heroes (and the associated investment!) to random dialogue events.The world map is like a bad joke on my expense, as it serves absolutely *no* function in the game but as a ""choose your flavour text"" library. It feels like there's an entire aspect of the game simply never implemented here...Same goes for character development and resource management. Both are oversimplified, shallow and simply feel completely unfinished. Each character has one single item slot, and the items available are nothing special. Abilities are pretty much predetermined, and dividing 10 points you *might* receive during 5 ranks isn't that big a deal towards diverity or individualization.There is one single resource for everything (renown) and one single sure way to acquire it (by killing enemies in combat). Sometimes you might draw a lucky card during the random dialogue guessing game and acquire some extra, but that's it. As the resource is used to buy supplies, items *and* for leveling up your heroes, it comes down to either have your caravan starve or run around with level 1 heroes, despite them having earned several promotions on the battlefield. That kills motivation on such an epic scale, and can't even begin to describe it.There are no side quests, no method to forage for food, trade, to gain extra renown or anything - remember, you are on one long, single track railway and never look left or right. You will *never* feel in control of *anything* in this game. For me, however, that is what gaming should be about.Even the combat system, one of the best parts otherwise, has several unnerving flaws that started bothering me in the long run:- You are forced to choose your team *and* the sequence in which they act *before* you know anything about the enemies you will face. Why is there even a deployment phase at the begin of combat if all you do there is arrange the predetermined team on the board? That placement will be void after one round of movement, a wrong party mix or suboptimal sequence will stay, however.- the way the two sides take turns is beyond silly. If you face a single, strong opponent, that one will act 6 times for every ONCE your heroes do something, as it's always the *sides* that take turns.- one stat for hitpoints AND combat effectiveness basically means, that the battles are decided in the first round. The side that starts taking hits is the side that will lose. Always. Without a way to regain strength, a single hit can de facto disable a hero. The whole system is too simplistic, counter-intuitive and artificial. Simple to understand, but never becomes fun for me.And another main grief is the complete absense of a save game feature. Not because of technical problems, but simply because the designers want to forbid me to play the game any other way than to live with the random outcome of their nonsensical guessing games. Sorry, folks, I'm 45 years old, have been playing games for 30 years and don't need *anyone* to tell me how to. This arrogant patronizing annoys me to kingdom come!So, again, sorry Stoic for being so negative, but this game is so totally NOT my piece of cake. Terrific art, great lore, good music and a stable game do NOT equal fun, I'm afraid. Lots of bad design choices for me equal de-motivation, tedium, boredom and frustration. Others might love this game, probably the majority. But it's definitely 100% not for me - and the files were deleted after that completely silly, unfair and annoying final battle.			"

												It really pains me to do this because there are so many reasons to like this game.The problem is that The Banner Saga simply doesn't deliver what it promises.At the very beginning we are informed that at our decisions affect the game: THEY DON'T. Despite the fact that they've created this vast and gorgeous world, steeped in lore and history, you can't even choose where to go. You're firmly 'on-the-rails' for the entire game. Occasionally, you get text based encounters where you get to make a decision, but having played Banner Saga a couple of times, I can tell you that most of these change nothing. Sometimes one character or another dies, but it's trivial since they aren't really necessary anyway.At the very beginning we are treated to a beautiful animated cut-scene complete with voice acted dialogue, so you'd figure those would come up at key points in the game at least, right? THEY DON'T. Not even at the end.As the story develops, more and more layers are revealed: The gods are dead; the sun has stopped in the sky; there's a prophecy; there's tension and intrigue between characters and races, etc, etc. NONE OF IT GOES ANYWHERE. In a nut shell, the story is: survive until you get to the end boss - who has practically nothing to do with anything.The artwork is gorgeous, the concept (Viking Oregon Trail + Turn Based Strategy + Some RPG elements) is simple but it works. But instead of using that simplicity to really open up the world, we're instead treated to a vast tableaux of untapped potential. Maybe they're planning a sequel - and heck, I've put this many hours in already, I might even pick it up - but honestly, if a game leaves you feeling, ""What, that's it?"" It failed to deliver.EDIT: I DO NOT care that Banner Saga is part of a planned trilogy. I WILL NOT base a review of a game on the potential of its sequel. I think that would be a huge disservice to those choosing whether or not to spend money on THIS game.			"

												Despite always handing players a crummy hand, the consistent drawbacks in The Banner Saga are exhilarating, even if they are utterly exhausting as well. While a sporadic bout of good news may flow through the caravan, the tone is clear. It’s an arduous journey and one that will come with death at all times. With an authentically illustrated ambience of harsh winters and closely followed characters, its story seen through tough conversations becomes that much more captivating. Offering simple yet fully symbiotic combat options as an active counterpart to text, this game leaves little to be desired, except the will to survive.Read the full review: http://www.noobfeed.com/reviews/995/the-banner-saga "

												Just want to give my early impressions.  Not a full, formal review.The Banner Saga is a Kickstarter game and it's exactly what Kickstarter should be about: visionaries with bold ideas that probably wouldn't get funded through traditional means.  And that's exactly how TBS feels; it's a game designed by visionaries who love every bit of their craft but that leads to some issues of its own I'll address later.First off, this is a gorgeous game.  The art style combines the clear-line character art of Ivan Bilibin with the iconic backdrops of Eyvind Earle.  Every piece of art from the intricately detailed world map to the rotoscoped animations is beautifully rendered.  The world of TBS draws heavy inspiration from Norse mythology but there's quite a bit of detail and world building when I was expecting it to be very straightforward.  While it is still a strategy game through and through, fans of RPGs will find plenty to like with the well defined characters and detailed world.Being a strategy game, combat is at the forefront but has some niggling issues.  It's a very clean move-action system where character order is more important than arbitrary stats like speed.  Being wholly turn based, action economy is the name of the game as you're forced to dominate the battlefield through superior placement of your units.  Combat could be a bit more robust but normal difficulty is a decent challenge so far and there's ""hard"" for people wanting more of a challenge.  Thankfully, battles are evenly spaced between story scenes so every individual battle feels special.Unfortunately, my biggest complaint of an otherwise fine system is the speed.  Combat moves at a lethargic pace.  There's no option to skip animations or speed combat and in a game where battles with as few as 4 enemies can take 10-15 minutes average, having a speed-up option is sorely missed.  TBS is immensely pleasurable so far and I can only hope it remains consistent to the end.  I'll update my thoughts as I go along.			"

""A tale is but half told when only one person tells it."" - The Saga of Grettir the Strong, Chapter 46The gods are dead. The sun never leaves the horizon, shining on boundless wastes of tundra. The land is torn between men, giants known as varl and armored creatures known as dredge, neither carry any reason to trust each other. A new day dawns, and the world is at the brink of turmoil, weary of old wars, always anticipating new wars; nearly void of hope. In such a time, you take the role of leading a caravan across frozen wastes to its destiny.You play the parts of many characters, make their choices and endure the consequences while discovering the beautifully weaved tale of the realm. Each and every character that you lead tell a story of their own in this Nordic, war-thorn saga. Each choice that you make affects your chances of survival, and makes you approach one step closer to your destination. The setting is incredibly rich, expected from any proper RPG game. Every road, landmark, settlement, mountain or forest; every region depicted on the map contains its own local history. The lore is complete and refreshing.To begin with, the game contains a diverse gameplay, bringing together elements of adventure, role-playing and strategy games. The adventure elements are directly affecting the story, and the outcome of your choices twist and turn to present you alternative destinies. Combats are turn-based in isometric maps, and gameplay is fairly easy to grasp. Yet 'fairly easy to grasp' quickly turns into 'hard to master'. You are able to level up your characters with renown, a kind of currency that you may gain through heroism either in adventure choices or by slaying your adversaries in battle field. Alongside leveling, you are capable of gathering minor and major items to enhance your heroes furthermore.The Banner Saga presents a direct example for my reason to become a gamer: a story to be told. The game satisfied all my expectations thoroughly. I do not wish to present any spoilers, but it is safe to declare that the story of the realm is not finished in this game. Good news is that The Banner Saga 2 is in development. Cheers!Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												I have mixed opinions about The Banner Saga, but I'm still very happy to have played it. Most of the time, when I find games to be surprisingly brief, it's generally to their benefit. However, this is one title where I felt like it ended before it could really shine. I'm appreciative that it didn't drag itself out, but at the same time it's always a bit jarring when the end credits sneak up on you.The Banner saga is some weird mesh of grid based strategy rpg (Fire Emblem, Tactics Ogre, FFT/A) and...the Oregon trail. And Vikings (or something resembling Vikings). However, only the first part of that hybrid combination does the game feel polished, gameplay wise. The game's most notable feature when it comes to the primary battle engagements is the Armor/Strength duality, as well as Willpower and Exertion mechanics. In order to deal a lot of damage to most enemies, especially Dredge, you first have to spend time working down their armor instead of trying to outright lower their health to zero. This is only a small wrinkle to the normal rpg standby, but it is implemented well enough to have two interesting results. One, it creates some very real consequential moments where you've got a unit able to do decent armor or strength damage and you can't be certain whether you should really strip the armor down further or if you should take a chunk out of the enemy health so that they might be finished off sooner. Secondly, it creates much needed class specialization where certain units are much more adept at stripping armor while others are better set finishing weakened foes. The game then allows you to use some basic accessory-equipment to either further specialize (giving an armor-break boosting equipment to someone already well equiped to break armor) or to make certain units more versatile. One thing that I suppose I wasn't used to is that the class-roles are specified and listed on the heroes pages, but they still don't seem as iron-clad or strict as those in games such as the Japanese srpgs I listed earlier (where the class given to a unit is much more defining). I couldn't tell you which units were which class off of the top of my head, only what each given unit was good at performing in battle. I suppose it feels a bit more organic this way. I feel like the willpower-exertion mechanics are the most important (and unique) mechanics of the battles. Exertion allows you to add damage points to your strength hits, break down armor faster, and move further than normal. Morale allows you to add willpower to units as you need it, and replenishes as you defeat enemies. Since exertion determines how much willpower you can add to any action, it was the first thing I upgraded on any unit promotion.The battle animations and sound work is expecially great, and I generally love the look of this game. The battle environments are a bit bland but that's not a real dealbreaker. One thing that I never did gel with was the out-of-battle dialogues, usually set as continously reversing camera shots of the front facing portraits of the various characters. The continuously changing perspective and lack of multiple emotive artworks for each character really made clicking through these dialogues to be a chore at times, and it was sometimes more difficult than it needed to be to determine who was entering and leaving the scene, and even who is all present at any given time.The in-between battle treks with the caravan were not super enjoyable. I was given a unit count of clansmen, fighters, and varl but I didn't really know what this represented and only tried to keep the numbers high because that's what you're expected to do, right? A handful of times the game would tell me that the enemy force was so large and my force was compartively large but I couldn't really tell what numbers the game was crunching underneath. While other moments of open-ended choice and consecquence within these sections was enjoyable (do you help the random caravan you come accross, do you punish the drunk, do you demand goods from the traders if your supplies are low, etc), the various off-screen battle tactician moments (do you charge in, do you pull back, you have x forces against their y forces) seemed to be more random and less consequential. In the last two chapters of the game, I had made a dumb mistake and lost most of my unit count but it didn't seem to matter at all. That said, in general I enjoyed the challenge of the game. I played through on Normal mode, and I even lost two battles (one of which I am sure you are supposed to lose :p ) but the game ended up allowing the journey to progress with those loses, which makes the prospect of a replay to see if I could either avoid or overcome though encounters to be somewhat appealing. The last battle of the game took a few tries, but at the same time, I didn't realize it was the last battle. It didn't really seem appropriately grandiose when considering some of the things introduced before that point that I thought I would be tackling. I'm unsure how much the ending can change depending on your choices, so I might have to do some reading.I just wish the game was a little longer. Some of the units in the game I felt like only saw 3-4 battles, and with the number of units you get in total (quite a few) and the frequency in which the become available and unavailable, and the low-map limit of who all you can bring into any given battle, I just felt like there were a few things I was unable to ever get to try. While I had some units level up many times, but the end of the game I had some units only often enough to have promoted once. But again, I suppose that allows for some variety in re-plays.Great art, but I wish there was more to the dialogue sections, retweaked caravan between battle-mechanics, some larger more interesting maps would be neat, and more chances to be able to bring units into battle which a lower frequency of units becoming unavailable. Though not to any extreme extent, having some limitations on those sorts of things is a great way to force yourself to try out different strategies rather than just bringing your strongest units every time.Lastly, the overarching story and narrative were interesting enough, but sometimes it felt messy and cluttered. You find yourself moving from one outpost to the next, each with exotics names, and never in one place for too long. Yes, there's a fairly nice in game map that helps to try to put things into place mentally, but when the purpose of most encampments is to simply upgrade your units and merch and be on your way, there wasn't a lot of incentive to really keep track of much. A large part of the game boils down to someone declaring that you need to leave place x and head to place y for reason z, and that's really all of the motivation I needed or wanted.			"

												Wow, did I really already spend 15 hours in The Banner Saga? Yes I did and as this game has currently been on various holiday sales it's time for a little subjective review without getting too much into game and details:If you want to know about TBS's game mechanics you best checkout some gameplay video. I'll rather praise what in my opinion makes this game a good one worthwhile both your money and time. - Art & style: Beautifully crafted (rather drawn) environments and characters and map; it may not be everyone's taste but the devs put much dedication into creating a world you care about.- Music: The soundtrack alone is a masterpiece - the classical compositions fit seamlessly into the game's medieval fantasy theme. It really helps the immersion, for example if your caravan moves across the lands.- Writing: It's based on Nordic mythology but neither does it copy known works nor does it feel clichéd. Each character and each location has its own history and meaning. You can read all about it if you care but you don't have to. The story unfolds in a great way and at good pace. I really care for the protagonists which isn't an easy task/achievement for this type of game - I never skipped through any dialogue as I always wanted to get to know as much as possible.The whole story feels like it's part of something bigger, some universe that makes sense - one might even compare it to Sagas like Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones etc.- Gameplay: To keep it short, this is solid turn-based strategy (some might miss complexity) along with text-based RPG where your decisions affect combat and experience. It offers enough opportunities to upgrade your characters and to make the impression that your choices matter without getting overwhelming at any time.These points above are the core of why I recommend this game to others to whom those impressions appeal.PS: As this is a saga the devs currently work on a sequel - TBS 2 (first trailer already out)...I hope this was of any help for your,Yours,Bethlemos			"

												Wow, just wow. The Banner Saga blew me away. Incredible art and animation, and a fabulous turn-based strategy game with RPG elements in general. I couldn't stop thinking about this game for days after I finished it and I normally don't even like turn-based strategy games (or it has to be something like Advance Wars).This game is deep, as far as the story is concerned at least. You'll be losing plenty of people over the course of the game, and it's not necessarily because you made the wrong choice. It's because the choices *are* tough and there usually isn't a right answer to begin with. The game autosaves so you can't go back and try it again, and you can't save manually.The artstyle and animations are just beautiful. I appreciated it, and enjoyed it, for the entire length of the game. There's just so many detail. The characters and the environments, especially when you're fighting. Normally all you see is empty looking environments with a tree or something, but here you have dead bodies lying around and destroyed villages. Nothing looks the same (as far as I can see). They put *a lot* of love in this game. It also feels, and is, incredibly polished. It's simply amazing. The UI is small, clear and unobtrusive, but some things could've been explained a bit better. Some things are a bit unclear if you go to the character management screen, for example. It could benefit from more and better explanation. Still, no biggie.One other thing that stuck with me are the difficulty spikes. These are random but annoying. However, you can change the difficulty on-the-fly so it's usually just a matter of pressing a button.The game itself can take about 9-12 hours to complete, so it's a pretty big game. I personally never got bored of it. Now I'm anxiously awaiting the sequels, because man, this one set the bar pretty high for me. If they can maintain the same quality and polish it will be awesome, even if they decide to never add any new features.Absolutely recommended ![Rating: 93/100]			"

												The story itself starts off with humans and varl(giants) trying to bond thier alliance when suddenly everyone getting attacked by the armies of dredge (stonelike people) and are forced to travel away to confront this diaster, as you travel the lands you'll discover friends, encounter wars, and make choices that will change the outcome of your party. You'll be playing this game from the perspective of two different caravans.What an amazing game for its value, The art in this game is fantastic, the story is also very well done and the music is phenominal you'll enjoy this game if you enjoy turn table tatic with great art, story, and music with a viking theme to the entire game. only cutscenes had voice acting and that was pretty good. The only things I thought was meh in the game was is how a unit must kill off a unit to level up otherwise he'll stay level 1 forever so you'll have to really decide who you want to level up, the limited special moves  that each of the units had (which is 1) for each char, and  the lack of voice acting during the events scenes but this is understandable due to the fact that its an indie title and the focus of the budget was on everything else. So hopeful for future sequels to be even better.The game itself is really hard due to the fact that you cannot heal your units in this game so you have to make your turn wisely,  Your units only levels up if they get the last kill which I was meh about, but the choices you make to either level up your army, buy some items, or supplies for the travel is gutwrenching making the game really challenging, especially since choices you make can effect your entire party and army and your currency (renown) is so limited.There is many heroes to gather during your travel which you'll get to interact with at camp as you travel to learn about them. The travel itself which reminds me of oregon trail a bit,  is enjoyable to watch as your little army travel the lands and the events with decisions unfold for you to decide on how your battle will be or what the outcomes will be.  The map itself presents a sizeable amount of lore about the land itself and there are more to read as you travel.+Good story with good amount of lore and character interactions.+Great Art.+Music is fantastic.+much replayability due to choices you make in the game, also there is interaction with the heroes at camp.+its a 20 dollar game and have a good amount of hour in it, 10+-wish there was voice acting during the traveling event, lots of reading and text-each char only has one skill, not everyone has a buncha skills to utilize and the leveling is really straightforward since you can only level chars up to level 5 max, would love to see expansion of this-No multiplayer of any sort in this one, singleplayer only you'll have to play THE BANNER SAGA FACTIONS for this.

												The Banner Saga is a beautiful story-driven turn-based strategy game/RPG lasting about 8-12 hours. Overall, I thought it was a great experience and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys tactical strategy games like Fire Emblem and XCOM. Its major strengths are its fantastic art, reminiscent of classic Disney or Don Bluth animated films, good soundtrack, and relatively challenging and compelling battles. My primary complaint with the game is that its story is told in a bit of an exhausting way with a ton of dialogue that's not easy to care about, and I was really ready for the game to end a few hours before it actually did. Also, the game feels episodic and I'd imagine more content is on the horizon. If that's the case, I really feel like the experience didn't need to be as padded out with so many seemingly same-y towns and encounters. Still, The Banner Saga is a really ambitious title and one of the better strategy games I've played in recent memory (and certainly the most visually striking).			"

All in all, its an RPG game with turn based combat. Characters in the game are superb, choices you need to make along the way influence the story greatly. After this game, I thought to myself: ""Is it really possible to make such a good game on Kikcstarter?"" I had my doubts before, but now, I'll gladly admit I was wrong.Buy the game, support the developers, and enjoy the tale about Vikings and their folklore.			"

Without giving away spoilers, some companions seemed to be set up to have arcs of conversations that never happened, as well as characters that were just thrown in with no personality at all.To quote Narushima, whos review I found sad but true:""Oh look at that, you just lost two of your best characters forever because you clicked the wrong choices in a conversation that seemed trivial. Have fun trying to play with those lvl 1 or 2 characters that you were never interested in in the first place and who will never be able to do the same job! :)""""Oh no, you have no way of knowing how many days your journey will last, and therefore how much supplies you need, because you're never told, and half the time it's not even clear where you're going.""""What's that, you thought you could explore more than one reply option in that dialog, because that's how they pretty much all work? Nope, not this time, and now you're stuck with a dumb decision you would have never chosen. You're welcome!""The above statements are witty insults to the story, but honestly I still managed to enjoy it.The art and animations were fantastic. Exceptionally well done. Reminds me of old Disney animations.But there are parts of this game that are simply awful.You have the option of choosing your banner in the main menu, they created over 800 of them though you'll probably not bother skimming them once and just go with the default banner, its a cosmetic choice so I ave no clue why they'd invest so much of their time into that and not enough into the gameplay.I LOVE srpgs (trpgs if you like) but I detested this game's awful mechanics.I'm sure many srpg fans have played several other games of the genre: fire emblem, xcom, etc.So let's talk about XCOM. In XCOM, you have a unit of soldiers you command, different classes, all of which use different strategies on the field. Because I can't see through fog, I can cautiously walk through from cover to cover keeping my squad sade and update my map as I go or rush. In the expansion, I now have the incentive to rush so I don't miss out on lootable meld. Two possible strategies for exploring and advancing through the level with rewarding outcomes.XCOM has another strategy for combat: I move each of my units 1 time a turn and there are 3 enemies in front of me. I could attempt to have one of my soldiers walk behind enemy lines and flank the enemy, though if I brought him to cover its possible he'll be found out by another group of enemy soldiers, so I might want to risk just having him walk in front of them and attacking quickly and killing them before a counter attack (although this would put said solier at huge risk if i dont finish them off). I could also use one of my soldiers grenades, though he'd be out one for the whole mission, it'd destroy our enemies cover allowing us low risk execution. There are all kinds of tactical approaches I can use because this game has cover, height, destructible environments, each with different risks and rewards. That is EXACTLY the kind of thought process a srpg should have. Different strategies with different possible outcomes.So does THIS game meet up to having all sorts of tactical strategies with different risks and outcomes? No. Absolutely not. Disgustingly bad.There are three reasons.-Chess style gameplay. You have a turn to move a unit based on initiative. Your opponent moves a unit. This does not change until there is 1 unit on either side. As a result 2 units will move as fast as the combined speed of 10 units.-No cover, no terrain advantages, no heights, only minor cases of walls/objects you can't walkthrough.-The literal worst part of this design choice that led to the biggest problem of this game: injured/weakened foes do signifigantly less damage than healthy ones.If you read those three balance decisions, you can probably figure out the single strategy to use for virtually all battles.MAIM, DON'T KILL.Yes, that's right. You can essentially waste your opponents turn by savagely weakening his units, but absolutely never kill any unit until they've all been beaten. This way you mitigate the majority of damage your units take, waste your opponents turn, while retaining the benefits of your own turn. If a unit is weakened, you're best off using him as cannon fodder and letting him die asap so he's not a waste of turns.This strategy... it would be one thing if it were only a cheap exploit, but its not. It's an ENFORCED strategy.If you DON'T play by this strategy, the game punishes you, there is no superior strategy to this, and the game becomes difficult if you're trying to use any other strategy. With absolutely no cover or terrain advantages or heights it's just a math battle where u run your units over and see how much armor you'd be best off breaking before targeting the enemy hp without killing him. It's one of the single worst design ideas an srpg can have.It is the literal worst srpg I have ever played in terms of gameplay. The genre is sorely lacking in games and I had the best wishes for this one. I've heard they were planning to bring that same battle mechanic back in its sequel. I'd recommend passing on this one.

												An exellent, albeit linear, narrative constantly interrupted by flawed turn-based combat. The Banner Saga boasts great visuals and beautiful soundtrack, character design is spot-on, reminiscent of older cartoons, while still being true to the nordic theme and as historically accurate as a fantasy saga can be.The flaws lie in the gameplay, particularly in the fact the game concentrates too much value on Renown. It's the currency with which you buy food, amulets and level up heroes. It's also not that easy to come by, since it's mostly rewarded from killing things and winning battles (although you, very rarely, gain some for a choice).The game alternates between frequent combat sections, where you and the enemy alternate in turns, regardless of numerical advantage. Combined with the fact strength is both HP and how much damage you can deal, this system encourages the player to not kill oponnents, but, instead, harm them until they all have low HP, only then should the player start the killing.The fact renown is used for everything also limits character choices and story decisions. You'll be encouraged to be a psycopath, partaking as many battles as possible to gain extra renown. To make matters worse, there are no real consequences for such choices.Morale is almost meaningless, only awarding a few extra willpower points at the start of the battle. Supplies are also meaningless, seeing as fighters aside heroes have no effect on war outcome, as long as you win your battle (usually a charge, since it puts you against more enemies, which equals more renown), a team of 5 heroes could win a war against thousands of dredge.Downed heroes come back with injury whoose duration and severity depend on game difficulty setting. Ironically, these same immortal heroes can die arbitraly during text-based events while travelling.While I haven't been able to finish the game yet (always get bored by the game before being able to do so), I've seen users complain the story actually ends abruptely, leaving space for an obvious non-advertised sequel. The Banner Saga is actually just a first episode, despite not being advertised as such.EDIT: I have finished the game on a new playthrough, and the ending is indeed abrupt, with a short (non animated) cutscene right after a rather easy boss fight (just ignore every dredge and focus on the boss). Even if it's part of a trilogy, a game must feature a relatively complete story (compare it to a movie such as ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" and you can see how this kind of ending is unsatisfying). A bit more recently, the store page was updated to reveal banner saga as the first of a trilogy, despite that not being the case on release date.To summarize: The Banner Saga has great visuals, soundtrack and (linear and relatively unfinished) story, but it's held short by bad gameplay which ranges from silly to frustrating, removing almost all immersion or tension the well written story can create.If things don't get better in the sequel, I think stoic should give up on making games and start writting novels or animated short films.

												Oh, Banner Saga.  I supported you on Kickstarter, and I wanted so much to love you.  Your visuals are gorgeous, your music excellent, and your writing sublime.  But your gameplay!  Ah, your gameplay leaves much to be desired.Drama aside, The Banner Saga is a game that should have been excellent, but is marred by its actual gameplay.  The tactical combat is the sort that some will love and some will hate, but either way the initiative system is completely nonsensical, with units in each army getting to act more often as they become outnumbered.  Damage and health are also based on the same number, so as a character takes damage, he becomes increasingly ueless in battle - which is a serious problem if you outnumber your enemies.But where the game really fails is the decisions it presents.  On the surface, it looks like the system used in many games: be presented with a situation, and react.  The problem is that it falls into the trap of frequently making the consequences of your choices arbitrary.  Sometimes you can reasonably predict what result each choice will produce, but most of the time the results come from nowhere, making the decisions effectively meaningless.  If the player can't reasonably exert control, why give him choices at all?The game has been getting a lot of good reviews, so clearly my opinion is in the minority.  But I can't recommend it.  Its gameplay simply holds it back too much from being a satisfying experience.			"

												Most games these days are designed to be won; The Banner Saga is meant to be survived. Anything more would be a mockery of the Viking apocalypse suffered by its characters. The atmosphere of Stoic Studios' first title is so evocative of desolation and despair that succeeding too grandly feels like a betrayal of the twilight sagas. With the gods dead and the sun stalled in the sky, humans and giants work together to eke out a shattered existence. The arrival of an ancient enemy throws the tenuous balance into question and sends desperate warrior caravans across the hostile landscape. The displaced and hopeful follow in their wake, scraping together what lives they can. The leaders of these caravans are forced to make difficult decisions, by which their followers live and die.The point of view shifts several times throughout The Banner Saga, demonstrating the dire straits in which both humans and giants find themselves. However, in spite of the multiple views, so much about what's really happening remains unknown. Each caravan meets many people, most of whom have an angle for survival. Figuring out who can be trusted is one of the great challenges of the game, and also one of its greatest pleasures. It's easy to be trustworthy when supplies are high and no one's laid low by crippling wounds. Righteousness is more difficult to come by when the gods are dead, the horizon is alight with burning villages, and taking on new allies means condemning others to slow starvation.Despite the pervasive apocalypse, not all is lost. Stoic has done admirably at focusing on the personal stories at the epic's core. The key characters' motivations are well-explained, and their mysteries reveal themselves at an appropriate pace. Even when all seems lost, moments of heroism, compassion, and courage keep the narrative of doom from becoming crushing. The ending, such that it is, is powerful. Unfortunately, it is abrupt. Future chapters of the saga have already burdened themselves with the hype from the first installment's unanswered questions. Everything looks and sounds amazing. Character designs are rich and colorful, and their animation is like something from out of a lost 80s classic. The visuals scale impressively, handling great crumbling monuments and fierce monsters as well as delicate human gestures. The deliberate staging extends to travel scenes where no actions are allowed. Watching the caravan struggle through the landscape to deep chants and mournful horn movements offers counterpoint to moments of blood and steel. These contrasts demonstrate relatable smallness against the enormity of the end. Occasionally animations look uncanny against their backgrounds, but the characters are nuanced enough that the strangeness almost feels like a stylistic choice. The music is professionally orchestrated, and would stand out as a compliment to the mood no matter what medium it accompanied. Whereas The Banner Saga's story and sensory appeals are difficult to critique without gushing, its mechanics are more controversial. Combat has many quirks that may seem counter-intuitive to SRPG players. However, learning the ins and outs of the system can be an enjoyable puzzle. Battle takes place on a flat grid. Up to six plot-relevant allies, drawn from a frequently shifting pool, face off against a potentially frightening number of enemies. Battle proceeds in alternative rounds, with one member of the enemy force getting a turn for every allied turn. As a result, keeping weakened enemies alive is often an effective tactic. Hit points double as a character's damage capacity, so getting the enemy to waste a turn commanding a shattered unit can delay a stronger unit's attack. Managing each character's reserve of willpower and exertion - the amount of willpower that can be spent in a turn - draws the resource conservation elements from the rest of the game into battle. Every enemy killed provides bonus willpower that can be distributed to any character, allowing momentum to build from a victorious thrust. Racking up death willpower isn't always a strong enough incentive to overcome the strangeness of alternating combat rounds, but it helps. If the battle quirks get too unmanageable, it's possible to dial the difficulty down from hard or normal to easy.Despite its enjoyable features, not every desperately calculated moment of battle is joyous. Many battles begin with a large-scale conflict, which pits the caravan's rank-and-file soldiers against enemy hordes. The formation options in this system don't feel as strongly tied as they could be to the skirmishes that follow. Most battlefields are devoid of terrain, and facing doesn't matter. As a result, character placement, willpower expenditure, and party composition become the major tactical elements. The sole currency for preparing for battle is renown. When all is lost, only a man's observed actions are important. Renown is used on stat-boosting treasure, character advancement, and purchasing supplies for the caravan. Focusing on any of these areas limits growth in the others, and doing everything is impossible. Keeping a trailing column of peasants fed is an admirable goal, but it becomes difficult to justify when contrasted with clicking the button that increases an ally's armor break ability. The choice is further complicated by the knowledge many more could die if the warriors aren't kept strong.Playing The Banner Saga as a standard game of optimization and the greatest possible success may lead to disappointment. Trusting the crazy - eyed wanderer who smells of stale mead could be the best decision you make all week, or it could lead to a knife in your back. Rolling with the punches and accepting the permanent death of a favored all adds texture to the banner of a doomed people. Some choices are mechanically better than others, causing the more damaging answers to become less interesting during multiple replays. Certain tricks will only be novel the first time around, while others allow more strategic calculation.All saves are autosaves, and are made at predetermined checkpoints. There's no indication when these saves occur, except manually checking the Load menu. Attempting the old Choose Your Own Adventure trick of sticking a bookmark in at a difficult decision point isn't so easy here. Loading a save to choose a new answer may require fighting several battles again. On the plus side, the game is short enough to invite multiple replays. Although the central narrative is the same every time, choices made along the way lead to different side paths and party composition. Simple, split-second decisions can lead to significant consequences.Stoic Studios have set themselves up with a difficult act to follow. The Banner Saga is a rare game that forces its player to think and feel, often in delightful opposition. Its subsystems combine to support the narrative of desperate heroism, hard choices, and survival. Like the doomed giants who fight its battles, The Banner Saga is powerful, thoughtful, and worthwhile. Recapturing this winning combination is going to be risky. When a game is so precariously excellent, a wiggle either way in the sequel could spoil the formula that made the first so magical. Regardless of whether future installments stand or fall, The Banner Saga has done its duty. It may not always give gamers what they want, but it gives them what they need: challenging questions, tactical gameplay, and a strong, fully realized atmosphere.			"

												This game causes mixed feelings. The concept had really great potential but it wasn't fulfilled. Some (+)s and (-)s(+) Art. It seems to me that graphics and music were on the minds of developers from the very beginning and they focused solely on it. Great, fantastic art. Impeccable style. Totally enjoyed it.(+) Caravan management and interactive stories. These determine the result of everything: what characters you'll get, which ones will survive and which will die, how much resourses you'll get etc. That's one of the best parts of the game.(+) Strong authentic atmosphere.(+) Excellent initial concept.(-) Weak repetitive battles and gameplay in general. Too few different types of enemies. Few classes of characters. And there are hundreds of battles when you have to fight the same enemies with the same characters. Boring to death. It seems that developers devoted themselves to making graphics so much that they forgot about gameplay till the last night before the release and barely managed to finish it hurriedly. But often gameplay = fun.(-) Story. It was intended really epic. I mean REALLY big and epic like in Game of Thrones or something. But they didn't have enough resourses, so in the end it finishes abruptly, it is relatively weak, it's not supported by great gameplay, it is disappoining. If they'd taken something of a less scale the game would have been much better I guess.My overall imression is negative which is sadly, because this game could have been truly terrific.			"

												This game has a beautiful aesthetic and engaging story, but too many gameplay mechanics are broken or intentionally flawed to create a phony sense of challenge.  These are:* The devs took the ""turned based"" of turned based strategy way too seriously.  Fights are ""you hit me, I hit you,"" and turns are based off of how you line up your team before battle.  If you didn't line your team up right and properly zerg rush the enemies, you're in for a bad time.  And if you kill the guy who was next in line, the unit three turns away magically gets to go next.  I guess they weren't paying attention until their buddy died?* You can't save the game.  The game autosaves at pre-determined points and that's it.  Made a bad choice or screwed  up your zerg rush?  You go to the last save, which may include lengthy marches you can't speed up and cutscenes you can't skip.  The devs say this is to make you live with your choices, but it's really to punish you for a combat system they didn't think through all the way.* You have a single resource.  No gold and experience, just renown.  You buy food with renown or level up with it.  As you can guess, this can leave your army starving or your team underpowered.  I guess real heroes don't need to eat?  You lose renown for buying food so that must be the case.  * Strength and HP are a single attribute.  This means the more damage you take, the less damage you can do.  This is the main fault of the game - if you don't properly zerg rush the other team and whittle each unit down one by one, multiple characters on your team will be crushed.  There's no strategy and no system to learn.  Either you chip away at each unit (instead of taking out the most powerful first), or you get shredded.  * Forget guarding (unless you're a special unit), cover bonuses, overwatch, or any other hallmarks of the genre.  In this game, you rush in or rush out (and the AI always goes for the weakest unit so you won't rush out for long), and that's it.  Better hope you leveled your squad right or by the time you realized you upped the wrong attributes, you're slogging through hours of unskippable cutscenes and ridiculously flawed fights.This game has great potential, but is so badly flawed that progressing through it will frustrate you to no end and wear your patience to nothing.  Watch the cutscenes on youtube if you have to - the torment that comes from making it unfold for yourself is not worth it.			"

												The Banner Saga was a wonderful turn-based strategy game. It's probably one of the more challenging games within the genre. I personally had to play it a little over 2 times through just to get a better foothold on the combat system. Here are a few observations I can make after playing over 30 hours of the game:Pro:- The game is VERY challenging. The jump in difficulty between easy to hard is extremely high and there is a very small room for error in most battles.- Great visuals. The characters (from the animation to actual design) are amazing. The landscapes are gorgeous and you get to experience them in full as you travel to the final destination.- Numerous tactical possibilities! When you finish the game for the first time on Normal, you'll be able to decide how you want to invest your resources and who you want to invest them on. This opens up a lot of possibilities when it comes to character placement/formations. Even though there's little room for error when playing on hard, there's a ton of ways to overcome each challenge based on decisions you've made from prior experience.Con:- The camera controls are limited. I would have liked to see keys binded to auto-move to each of your characters. You have a max of 6 so f1-f6 or 1-6 would have been nice.- No key binding. I know there's not a lot of use for the keyboard in this game.. but a skip function to automatically rest for willpower would have been very helpful.All in all, it's a really good game. There's a lot of things to appreciate in this game and you can tell that a lot of effort was poured into polishing the experience. I hope that this game continues with further installments because I would gladly pay full price for more of this masterpiece!			"

												I certainly enjoyed this game. It has a unique feel even if everything is stolen from Norse mythology. The story was captivating, so much to the point that I yelled in fury when I happened to loose a member of my party. Combat is perhaps less than groundbreaking with originality but it was certainly solid and very rewarding when it came to leveling up characters. I got a couple of the giants mixed up for a while, but aside from that, most characters have a unique backstory that fleshes out as things progress. It is certainly worth it to read into everybody's capabilities, for the most subtle traits  they posses play out very importantly once you realixe their potential. Every battle should be played with the intent of keeping as many of your fighters intact, lest you be forced to send in your benchwarmers in for the next fight.The artwork was impressive, captivating, and downright epic, however.......... the first cutscenes really got me stoaked for kickass cartoon ""Heavy Metal-esq"" laden story line. The artwork let my hopes fall gracefully rather than total disapointment. Despite the fact that I have 1 and a half playthroughs under my belt I do not see an increible amount of playability, although it seems as though a few play throughs could be rewarding due to the amount of different options/results offered throughout the game.Now, here's where I'm not totally sure how I feel about the game: Choices. Some choices totally blindside you with how determental/beneficail they can be. They game has a habit of throwing scores of petty situtions in your face just so that you'll be unaware of the severity of a certain choice and suffer because you did not treat it with appropiate reverment. I mentioned earlier that I have one and a half playthroughs; this is because I utter screwed myself in the first game so I went back to ammend my ""mistakes"". If you've ever layed D&D, this game has the feel of a ruthless yet rewarding DM that often sets you up to hang yourself with your own noose once you get things going.All in all, I loved playing this game, yet I do not see myself playing it in the immediate future.

Teal DeerDevelopers: StoicPublishers: Versus EvilInitial release: Jan 2014Genre: Strategy, RPG, Turn-based, Dark#Worth/NotWorth: #AbsolutelyWorth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationThe Banner Saga..I've been trying to write this review for two days now. I played through the game twice. The first time I played was about a year ago. I'm trying to find some quick snippet I can use to surmise the game but nothing comes forth. So I guess I'll provide some exposition. Its a turn based, tile based, highly narratively driven up to 5 person party adventure. You make decisions as the leader of a large group of traveling humans and a race-- Well, more of a species called the Varl; which more or less are giants. You are constantly having to manage resources. Battles earn you renown, which is used as a currency and XP. Renown can buy you items for your characters to wear to increase stats, supplies for travel as well as allow ready candidates to level up. Resources are needed on the road for your traveling companions to survive. As well as keep morale up. Poor morale can effect the abilities of your fighters in the from of losing willpower. On the road you will run into events that you will have to make decisions about. Including dealing with everything from fights in the caravan to deciding to trust outsiders or not. I never quite pinned down if they are all scripted or procedurally generated. Some but not all seem very timely. COMBATThe battle system takes a little time to get used to as its slightly obtuse at first. Each characters health is their strength, what this means is as someone gets hurt they progressively become weaker and their strength is directly blocked by the enemies armor. So you must choose to either attack their health or armor. There are some other variables such as willpower, which allow you to move farther or do extra damage in one turn. Killing enemies earn you a notch on the horn which equates to an extra willpower lying in wait when needed. Some other stats that effect the two main ones are exertion and armor break. Exertion limits how much willpower one can use even if they have more. Armor break allows one to do more damage to armor regardless of other variables. There are of course classes for all the characters which have specific abilities such and Tempest, a sort of whirlwind attack and others like Forge ahead that allow you to choose someone to move up in the turn order. If a character falls in battle they will become injured and need to rest, usually for multiple days. The character can still be used in other battles while injured at the cost of lowered stats typically. The game does have multiple endings. I am interested to see what happens in the sequel regarding them. I will also say the game does sort of end abruptly. It does come to a climax but to be honest, a lot it seems a bit unresolved. The game is also, from what I can tell, hand drawn. Characters have very fluid animations when attacking and the overall aesthetic is very pleasing. THE GISTThis is maybe one of my favorite games in the last.. decade? One of the most gripping, memorable and emotional games I've played in my life. Definitely in the top 20 ever. Difficult decisions abound. Stuck in between a rock and a hard place? Can't move the rock? Don't have a drill? People are relying on you ya know. Better think about your actions.Follow my curation for more "

												I love the Viking setting.  I enjoy the story, and it certainly kept my attention.  The combat has some interesting mechanics: armor break, the fact that strength is health, and some great special moves.However, the turns and initiative are implemented in a really frustrating way that, in the end, has ruined this game for me.First, each side gets to move one unit per turn, no matter how many units are remaining, in a fixed rotation.  As enemy units are injured and lose health, they also lose the ability to deal damage.  However, once they are killed, their spot in the initiative order is filled by another healthy unit.  If I have 4 units remaining, but the enemy has only 2 units, then those units will each act twice as frequently as my 4 units, and they will have a distinct advantage.  Sometimes I may have a couple of units across the map who have just killed their opponents, and while those two waste turns walking back to the other side, the fewer remaining enemy units that are engaged with the other half of my force will be attacking twice as often as those units near them.Bottom line is that killing an enemy unit is generally a bad idea until the very end of the fight.I have adjusted to this tactic, as unintuitive and frustrating as it sometimes is.  Now that I have advanced sufficiently, I was able to raise the Strength of one of my favorite units to 18.  Now, his key ability, the sweeping attack that hits 3 enemies, has been rendered much weaker.  Many weak enemy units can be killed by a single 18 STR attack.  When he had only 16 STR, he could severely injure 3 of these weak units in one blow, which was fantastic.  Now, he kills them outright, and what remains are 3 stronger units that now get to attack twice as frequently.Killing an enemy unit is a bad idea?  Killing 3 of them even worse?  My favorite character is too strong, and that's a tactical disadvantage?To me, this is just a bridge too far.Is it novel?  Yes.  Can you work around it?  Sure.  But it draws out the combat as you avoid weakened enemies and chase down the healthy ones before you start delivering the killing blow.  And the longer I play this game, the less I enjoy it.			"

												Banner Saga is a fascinating trip to Norse mythology. Half leg deep in snow I enjoyed the story, the conflicts, dilemmas and also emotions, all in its graceful audiovisuals. Several of its flaws and ambiguities are not worth mentioning. This visual novel game shouldn't be missed (like its sequel was)! There should be more games with this style!

												The Banner Saga’s awe inspiring scope is both its biggest strength and weakness.It paints a picture so lavish and compelling that its almost irritatingly compelling with each new thread it introduces, so rich that you want to spend time learning about every character and piece of lore but haven’t the time to do so. In a medium so oversaturated with derivative fantasy, the distinctiveness of the world Banner Saga creates pulled me in eagerly awaiting even the most trivial of pieces of exposition. It wrapped me up so tightly in its intrigue that even when its problems surfaced they could do little to take me out of the experience, the only real issue then being that said experience unfortunately only has enough time to tell part of its story.The Banner Saga is quite simply the telling of the end of days. The Sun has stopped moving, the gods are dead, and the return of an enemy thought extent threaten to annihilate those few who still survive. It’s bleak and unrelenting in its showcasing of how dire a place the world has become, as you embark on a caravan fleeing to anywhere not already destroyed, many not living to see the journey’s end.The tension of the narrative - the abundant despair and sacrifice every step of the way - rejects the overly cautious writing far too often substituted in for more disruptive outcomes, and makes the characters you travel with people you care and worry about. With how constant the possibility of death becomes, I was invested not only in each character’s narrative but also in fighting to keep them alive as best I could. The choices presented before you become agonizing decisions that often decides who lives and dies, leaving me paralyzed as I hoped I’d made the right call. It’s stressful, but crucial to the story Banner Saga wants to tell and the emotion it intends to make you feel, and it succeeds at this almost perfectly.The lack of voice acting or animated cutscenes for most of the game definitely at times hinders the impact of events, but by the time these begin to arrive I was already so caught up in who my characters were that dialogue alone was enough to humanize them. The bigger “problem” is that Banner Saga’s narrative and world are on a scale far larger than a single game can contain, and as a result many of the story’s plotlines both overt and secondary are left dangling, with a statement that they will be expanded upon with the next two games in a planned trilogy, but for the time being left me frustrated that I was so quickly cut off. Of course I say this only because of how enthralling the narrative is already, but it was a tad disappointing to see so much setup but only partially executed, leaving me with more questions than answers and praying this adventure gets finished.With how seamlessly the experience flows together, it might be easy to forget that under all the plot and jaw-dropping artwork exists a polished and inspired turn-based strategy game. The Banner Saga works as a game of small, important numbers and mechanical simplification so as to make every fight immediately understandable. There are very few numbers to be concerned about, and every one that is here matters and is imperative to make the absolute most of if you want your party to survive. Fights are designed not as giant encounters or grand boss fights, but small battles that often come down to the last fighter standing. This raw, streamlined approach was refreshing, not only in that it cut down on the number of throwaway encounters but also made me far more conscious of every tool at my disposal.Party creation and leveling were more meaningful to me as each character played a distinct role in combat, and raising their skills was a rare and extremely important event. The low numbers tied to everything kept things from ever becoming overwhelming, and made positioning of fighters just as if not more important than the blunt force they could inflict. With each battle intimately tied to the narrative, I also became conscious of who it was I was sending into battle, a decision that could potentially result in them never coming back.The areas where combat breaks slightly are mostly related to a handful of oversights as to what information you’re given. Though you might have been given hints via a preceding narrative bit, you’re never allowed to see who or what you’re fighting before the fight has already begun. This makes selecting the right fighters almost a game of luck or forcing you to develop a standardized strategy and only focus on characters that work within it (which of course is compromised if one of those characters dies or is injured). It prohibits experimentation and seems kind of silly, as surely you could see the battle you were going into before you walked into it. This extends even into letting you see character stats, level up, or change items on the party select screen, which can have a huge effect on your outcome if you haven’t recently looked at and adjusted these earlier.What’s surprising though, is that The Banner Saga’s flaws for as irritating as they often are feel less like problems and more potential. There’s so much here that’s inspired, engaging, and full of promise that anything that doesn’t work perfectly doesn’t bring the game down but show areas where it could be made even more amazing. This doesn’t make it a flawless game, but it does make it one that’s worth playing despite any mistakes it makes. Developer Stoic’s ambition is intoxicating and left me not unsatisfied by what The Banner Saga isn’t, but excited to see just how much more it becomes.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

Posted: December 20, 2014
												I had heard very good things about this game so I had high expectations. The art is indeed gorgeous, it is reminiscent of old animation movies from 70s and 80s, but with a modern twist. Unfortunately I wish there was more positive things to say about the game. Well, the world and the background story are pretty good, plus the game doesnt feel too short nor too long... I actually was positively surprised by it, I thought the story would draw to an end earlier. Here's a collection of random thoughts I have about the game:1) you spend almost half of your time staring at a long string of tiny characters plodding at unnatural speed through snowy landscapes. 2) the map is not integrated at all in the game. You dont have any saying in which direction your caravan is going, everything is decided. You can access the map only when you camp or stop the caravan, and at that point I've already forgotten where I am supposed to go... why isnt the map shown when the route to be taken is presented to the player? there's a huge map full of Norse-sounding names, and you can click on most of them to get additional info... but why would you? I got bored after a while, like with the planets' descriptions in Mass Effect. You dont just dump a huge map to the players to satisfy their thirst of knowledge, you introduce the world little by little with bits and pieces that are relevant to the story.  In TBS only a handful of locations on the map matter for the story and they are all non-descriptive... one town or the other, they feel all the same (except the Varl capital). 3) I heard some people saying ""The dialogues are really good""... well I dont know what kind of games these people have been playing but the dialogues in TBS range from average to bad, with a couple bordering to nonsensical (e.g. the one of the mead house stands out for making little to no sense). I grew more and more irritated. 4) Another little irritating thing: the lines in dialogues only proceed forward. If you press accidentally the mouse key (in my case the trackpad) you will skip to the next line without possibility to go back. it happened to me a bunch of times, I play with the finger resting on the Macbook's trackpad and a little twitch sends the dialogue forward5) the story feels really average, many questions are left completely unanswered... I can only guess they might be doing a sequel to expand on the story. I'm not gonna mention anything to avoid spoilers but seriously there's stuff that happens that you feel it's major and could definitely steer the story some way or the other, but instead nothing happens and the event/story element is not mentioned anymore afterwards. 6) the fighting system is super clunky, doesnt feel fluid at all. You are often pitted against more numerous / stronger enemies and your characters never seem to level up fast enough for the fight to feel equal. Moreover they are equipped with abilities which are often difficult to use (this ability? Only works with enemies which are positioned EXACTLY diagonally in respect to the original target. Oh you think it's hard to use? How about we make it so that it can inflict damage also to your allies?), or semi-useless (each time my Raidmaster used Stone Wall he's never been targeted afterwards; Rain of Arrows, Mend, and others are so nerfed they suck). In the end it pretty much resolved in ""I start chipping down the armor first, then I go for the health"" with basic attacks, hoping the bad guys would go down before mine. Sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt. Lost maybe 1/3 of the battles, without chance to replay them. 7) the big-scale clashes are just ridiculous... you can chose one of the strategies like ""Hold them"" or ""charge"" or ""tighten your ranks"", and how the battle will resolve feels totally random. If it is not, than there is no way to understand the logic behind it. 8)  I felt no attachment whatsoever for the characters nor the caravan members (i.e. people who depended on me for protection and leadership). Especially the caravan members, they are just a stat, when they starve you see the numbers going down and the morale plunging and you're like ""yeah so what? the game continues anyway."". This is a major drawback, you dont feel you have anything to lose, you can lose all the battles and starve out almost everyone in the caravan, you will still go on. At a certain point I started playing like a di*k, thinking ""well let's see how much I can f-up before I get a game over screen""... it never came. Ok for the story-driven playability, but this is still a game. If the game plays itself what's the point?9) you are forced to make totally random choices. E.g. how many ratios to buy before setting on a leg of the journey... you have no idea how many days it will last... how about informing the player?? Renown is always scarce, because it is mainly used to evolve characters, so it would be good to have some planning before spending some hard-gained renown.10) The banner itself plays NO role at all in the story, it is mentioned in one line of dialogue and that's it. For the whole game. So much for a whole ""saga""....11) Hardly any tutorial in the game, just a basic one about combat. How about explaining how the different abilities work? I had to quit the game and resume from last checkpoint when I realised my assumptions about a certain ability were off and I lost the little tactical advantage I had because I screwed up12) I dunno what was the reason, not enough money to put in the artistic production or time constraints, but I got so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off when I realised (and i realised it pretty soon in the game) that there is only one image for each character. All the dialogues, during the whole story, the same expression. Zero emotion response. Oddleif is stuck with the same scornful expression for the whole game, Eyvind with a sorry♥♥♥♥♥♥♥smile, and Ubin goes around holding his quill even in the middle of a battle.			"

												According to Steam I tried for 8.5 hours to like this game. I failed, even though the story looks interesting enough and the visuals are beautiful. I have read from others how they dislike that choices give little hint to as what the outcome could be. Even worse is how the story swaps between protagonists and thus those outcomes are arbitrarily moved into the future.Still, I'd try to play it if it wasn't for the gameplay. The combat must be the worst turn based combat I have experienced. Units can move past enemies, in and out of melee without any fear of turning their backs on enemies. While attacks of opportunity have become a staple for many games, they are non-existent in the Banner Saga. Coupled with how units can burn Willpower for extra moves and then burn Willpower to boost their attack, means that even if you try to tie up an enemy in melee, they can still stroll past your fighters and get to your back row. After all, archery range is within charge distance. And since movement is always the same, there is no chance to get out of melee range once an opponent has gotten close.Even worse is the initiative system. Both sides take turns moving units, meaning that the side with less units gets to move those more often. If those are more powerfull, having twice the stats of the player's units, then those powerfull enemies hit multiple times before you have the time to even try to save your hero.Yes, you can learn to beat these fights. But it seems less like adapting tactics than learning to play a broken system.I had heard combat was bad, but I had not expected it to be this bad. At least I bought it very cheap on the Humble Store for a good cause.			"

												I had a very hard time deciding if I should give this game a thumbs up, or thumbs down. TL;DR: This game is too short, the story left wholly unfinished, and your choices matter much less than the game leads you to believe. Purchase only on a good sale. At first blush, this game is evocative and intriguing; the artwork is beautiful and the characters well-wrought. It's sort of an Oregon Trail meets turn-based RPG, and the story appears vast and your choices deeply important.Unfortunately this game fails to deliver in three key areas: choice, story, and length. At the beginning you feel like your choices matter. Make a wrong decision and you run out of food, or an important character dies. Later, you realize that you're pretty firmly on the rails; you might save people here or there, but in the end, it doesn't really matter much who lives and who dies. I was deeply disappointed to discover this, as the game felt like it offered really gritty options in the beginning. The story and length problems go hand-in-hand--this feels like a book you slam shut in the middle and never pick up again. There are so many loose threads that doesn't have answers, so many stories left untold. The ending felt so abrupt that I had to do some internet searches to see if I'd somehow screwed up and ruined my game, or if the credits just happened to roll in the middle. It didn't end, it just dropped off into oblivion. I got roughly six hours of gameplay out of this, so the $10 sale price tag wasn't too bad. If there's a sequel released, I'll pick it up for roughly the same price...but for now I feel cheated. Not in price, but in story. There's so much left unfinished that I feel unsettled, and the realization that my choices matter not is rather disappointing as well.			"

												Beautiful but Flawed.Greatness lurks beneath the skin of The Banner Saga. It is a beautiful, emotionally involving and utterly unique experience, but sadly I found this first installment to be marred by a host of frustrating design problems.The artistic vision of The Banner Saga is without peer. Its world, characters and story are depicted with rare clarity and conviction, without compromise. The visual style is bleak yet gorgeous and can be mistaken for no other game. The music (by the talented Austin Wintory of 'Journey' fame) powerfully evokes a forlorn, dying world. The writing too is excellent throughout, defining tragic characters with sombre nuance.The combat in the game is also novel and interesting, with great tactical depth. Battles are tense and strategic, and the developers succeeded admirably at weaving it into the storyline - battles affect choices and choices affect battles, each adding meaning to the other. That a turn-based combat game kept me so enthralled with its story (an unremittingly bleak one, at that) is a testament to the talent and passion of the studio.That said, at the same time everything feels somehow underproduced; voice acting and animation are conspicuously absent in all but a few scattered scenes, and each character has one fixed expression - which can sometimes be incredibly inappropriate to the dialogue. While it is true that the art design of the game is deliberately spare, my impression was that some things had been over-simplified, as if the game had been rushed to completion.Minor cosmetic issues aside, the game felt unfinished in other more problematic ways. It crashed several times for me, and on each occasion I suffered from poorly placed autosaves. The combat interface also frequently proved vague or incomplete, in many cases failing to explain critical rules. One consistent frustration was the inability to undo or preview character movement, in cases where the (often severe) consequences of a particular move could not be determined beforehand - this did not seem like a deliberate choice, but as with the incomplete UI more likely due to a lack of playtesting.The most frustrating aspect of the game, for me, was the handling of player narrative choices. This story is one of loss and hopelessness, so as such I accept that there are no happy endings to be found, but rather a series of tragedies to be survived. And as in combat, the player is asked to make difficult decisions, with no clear right answer - but unlike in combat, the consequences are utterly random. In combat, the player is asked to make careful choices and is rewarded with various bonuses on success. These bonuses usually relate to specific characters, as do the combat choices, so this feedback cycle works well, strengthening engagement with the characters and story in a satisfyingly consistent way.Narrative choices on the other hand, often reward the player with an unforeseeable slap in the face, throwing away much of their prior hard work - for example by stealing away a character in whom the player had already invested a lot of time and emotional energy. I question why player choice is involved at all, if it does not involve skill. If the intended purpose was to make the player identify with the hopelessness of the characters' situation, then this would have worked better if the choices embodied clear tradeoffs: in a bad situation, allow the player to pick which sacrifice to make, based on what is more important to them or to the character. But by consistently leaving me feeling cheated and powerless, by the end of the game it merely served to reduce my engagement with the characters and plot.Years from now I feel sure that I will remember The Banner Saga more for its strengths than for its weaknesses. The beauty of the experience implies a great deal of talent, and the various flaws are all fixable - as such I still highly recommend the game, and have high hopes for its sequels!			"

												10/10 - Epic Nordic Tale With Turn-Based Combat! This game exceeded my expectations on every front; I found it so enjoyable that immediately upon completion I purchased the sequel at almost full price. No regrets either!The game brings together elements from several genres and magically blends them together in this Choices Matter masterpiece. The main point of interest for me was the lengthy, epic tale that unfolds as you lead your people through struggles of surviving a increasingly barren world. You trudge your army in a side scrolling fashion and frequently engage in grid turn-based combat which I love. This elements really reminds me of the combat style in the Kings Bounty series; if you liked that... You'll love this. My first play-through took about 11 hours. I will 100% play this through again, maybe several times. Replay value = Very high! With over 25+ characters to assemble your army and hundreds of camps and towns to explore; you'll be sucked in quickly!Overall, definitely worth the $20; grab on sale if you can but not required in my eyes! A must play for turn-based and fantasy lovers alike!   Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more. Free Keys and Reviews weekly!

												I don't think The Banner Saga is a very well executed game. The ideas are certainly there, the story is interesting, the music is excellent, but gameplay-wise, it has some pretty egregious design problems.Consider that players replaying the game regularly consult a guide to check when certain characters might die, in order to not waste resources levelling before that point. Then consider that on your first run, you don't have that - you have the option to choose from an assortment of characters, spending your points (renown) on whoever you please. But while they can die from your negligence, they generally don't: they die from purely unpredictable events instead.Well that's how surviving in a viking wasteland is, yes? That's how it should be!The trouble is that this is not FTL - a run is not 1-2 hours, it's 10, and it isn't replayable if you find yourself trapped with a now-useless team after luck decides to screw you. It's harsh, and adds to the tone of the game, but it's also ruinous. Save-scum, save-scum.Double-edged sword that may be, I can see the justification for it. What I can't justify, at all, is that the game essentially does nothing with it's random encounter system. Events pop up and you're faced with options. Based on my runthrough of the game, I'd say you get positive outcomes maybe a fifth of the time. Further adding to the harsh climate of the game, etc, etc... the trouble is, your options tend to lie in shades of grey between the -right- thing and the -wrong- thing to do in any given case... and THERE IS ZERO DIFFERENCE. They're all dice rolls, and that I started at a point of angelic service to my fellow survivors and slowly arced towards commiting horrible deeds for my tribe caused not one change. It was dice rolls all the way through; you get nothing in exchange for that guilt, and seeing what emotional impact it has on the player to decide, I'll murder this person in front of my (character's) daughter, when you take the plunge and hit that button ----> dice roll. The same dice roll. 80% of the time, it goes bad, and you feel worse.(On a lesser note, a gripe: this game totally does not have good animation, as nearly everyone is excited to share. It has a very cool art style, but central story beats aren't illustrated; they're all just text... including the climax.)I leave off with one thing. The final boss is very very poorly designed, requiring a combat style the rest of the game would punish (rushing in a straight line forward), and I didn't/couldn't finish with the team I had, and I now have no intention of continuing with this franchise. Cross your fingers. You might find the telepathy to make the right decisions, and the game might be fun!For me it was a lesson in negative reinforcement.			"

												I was very disappointed in this game.The GoodIt's beautiful. The animation and soundtrack are phenomenal. The combat is satisfying.The BadThe story is slow to start but by the time it gets interesting the game ends. The story is presented almost entirely through text and that text reads like a ""choose your own adventure novel"". This would be fine but the quality of writing is lacking and the way the text jumps between third person perspective and second person narrative is annoying. It's especially annoying because there are multiple points of view for a majority of the game.I'm an avid reader so I don't mind reading in my RPGs but I at least want some consistency.As for the main game mechanics it's a lot like a 2D Oregon Trail. The campaign consists of two stories following two player controlled caravans as they cross a map. Most of the choices given the player consist of:Do the smart but heartless thingDo the dumb but moral thingDo nothingThere will be other options but they either return you to previous ""options"" or are just variations on the same.The main game mechanics  consist of making dialogue choices and trying to keep your caravan of refugees alive by making the correct choices.The entire game is on rails so you don't actually change the story or make meaningful decisions (outside of combat), you just get rewarded or punished for the choices you make.SummaryAll in all the lack of real game content and lackluster story heavily detract from a beautiful game that could have been brilliant but just overall feels lacking. There's also nothing to do after the main story has concluded but play the game again. I would be okay with that if they story had been well written and the other game mechanics had been fun.If you're looking for a finished tactical RPG keep looking. This is apparently the first of three chapters but it's up in the air if those will be made, and as it is this is not a finished game. It ends abruptly just as the story becomes interesting, and no matter what you do, the ending is the same. The store page should be more reflective of the fact that this is not a single player version of Banner Saga Factions, but is in fact more like Oregon Trail, with some tactical combat tacked on. Or maybe it's the other way around, but either way it doesn't work.Updated Review on 1/16			"

Pros:- Unique and great looking art [+++]- Fun turn-based combat system [++]- Great underscoring [+]Cons:- The rewards/penalties for in-game decisions are inconsistent.  You can't play a ""good"" or ""bad"" character.  Help someone, get punished.  Hurt someone, get rewarded.  Or vice versa.  [---]- Short and somehow repetitive; about 9 hours for the first playthrough without much variety [--]- Story and gamplay are too linnear; not enough variety to warrant multiple playthroughs [--]ProCons:- The main narrative isn't as interesting as the world it passes through, which is terribly interesting [++-]- Voice acting is sparse, but good when present [+-]- There is almost as much (if not more) story than game, which would be a positive if the main narrative was better [+-]- Limited character progression system, but diverse character options [+-]- Initiative is interesting.  One character from the player team will go and then a character from AI team will go.  A character death will only reorder the initiative order of the team, not globably, until a team only has one character remaining.  Then the last character will have to face the entire team in succession.  This means that even if a team with two characters is grossly outnumbered, the outnumbered team is still moving every other character. [+--]Final Verdict:It is an interesting game and worth playing for the art and combat system.  But it isn't worth the $24.99 retail price.  You might feel you got more of your money's worth at $15 and below.			"

IntroductionThe Banner Saga is made up of three parts:(a) Dialogue & Role-playing -- You assume the roles of fixed characters and guide them through the story, in a choose-your-own-adventure style, albeit in a relatively linear way.(b) Traveling -- You manage a viking caravan that's almost always in peril, with enemies constantly on its heels.(c) Tactical turn-based combat -- You assemble your heroes (1-6 of them) and fight against various enemies on a grid-board. This part of the game is probably the one you'll spend more time with.The GoodThe first thing you've probably noticed about The Banner Saga is the uniquely beautiful graphic/visual style. Just look, if you haven't. What you can't actually ""experience"", unless you actually play the game, is the excellent bonding of the music with the visuals and the atmosphere it creates. That's also unique and powerful, worth another thumbs up. Now, lets get to the main course, the combat system. If you've played Factions, the free-to-play offspring release in March 2013, you know what I'm talking about. The combat mechanics are very sharp and allow for great simplicity and remarkable strategy depth, at the same time! It's the paragon of the ""easy to learn but hard to master"" type of game. Finally, the last merit I'm gonna give to the game is the marvelous lore and deeply detailed world they have created. It takes a lot off of the viking/Norse history, but it also blends-in many fantasy themes in a very successful way.The BadOK, enough with the good stuff. Lets see the bad ones. Actually, what hurts most about this game is its own extremely high potential. I mean, it offers so much potential that seeing it come short of that is enough to let you down. For me, the biggest problem about the game is that the final product feels a little rushed, kinda unfinished in the sense of consistency and balancing. There aren't big flaws in the core mechanics of the game, but it could use a lot more polishing. I'm gonna bring up some specific issues so that you understand what I mean:-- Caravan/Survival balancing issues : Sometimes the game feels too hard for its own sake. I mean, it's supposed to be hard, about survival and all, but at some points it just feels wrong and falls out of perspective. EDIT: This was addressed, to some extent, by the first patch. Chapter 6 is now kinda easier, but there's still no incentive to try to keep your clansmen alive, or have more join you...-- Language & Localizations: In my opinion, the language used is often too ""casual American"" styled, something that hits bad with respect to the viking theme of the world. Also, the quality of some localizations was sub-standard, according to native speakers.-- Inconsistencies and awkward ""story delivery"" : The game is all about a branching story line, where each choice you make has consequences. That's fine. Problem is that it feels like some story parts don't quite glue together, or the pacing of the story changes from Chapter to Chapter sometimes putting you off. That's more noticeable near the end of the game, where the pace dramatically picks up, and you are bombarded by a lot events all at once, that you barely have time to digest. Also, I could argue that the ending sequence, despite its emotional strength, is a little wanting in view of the climax that precedes it. Finally, it's quite evident that the game is just the first part of the proclaimed trilogy, so it leaves a lot of unanswered questions. It's not a cliffhanger per se, but close enough.My opinionTo conclude, I'm giving it the thumbs up because it's a beauty to behold and has four very strong components (visuals, music, battle system, theme/lore). Also, I believe that most of the problems I found can be easily addressed with patches without meaning that the game is ""bad"" in its release state. I'll say it once more -- The only thing that is not perfect about the game, is that it has the potential to be more than perfect! "

Posted: October 4, 2014
												One of the best games I've played in a long time. Three reasons stand out:First, the writing is superb. I recently finished Divinity: Original Sin, and have played all kinds of RPGs from the old Baldur's Gate titles to Morrowind to System Shock 2 and a lot in between. This game manages what few others do: create believable, interesting characters without walls of text. I like reading, but I don't like huge amounts of text that do little to further the story, character development or immersion. Even though I liked D:OS a lot, and the game had some great writing, a lot of the dialogue was just doing nothing to these ends. The density of little clues and nuances in the Banner Saga is astonishing, coupled with some humor and great attention to setting-appropriate terminology.Second, this might be the first game ever that managed to make me feel pressed. Generally, games I've played fall in two categories when it comes to time-crucial missions: either they don't enforce it at all mechanically, meaning that while the princess is being eaten by the bad guy I still have all the time I need to loot chests, talk to strangers and tend to my weapons. Or they implement some kind of timer - an option I hate with a passion because it feels so out-of-setting and forced. In the Banner Saga the whole setting screams 'hurry up' - and you do, by weighing the alternatives and choosing how much time to allocate to them. At least to me, it never feels artificial, or unfair, or like a difficulty-thing, it's just part of the story.Third, and fans of A Song of Ice and Fire will likely agree, the fact that beloved characters can die on a whim makes the whole cast and your decisions infinitely more interesting. I'm generally someone aiming for the best possible outcome in RPGs, including loading a save game when something turned out to be a bad decision. In the Banner Saga, for the first time ever perhaps, I did not feel annoyed by bad things happening to me. It's just 'damn... guess the next few hours just got a lot harder'.All in all a very, very good game, including the ending. Fights can get a bit repetitive since you only have one special ability per character, and some of those are frankly useless, but that's a minor gripe since the system is still well executed and challenging while staying fair. Maybe we should combine D:OS's combat system with the story and writing of the Banner Saga to create the perfect RPG.			"

												I've seen some mixed opinions about this game so I thought I'd give you mine.I'm at what I think is the last or one of the last battles in this game so I'm pretty far in.I noticed this game on the ""coming soon"" list some time ago and without hesitation I pre-ordered it. Why? Simply based on the artwork, turnbased combat and the setting of the game. And mostly, your decisions affect your journey! I played The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among us and I like to have some choice in the direction a story is heading.  Basically it's Vikings on the Run (would have been a good title as well, but not nearly as cool as The Banner Saga). You're fleeing from a ""robotic"" army called the Dredge. On your journey you meet people, villages and enemies. You meet a lot of those so you have to make a lot of decisions on how to approach each situation.For example: A Village you pass is under attack by Dredge. Will you help the villagers (chance of casualties or other surprises and possibly a cool reward), wil you sneak past (no casualties if you aren't discovered) or will you watch the fight (and later check out the village and maybe kill the remaining Dredge)? All decisions lead to a different situation, and they can not be taken back. Luckily there is no time limit on your decision so you can take your time to think it through. Whatever you choose, you never know what's going to happen. You might even lose main characters by ""bad"" decisions, and believe me, you WILL make bad decisions ;)So you're on the run with a rather large crew of Vikings: Warriors, women, old people, giants, kids... a whole community. Lot of people means a lot of problems. You're not only fighting the Dredge, there's a lot more happening. Intrigue, jealousy, betrayel, you name it. And they need food too, so you have to keep that in mind as well.Now the fighting part. You fight a lot in this game so don't underestimate it.It's turnbased and actually imo it's the worst part of the game. Once you find a tactic that works you can stick to that most of the game. There isnt much variation in fighters: you have your tanks, archers, warriors and a rare magician. All characters have different special skills, but you can finish most battles without thinking too hard which characters to use (simply those who have the highest skills). Oh, and each character can equip 1 special item to boost some stats. These special items can be found on your journey or bought at a town market.Your enemies are of the same type: big ones, small ones, magic ones and those that can do ranged attacks. Sounds basic? Yes it is. At this moment I've seen a lot of battles and they bore me.Conclusion:If youre looking for a Viking version of a good turnbased combat game this isnt for you. If youre looking for a RPG look further. If you want a fast game, tough luck. ""That's a lot of bad stuff you wrote, why did you give it a thumbs up?""Yes it has some major flaws but the story keeps me going, even though it's not even the best I've ever seen in a game. The graphics are beautiful. The amount of decisions you have to make is impressive. The soundtrack is good, nothing fancy. It's a game that makes me want more, which is impressive. I consider myself a bit spoiled and I'm not easily impressed by a game anymore. I play 1h -1.5h sessions almost every day (my gaming time is limited and my backlog is huge). I'm sure I'll finish this soon and I'm looking forward to the next part(s).			"

												After my Assassin's Creed binge last week, I took a bit of a break to wind down a tad. I started playing Banner Saga a few days ago however - I wasn't sure what to expect from it, the screenshots looked more like a point and click adventure, a genre which I normally don't enjoy as much - thankfully I was wrong.The Banner Saga is heavy role playing game where you face numerous scenarios throughout the story, each decision you make will impact the outcome and general feel of the game.The story goes extremely deep into Viking saga and history, which if you are interested in that sort of thing, this will already be a winner for you. The devs have done a very good job at making you feel you are part of the caravan and are right there in the midst of it all.The game does start out quite slow, but as you get past the first chapter, it picks up pace and you keep wanting more.The actual game play is a turn-based strategy basis. Again strategy is not normally one of my favorite genres but The Banner Saga does a very good job at introducing all the elements and features of the game at a slow but reasonable pace for you to get used to them.  By the end of the game you'll be able to blast through your turns without thinking at all, very simple (which is a good thing in my eyes).Graphic wise, the 2D art is beautiful. It looks as if every scene has been hand drawn. Length of the game is just right - a full playthrough for me took about seven and a half hours, and this was with picking up quite a few achievements along the way.I highly recommend The Banner Sage as it will be a welcome addition to your library if you give it a chance.More reviews at - http://completingthebacklog.blogspot.co.uk/ "

												This was a beautifully rendered tactical turn based RNG RPG with an engaging story and for the most part, stellar gameplay. The backdrop was visually stunning, and this was easily the games strongest feature. It really did a great job of not only creating a game setting, but also adding an air of mystery and intrigue and foreboding to the game.The combat itself was fairly simplistic as far as hex based battle systems go. The RNG aspect can create some frustrating moments, but can also conversely make you so stoked that you took a low percentage chance and succeeded.The RPG upgrading system likewise was fairly simple. As far as the writing goes, the story itself well complemented the artistic design of the game, or vice versa, lol, and the characters were pretty interesting in my opinion, overall. They weren't fully fleshed out, but I didnt feel they needed to be, and for what the game was presenting, I thought the whole thing worked quite well.So, based on all that, with the excellent story writing, the cool characters, the amazing set piece, and the decent combat, this game should really be one of the best. However, it had some very real issues that knock it down some.For one, as good as the writing was, realistically, none of your choices leading up to the finale really mattered, EXCEPT who you leveled up. Speaking of which, party members only level up through use, which I feel, based on the type of game it is, is something of a failure. I feel party members should level together in games like this, or at least, the unused ones should get some sort of experience. Otherwise, you end up woefully unprepared later when you are FORCED to use certain characters, arguably the ones that held the least appeal through the rest of the story as far as using them in battle went.So, like I say, your choices didnt really matter. You have to fight starvation and loss through battle based on your actions, which for the bulk of your group (the common soldiers, scouts, and peasants), basically affected the amount of survivors left when you get to the final city WHERE they all die anyway, lol. However, your party decisions definitely matter, and because you are forced to use certain characters later in the game, and one specifically for the final battle sequence (the daughter), you would be encouraged to use them EXCEPT, the game really doesn't hint at that. They are mostly the characters you will find least useful overall, and that coupled with a distinct lack of anything suggesting they might be important later, virtually guarantees that most players will face the same complications later in the game.So, this matters because the final battle is two stages and relies solely on the daughters archery skills to win. However, there was no real reason to level her up through the game, and I know that most players enter that final battle with an under leveled primary use character, which generally spells defeat. Now, it is my understanding that the developers listened to these same complaints from a large percentage of the people who played this just after release and made some adjustments, but I haven't played it since those patches were released, so I cant speak to whether they really helped out with these issues or not. My understanding was the patch release focused on the final battle, so that aspect might be better now.Anyway, I think overall, I want to give this game an 8 out of 10, but all the issues with it make me drop my rating down to about a 6.5 out of 10.I do intend to revisit this game and see how the patches impacted things, so I will revise this review if necessary after I do so. Regardless, it is a game worth experiencing, so I do in fact recommend it.			"

												The art is beautiful, the story compelling, and the mechanics are interesting. However, I feel like this game spawns really ugly  atritional environments. The out of combat gameplay revolves almost entirely around making choices. This kind of decision making is interesting and compelling in games like FTL or King of Dragon Pass. This is because the risks apparent in your choices are relatively apparent, and make a lot of sense. And the consequences are also appropriately weighted. But In Banner Saga, there's a disjoint between what choices you make and the consequences. You choose an option, and are greeted with a largely unknowble outcome, which is almost always overwhelmingly bad. Random, roadside events can easily kill off characters, or rob you of supplies. More often than not it feels like my reward is simply not dying. If that's what the developers were aiming for, I understand, and it matches the theme of the game, but its not fun.In combat there's a similar feeling. Character's damage output scales directly with their remaining health. A character who is still alive but with low health might aswell be dead. He'll do 1 damage, or miss alltogether. This means that characters who want to deal damage cant afford to take any damage, and character who tank do almost no damage. Its an interesting mechanic, but its not fun. It slows combat to a crawl since it takes relatively little effort to reduce the damage of your units to negligible amounts. Considering you are literally always facing more enemies than you have champions, this is crippling, and boring.Good Story, feels very game of thronesy. Beautiful Art, it looks like classic, rich disney animation. Crappy gameplay.			"

The Banner Saga

The Banner Saga is a turn based RPG set in an apocalyptic fantasy world being invaded by a host of armored giants dubbed ""The Dredge"". Stoic, the developers of The Banner Saga have recently released a sequel and have even released on mobile platforms due to its success on steam. The Banner saga is a singleplayer-only game with a story mode that has the interesting main mechanic of switching between two different points of view for the first half of the game. The Banner Saga contains 7 chapters and each thrilling chapter will keep you on edge for the entire time. Chapters are fairly lengthy, each ranging from an hour to two at most and for me I ended up finishing the game in about 10-11 hours on my first run through.


Last Stand 
A Screenshot of The Banner Saga
By: Friedmudkips ツ #FreeMilo




In the Banner saga there is two different phases in the game: Caravan phase and combat phase. When you're in your caravan phase you oversee your caravan as you try to head to your next destination. This is where you make almost all your choices and also where you will see the various resting points in the game. As the game progresses you find various different resting points where your caravan can take a break in places such as towns and villages or sometimes even near one of the holy godstones. While you're camped out at a resting point you can access your hero screen, your map, and you can even have chats with some of the characters in the caravan. In this phase your caravan slowly consumes supplies which can be bought at markets in some villages or even acquired through some choices. There are also different items for sale in the markets although most of them are very basic passives that don't really add that much to gameplay. The items really could benefit by giving you new skills or maybe skill point boosts but instead they're just rather bland passives. In order to buy anything though you need renown, the games currency. You acquire renown from killing people in combat, although I do believe there are some major decisions that grant renown. Renown can also be used to level up your characters for combat however I feel that most of the time these upgrades are too expensive and you end up being unable to buy items and supplies because of it. The caravan also has a morale system where, depending on the current morale level your characters may suffer a penalty in combat. ""As we pass steep cliffs, the sprawl of Boersgard comes into view. A city of contrasting rich and poor, opportunity and gamble. Our best hope for salvation, or our graves."" -RookThe combat phase is a pretty refreshing take on turn-based combat due to the willpower system. Willpower is a stat on your characters that, in combat, they can use to increase the damage of their attacks or allow them to use special abilities. In The Banner Saga there's two types of damage you can deal to enemies: Strength and Armor. Strength is the stat that determines how much damage you can do to an enemy, so if you attack an enemies strength then they'll do less damage. If you decide to attack the enemies armor however, then that will open them up and make them take extra strength damage from future attacks. It is absolutely critical to make sure you don't only attack health or armor but instead mix them up. I really dislike how the more damage dealt to your strength the less damage you deal because then the combat can devolve into who gets the first hit. Every character that you have can be upgraded, up to level five, for increasing amounts of renown and this is where, as I said, you end up sinking most of your renown. Every character has a class but they mean very little and the characters all follow the same archetype and some characters literally use the same model with a slight recolor. I wish that instead of having loads of characters that you could equip for combat you could have fewer combatants with more unique models and stories. Even with these flaws The Banner Saga still has a very unique take on a combat system that, in my opinion, has begun to get stale.When the Banner Falls

The story of the Banner Saga is also one of its strong points as it is both unique and easy to follow without letting the two detract from the plot. The story, without spoiling much, is essentially divided into two parts until about halfway through the game. The first part you play as Hakon, one of the co-commanders of a group of giant-like beings called varl. You're goal is to essentially escort a human prince to the varl capital of Grofheim so that you can seal an alliance between the two races. The other side of the campaign you play as Rook, a human father who is out hunting with his daughter, Alette, when they run into a dredge footsoldier and have to retreat back to their village. The chieftain of their village ends up being killed so Rook has to take command of the caravan and help them reach safety. With the counsel of the chieftains wife and some old friends, Rook sets out with the caravan in tow in the hopes of making it to the nearby city of Frostvellr. The story features a strong mechanic of choice, similar to Telltale's ""The Walking Dead"" series and this takes an already intriguing story and gives it all the emotional twists and turns that come with choice based storytelling. Most of the time the choices you make result in effects like getting or losing supplies or having morale changes but in some cases you can gain or lose characters. However, you can never really alter the story that much from a set line of main events for it to make a significant difference in the end but it's nice to have choices that actually feel like they effect gameplay. The story has so many mysterious elements that you cannot help but to keep playing just so you can find out the next little bit of character development or lore. TL;DRAn intriguing story of camaraderie in the face of ahnihilation that revives turn based combat and shows how important choice can be.If you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to join my Steam Curator Group at  Mudkips Gaming "

Product received for free
The Banner Saga PC Review Quick-View Substantiation/ Summation The Banner Saga has one of the most immersive strategy based storylines in a game to date. Unfortunately, it  is hard to see all the elements of the game's story without playing it in its entirety. However, here are the main ideas: We have a band of warriors and Vikings tasked with fighting a vile opposing faction called Dredd, heavily armored soldiers that have more strength and force. The Dredd come in a variety of sizes from small ( normal-sized, normal strength) to brutes ( the largest of the Dredd). We, on the other hand, control a cast of characters that are a mixture of warriors, Vikings, chieftains, and archers. Through the story, we are presented with a set of four different choices. All of these options impact our morale.      Ideally, we want high morale because it adds to our reputation when coming across travelers and people to help us fight against the Dredd. On the other hand, low morale will make us gain low rapport and a high level of distrust among people, preventing others from siding with our caravan, while, on the one hand, high morale boosts our accolades, authenticity and certified credentials as a leader. Normally, we have one person we control in these situations seen as the leader. Our first leadership opportunity occurs in Chapter 2 where Rook, the Father of  Alette, the daughter of Rook are traveling home when the Dredd overtake their land forcing all the inhabitants, men, women, children, clansman, and fighters out. Audience The Banner Saga fits a core niche audience and is not a game that was intended for a mass audience appeal. In the life of a Viking, you get to experience the lifestyle, religious aspects, and warring sides while you travel with your caravan; a band of people that consist of fighters, clansmen, and varl. Varl are giants that are Vikings and warriors, the human race which is weaker in the game and more vulnerable to strong attacks. The soundtrack score was produced by Austin Wintory, the same man that produced for us the soundtrack of both Journey, Flow, even, a more interesting soundtrack called the Spirit of the Cosmos.  The gods have died at the start of your trilogy on this journey of yours. The loss of gods are indicated at the beginning in which it states that some bad omen has shielded out the sunlight, now, producing snow during a unusual time of the year that now daily occurs as progression continues.      However, later on, in Chapter 2, you come across an interesting looking stone. This stone is fashioned after the god Hridvaldyr; offerings given to this god by travelers that pass through to pay their omens. The mythology of this god claimed that he transitioned into two forms, one human and the one, I would call a wolfman.Overall ScoresPresentation: 10/10- The graphics are a nice art style that I am at a loss for words in how to describe its immense beauty. When it does include voice-overs in the dialogue, it is well done while relying heavily on reading the text and selecting from four options of real-time choices which affect consequences, overall morale, and casualties. The title screen demonstrates carefully placed particle physics of trickling snow drifting by the display, slowly. The main menu has a user-interface that is comprised of hyperlinks that take you directly to the corresponding store page ( i.e. stats shortcut, rate app, share app and soundtrack purchase). Gameplay: 7/10- Gameplay is solidly reinforced by its grid-based system and movement allocation at the start of each battle that is set up as a game of chess, where the grid-based system is primarily movement based.Value: 10/10Replayability: 10/10 - Many choices are at your disposal as a leader, you are in charge of decisions made and who gets saved from those who do not.Niche Audience: 10/10 - The niche audience will be those that enjoy learning about other cultures and civilizations such as polytheistic based religion, Vikings and large-scale stories of the previous history of all of these people divided in chronological order through the use of chapters that unfold the story, but takes longer to progress.Story: 7/10-Although the story is robust and accounts for how these people lived in real-life during these times before technology, travel and innovations in computer technology were invented, it is slow to build up because its introduction is too long. Honestly, they should have begun with Chapter 2, since, this chapter is where it gets engaging, interesting and the first chapter in which you make the most decisions.Soundtrack: 9/10- I cannot complain at all in regards to the soundtrack. I have listened to Austin Wintory's work across many of his projects in which his use of instruments without vocals always creates a very soothing atmosphere and experience. The Banner Saga would not have been possible without it.Overall- 9/10Small Points ( Pros & Cons)Pros•Excellent use of vivid imagery to capture history, time dilation and lifestyle elements contributing to the setting.•Versus Evil used one of the best video game scoring artists, Austin Wintory to deliver a beautiful score.•Choices impact your decisions as a leader that has to make quick-based decisions, many so hard that others are either hurt or helped by your internal, external actions,convictions, and, rationality.•They went with real-time cutscenes; the cinematic opening is high quality as The Elder Scrolls Skyrim V.Cons•It serves a primary niche audience instead of a more mainstream, broad audienceVerdict-Overall - 9/10- A good solid role-playing, tactical based strategy game for all ages.Disclaimer     This review was written for Steamified.

												Few games keep my attention for more than an hour or two. I beat The Banner Saga in one sitting--which is no mean feat, as it took me nine hours to complete. It's a profoundly beautiful game, not simply from a graphical perspective (though it is one of the best-looking games I've ever played), but from a narrative perspective. I don't think I came across anything that I ever completely expected. The friends I lost and gained were unexpected. Some people lived when I thought they would have died. My losses were many, my victories few, but I soldiered on.Oh, yes, underneath it all, there's the tactical gameplay that's pretty interesting. I feel like it's lacking in something, though I couldn't tell you exactly what that is. And, y'know what? It locked up on me multiple times; I had to exit, restart, and load from the last save. It might be nice if I could manually save the game as well, but, hey, that's not really a big complaint, as the autosaving is fairly generous. The game's got a few grammatical errors in the dialog, mostly punctuation, but I think I spotted a few spelling problems as well.As an RPG, I'm not really sure how deep it is. I'm not sure if many of my choices had consequences. One choice led to fighting, but fighting is how you get renown, and renown lets you buy supplies for your people, as well as upgrade your units, so it's kindaBut y'know what?It's a beautiful game. I feel really... really different after having played it. It's an emotionally impactful experience. I'm a little bummed that it was only nine hours long, sure, but I also know this: I'll be replaying this game more than once, which is another feat I'm not prone to do. I'm not really a fan of turn-based games, but gameplay proved enjoyably compelling. The Banner Saga is a game I think everyone should play. It's a sad and heavy game in a wonderfully original take on the Viking mythos. I almost shed a tear at the end.This is a game worth buying.			"

												While the combat felt a bit repetitive toward the end of the game, I did greatly enjoy the story and the characters in this game. The Oregon Trail-esque choices that truly could mean instant death for your favorite characters is present, and makes each choice truly feel important. This is like the recent The Walking Dead game, except when you go back to play/read what the other outcome would have been, you realize your choice actually did matter.I'm not sure I would play through it again, but I absolutely recommend playing this game to completion at least once if you are a fan of RPGs, turn-based combat games, and/or isometric older games like Baldur's Gate or Fallout 1 or 2, mixed with some Oregon Trail.

												I had great expectations about this game and, to my surprise, The Banner Saga surpassed them all. It has a fantastic world building, a rich narrative, and marvelous art style. Soundtrack and gameplay mechanics are also adequately good.The choices present are relevant to the way you play the game (there's various ways to do it, since you can prioritize resources - don't let anyone die of starving -, focus on the combat and upgrade your warriors characteristics or gauge the overall caravan mood - by resting and making sure everyone is happy and etc) and can make you form a connection to the characters that is becoming rare on gaming these days.In my opinion, everything in this game was perfect or close to perfect, and if you either like choice driven stories, turn based games or beautiful pieces of art, you should pick this up and play it on the moment.➡️️Final Rating: 10/10			"

												A really great game. It's a turn based tactics set in some sort of Scandinavian myths setting. The story seems to be very well written and captivating from the start. But what is really stands out - is graphics. The artwork is astonishingly great. The colors, the details... all is just right and very pleasant to the eye. The overall quality of the game is surprisingly great (in our year and age of rushed releases).The combat system is also quite unique. Your units can attack armor or strength. If you're attacking strength, you deal damage to health and to enemy's ability to fight at the same time, but this attack will be mitigated by armor. If you're attacking armor, you're not doing any harm to unit's health or his ability to fight, but instead open it for a much stronger attack in the future. There's also an unique characteristic called Willpower. Units can use it to deliver stronger blows or to run further than normal. But it's a limited resource which can be replenished by resting (skipping turns). It's just 2 unique mechanics but they greatly enrich the tactics metagame.All in all this is a great buy for anyone who loves turn based strategies or wants to try them out.			"

												I did like this game, it is basically like Oregon Trail but instead of hunting mini-game there is a Tactics Turn Based Strategy mini-game.  The characters are interesting, the plot is easy to follow and enjoyable.  The music is unique, not my favorite personally but if you like old school chanting, this is definitely up your alley.  All that comes with some caveats though.  Firstly the game ran potato quality on my computer, which is a little embarrassing, my computer is getting fairly old but the graphics were also at 64bit levels so I have no idea why the framerate was so bad.  Secondly, this game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥a little bit because the difficulty does ramp up after about 10 hours but also because it feels like a long slog to try and get through.  This problem is magnified by the end which is even more depressing.  Thirdly, the combat because pretty stagnant pretty quickly without much difference in units and with you using the same strategies over and over.  I'm still not sold on the armor/strength system but is was at least unique as far as I know and did make you think a little differently than most other Turn Based Strategy games.  I won't lie to you though, I hated the turn order system they used which made me use strategies that would be stupid in any other TBS game.That got pretty negative pretty quickly so let me re-iterate, this is a good game, but it could have greatly improved from just a bit more polish.

The Banner Saga caught me by surprise.I did not hear of its [highly succesful] Kickstarter campaign, and only came to learn of its existence when it showed up on Steam's ""coming soon"" section.Obviously the first thing to draw my attention was the art style. As you can see from screenshots and trailers, it is clearly inspired by Walt Disney's works, and indeed it's absolutely gorgeous. Animation quality is great, too.The gameplay is really enjoyable. I'm not the biggest fan of turn-based combat, but The Banner Saga presents some interesting mechanics that make encounters with enemies feel like more complex chess matches.Where the game really shines, though, is in the ""caravan-management"" sections. You lead families and warriors for leagues across a beautiful land torn by war, making sure mouths are fed and morale stays high, facing dilemmas almost every step of the way. Every decision you make feels meaningful and impacts the world and characters around you.As the story approaches its climax, the atmosphere grows dire. At one point, I genuinely felt like I had painted myself into a corner, bad call after bad call. I despaired. That's a feeling few games can boast about being able to provoke.But for all its ruthlessness, The Banner Saga is not unfair. I persevered, and managed to complete the campaign. Finishing the game really felt like an accomplishment.And an accomplishment is what this first chapter of The Banner Saga is. A work of art. A masterpiece of our time.I stand in awe.			"

												I can honestly say that I enjoyed this game very much. Few turn based games have ever caught my attention but The Banner Saga managed to do so. The artwork and soundtrack are wonderful and the setting for the game is amazing and original.			"

												Visuals A+Sound AGameplay CI absolutely loved the intro and the first few chapters.  The story was interesting and the characters compelling.  Unfortunately the turn based combat is uninspired and dare I say outright bad design.  This is a game I should have loved from top to bottom.  I love turn based games.  But the movement, lack of terrain and outright poor combat design principles just kill it dead.  Having your attack strenght directly tied to your hitpoints is one of the worst design ideas I have ever seen.  It completely eliminates any kind of come from behind strategy.  If you get behind in damage output you might as well restart the match because mathmatically you can't win.  Which brings me to the worst point.  Without any kind of cover or terrain the matches feel like math equations.  You put damage A+B against enemy C and your outcome is X.  Mid to late game you realize that spending renoun on anything other than upgrading your warriors is a complete waste of time.  Your people and troops are completely irrelevant and the later game enemies completely outclass your best warriors.  You will also extremely favor some warriors over other less useful characters to the point of completely ignoring them.  Since levelling is directly tied to defeating enemies there is no incentive to take less useful characters.Bottom line, I bought this game for $5 and Card Hunter for $0.  Other than the story, I get way more enjoyment out of playing Card Hunters during the turn based battles.  I find this game to be highly over rated.  Maybe because its an indi game a lot of people give it a pass.  I wont be getting the sequels.			"

												I debated back and forth on writing a review for this, since my overall and gut reactions to the game have been primarily negative. However, as I'm near the end of what I'm guessing is chapter 1 I'm finding my feelings of discontent to not be fleeting agitation due strictly to losing a battle.I kickstarted this game on the premise of creating an RPG with tactical elements similar to those presented in Final Fantasy Tactics. Furthermore, the creators promised a rich and immersive story. For the most part, I feel robbed.StoryI can't describe the story as anything other than incredibly boring. Perhaps I find myself easily disassociated because of the extensive use of the game's in-game terminology to which there is no real primer on. I am aware that this game has a wiki and fan base which has been following along throughout the entire design process, so it may be that none of the language is foreign to most folks.The story leaves much to be desired with regards to its presentation. Characters are presented and disappear without word for long stretches at a time. On the rare occasions you are able to talk with other heros, you don't learn much (if anything) about them. This issue is further aggravated by the notion that it seems that none of your selections in conversations seem to have any bearing whatsoever with regards to those you talk with. I get the impression that the designers read about games with character discussion choices like Dragon Age or Mass Effect, but never actually stopped to play them and figure out the appeal.Furthermore, the game lacks a practical method for the player to learn about the world or truly take upon the mantle of the main character. I felt so consistently detached from the main character that for a good 2 hours after starting the game, I was not at all clear who the hell 'I' was (apparently I was Hakon).These issues are further reinforced by virtue of the main character having no real control over the events happening around them. As your caravan progresses through the game, multiple story events will occur wherein you have to make choices with regards to what you'll do, who you'll help, etc. However, I never feel like I am making decisions, rather I'm just making guesses and not even educated ones at that. This matter is further frustrated by the game's autosave system, so there is no way to go back should I not like the results of my guess.GameplayMore and more games have taken it upon themselves to dispense with any sort of instruction manual and just rely upon teaching you how to play in-game. Banner Saga has also done this, however, they have only bothered to do so with regards to combat; which is really only half the game.I state this, because it was not really clear to me how scarce food and supplies might be until I was well into a situation where I lacked any. The in game currency/experience system is renown and as best I can tell you earn it by either guessing correctly for story events or killing enemies within the combat system. Overall, I cannot stress the lack of any explanation regarding the importance of balancing the need to train up warriors with the need to purchase supplies.With that in mind, the other aspect of gameplay I found extremely frustrating was the utter lack of a means for your party to forage for food. As a sort of larger scale Oregon Trail game, the notion that you cannot hunt or forage the lands you roam for food borders on a little hard to believe. The forced suspension of disbelief is only worsened by the fact that everyday I have warriors and clansmen dying from starvation as a trained woodsman leads these people through hills, forests, and dales all of which are apparently completely devoid of anything to sustain ourselves on. Apparently my people would rather starve to death than eat anything short of steak.I cannot help but demerit the game for this exclusion, doubly so when it lends itself so much towards having a hardline, realistic tone. Decisions (guesses) have permanent consequences where someone usually dies and you have no means to stop it at all. With that in mind, I can't believe the designers missed the opportunity to punish you for slowing your travel by having frequent attacks on your caravan and thus force you to choose between making continued forced marches and slow starvation or slow down to gather food and risk attack.The last thing which irks the crap out of me is betrayal by heros you have picked up. Not necessarily that it occurs (usually because I didn't guess what they want), but that after I put down said betrayal the items they had equipped are gone forever from my inventory. I'm guessing (because I'll be damned if I'm going to be allowed to know anything at all ever) we've all assumed the incredibly useful trinket strapped to Stabby McBackstab's wrist must be cursed as that's the only sensible reason for him to attack a group effectively three times his size.CombatCombat in the Banner Saga falls somewhere between interesting and boring. Your primary health stat is broken into a unit's armor and their strength. The former provides the opportunity to deflect attacks while the latter measures both your ability to deal damage as well your health. It makes a certain kind of sense, the more injured you are the harder it will be for you to hit harder.As combat systems go, it's interesting because of its focus upon realism. That said, it's still rather boring in its execution. There is minimal variability between attacks which succeed and those which fail. Characters require an item to be equipped in order to manage a critical hit or just get lucky and have an attack miss them. Perhaps for some folks this general lack of chance isn't an issue, but I found it rather infuriating especially because many battles included multiple enemies whose strength was well above my most heavily armored characters.Furthermore, the combat system is deficient in many other ways. There is no bonus for flanking, no bonus for having superior numbers (in several situations your greater numbers can put you at a notable disadvantage), no means to delay a character's turn until the situation is more conducive to their abilities, and I'm sure I'm missing at least one more. Again, the exclusion of these standard tropes for tactical combat are a pretty glaring oversight; much of the combat system feels like a good idea that was only halfway thought through.One last complaint for the combat system is the fact that you cannot rotate the map to get a better view. The map has one isometric angle to look at things with, hope it shows what you need to see because that's all you're getting.SummaryI initially thought I was just being a whiny little ♥♥♥♥♥ about a game that was hard, but I think it's much more than that. The Stoic crew had an interesting idea for a game. Unfortunately, what they made was a game, not a good game nor a great one.Multiple game site reviews have lauded the Banner Saga with plenty of accolades citing its originality; but I feel where this game succeeeded in originality it fell far short on completing its thought.

												Definitely have mixed feelings about this, because while The Banner Saga is a game with great art, great music and an interesting concept, it falls short in immersing players into its world. I would love to recommend the game on the basis of the beautiful drawings and epic music, but it's been really disappointing to see that this game isn't what they marketed it to be.The game promises that every decision will have a ""meaningful effect on the outcome as your story unfolds"" and that ""the journey is as important as battle"", but players aren't even given the option to choose where to go and the micro-management of the caravan doesn't really affect how the story ends. Although there's a possibility of gaining, keeping or losing supplies and units during random encounters on your journey, the only thing that really matters is keeping your main team alive. Losing units doesn't mean anything.The game isn't too long but has players going in between different caravans with different characters in each one of them. This isn't too great because after spending time with one caravan and just starting to become emotionally invested in their plight, they abruptly shift you over to another where you have to familiarize yourself with a whole new set of names and faces. It might have been nice if they stuck to one caravan throughout this first episode of the trilogy, so we could've seen more character development and become more attached to the world.Battle mechanics are interesting but the fights can be tedious and repetitive because of the limited diversity of foes. Some battles can be challenging in a good way but most of the time, it felt like a ""rinse and repeat"" kind of affair. There are also weird spikes in difficulty from time to time, and the final fight arrived quite abruptly in a ""that's it?"" kind of way.If you're interested in looking at the beautifully detailed drawings and can appreciate epic music, the game would be worth getting when it's on sale. However, as the game stands currently, If you're expecting more from the gameplay and story, then this is hard to recommend. I hope the next part will fair better.			"

												I've been postponing to play The Banner Saga for a long time. When the game was released on iOS, I suddenly realized I didn't even start my pc game yet. That evening I sat down and played for several hours straight. Now, 18 hours along the way I just finished The Banner Saga on Normal difficulty for the very first time,I'm not the type of gamer to play a game again in order to get all achievements, but I did check which ones I earned and which ones I did not get. As it turns out, there are many story branches based on the choices one makes. Characters can survive through out to story or die during battle. I love the background of this game. Vikings are cool. By adding some kind of Super Viking (Varl) the studio has created a big divirsity in the characters one can use during the game. I will not spoil anything, but don't get too attached to your characters... they might die. The combat is tactical. Take your time is make a move, look at the movement range of your enemies and make sure you double check for example the reach of your archers. It happened to me more than once that my archers was one block short to reach its target... That's just waste of a turn and might result in you losing the battle. During a battle characters can die. But you can't know in advance whether they are just ""passed out"" or they will be actually removed from the game and story. Between the turn based battles there are lots of conversations in which you get to make choices. It's not always clear what the results of your choices will be. The most confusing thing in The Banner Saga is that you can be travelling without food and still thieves can steal food or Varls can drink beer because we passed some religious statue. Overall The Banner Saga is one of the highlights in my recent gaming years. It left me wanting for more. I've got the same feeling I got when I played The Walking Dead by Telltale for the very first time. Game studio Stoic has developed a very nice and enjoyable game with a touching story. No tears, but in the end you can't help but wonder whether the ending is just the ending of the story or the result of your actions.I've decided I'm not going to find out. This is it. My story is over and now I'm waiting for the second chapter.			"

												Once you begin this winding and perilous journey you almost want it to never end.  The Banner Saga has one of the best stories of any game.  You really get absorbed into the characters and the plot line.  The graphics are gorgeous.  The turnbased combat is simple and easy to learn, though it does require some strategy and forthought.  This is a great game that all can play and enjoy.			"

												The Banner Saga tells the story of a band of warriors, leading a caravan of soldiers and refugees over the countryside to escape the encroaching hordes of monsters known as Dredge.The game is a cross between a point and click adventure and a tactical RPG. There is a text-heavy story, with frequent choices to make that can have drastic effects on your progress. The choices you make during the events that unfold on the journey determine everything from loss/gain of supplies, to the deaths of certain characters.Your caravan will consume supplies and lose morale as it travels. The ""currency"" of the game, ""renown"" is gained from successful battles and from choices that have great impact. Renown can be spent on supplies or items at town markets, or on boosting the stats of your characters. You will likely find balacing your purchases extremely difficult, as renown is not so abundant.The main attraction to the game is the combat. You choose 6 warriors to take to battle, each with their own unique abilities. They can also be customised by choosing skill points for their stats when the gain a level, as well as equip them with items that provide buffs and other effects.The warriors move around on a tile grid. Moving a melee attacker adjacent to an enemy will allow you to attack. You can choose to do direct damage to their health (which also doubles as their strength stat), or deal damage to their armor which makes it easier to do more damage to their health. Your strength - their armor = damage done.There are two races in the game, Humans and giants called Varl. On the battle grid, the humans take the space of a single tile while Varl take up 4. This means you have to think carefully about positions, as units cannot pass through each other and grouping them close together may mean a character is simply stuck and wastes a turn. Additionally, you will also want to make sure your weaker units, specifically those with ranged attacks, are kept safe by placing them behind tougher characters such as the Varl Shieldbanger.Combat is satisfying, yet tough. You may find you become too weak to win battles while they keep getting harder throughout the game, it would be likely you need to replay the game so you know better what to expect. It is also a shame that units have no strengths or weaknesses against specific types of enemy units, and also that the unique abilities of each character are very situational and won't get used very often.The presentation of that game is fantastic, it is a visual marvel with finely animated characters, gorgeous scenery and a pleasing artistic aesthetic. There isn't much music to be found, but what little there is usually fits the scenario perfectly and adds to the atmosphere and scale of the world you traverse.Without spoiling anything, the storyline is a little on the weak side. None of the characters are particularly memorable. One of them had actually died off earlier in the game and I hadn't noticed until much later. Too much of the dialog is filler and a lot of the interesting parts don't lead anywhere and are never mentioned again.As a complete package, this is a gorgeous looking title with a lengthy campaign and addictive turn-based strategy gameplay. Veterans of this genre will find enough content to chew on and newcomers will appreciate the easy-to-understand mechanics and hands-on tutorials. "

												The Banner Saga is a strategy RPG with a viking fantasy setting developed by Stoic and published by Versus Evil.Narrative:The Good - The Banner Saga has an amazingly well detailed and rich universe. There is a whole map created for the game that gives an insane amount of lore about the world. The story itself is much better than most fantasy stories. Rather than going for the clichè ""save the princess"" or ""find the sword"", The Banner Saga instead is about the journey of clans across their continent in search of safety and it is very well done. The main characters are incredibly vibrant and interesting from the stoic (ha ha), grim, and stern Iver to the innocent and forgiving Alette. I became heavily invested with many of the characters and actually cared about what happened to most of them. The Banner Saga also has branching paths. I looked back over the course of my journey and wondered how I could have changed things. The dialogue is also quite heartfelt and believable so that certainly helps add to the immersion.The Bad - Let's get the big one out of the way. The game does not pace itself well at points. There are points where it completely rushes through areas that could have been expanded on considerably. The ending is also one of the most rushed I've seen in quite awhile. The final moments are just sped through with absolutely no slowing down to emphasize the impact of the results. Also, many characters that seem like they could have been focused on more get little to no screen time and some that seem incredibly important just up and screw off. The game also doesn't wrap everything up and leaves some loose ends. The game has so much potential and would've hit every note if it had slowed down and taken awhile to let the story's outcomes settle in and open up more about characters and areas.Score - 8/10Graphics:The Good - This game is gorgeous. Every area of the game is brimming with little details that make it just a little bit more immersive. The hand drawn art style is perfectly done and should be applauded. The game runs smoothly for most of the time and has a beautful color palette that fits very well. One of my favourite art styles.The Bad - While travelling across the continent there is occasional hitching. Nothing horrible but certainly noticable.Score - 9.5/10Sound:The Good - The music is beautiful. This game has one of the most fitting soundtracks I've heard in a long time. It's incredibly somber during heartfelt scenes and tense and fast-paced in battles. The voice acting is done extremely well and the sound effects are crisp and perfect.The Bad - I feel like there could've been more narration and it would've added to the experience. There was barely any.Score - 9/10Gameplay:The Good - The game follows some of the basic SRPG mechanics and discards others while adding in some new ones that I feel mostly benefit the game. To start, the rock-paper-scissors style combat that usually shows up has been completely removed and replaced with Willpower, Armor, and Strength. These three mechanics work VERY well together and help give the game its own gameplay style. Strength is your health, however it is also your damage so when your health goes down, so does your damage. This might seem frustrating but actually works quite well and results in a lot more thought being put into moves as placing your party in a vulnerable position may result in future losses. The Armor affects how much damage can be done to someone. High armor means it is very hard to get a meaningful hit in and so it also has to be taken into consideration adding even more complications. The game, however, never becomes overly complicated and manages to still be easy to understand, yet incredibly hard to master. As for Willpower, this is probably one of the best features. Willpower allows you to do more than you can normally do. It allows people to move further, hit harder, or use their special attacks. This is great as you can use it as a way to get out of a place you don't want to be in or take that last bit of health out of an enemy. The party management is also interesting. If a party falls in battle, rather than dying, they are injured and have a Strength penalty until they rest enough. This means you'll have to rest and waste supplies, causing your clan's morale to drop, causing a loss of Willpower in battle. It puts some extra pressure on during non-combat segments. Wars also happen throughout the game and allow for several different options for handling battles giving a sense of freedom. The difficulty is also perfect. The game never becomes too overwhelming, yet always offers a challenge. Tactical, patient players will be rewarded while people who rush to kill someone will usually be shut down. Finally, Renown. Renown is the in-game currency and is used to purchase supplies and combat items. Renown is also used to upgrade characters so it becomes quite a problem for youself when you don't have enough to both get a crucial upgrade for a charcter and that really enticing piece of equipment. Overall, the gameplay has some amazing mechanics at work and can certainly hold a candle to other SRPGs.The Bad - First, the game does not explain the consequences of clan deaths at all and there doesn't seem to be any so that mechanic is dead in the water. As for combat, the game becomes repetitive sometimes. Not many different enemies are thrown at you and so it may become a bit tedious at points. The final battle was also obnoxious as my characters were randomly getting stunned at random times and there was nothing I could do about it, prolonging the battle and irritating me. There is also almost no customization for characters. There aren't many different ways to build characters and usually your party is already decided due to low character counts at points. You can't choose their weapon and upgrading usually is quite straight forward. On top of this, many of the special attacks were (in my opinion) very underwhelming and ignorable. Score - 8/10Longevity and Replayability:The Good - My first playthrough lasted around 11-12 hours. I still feel like there is a lot I could've changed and seems like enough incentive to go back and try again. There are also a considerable number of acheivements if that's what you're in to.The Bad - Again, the game rushes through its story quite a bit.Score - 8.5/10Final Score: The Banner Saga is flawed. Greatly. But there is so much good here that I really do have to commend it for its efforts. It certainly isn't perfect, but it has enough good in it that I can recommend it at full price, easily. If you enjoy SRPGs, fantasy settings, or beautiful looking games, then look no further than the Banner Saga.8.6/10 = Very Good			"

												While the story borrows some really fantastic concepts from Norse mythology and starts with a bang, you're promised a Saga and receive a segment. There is no finality to this game, and you're ultimately left with an extremely shallow version of Final Fantasy Tactics with units who max at level five and some beautiful locations / characters who are left hopelessly vague. I bought this game when it went down to $15 after being released from like $30, and it was by far the worst decision I had made during any Steam Sale. I can say that as somebody who hasn't bought into too many Early Access titles. Download a background or two, watch a video on YouTube, just don't make the same mistake I did.EDIT: Some nice brony just pointed out my review is bull and they have a sequel coming later in the year. Great idea, spend another $30 to walk characters over more backgrounds. Even more of a downvote than I previously had.EDIT #2: Hey look, the second game is out and even worse than this one in many ways. LOL GO GO FANBOI FEVER			"

												This is why we love games over most other medias people. The story. As you play two different clans that struggle to survive the multiple onslaughts of an unstoppable army of beings known as the Dredge, a world consuming worm that shatters the land, and desperate highwaymen. You must make calculated, difficult and terrible choices to keep your tribe intact from these unrelenting threats. In the turn based combat you must anticipate your adversary's move and force them to react to your's.The combined animation and music elements evokes emotions that root you in the moment. The characters ARE the story. Each person has the power to save the day or bring everyone to ruin. Your choices are what make the story. You cannot save a game at certain point, make an undesirable choice and rehash it. It's just like it should be, YOU must OWN your decicions.			"

												For what it promises, it doesnt deliver. The battles are fun and certainly challenging at the higher levels. However, the game in my opinion inadequately makes use of a lot of the 'extra' stuff (the number of people in your party, the management of supplies and morale, and even the map are all just extraneous). You can go through the game without caring about supplies at all or by carefully managing the size of your group, and it doesn't matter; the only thing that matters is that you have leveled up enough for the final boss.The 'decisions' you make seem to have little impact on the actual gameplay other than what characters you have at the end, and zero impact on the end of the game. Zero. You might as well read a short story and have battles in the middle of it.I have read this is meant to be a trilogy and maybe these 'decisions' will mean something in a sequel, but for an opener, the game leaves WAY to much story on the table unanswered. I did not feel like I had come to a closing point in the game when the credits rolled, I felt like I had completed the first chapter of a standalone game, and was mildly annoyed (Imagine playing Final Fantasy Seven, and after you escaped Midgar, the game was over).

'What's the Deal' with The Banner Saga?It pains me to give this game a thumbs down, because it's clear that a lot of love went into creating it. The Banner Saga finds a ragged group of humans and giants fleeing from a world-consuming scourge. As the leader of this caravan, you are presented with choices that will determine your people's survival. You get to decide the course of action, from when to fight to how to adjudicate petty squabbles. And here is where the one of the game's major flaws comes sharply into focus: You're routinely asked to make these decisions without enough information, and some of the choices you are presented are not choices at all. For instance, in one portion of the game, I was asked whether I wanted to take my caravan the longer, safer route or try to make it through a dangerous shortcut. Realizing we were low on supplies, I knew we would run out of food if we went the longer way, so we drew our swords and attempted to fight our way though. After some combat and attempts by the game to dissuade me from taking the shortcut, it eventually just perma-deathed a party member I'd been leveling and told me I could not go that way because it was too dangerous. I didn't lose the battles; I was just forced to take the other option. It reminded me of the old choose-your-own-adventure books, where the choice presented might be to go left or right down a path, and the next thing you know you're killed by aliens that came out of nowhere. The player is deprived of any way to gauge risk and reward, and left to just picking something and hoping for the best.On the positive side, the artists have done a beautiful job, creating intricate visuals and animation that evoke the frozen Viking -inspired world in which the game takes place. The sense of immersion is further heightened by Austin Wintory's music, which serves as a perfect accompaniment as your lost group treks across the bleak, snow-covered plains and jagged mountains (go check it out on Spotify). But then there's the writing. Oh, the writing. It completely shatters the world the game struggled so hard to create. Watching hardened Norsemen saying modern phrases like ""We got screwed in the great wars,"" ""What's the deal with him?"" and ""You have to put up with my crap a little longer"" serves as a constant reminder, that no, you are not the leader of a group wandering refugees in the frozen north, you're sitting at your computer playing a game.If you're looking for a similar experience that includes turn-based combat, RPG elements and decision-making, while immersing you in the game's world, ""Expeditions: Conquistador"" is a far better game.

												I bought the Deluxe pack and I muıst say, that this game is lesser than I've expected. Don't get me wrong, It's good stuff you will play. Yet, there are some issues I need to tell.1. The game is largely story driven:The wonderful game map may give you a misconception, that you can travel to any area. Sadly, your route is predefined.2. Most of the character abilities are useless and some items are over powered:For instance, give Alette the +3 Armor breaking item and you will see it's much better than her special ability. Somewhat broken if you ask me. The spearmaster's impale ability is mostly useless except of the projectile enemies that flee after each damage they take. Another item gives you a knockback ability with 4+ strength damage. LIKE A BOSS!!!3. This game has a main character:The way that the game was presented, you may assume that Rook is just a kindle of the events and you will be very flexible on each decision making process or character addition. It gave me an idea that if other people play the same game, we might have entire different outcomes. (Someone, who decides to go on with the lead of Ekkill, Eirik, Hakon etc. find entirely different paths in the story was what I have expected.) Characters like Ubin and Ludin have rarely a weight at the story.4. Next episode:Within the game, you see a lot of additional material that reveals a centaur race, and you know that there would be much more to explore. The game just came out as the first episode of what is bound to come afterwards. But, I'm still waiting for sequels, DLC storylines etc... I begin to suspect that this will not happen.FINAL VERDICT: Buy it if it's on sale!			"

												This is not a really fun game. Some of that is by design: you are trying to survive and take care of your people against overwhelming odds, making tough decisions one after another. The dread that your characters feel gets to you.Sadly, its too much. After being blindsided by some terrible consequences (some from decisions made 45 minutes into the game; others product of a lot of walking around without being able to judge distances/food), you start to feel the game is a chore. For me it was a chore to get to the finish line. Once again, some of that is intentional, but if the game doesn't leave you with a good taste in your mouth, its because it went too far.Obviously that is a very personal issue with the game; a more general issue will be its combat system. I love turn-based games, but some decisions made here opened the combat to be way too exploitable.The rest of The Banner Saga goes from average (the lore ""borrows"" from new places, but is not unique enough) to very good (the ilustrations are amazing, although way too stiff during dialogues).This has been an enjoyable experience for many (rating ""very positive"" no?), supporting the developers decisions for some of the choices made here. Sadly, I cannot agree with them enough to give it a thumbs up.			"

												The Banner Saga is a charming little tactical RPG with a good story and some interesting decisions. It's set in an idealized Viking-ish world, where humans and varl (read: giants) coexist, more or less, and occasionally unite to fight off the dredge - a race of poorly-motivated Bad Guys. The game excels at its aesthetic - the setting, the characters (though not the writing), and the art and music are all quite good. Those elements serve to create a feel for the game and, while I may be critical of some of the actual gameplay elements, it's important to note that those gameplay elements are ultimately servants of the general aesthetic the game is going for, and in that capacity, they serve it well. The game does a really good job of creating an interesting, well-put-together setting and aesthetic, and of arranging game components (of which there are a few) to support that goal. The game components are:Combat. It takes place on orthogonal tiles where you control different characters (up to six) and try to beat up your opposition. Characters have strength, which counts as both hit points and damage dealt. When you get hurt, you also do less damage, as your strength goes down. Characters also have armour, which is directly subtracted from any damage taken. Armour can be difficult to remove and is often high enough that you have to spend a little time getting rid of the stuff before you can really lay into your opponent. Characters have a special ability, and they have some extra (limited) 'willpower' points they can add to specific actions to move faster and hit harder. Also, the combat has this weird thing where, as long as there's more than one person per side, each side alternates taking actions. So even if you have three people and the computer has nine (or vice versa), you still get to act as often as your opponent - with the result that if you have fewer people, they will get to act more often overall. Consequently, contrary to most games of its type, I felt the best strategy was to weaken without killing my opponents in order to make them useless, thereby wasting my opponent's turns. It seems better, in some respects, to have a few good characters than a bunch of crappy ones. The game makes when to kill vs. when to wound an interesting tactical decision.The combat's good enough for what it is. Generally, I enjoyed it. I felt to really excel at it (rather than just win on normal), a player would have to math it out a little to be able to optimize special abilities (some of which are just crazy if used right) and to avoid damage at key moments. That's not me. I like to run intuitively on my tactical RPGs, so while I had no real problems, I also recognize I'm not playing the game on hard any time soon.Resource management and strategic decision making. You spend a lot of time watching your caravan move across frozen tundra being chased by the dredge, and running out of food. Running out of food is bad, as members of your caravan leave (or die off, I guess) and your moral drops, making tactical combat harder. Tactical combat gains you renown, which you can use to level up your characters to make them better fighters, or to buy food (or to buy artifacts, but that's the worst use of it, I think). Your caravan contains fighters, varl, and clansmen, and occasionally you'll use the fighters and varl to conduct a large-scale combat that is handled off-screen while you handle a typical tactical combat using your heroes. If people starve, you'll run out of fighters and varl, which I guess would be bad? I don't know. Never seen it happen. The whole large-scale 'strategic' game doesn't really seem to do much.Interactive story events. You are given a situation, you make choices, and then things happen. It's not always clear why the things that happen happen, and sometimes those things are really bad, but not something you could've anticipated. I had to reload a couple times because I'd made a choice that saw me lose a few key heroes, and I didn't know that would happen. Good (/lucky) choices can gain you renown, same as in battle. Choices that gain renown are, I found, much easier to anticipate than other choices, and don't seem as arbitrary. It's better than it sounds - while the choices you make are annoyingly opaque, I think they're supposed to be so. Bad things are supposed to happen, and you're supposed to pick up the pieces. In all cases, that's much of the game - the characters you control are people who are watching things go south awfully quickly. Making choices where you don't know what's going to happen, and often what happens is bad, is pretty consistent with the game as a whole.Generally, the game was quite good. It won't be for everyone. But I think those who appreciate it will really enjoy it. "

												The Banner Saga is definitely in the top tier of games that have been Kickstarted. It has a very deep, involved plot from multiple perspectives and is filled with surprising revelations and heart-wrenching endings.The graphics are a refreshing departure from the norm. The conversation scenes are reminiscent of Fire Emblem's static conversation scenes, while the travel and cut scenes are truly beautiful. The animations during battle are enjoyable to watch, as your character pulls off such a powerful hit and damages nearby enemies as well, or when your archer nails an enemy from across the map after their careful aiming.The music in this game is just beyond words. Austin Wintory does an exceptional job on the soundtrack. The audio cues seem to hit at just the right moment to strike a chord of fear into you, or even to set the mood for celebration or sorrow. It's not often that the audio of a game ends up being my favorite part, but The Banner Saga really delivered.The story is very involved and changes based on the decisions you make as you go along. This means that I'll be completing several more playthroughs before I'm done with the game. The choices can really reward you, or even end up in a death if you're not careful. I haven't gotten more involved in the wellbeing of a game's characters in quite some time, though in this game I find myself desperately trying to make the best choices so they can be happy, or even survive!The combat, though it lacks variation, reminds me a bit of chess. It would benefit greatly from anything that could introduce deviation from the repetitive battles (though some specific battles can be exciting and different). My favorite point of the difficulties though, is that if you choose to play on Easy mode, you can play through the entire story without having to worry about battles, as some can be even skipped! If you choose to play on Hard mode, it is ACTUALLY a challenge. This is a nice change from ""hard"" modes on games lately not actually challenging their users.This game is worth the full price, and more. I look forward to any sequels that come out from Stoic.

												Unfortunately this game in incomplete and sold as such.  Supposedly it's meant to be part of a trilogy, but what is available here for purchase is far from a finished product.  After a mere 14 hours of gameplay I have finished the game.  There is some minor replayability due to the nature of the branching story paths, but really only two ultimate outcomes.  If you can find it available for a few dollars it may be worthwhile, but anything over $5 is too much and the actual retail price is absolutely absurd.The story is interesting, but the characters are not fleshed out enough.  As an incomplete game, much of the story is never resolved or even explained.  I enjoyed the art and fact that most of my choices seemed to have repercussions.  However, the ending really came out of nowhere, as it felt more like I beat a mini boss, rather than an end boss.  Indeed, the game's supposed ""end boss"" isn't even introduced until near the end of the game, and the game spends very little time building the boss up to something substantial.  In fact, the end boss' actions are never espoused upon at all, it simply exists to move the plot forward, like some broken macguffin.  Worse than the broken story and ending of the game is the fact that the actual battles feel very unfinished too.  The fights you encounter are rather simple, which made the game easy to pick up.  On the other hand, as you play through the game the fights never really get any more difficult, and hardly change at all.  In fact, there are only a handful of enemy types you encounter, and their type hardly makes an impact upon the combat system at all.  I can literally count on two hands the different types of enemies one encounters in this game, and even then some are simply the same type, but with a different skin.  That is, there are human archers and monster projectile throwers, human swordsman and monster swordsman, etc.  Having the same encounters again and again just feels incredibly stale after about 1 hour.If there were a greater amount of variety of enemies in The Banner Saga, a more interesting combat system, and all three chapters had been released as one, complete game, than I would give this a very positive review.  As it stands the game is boring and unfinished, so I can't possibly recommend it.			"

												I bought this game several months after its release, heard a lot of positive reviews and decided to try it on my own.Banner Saga is a fantastic game in my opinion. I finished it three times, taking different decisions during the playthroughs just to see all the consequences they could have (and had!). I liked the setting very much, the epic viking saga of last stand of both humans and giants against a merciless invader horde. Heroes and their personalities are quite memorable, I enjoyed every bit of dialogue. The system of somewhat random events in-between your main battles is not new, we could see the same in Fasterthanlight, but it does surprisingly good here.Tactical battles mechanic is interesting, exploring various character options while advancing their level and unlocking new abilities gives some hidden depth to the game.The visual part is awesome, plain awesome. The same could be said of 100% fitting soundtrack, the melodies create just the right mood for the game events flow.I cannot say this is a game for everyone, but if you enjoy tactical battles and storytelling you'll likely fall in love with this game. To me it's nothing but a masterpiece.Looking forward to the sequel.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. The combat isn't bad (though it's not inspired either -- the lack of terrain features combined with the suicidal ""gank the weak ones"" AI combine to make it all feel very gamey) but the story is just not interesting.If you're going to go with the whole ""the world is doomed"" plot line you have to give me a reason to care about this world. However, all the characters felt flat and uninteresting, and with a few exceptions they were just variations on the 'generically ok person' template. The visual design was not very interesting -- everything looks like a 70s cartoon and all the characters basically wear the same outfits. Also, the game occasionally ambushes you with choices the ramifications of which are not really possible to understand at the time. This is a big narrative mistake; it's not really clever writing to ""trick"" the player into making a bad choice when there's no way to understand what the choice actually is. Actually gripping choices in a game come from making a hard choice between two equally good (or bad) outcomes, not from simply trying to pull a gotcha on players.There are lots of VERY good RPGs out there. There's no reason to waste your time with one like this unless you're really desperate for something to do.			"

												How often would you do take a wrong turn in a game and then load to get it just right? The big difference between a really good and an average game is that you live up to your decisions.You never wanted neither planned to be a leader, but here you are, people depending on you, enemies around you, food hopefully long enough to sustain you, every day facing a new problem. You would sometimes screw up, get someone killed, but you move on and take responsibility for your actions. The game is so immersive it doesn't even come to mind to save-load and change it.Banner Saga is a beautiful interactive novel / oregon trail mix with clever and dynamic tactical fights. It features a mysterious doomed Norse mythology based world and a rich story told from different viewpoints.			"

												This was a good game. I liked that it had good art and story, but it was a lot of reading. There is very little animation. Most images are still art that you pan across. I was expecting it to talk like the telltale games, but it doesn’t. There are a few speaking narrative parts so expect to read a lot and don’t try and skip the text or you won’t know how to respond to conversations. The fighting part of the game was fun, but could have been better. I'll probably pass on the sequel unless a good sale comes along. Overall I give it a 80/100			"

												For all you guys who are hoping for a gameplay - Banner Saga is not for you. If you like playing visual novels - this game is not for you also, the story is really poor. Get some time of your own and read a book.To start with. I have had great hopes for this very game. The videos and screenshots looked impressive. The graphics and music definitely made my decision on the purchase.Once I hit the 10 hours mark of being in game it come clear that this is nothing of what I was hoping for.I will just quote some of the description given.>Live through an epic role-playing Viking sagaThere is nothing epic except the plot. Interesting game universe, poor storytelling, poor characters.There is nothing of role paying considering the 'role playing' as interaction with the world and making decisions important for the outcome of an event. You are given a set number of characters that will act as they have been set to, no more. You are being told the story, so sit up and listen - that's how it goes.>...where your strategic choices directly affect your personal journey. Let's be clear on this one. That's bull... . The choices you are going to make through the story are nothing, the choices are illogical and have little to do with the common sense and are anything but strategic. Basically, probable outcome is:1) You get renown (ingame currency also used to lvl up);2) You get nothing/one of your characters dies;3) You get nothing;4) You get nothing.*Moral boosts along with several fighters for your army are not even worth mentioning*To emphasise: YOU CANNOT GUESS THE OUTCOME OF YOUR CHOICE, neither logically thinking, nor by any common sense. The results of your choices are defined by the developers. If you are lucky you will get something, if not... well.You can also make ANY choice and run through the game like nothing happened.>Make allies as you travel with your caravan across this stunning yet harsh landscapeRefer to my thoughts on 'strategic choices'. Same goes here - right answer (on the developers opinion) - you get the allies.>Carefully choose those who will help fight a new threat that jeopardizes an entire civilization. Same as for ""strategic"" choices. The outcome of your decision:1) There will be fight;2) There will be fight;3) There will be fight under another circumstances;4) There will be no fight, meaning no renown for you.To draw the line.Pros:- plot;- mood;- graphics.Cons:- poor storytelling;- no freedom of choice, just predefined illogical variants that have no impact on the story;- no gameplay - you are going to fight two battles all game long: 1) vs humans; 2) vs dredge. That's pretty much all you can do;- you cannot make right decision.Who would I recommend the game to?- if you have not decided which viking movie to watch - this game is for you;Who would I recommend the game not to?- if you like RPG and was hoping to get your hands on one.

												The Banner Saga is a shiny red apple that looks delicious until you really bite into it and find it worm infested.  The art and music are very well done and bring a sure charm to the game that seems to have bedazzled a lot of reviewers.  My issues with the game didn't become aparent until well into it (more than a few hours).  The only important resource in the game is ""renown"", which you use to either level up your characters or to buy supplies so your ""caravan"" can eat.  There is so little renown in the game you generally have to choose to do either/or of these activities.  As a result you can either feed your people as a kind leader would and end up losing a lot of battles with a stagnant squad of low level guys or you can ignore your people, allow them to starve and die off, and level your squad of fighters to win battles.  Despite the fact that one of your two leaders you control has the occupation of ""master hunter"" there is no hunting in the game.  No way to procure food except for the occassional scripted even with a ""King of Dragon Pass"" choose your own adventure chance to get precious supplies.  It makes for a frustrating experience.  Perhaps the point is the force the player into being cold and heartless much the same way Fable 3 did.  That experience ended up being sub optimal as well.  For $30+ I wish there was more of a game here to go with the fantasy story.  It just as easily could have been an excellent interactive novel on an iPad.  Instead of playing to the strengths, the game is shackled like a mewing beast to lame ""Oregon Trail"" gameplay and a somewhat counter intuitive basic turn based tactical combat system.  There are D&D Goldbox games available online that were made twenty years ago with far more tactical depth than what this 2014 game offers.  On the upside, the game looks great (even on a Mac without a dedicated graphics card).  The music is decent if not a bit overly dramatic.  The characters are mostly interesting.  I haven't finished it.  I'm probably a little more than halfway.  Sadly, there are too many worms for me to finish this deceptive looking fruit.			"

												This story has a habit of kicking you while you're down, and then delivering a few more swift kicks for good measure. It is not your typical role-playing game, nor strictly a turn-based strategy; it is more of a choose your own adventure story. And you have distinct honour of having to pick your own poison. No one is holding your hand throughout the story, and the friends you meet along the way may become your enemy in due time. This game is not meant for everyone. It does not aim to please everyone. On the contrary, you will be cursing the Gods for the cruel fate that destiny has entwined for your past deeds and decisions. But no one is listening. Didn’t you know, the Gods are dead.--EDIT: I decided that I should also include the negatives of this game, to ensure people know what they are buying into, I wouldn't feel right recommending a game to a friend or even a stranger without the entire picture. With that said, you should know that it is the first chapter in a three-chapter story.The negatives: The entire story you are met with problem after problem, and at the end (which was abrupt and unexpected) you feel like you haven't solved any of them at all, leaving the player with more questions than answers. The problem is that this story doesnt stand on its own feet, since it is one part of a planned trilogy. Although it does a good job of introducing the characters, world and the problems they face, it does not do much past that. I am sure the game will stand better alongside its other two counterparts, but I cannot recommend this to anyone looking for a self-contained story, since this is just the first chapter; it feels more like an introduction to the world of Varl, dredge and men. You will want to get the second and third chapter to get the full experience of the Banner Saga, but this is a series that will be well worth the investment. The first chapter is one piece of what looks to be a great pie, but you are not given a vertical slice; you are given a horizontal one, and tasting only the crust of the entire story you are left wanting more.After all is said and done, I am sure it is going to be a masterpiece of a trilogy. I would recommend this if you can take it for what it is, the first part of a three-part series.			"

												One of the better Kickstarter games out there. I liked the setting. I liked the turn-based combat. I liked the minimalistic voice/animations. I liked the art style and 'deep' world. Everything seemed positive but I didn't feel like it was a completely positive experience. I appreciate that the devs wanted us to view this world through different group's struggles, but I initially didn't even know whom to identify with and care about. We are thrown into the deep end and expected to make the right decisions (I say right because you can lose some of your main characters in the game, which in my opinion removes interesting stories/interactions down the line). Worth buying on sale, but be warned that it's quite short (~7hrs).Pros[/b] - Your choices do affect the outcome! (#shotsfired #telltale)- Great art style (especially visible during the numerous 'walking' segments). You get a real sense of the minuscule size your units occupy in this unforgiving world. - Turn-based combat (though innovative, it isn't as deep as I was hoping. I ended up doing the same thing in every fight for most of the game). - It may take time, but you do start to care for the main characters (Rook!)Cons[/b] - Story on Iver, the Bellower, the serpent and the Council is seriously lacking.- Everything loads slowly (Map, Camp, Towns, Interactions).- Map is an illusion (extremely detailed map, but most of it is pointless). - No side-quests.- Resource management actually doesn't matter much (I had my caravan starve many times due to random events, but still won every fight easily).

												I so want to enjoy this game more than I actually do. The combat system is fun, sensible, and deep; the artwork is beyond beautiful; the music is fantastic; and the story is enthralling.But there's just way too damn much railroading. I don't mean in terms of not having much choice as to where you're going (that part's fine with me). I mean in terms of what happens to people.The bottom line is that characters don't live or die based on the foreseeable outcomes of your choices. They die based on what whoever wrote the story thought should happen. ""If you do X, this person will die five hours later in your game. Period. No, you will not see it coming. No, you will not get to react to it or have any sort of impact on what happens; you will get a bunch of text that tells you what I have decided will happen."" You're left completely powerless and turned into a passive observer.The loss of control kills the story; it completely ruins your immersion in this rich, deep world, and slams you back on the tracks. Whenever someone's died, I've felt cheated in a way no other game has made me feel. My reaction hasn't been ""well, I was hoping for a better outcome than that, but fair's fair. I took some risks, and I can see how that would make sense."" Nope. The overwhelming feeling I'm left with is ""How the heck was I supposed to know that was going to happen?"" I feel like I have to constantly second-guess the game by trying to figure out how the various choices are trying to screw me over, instead of getting into the mindset of the characters and thinking ""what makes sense here?""This is the second time I've tried to play this game through, and I'm genuinely sad that I suspect it'll be the last. With such a linear storyline, it's only got so many playthroughs in it. Which is a shame, because apart from that it really is a terrific game. If you don't think that'll bother you as much as it does me, give it a go.			"

Epic story telling that thrusts you into situations with which you can't tell what is the most advantageous choice even a few times through. The battles feel dire from your first encounter. Every time an ally is downed it feels fatal and every victory is glorious. You must master stratagem, positioning and party composition in order to survive this journey.

												Genre - Fantasy 80s style cartoon Turn Based Survival/Battle GameI love this game set in the world of Viking Types and Giants (Varl) with the Baddies (Dredge). The game plays like you are escorting a caravan with clansmen, fighters and Varl to deal with and feed on the way. The animation and characters look great and awaken a lot of nostalgia (for people having watched things such as Fire and Ice and the LOTR animated film). There are several chapters that see you following different characters to add variety to the story. The combat is quite tactical and is a challenge with some character progression and single items allowed to boost them slightly.Main Criticsm - The voice acting is limited so you end up reading a lot of conversations (although it is worth reading in most cases).

												The Banner Saga is a game that delivers mediocre strategic gameplay with lack luster game mechanics. The game drives you into making choices between being able to use the primary resource to feed your people or level up your characters. But no amount of leveling prepares you for the random events that can kill off a character suddenly, without warning, and strip you of a vital character you might have just spent the past hour leveling. While I do not mind random events being a detriment in a game - insta death choices are fairly often additional signs of poor game design.The best things about this game is the music and the compelling storyline. Place those into a better mechanically designed game and this would be the indie darling that everyone else believes it is.  "

												Whelp, this is a disappointment. When you start the game up, it impresses left, right and centre. It's artwork is amazing, the music is stellar, the combat system appears really interesting and there's lot of named characters to explore and a gargantuan world shown.But the more you play, the more you realize that what it shows you in the first 1-2 hours is actually all there is to this ~7-10 hours game. The AI is dreadful, the combat system never goes past the complexity it has in the tutorial parts, the characters aren't explored, the choices don't actually change anything, the map is useless as you are on two rather short fixed treks with no open exploration and there's no story to speak of.Worse, of the 7-10 hours you play, 15%-20% is spent watching tiny sprites trek along a landscape, fully automated. It's painfully slow, and really underlines how much this was done to pad the game length.Disappointing. In theory, this could be a great game. Good ideas, awesome world, stellar presentation. Just that there was nothing built around it.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but it just does not 'click' with me. Actually, of all the games I backed on Kickstarter, this one has disappointed me the most (so far). I admit it is still an ok game and there are many worse out there, but here is why I do not recommend it:- It is story based, but the story is not great - mostly it seemed pretty boring, to be honest.- Lore and world bckground are probably interesting, but the game presents them extermely scarcely, mostly on the world map, which you have no gameplay reason to ever use at all.- There are a lot of characters, who seem interesting at first, but never really fulfill their potential and end up being bland to annoying. My guess is that voice acting would help a lot here.- There is tactical combat, but rather simple and repetitive - and battles seem more like solving a puzzle than being in command of a party of unique warriors. There is little enemy variety too.- Caravan management layer is completely broken. Losing all clansemen makes no impact on the game, it does not even change random events, which still refer to your caravan as if it was full or people.- No manual save option means you might end up forced to repeat certain parts after coming back, if you happened to play through a longer section not containing autosave points.- CYOA dialogue options are rarely clear as to what they will cause, meaning you might choose an option and end up causing something you were actually trying to avoid. Usually you are just forced to choose randomly, as there is not enough information.On the positive side, presentation in superb. The game looks and sounds great (music is especially impressive), but this should be dressing for a good core game, not its main advantage.			"

												I wish I loved this game.I love the art, I love the music, I love tactical RPG's.But I can not figure out the story; the choice options are not useful as either they are not what you want to do, are redundant such as: ""say Ludin is no one; tell ludin to shut up and leave; or beat ludin up until he is quiet"", and the choices don't always do what you want them to do.I could get over this and see it as a more fun version of the Oregon Trail but there are 3 things that really bug me about this game.Save Files, turn's and health/armorYou don't get any manual save options, instead the game generates auto save at some point (I can not tell when) and you have the classic ""continue from your last thing"" at one point my 'last play' and the last auto generated save where 10 days of travel and 7 battles apart not to mention key characters that died or did not die.And the turn order in combat. I don't mind the I get 1 move then the opponent gets 1 move. But this system is seriously flawed when either you or the AI are outnumbered by the other, allowing your 3 units to move 2 times for ever 1 time their 6 units more.It would be alot better if it had some turn order based on speed like Final Fantasy Tactics Advanced does, or if it was a simple 1 character move per 1 round like a lot of table top miniature games are.You don't seem to be able to heal your health in battle and this is only annoying because you might have 3 health points left but still have 20 armor points. But because you can choose to attack health or armor, health weakens their life and their attack and attacking armor sometimes lets your next attack on that unit do more damage, there is no point in attacking armor. Enemies almost never attack armor and can hit you unit with a max health of 15 for 7 damage and then because you have 5 unit’s to their 2 that same enemy can get an extra turn to get your unit to 1 health and attack before he gets a move thus making him a wasted turn when he does come around.In my eyes the whole point of an armor stat is either that it decreased the amount of damage you take, or they have to get through your armor to get to your health. However there is no point in enemies attacking your armor because they already do such massive damage while you have to hit their armor down to half if you want to do more than 3 damage to their health/strength stat a hit.

												8.5/10+ incredible presentation, graphics look handmade in pseudo-3d environment, the result is breath-taking+ incredible soundtrack+ gameplay wise it's a turn-based strategy game, fans of the genre will like the mechanics, although not as deep as in classics of the genre like homm. as far as difficulty is concerned it's on the easy side+ heavily focused on story, a story about an alliance of giants and humans vs the dredge (with some twists). great atmosphere+ seems your decisions influence the story, so the game has some replayability+ game length seems fine (not a very long game though, but i prefer that since the quality of the game is very high)- as i wrote game is easy for those familiar with the genre- the game is story driven, which is great for me, but sometimes it's very heavy on text. also people and places have weird (or difficult if you prefer) names that make me loose immersion, because i just can't remember who is who (lol)- map has no practical function, didn't help me at alla high quality game, very fresh for the genre since it has a rich and very interesting story to tell, if this is an indie game it's definitely an example of how an indie game should be. waiting for more from this talented developers.

												I absolutely loved this game.Having been afraid of strategy RPG's most of my life (Final Fantasy Tactics drove me away because I think I was too young to understand what was going on when I played it and found it immensely frustrating) I've recently found a new love for the genre. It started with Valkyria Chronicles on the PS3, expanded to XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and now The Banner Saga joins the list.I felt that everything about it - the gameplay, the pacing, the music, the art - was all top notch. This is a game I'm glad to have backed on Kickstarter, and I'm eagerly awaiting the sequel.If you like strategy RPG's I don't know what's not to like about this one. But the biggest caveat to my recommendation is that if you don't like the genre then you may want to avoid it.			"

Though arguably inferior to its sequel, The Banner Saga is worth buying for the same reasons: hand-drawn animation, beautiful medieval music score, and strategic element of turn-based combat.If you're interested in the first installment, my immediate concerns are the survival and RPG elements.At least 50% of the gameplay is an unrealized Oregon Trail as randomized situations cause your clan to fight, argue, rejoice, or die off. Being nice to people in Banner Saga presents an equal chance of receiving resources and getting stabbed in the back. Read a game guide, attempt to roleplay, or flip a coin.The nagging survival elements consist of managing food supply and morale. Food supply can be bought with Renown, your experience points, which takes away from the pool used to level up party members. This fight for balancing the health of your clan with the power of your party takes away from the possible enjoyment of combat and skill allocation.Fighting with a party of developed skills is arguably much more fun than keeping your clan members alive. Unless you care about the weak consequences (the resulting dialogue is similar to a waving finger), you might as well not care about their health. On the other hand, Morale supports combat by increasing strength of actions, but I did not see this as a necessity.If you are much more interested in the combat, try The Banner Saga: Factions. It's free-to-play, solely based on the turn-based strategy, and free from managing an annoying clan.If you are curious about its Viking-esque world specked with music for pressed marchers, give this game a go.

												As a pure audiovisual experience the Banner Saga is superb, both the artwork and the soundtrack are amazing.Unfortunately as a game it has several major issues. The turn-based battles are not that good and get repetitive really quickly. The caravan management side of things doesn't fare much better. There's plenty of choices to be made, but often the consequences feel very unpredictable and unfair. Furthermore, the main path through the game is fairly fixed anyway and in the long run your choices don't really matter much. Even running out of supplies for days on end doesn't seem like a big deal, you just lose a few people from your caravan.I backed the Banner Saga on Kickstarter and really wanted to like the game. Unfortunately the gameplay is just too weak and the game has too many bad design decisions for me to truly enjoy. I played through the game on normal difficulty.The good:- Gorgeous visuals- Amazing soundtrack- The Norse mythology inspired world is quite interestingThe bad:- There's lots of choices, but the consequences often seem very unpredictable and most of the time don't seem to matter much in the long run- The turn-based combat is pretty weak with some questionable design choices, especially the way turn order is determined and how remaining hit points and attack strength are combined into one stat- There's very little variety in battles, in pretty much every battle you'll be fighting the same few enemies- Using renown for both leveling up and for supplies & items was a very annoying design decision- Ending is very abrupt			"

												Summary of the full review:The Banner Saga is an immensely unique, and, by no coincidence, immensely good game that combines great artistic design and robust C&C mechanics with a highly entertaining and deceptively complex battle system. The Banner Saga has only a few outright flaws; the shoddy dialogues and the constant need to click-click-click through them line by line are a blemish on an otherwise engaging narrative. Moreover, the startling lack of enemy variety and the relatively dumb AI keep the battle system from realizing its potential for true tactical greatness. The game's system of choices and consequences also has far less of an impact on the story than Stoic's PR department has been trying to claim; nonetheless, it still offers an engaging and immersive range of decisions that will directly influence your battle performance and can occasionally result in major character deaths.I suspect that The Banner Saga will always be the subject of great controversy; it has a kind of self-assured swagger, flaunting all of its little weirdnesses and weaknesses without making much of an effort to look like a typical tactical cRPG or a typical casual story game. The game features heaps upon heaps of idiosyncratic gameplay systems, like the strange combination of a broad C&C system with a fully pre-determined linear story, the fact that you will rarely if ever be able to see a ""game over"" screen, the ""sit back and immerse yourself"" approach to map travel, and a whole slew of novel and deeply unrealistic combat mechanics. You may choose to accept or reject these mechanics according to your personal preferences; all I can tell you is that all of these elements stand in the service of a fully coherent and extremely tightly designed gameplay experience that I deeply enjoyed playing through.Full review: http://www.rpgcodex.net/content.php?id=9938 "

												I feel almost bad not recommending it, this game has so much potential, but unfortunately it's pretty much wasted by the horrible ending.The pros:- The graphics are very pretty, and do convey the sense of being in another world, and of setting things up nicely- The music and the few voice-overs are very good- The general story, up until the end, is captivating and unique enough when stacked up against other games.The cons:- The game is on rails. Serious rails. And it feels like it. It actually provides you with a map you can click on, so you can learn about the different regions and cities of the world, but then won't let you plot a course to visit any of them.- The combat is actually pretty boring once you realize that every round of turn based combat, the turns go back and forth between you and the enemy. You just killed 3 enemies so it's now 5 on 3? Well, that just means some of the enemy units will go twice. It really sucks any aspect of strategy right out of the game.- The ENDING! Wow. I don't want to spoil it, but the game builds up so much about the setting, the history of the world, the different characters....and then it just ends. SO much could have been done, but wasn't. What a gyp.			"

												I have been truly excited for this release. I'm a veteran of The Banner Saga: Factions, the multiplayer aspect of this - which helped to develop the AI. I absolutely adore that game, so I had an idea of the combat coming into this. What I did not expect was the scale. I avoided most news up to this release, so as to be fresh and not have any expectations. The battles are wicked. You will not be coddled, one mistake can wreck you. You're always outnumbered. The battle system is fantastic. I adored every battle.The story I find to be a bit lack-luster, but the twists are great. I am going for my second play-through, on normal this time. Great game. Very dark and not very forgiving. Don't really need to say anything about the awesome art. ^_-			"

Pros:Breathtaking visuals. A very unique and beautiful art direction. Characters, backgrounds, battle animations, particles. All very well done.Amazing music, works perfectly with the fantasy/Nordic atmosphere.Combat is easy to pick up, and difficulty is adjustable at any time.Great narrative, with plenty of twists and turn. Plenty of lore if you really dig into it.Tons of random encounters with varying consequences.Choices feel like they actually matter.Cons:While it is a grid based battle game like Final Fantasy Tactics it unfortunately doesn't have the same kind of depth that FF Tactics did. That isn't to say that combat in The Banner Saga isn't fun.Not a huge enemy variety, you'll see a lot of the same enemies in a lot of similar formations. Given the length of the game though this isn't a huge con.Aside from a handful of narrator introductions, there is no voice acting. Which is a shame, I think that it would have really added to the experience. "

												I was really excited to play this game, but the more I did so, the more obvious something became: I just wasn't enjoying it very much.The RPG elements of the game aren't bad. They aren't great either, but they're not bad. Nothing to write home about either way.The problem is with the turn-based tactical combat, which is bland and repetitive.  For starters, there is no terrain of any sort. You just get a blank grid with you and your enemies, with every square of the grid created equal. That means there's no choke points, no cover, no high ground, and so on. This is made worse by the bizarre way that turn order is handled. First one of your units moves, then one of the enemies, then back to one of yours, and so on. This applies even when one side outnumbers the other, so if you have 6 people and there are only 2 enemies left, each enemy gets to move three times as often as each of your units. This disparity just further eliminates any possibilities for actual tactics, and turns combat into a mosh pit of repeatedly hitting each other until everyone on one side has fallen over.Fortunately for the player, the enemy units and AI are sufficiently weak (at least on the default difficulty setting) that this is seldom a problem, especially as the game has no permadeath. You just keep on hitting the enemies until none of them are standing, and if a few of your side fall down in the process then it's no big deal.Which brings me to another problem: there are no other mission types. Every single combat is a straight last team standing. There's no ""control the point"" or ""survive for x turns"" or ""rescue the non-combat units"" or anything else. Just your units, their units, and yet another identical fight to the death.			"

												If you're interested in story driven games and RPGs, this game is definitely worth the buy. The Banner Saga is a combination of (a) turn based, micro-scale combat (a la Dungeons & Dragons or CRPGs), (b) visual novel storytelling with many choices, and (c) a clan management game. This it the abc of The Banner Saga, and its primary innovation is trying to entwine the three elements into a single, engaging experience. There are a lot of things The Banner Saga does right:+ A compelling story in an interesting world (basically a Nordic world where humans and giants try their hardest to tolerate each other);+ A simple yet interesting combat system that is genuinely fun;+ Genuinely difficult choices, both in terms of gameplay and story progression;+ Beautiful and unique art and visuals (a sort of gritty Disney meets Eyvind Earle (mentioned in the credits as inspiration));+ An equally beautiful celtic sound track.But the game has several flaws as well: where it is ambitious in entwining the abc and innovative in its ways to make the interactions between those elements engaging, it never really delivers in the end-game. This is mostly due to The Banner Saga's Renown system, which hopes to bring all three (combat, narrative, and magement) together, but ultimately fails to do so.The Renown system functions much like Experience Points, only Renown Points will buy you (1) character levels, (2) items for your heroes, and (3) supplies for your clan, which you require to travel. Although this is an engaging way of resource management, it fails in several respects. Firstly, it can be anti-fun when the player is forced to choose to buy supplies for the clan rather than spend money on leveling characters, which is a core element of what is enjoyable about RPGs. Secondly, characters that die in the narrative will have been a waste of invested Renown (I personally don't find this a big deal, but those who enjoy the turn based combat more than the narrative may find it irritating).More importantly, this system leads to a watering down of all the three elements: combat becomes too easy and narrative and managament choices unimpactful. The clan management for example consists of managing Supplies (for travel), Figthers (for large battles and random events) and Morale (which affects fighter efficiency as well as the combat system). Yet this never ends up being sufficiently relevant: leveling characters makes it easy to ignore the penalty for having bad Morale, you always end up having enough Fighters, and buying sufficient Supplies is more of a necessary tedium.There are some other, less prominent flaws: sometimes the writing takes much agency away from the player, resulting in catastrophes that you may feel were completely beyond your control. Often, the narrative fails to emphasize important events that aren't entirely in the script, such as a character dying due to a narrative decision. There is also very little time spent actually developing some of the side characters in interesting dialogue, and much focus rests on the main storyline. The latter bothered me enormously, because I liked many of the characters upon introduction, but barely got to interact with them. This is partially due to the game introducing too many characters, but partially simply too few of such events were actually written out.These flaws, as well as a rather abrupt ending (which pretty much makes buying the sequal mandatory), leave me feeling slightly less satisfied than I'd hoped to be. However the flaws are easily forgiven, because The Banner Saga manages to keep the players attention where it wants it, namely with the main storyline. This storyline itself is compelling and well presented to the extent that it warrants the €20,- pricetag in itself.Verdict: Recommended with a 7/10. The flaws in the gameplay are compensated by a great narrative experience; moreover, the gameplay has much potential and if the developer learns, The Banner Saga 2 may become a real classic.			"

												One of the most visually pleasing games you'll ever play. It presents you with tough choices throughout your journey, impacting whom you get to take with you, who lives, who dies, and how good or bad you manage. Ultimately, also impacting your story.Though I didn't feel like many of them mattered for the end of the game, they still mattered for the JOURNEY towards the end.Pros: Gameplay is challenging or if you want to, you can play the combat on the easiest setting if you just want the story and the journey.Visually very beautiful.Music and sound design draws you into it.Choices and moral dilemmas make you sit there for a long time, pondering what will be the best choice.And towards the end... well, I won't spoil it. BUY IT AND PLAY IT DUDE! JUST DO IT!Cons: The combat can become a bit repetitive as many enemies repeat and the variation doesn't happen until later in the game.			"

												Fantastic artwork and story. The battles are fun and intense as well, though if you are a hardcore turn-based strategy player you may consider them lightweight (I certainly find them as much as I can handle). The best parts of the game are the role-playing parts. Every decision is a burden, and often there is no decision that won't have dire consequences. Aside from 2 or 3 main characters, every one of your party members can get killed off in any encounter. Even some of the discussion trees can lead to a character death if you are not careful.Think of it as a combination of the best parts of Final Fantasy, Skyrim, and Oregon Trail.			"

												Recommend -- barely. This game is fun, but it in no way lived up to the hype/my expectations, and it is quite pricey for what it is. I've played through twice, in about 15 hours altogether. Basically, this game is ""Viking Oregon Trail"", with level ups. Very narrow level ups (stat selection for pre-made characters). There's no character creation (though you do have access to several different character's POV during the game -- but you don't have control over switching between those). Events in the game (for example agreeing to let certain characters join or not join your caravan) don't really impact the game other than to provide a bit of flavor to your next play through. The world is interesting enough, and some of the characters are intriguing, but by and large there's no pay off on that, because it's half a game. The game just stops, at about what I thought was the half way mark. So while there's hints at things that it might be interesting to learn about the characters, that's as far as it gets. Furthermore, the characterisation is not that sophisticated, despite the praise heaped on the game. It's not terrible, but it's by no means outstanding. The characters are very trope-y: ""Concerned Dad"" ""Teen Girl"" ""Lady Archer"" ""Rude Prince"" ""Pyscho Pyro"" ""Proud Warrior Race Guy"" etc. A final pet peeve: the dialogue in this game was very iffy in places. It's supposed to be reminiscent of a Viking Saga, but the characters are constantly going around using contemporary slang. I'm not expecting Shakespeare -- but it would be nice if the characters didn't use things like ""ok"". It's just -- not in keeping with the milieu.So, I've told you my reservations for recommending. If you're reading this and thinking, ""wow that's very picky"", then maybe this game is for you! But if you're thinking ""no, that would bother me too"", maybe skip it or wait for a good sale. As I said, I've played through twice. I doubt I will again -- fifteen hours and I feel like I've seen everything the game has to offer. I got the game on sale, which I'm really glad about. I feel like it was expensive at the price I paid. I think I'd be genuinely annoyed if I'd paid more. "

												Many recent Indie games I tried felt like unfinished, half baked products by lazy developers who've been trying to ride a trend for some easy money and fame, leaving me feel cheated and disappointed. Not The Banner Saga, though. This game looks like a lof ot talent, effort and hard work had been poured into it, and that alone, in my book, means a lot.The Banner Saga is a tactical Strategy RPG with a deep, intense story. The graphics and soundtrack are great, but what I like the most here, is the story. The atmosphere of the game is really dark, as the story is about a violent and bloody war. There's a lot of death, injuries, bloodshed and grief. Some people might consider such a setting to be problematic or even inappropriate for such a game, but I kind of like it. It's a refreshing look on things, at the very least. Just don't expect too many rainbows and unicorns. :)Another good aspect of the game, in my opinion, is the choices. Some people complain they don't have enough influence on the game. While I agree that it would be great if the choices had more weight, I think they do offer enough replayability value. Going through the game just once hardly feels like all there is to it, as I know if left me quite curious to play again, make different decisions and see where it leads me.As for the strategy part of the game, it's certainly one of the better parts of the game for me. The battle system is simple to learn (should be almost intuitive for anyone who's ever played such games before), but seems to have enough depth and balance to be appealing and interesting. It kind of reminds me of the battle system in Expeditions: Conquistador (another great tactical RPG, btw).As of now I haven't beaten the game, but I did get to the final battle. I ended up losing quite a few times, after which I simply got frustrated and gave up. I restarted the game, got kind of half-way before losing a mid-game battle and getting a 'Game Over'. The reason I'm describing all this, is to point out what I consider to be the only two real problems I have (or used to have) with the game:1) At the time, the difficulty level of the final battle was much higher than anything else you encountered during the game, and I don't mean ""slightly"" or ""moderately"" higher (which would make sense, considering it's the final battle), I mean it was REALLY much more difficult. I know many people have been complaining about this, enough to have the developers address and fix this issue, which probably means it should be okay now.2) The game is somewhat vague regarding the consequence of losing a battle. In most cases, if you lose a battle you can still continue playing, but you suffer some negative consequences. In a few specific battles, though, losing means getting  a ""Game Over"". It means you can get back to your last save and try again, but you don't get to continue playing despite the loss, as you would after losing a normal battle. This wouldn't be a problem for me, btw, if the game was clear about the rules. I'd expect to get at least a clue, that I'm facing a critical battle that I must win in order to survive. Well, the game doesn't give you anything to indicate there's a difference.Despite those two problems, I really like the game. It's one of the better games I encountered during the last few years. I'm kind of disappointed I didn't get to beat the game yet, but I did really enjoy playing it, regardless.EDIT (March/31/2016): By now I've managed to win the final battle and beat the game on 'normal' (the medium difficulty level). While I'm happy to have finally succeeded, I still feel the spike in the difficulty level was too much.			"

												If you like character driven novels or tactical turn-based games, this might do you better then me. I found the gameplay itself mostly frustrating and repetitive. The story and characters were great, if the game was more of a novel than a tabletop game, i would enjoy this better. In the end only the novelty of this game made me endure it's flaws. But there is 2 more? What's up with that?			"

												I’m gonna be honest, I haven’t experienced such an amazing game for quite some time. Graphically the game is astonishingly beautiful, with one of the best art styles I’ve ever seen and the way the animations were made, slow but nailing the right spot. The graphics and the soundtrack are, for me, a masterpiece on their own.Quite possibly one of the most intense soundtracks I’ve heard over the last years. Gameplay wise The Banner Saga could be described as a turn based strategy game with a party/hero management system, which include leveling up using “Renown” and distributing skill points to each separate stat, it also features something which can be compared to something like Oregon Trail in which you need to micro manage your supplies as you travel across the land and each time you visit a town you can trade your “Renown” at the market for supplies or items which can be equipped by your characters.Renown is what you could call the in game currency, you get Renown for killing enemies and winning battles and you can use that earned Renown to trade in a town market for supplies, which will be consumed as each day passes depending on how many people you have on your caravan (Varl, Clansmen and fighters) or you can use that Renown to promote your characters.By promoting your characters you get 2 – 3 points which can be assigned to various different stats, such as strengh which determines how much health you have and the damage you deal to your enemies, willpower which can be used to increase your movement or the power of your attack on a turn but it’s a limited resource in each battle, along with many other stats such as Armor break which determines how much damage you deal to the enemy armor etc.The battle system is pretty simple to learn, yet, hard to master. Before each battle you get to choose your party from your pool of characters and then you will proceed to the battlefield where you can deploy your troops along the starting line. Basically, units have armor, represented by a blue banner, and strength represented by a red banner, if you focus on dealing damage to an enemy armor you’ll be able to deal more damage on a later turn, the more armor an unit has the less damage that unit will receive and the more strength an unit has the more health it has and the more damage that unit will deal to enemies, sometimes you’ll have to focus on dealing strength damage to an enemy in order to lower their damage and sometimes you’ll have to focus on their armor in order to deal damage to them later on the battle, this is the key to mastering The Banner Saga combat system. Each character also has an unique ability which they can use in battle by using willpower, that same willpower can be used to increase damage dealt to enemies or travel distance during your turn.Besides all this you have a fairly standard dialogue system, with some pretty neat writing, albeit with a lack of voice acting, something that works like the dialogue system from Dragon Age or Mass Effect in which each dialogue option will have a different outcome on each situation and sometimes those choices will lead to severe consequences such as someone abandoning your party or your caravan or taking away your supplies so choose carefully.In my opinion this is what makes The Banner Saga a somewhat highly replayable game because if you choose a different dialogue option everytime you play a new game you’ll have tons of different outcomes. Story wise the game did an amazing job in creating a world in which you care about the characters, people you meet along the way and even strangers, while it still forces you to keep your eye open for trouble along the road.Besides the “normal random events” there’s also something else which comes up when you are travelling through the land with your caravan and these are called “Wars”. As you might expect these happen when your army meets another army, in this case a Dredge army. First a screen will pop up showing how many troops the enemy army has and how many troops you have, including varl and men, and after that you’ll be presented with a series of different choices such as “hold the line”, “formations”, “charge” etc.Each one of these tactical approaches will have a very different outcome depending on the battle, the number of troops on each army and depending on your army morale. Morale basically increases and decreases depending on your dialogue choices and if you win or loose battles and wars, lower morale will result in a decrease of the amount of willpower that your characters will start each battle with. When travelling through the land you can also set up camp, on your camp you can arrange your party, you can chat with your party members, check the game map which will provide a description for each region and town on the game world and you can also rest. Resting is fairly important because it can trigger certain events and it’s by resting that your characters heal from injuries and you should always make sure your characters are healed, but, keep in mind that everytime you rest a day passes by and thus your supplies decrease.However, there’s one more thing I’d like to say about The Banner Saga, even though I absolutely loved the game the final boss fight was just way too frustrating and very hard to beat, it took me over 5 hours to beat it on Normal mode so I can only imagine how long it must take on hardcore. It mainly took me that long because by the end, the game forces you to take two specific characters, two characetrs which I barely used during the rest of the game and so they were low level, to battle and by the time the final boss triggers you can’t rest and I had several characters injured which really hurted me thus taking several tries, I don’t think that this was actually my fault but also something on the design side, when you get there, if you get there, you’ll understand what I mean.In the end, despite the frustration I went through to beat the game I can’t recommend The Banner Saga enough, it’s such a great game! In my honest opinion it excels in all key aspects of a game like this, story, graphics, soundtrack and gameplay, it’s certainly a good investment of both your time and your money and I’m sure you’ll have plenty of good moments with it.Still, it needs to be said that The Banner Saga is divided in three parts and this is the first part and buying this game will not grant you access to the other parts when they come out. You can also try Banner Saga Factions which is multiplayer only and it’s available on Steam for free and by playing it you’ll be able to see how the battles play on the single player game.			"

												The game has potential. It's beautiful, no doubt, and the storyline is interesting. The gameplay, however, leaves me wanting. Most of the gameplay is split between making decisions while you attempt to move your caravan somewhere safe and controlling a small party in turn based combat. There really aren't many options with the turn based combat. Most of the strategy will come down to picking your team, but once you're in the fight, there isn't always a lot to do. Each player has a specific talent they can use at the cost of a limited supply of points. Otherwise you can attack or skip/rest. I really wish the depth of options was greater. While the choice to break armor or attack strength adds a potential element of strategy, it becomes pretty obvious once you realize the enemies don't change much: break armor on the big guys, attack strength on the smaller guys, hope you can arrange the enemy in a way to link armor breaks...and that's about it. I was also let down by many of the special attacks. Some are highly situational, and require too much luck getting enemies arranged properly on the board to really take advantage of them. The ranged attackers tend to be super limited, and the support roles just don't offer a viable option to use effectively in battle. The caravan aspect of gameplay has you making text based choices when confronted with an option, like adding a stranger to your party or not. I enjoy the opportunity to roleplay, but it often seemed any choice was bound to be bad. Rarely did a choice end up being positive (though I don't know the results of alternative choices). While I can appreciate the idea that the caravan is supposed to be very difficult and force you to make difficult decisions where you know something bad is going to happen, it would be nice to have some variety. The worst of these, however, is when it leads to one of your characters being killed through text. No one dies on the battlefield, but they can during roleplay. Since resources are so limited and improving your fighters takes up the same resources that you use to buy food, losing a character you've invested in to a choice in dialog was almost enough to get me to stop playing. I've reached the end of the game, but I didn't have too much fun along the way. Some of the issues are just balancing. But ultimately the balance is off too much for me to recommend the game. I really wanted to like this one, but the only thing I came away impressed by is the artwork.			"

												A story of utmost intensity and chaos at every turn.  Your actions and words carry heavy weight so choose wisely playing through the history of your Bannar Saga.Turn based action where the battles never seem to end too fast or carry on painstakingly.  A good blend of linear and choices with super artwork played out through epic war.  Character development also flows nicely into place.  Be sure to keep an eye on supplies and morale while distributing your renown, that you earn through battle, only to level up or promote the fighters you are going to use most.  Do not put all your chips on one hand though because in my playthroughs I had various exits upon different actions and choices.			"

												I played this game through and I enjoyed it VERY VERY much. The artwork, the music, the storyline, the battles - everything was mostly great. The game basically reads like an interactive book with lots of awesomely drawn static ilustrations and turn battles inbetween. The influence of Norse mythology is  very obvious here and gives a very good vibe to the experience. There are plenty of choices in the game, but their biggest consequence (as far as I can tell) is who of the heroes will join you and survive the perils. Otherwise the storyline seems fairly linear, although still very captivating and well-written. You will also not experience leading huge armies as you are always in control of no more than half a dozen characters. I personally was  left a bit dissatisfied with the ending (this includes both the final battle, the final plot twist and the final cutscene) and it DOES seem to me personally there might be a room for a sequel. Overall the game has its flaws, but if you like books, high fantasy in norse setting, turn-based batttles and good storyline you can't go wrong with Banner Saga. It was a time well spent, which leaves a desire for more.			"

												The atmosphere of The Banner Saga is incredible. It's oppressive and depressing, and helps you become part of your party as they desperately seek solace in a world that is slowly ending - being consumed by an ancient darkness.Gameplay is split between turn-based strategy with an interesting Armor/Strength dynamic that will effect your approach and strategy to every situation, and overworld politics and diplomacy as you try to lead your party, maintain provisions, determine the speed at which you travel, and help (or abandon) passersby.The Banner Saga is a slowly paced game, and I mean that in the best possible way. It gives you time to absorb the world, and hammers in the weight of the decisions you have to make for the caravan and your allies. And these decisions matter. Critical characters can live and die based on the decisions you make, and there is no auto-saving to get them back. Choices are gray at best, and it's solely up to you, the player, to decide what you feel will best serve the caravan.Visually, it is beautiful, with smooth gradients of color behind swathes of silhouetted foreground, and a fitting soundtrack for you slow trek through the end of the world.Highly recommended for anyone looking for a story-driven game or a different take on turn-based strategy. The Banner Saga is oppressive, overwhelming, and exhausting. And it's incredible for it.			"

												THough the game is more of adventure type then RPG or strategy and it got some questionable balance decisions it remains one of the best games in terms of immersion and story. Narrative is thoroughly weaved at the beginning but, unfortunately, later it becomes more and more schematic, the pace of story got faster, often skipping or even cutting previosuly declared minor storylines. Nevertheless, it was a nice experience for me and unlike most of modern games it was able to hold my interest untill the final titres.			"

												A story very well done with many incredible elements, and that will make you almost cry. Early in the game you will feel lost, but long of the journey, you will getting the hang of the game and understand the story. -A mixture of Final Fantasy Tactics and some RPGs and games Point click, make this game one of the best of 2014.Make decisions in the midst of war, will make you think twice, because a simple decision can make you lose the battle. -Graphs beautiful ... Clean and simple but detailed. -Excellent soundtrack, Songs that make you want to stop the battle and listen. -But the weak point of the game, it would be his lack of command and compatibility with the X360 control.-Some commands are complicated because the screen is static and you do not  to move it to different angles ... it always keeps the same angle, amid battles it ultimately fail bad gameplay.-Another thing that could be better is the personaliação of perssonagens, it could be more like FFT, which has several items, jobs, and powers / different attacks, which ends up leaving the game more envolvente.-The lack of animations of the characters, are always with the same anemation, do you get angry, but this is a simple and silly thing for an amazing game. =Recommend a few people, more for those who like challengesNote 79/100(sorry my bad english... I tried!)Uma história muito bem feita com muitos elementos incríveis, e que fara voce quase chorar. No começo do game voce vai se sentir perdido, mas ao decorrer da jornada, voce vai pegando o jeito do jogo e entendendo a historia.-Uma mistura de Final Fantasy Tatics e alguns RPGS e jogos Point Clicks, fazem desse game, um dos melhores de 2014-Tomar as decisões em meio a guerra, vai te fazer pensar duas vezes, pois uma simples decisão, pode fazer você perder a batalha. -Graficos lindos e simples... Limpos mas detalhados. -Excelente trilha sonora, Musicas que te fazem querer parar a batalha e ficar ouvindo.-Mas o ponto fraco do jogo, seria sua falta de comandos e compatibilidade com controle do X360. -Alguns comandos são complicados pois a tela é estatica e você não tem como move-la para diversos angulos... ela se mantem no mesmo angulo sempre, em meio as batalhas isso acaba prejudicando algumas coisas. outra coisa que poderia ser melhor, é a personaliação dos perssonagens, que poderia ser mais parecida com FFT, que tem varios itens, jobs, e poderes/ataques diferenciados, que acaba deixando o game mais envolvente.-E a falta de animações dos personagens que sempre estão com a mesma animação, fazem voce ficar irritado, mas isso é uma coisa simples e boba, para um game incrivel.=Recomendo a poucas pessoas, mais para aquelas que gostam de desafiosNota 79/100----PS:A linguagem em Portugues é horrivel, deve ser portugues de portugal, mas mesmo assim ajuda muito na historia.----			"

												The art is superb and evocative - like a fantasy film you might have dreamed in childhoood.  The writing is lovely, full of Nordic deadpan and the gallows humor of struggling heroes on what may very well be a death march at the end of the world.  The tactical gameplay is solid, and while I can see there are comments that hack on it for being repetitive in the campaign, I don't feel that way about it yet - also, I feel it's a solid foundation from which to explore the system's potential in multiplayer or for a sequel.  I have only one issue with it, and that is the deceptive title.  I came here fully expecting Candy, and or some form of crushing, based on the name obviously.  This tale of northerners and Giants trudging through the ice and eternal sunset towards a bloody end in battle, as in legends of old, is woefully misrepresented by the use of the word ""Saga,"" so buyer beware.

												It plays well, but there some things that just pisses me the ♥♥♥♥ OFF to no end.-No Manual Save feature; which is especially frustrating because the outcome of a lot of those cutscenes make no ♥♥♥♥ing sense; NEVER RUN FROM A FIGHT, ALWAYS CHOOSE DIRECT CONFRONTATION; you will lose heroes, supply, army, etc otherwisebest example: I have a choice to either run or fight an army ""that greatly outnumbers mine"", according to the text. Ok I run, lose a high lvl hero LOL ok I reload a autosave, replay to the encounter and choose FIGHT this time, and it was actually MY army that outnumbered the enemy greatly, an easy fight followed and I lost nearly nothing.-Unbalanced encounters: Sometimes the fights have like 4-5 enemies, other times 15+, LOLwhich is ok when you have EGIL with whom you can abuse the AI; BUT THE GAME HATES HIM AND WANTS HIM DEAD-Losing high lvl heroes, whats the ♥♥♥♥ing point of lvling them, especial egil, the game wants him dead so badly, but he is like the most useful character in the game. just G2H stoic-Losing multiple high lvl heroes in 2 textboxes, lolok gj I stop playing now, no way to talk may way out of it, why the ♥♥♥♥ was it even a cutscene with multiple choice answers? That's nothing more than the illusion of choices.-the story ends at the halfway point, with multiple endings that dont really differ from each other .. like in ME3			"

												The Banner Saga excels more so at being a demonstration at the power and potential of crowd funding more so than it does as a successful tactical RPG. A story driven, episodic, tactical game like this would have had no chance of making it into the public's eye just a few short years ago, and because of this, gamers should be thrilled. Standing on its own, The Banner Saga is a very decent game that just narrowly gets a recommendation from me. The art style is simply stunning, and will undoubtedly land The Banner Saga on many ""Best Looking Games of 2014"" lists. The story itself is also fascinating with its ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" style of narrative, although your mileage may vary when it comes to becoming emotionally involved with the plights of the game's multiple protagonists.The Banner Saga's biggest missed opportunity, in my opinion, is with the combat system. It's a very bare-bones system that adds nothing significant to the genre, and begins to feel quite repititive as you progress through the game and often repeat battles due to the game's high difficulty. It's functional and all, but overall just feels competent at best, and ultimately disappoints, as a stronger combat system could really have propelled The Banner Saga into the realms of the greats. But overall, it's a solid debut effort from Stoic, and if you're a fan of this genre, is worth checking out once the price drops a bit.			"

												Near the start of the game there's a fully animated cut scene setting the early stage of the game. It's well done, it looks amazing and gives background to where you are, and the setting you are in. I looked forward seeing a few more cut scenes like this- but to my surprise it was the only one of it's type in the game. No second act cut scene, no ending cut scene- just a couple still pictures. They set the bar for themselves very high whit this opening cartoon story telling bit- get your hopes up high, then let you down by not following through in the rest of the game.The combat lends itself to one tactic- cripple enemies so they don't hurt you, then let them run around and eat up the enemies turn order so the tough guys don't act as quick/as often. It makes very little sense- in video game or real world logic. ""Attack! But don't kill them, maim them, so like, the other guys won't attack as much."" In most tactic games killing a bad guy would mean there is less of a threat- slowly gain an advantage until it's a big advantage, then win. Not here, the metagame tactic of maiming is unfun. The health/armor system is interesting, and may have been fun if the rest of the combat helped with a more cohesive vision. Too often I would feel like a battle would be uninteresting simply because a huge dude just happened to start combat near a weak dude, and smashed his face in- either on my side or the enemy side. There are some 'tactics' to this game, such as positioning people for small bonuses here and there- but on a whole its a pebble in a shallow pond.The decision making process outside of combat is more frustrating than anything. Too often you would look at your list of options, and see the logic behind one of the answers. ""This looks like a reasonable option"" you might say to one of them. So you pick that option, only to find that the vague wording has lead you astray, or unforeseen logic throws you for a loop and you end up frustrated. ""Post gauds to guard supplies!"" You might say. ""Ok!"" The game will tell you. ""But robbers stole half your stuff anyway, wah wah."" So why did I bother with the guards at all! Another example; an option might say “I trust you.” So you selected that. But then the scene plays out like “I trust you. Dead men don’t lie!” Then you stab him dead. Didn’t see the flow of logic there? Too bad, the game autosaved, live with it. At one point in the game you need to use an item to win a battle. This fight is annoying for a few reasons. First- there's an NPC giving stupid hints that too vague to be helpful, and the speech bubble is right over half your characters. So you have to wait a few moments before selecting where to move, because you can't see anything.(Also you can not adjust the camera in combat, and it can get messy/clucnky/and visually clustered quickly. When things get heated in combat you'll be fighting the menu more than enemies.)Next, the storyline item used in the fight is not explained. Maybe this my bad, but I didn't realize that it became a special ability of a character during that fight. There was no indication that it was there, and I never used that characters abilities anyway, so why would I look? I thought at certain conditions where met the item would be used in a cutsence or something- but nooope you just have to know. Great, wasted 2 hours before I realized that.I want to like this game. It does some things really well.The story feels like it's a real fleshed out fantasy novel. The one single cut scene is really good. The use of fire emblem style dialogue deliver (nonmoving portraits of characters) look nice. But overall this game doesn’t need more polish, it needs better design. I want to like it, but can't. I also can't recommend this unless it's on sale for half off or more.			"

												The Banner Saga, it was one of the few indie games of recent memory that I was truely pumped up and excited for... I guess I shouldnt have gone in with such lofty expectations.This is no Final Fantasy Tactics or Agarest War if that's what your looking for, those games are way deeper in terms of combat and story. The Banner Saga is very bare bones when it comes to being a turn based strategy-RPG game. Now I know that the Stoic team is mostly made up of a few ex-Bioware guys but the story similarities between The Banner Saga and Dragon Age are eerily similar, if you've played both games then you can probably see the parrallels. The Banner Saga is supposedly going to be an episodic or trilogy style series, very lame considering nowhere on the steam store page does it say anything about this being an espisodic/trilogy half-baked half-made un-finished game... but this is an indie kickstarter game so why am I surprised. If you were like me and expected to have a full complete epic journey to sink into from start to finish then you are in for a very rude awakening, we got fleeced.The first part which is available on Steam, is extremely short and when the credits roll there is literally no forward progress made in the story and your left with a giant TO BE CONTINUED.... I cannot reccommend this game in its current state unless your a hardcode turn based-RPG fan, and even then this will be a bit of a stretch because the campaign is so woefully short. This game is un-finished and not worth its current price of $25.00Personal Pet Peeve: This game has nothing to do or in common with ""true"" viking/nordic mythology at all. I honestly dont even see how the developers can make such a claim on the store page, sure this game might be ""inspired"" by viking/nordic mythology but I would use that term extremely loosely in this case. There is nothing even remotely viking'esq about this game, only a perversion of what some developer who has probably never read an Edda thinks a viking might be like, for shame.Thanks for reading.

												The battle system is really annoying. I liked the HP=attack strength part, but the ""turns always alternates between sides, one character at a time"" rule means that if you kill weaker enemies you essentially give the stronger ones extra turns. Therefore, to win, you must weaken as many enemies as possible without killing them. This is nonsensical, counterintuitive, and not very fun.			"

												I pre-ordered this and honestly not overly impressed with the game, as everyone else has said the music and the art work is lovely but it's not enough on it's own and it really does just come down to that.The combat is not so much difficult as it is annoying, one of my biggest annoyances with combat was how the turns are always switched between sides, so even if I can see which enemy soldier is next on the turn list and I kill him off, his turn will just be replaced by another enemy meaning it's more combat effective for me to leave enemies alive but damaged rather than killed so I can get attacked by a fresh enemy. Very frustrating.I seriously don't understand the renown purchasing thing, why do I have to choose between leveling up my characters and buying supplies? When characters start getting very high level it costs so much renown to actually level them that you're effectively starving your caravan of supplies.I was not impressed that the description of this game put so much emphasis on choices, the result of said choices are almost entirely + supplies or - supplies, occasionally randomly killing off a character who has been with you a long time with just a a sentance, it just doesn't feel part of the story.The last gripe I have is the characters in your caravan, I completed the game after 2 days but I don't think I skipped anything so it's a short game anyway but in my entire play through apart from the scenes where you recruit new characters there is only ever 1 other conversation with them throughout the game (unless of course it's one of the main characters) this annoyed me a bit I was looking forward to seeing how my new companions would get on with each other in the stresses of my starving caravan but they apparently go silent once they join me. After this I really can't recommend this game, it just doesn't deliver on what the game description said.			"

												I don't really want to give this Game a negative Review, but there are no grey areas in the reviewsystem and if I ask myself ""would you recommend this game to others"" I simply can't get myself to say yes.Let me try to explain my reasoning:The game has an interesting artstyle and some elements of norse-mythology, and works with a mixture of oregan-trail style  traveling(where you make decisions along the way) and turn based combat on a grid.So far so good, a solid concept.My problems with the game:None of the characters, were all that memorable to me, they all felt kind of bland and those that I rememberd were rather annoying(mostly the humans, the Varl, a race of horned giants, were mostly bland warriors).The oregan-trail elements of the game actually felt kind of fun to me, but I found the combat to be so utterly dull and repetetative... You fight a bunch of really tough(tough in the sense of, they are able to take a ton of damage, not that they are difficult to beat) enemys that repeat over and over again, with little variety. Maybe there will be more interesting enemys later, but that still doesn't change my second problem with the game:The characters don't all that many abilitys, in fact, they have one per character and their base attacks. And Most of the time you just move a character, hit a thing and thats it, as long as you don't let your groupsize shrink to much during the out-of-combat-events and just gather all your characters in one place, you should be able to defeat most encounters with ease.Most of the time the combat just felt like it was getting in the way of the storyprogression though...So yeah, since I am someone who rather likes really complex turn based combat, I sadly can't recommend this game.

												I marched for days trying to reach my final quest however my journey was rather difficult as I had to decide the fate of my journey. I either starved my men to save a few people, or have them kill each other as I look the other way, or maybe we get destroyed as the enemy surround us...why did I volunteer to lead.The banner Saga is a interesting game to say the least. I found the story interesting and the combat rather enjoyable and fits the overall game. The story has you dealing with a rather difficult situation and to reach the end of your story you will have to make some hard choices some in which will effect your army either making your group weaker or even have different party members because of choices you make. ========The Good========1. Story - I enjoyed the story and found it interesting. I was always wanting to continue my journey to find out what happens. 2. Looks - The overall looks of the game seems perfect for it's story and gameplay. The art work and back drops have move the story along nicely.3. Gameplay - The gameplay may seem simple but at the same time it has you thinking about positions and the right units to counter the enemy units. Just remember one bad move could end up costing you...a lot.======The 50/50======1. Difficulty - I found the difficulty would spike randomly making some battles rather difficult or catching you extremely off guard. However with trial and error you will get through these situations and continue to progress through the story. =======Overall=======I found the game again, enjoyable and fun to experience. I recommend this game for both the story and overall stlye of the game. Just remember it can get tough and you will be faced with a lot of choices which the game pushes you to learn from these mistakes and adapt which is always great to have.			"

												The Banner Saga really impressed me for the majority of its duration. Great artwork, an interesting world inspired by Norse mythology, a interesting but sad story full of interesting characters and unique, enjoyable combat. I began to genuinely care about many of the characters, they are well written and some have distinctive personalities. You will often have to make walking-dead style decisions where you must weigh risk versus supplies, morale and your available fighting force. Later in the game some of the choices you must make are quite difficult and make the story feel like your own. The combat is turn-based, with you moving your selected squad members about using different abilities to damage enemy armor and health, which also serves as strength. Weakening armor allows you to do more damage to strength, while damaging their health/strength reduces the impact of enemy attacks. I found the combat difficulty to be well balanced if not a little bit easy for most of the game, I only failed a battle once but often I was down to my last guy when I won. Sadly things fall apart a bit near the end of the game. The story becomes a bit contrived with the introduction of a certain character, and the final battle is problematic. You are forced to use a specific character in this battle despite making a big choice regarding this character right near the end that in my mind should have left her out of the battle. I had not leveled this character up at all, she was weak and unhelpful in combat and this made the final encounter near impossible for me on the normal difficulty level. Apart from the last hour or so of this ten-hour game, I really enjoyed the Banner Saga and would put it on part with The Walking Dead in terms of story, characters and meaningful choices that have surprising results. one caveat is that there is no voice acting for most of the dialogue, so if you dislike reading you might not enjoy this game as much. I personally would take no voice acting over bad voice acting, but for some this might be a deal breaker.			"

												Be warned. This is not the cheap thrills and quick kills sort of game. This will not provide you with the 30min of immediate satisfaction that you crave before having to go out and do real things. A quick rush of points, colours and sparkly lights with no challenge this is not.This game is slow, deep, and full. And it is most incredible in all the ways that matter. The art style, inspired by artist and illustrator Eyvind Earle, sets this story that sings of a rich norse heritage into a truly magical setting. You command a caravan on two perspectives of this catycalismic event that is shaking the world; one, a ever-growing group of hungry refugees fleeing the oncoming horde of stone automatons, and two, the taskforce of horned giants that are marching to fight it. The characters fill this world with their own histories and personalities, they are fleshed out and become important to more than simple stats and combat ability. There are moments in the progression of the game that the player is required to make choices that will affect the caravan you have been tasked with managing and the direction of the playthrough. As a result of some of these choices, there were points that I cursed the screen in frustration as I tried to re-load a previous save point to try and save one or more characters from their inevitable demise, but fully knowing that it had been my leadership that had put them there.The combat can be at times frustrating, but there is always a way around - rethinking your strategy, utlizing different tactics or simply equiping various items on your characters. It is a thinking game, characters occupy tiles on the board that move, fight, or rest to regain ever-precious 'willpower' per turn. The larger and evidently more powerful pieces - as it effectively rounds down to a chess-like experience - take up more tiles, thus can be hit from more sides and rendered almost useless when kept out of range by being inadvertantly boxed in by allies. However, any foibles or griefs that I have with the combat and the brick wall that the final boss turns out to be are quickly dispelled by the compelling tale that is being woven in front of your eyes. Like any good story, I could not put it down - and after almost 17 straight hours, I am starving for more.I want to see where the people have gone as a result of me - what new adventures and tragedies await them, and how my people will fare with the prospect of doom in the coming darkness that is creeping ever forth, as told by a monstrous mountain splitting serpent.I love this game, and cannot reccomend it highly enough. If there are any talks of expansion or even a sequel, I will be there, waving my banner all the way.			"

												Wonderful game. It's a mixture of turn-based battles similar to X-com Enemy Unknown, management of caravan's morale and supplies, and text quests where you choose your answers trying to guess the consequences. The choice is usually between bad and worse which makes it even harder.The whole atmosphere in the game reminded of Game of Thrones universe. Your friends and you can die any minute, being in battle or because of hunger. Graphically the game is charming. It doesn't have CGI cutscenes, and it doesn't support DX11. But it all isn't necessary. The Banner saga has fantastic backgrounds which were drawn by hand, and all characters have their own peculiar features and details.At some point of your journey you make crucial decisions that shape your further trip, so the game has high replayability value. In my opinion, everyone who loves stories with important decisions to be made and exciting battles with various strategies should try this game. 10/10			"

												Not a turn based player. At all. So I will have to throw out there that I can't provide the most detailed review on the turn-based combat because I can't speak to what would be good or bad in comparison to other turn based strategy games. That being said, I enjoyed the game immensely without really enjoying the genre. The art style was what got me interested but it was the story that got me hooked. I really enjoyed the gameplay and the importance of the decision making throughout the game. It's not too challenging and at the easier difficulty levels, the game is pretty breezy to play through (almost too easy) if you just want to enjoy the art and music and just learn more about the characters and world.Whether you're a turn-based strategy player or not, you will find a lot to enjoy about the game and I'd certainly recommend it.

												This game is the most impressive, intriguing, challenging, entertaining, eye an ear pleasing that I ever played in last few years. It's like I’ve read an exciting book, watched a beautiful cartoon with awesome soundtrack and obviously played interesting challenging game. I rarely get impression this high from a game lastly, but this one is the massive exception. Actually, The Banner Saga: Factions initially got me in this awesome universe and gameplay style. I was not really into turn-based games or games with turn-based strategic combat style in particular until I met Factions. And I was blown away by what an awesome, challenging and entertaining gameplay guys from Stoic have created! After that The Banner Saga became the TOP 1 in my wish list. And eventually it surpassed all my expectations.GAMEPLAYThis game offers a mix of turn-based combats, text-based quests, interactive dialogs and management of caravan under your leadership. Battles are very challenging and entertaining. Using different types of units — Varl (unique race of horned giants) and humans of different classes — and combat formation you can build your own unique strategy for the upcoming battle. You can take up to six fighters and place them in a specific turn order. Since combats are turn-based, this part of preparation can be crucial. As well as combat formation, because battlefield split in cells and every unit in battle have its own range of movement and attack. Most units can attack foes standing only at nearby cells. So you probably would like to place your archers and other weak units behind your Varl and other strong fighters.Screenshot #1Ability to upgrade warriors' characteristics and unique special abilities for willpower (local currency, earned in battles) or increase with artifacts adds more variety to gameplay and tactics in battles. Upgrade points are limited and can be split between 5 characteristics and since you won’t be able to max all out you better use them wisely thinking of how you want to use this particular unit on the battlefield.Fight mechanic is mostly about unit's armor and strength. Strength is also a health and it makes the WHOLE DIFFERENCE! Once you lowered the enemy’s strength below your armor he gets less than 100% chance to hit you for strength! But he still can damage your armor. So your damage to the enemy is your strength minus enemy’s armor. Using willpower to add additional damage points or unit’s special ability adds some spice to the battle. And more often than not it’s crucial to use them. Ability to hit without a chance to miss or hit multiple adjacent enemies at once or command to specific ally to move on next turn etc. can help a lot, especially if you play on hard, like I did (except first 2 battles). There are A LOT more nuances and things to learn about this very thoughtful combat system. And the more you upgrade your warriors the more tactic opportunities you get. But two biggest advices are: 1) lower enemy’s armor and 2) don’t get hit first. If you like challenge and turn-based combats you’ll love this one.In ""text mode"" you talking with other persons, more often than not choosing what to say next, which will affect the following events. The most awesome thing in this part is that all of the choses are so not black and white – you can’t tell right away which of the options is right and which is wrong. It’s all about making hard decisions and facing its consequences later. Some consequences will appear almost a half game after, striking you hard and unexpectedly. But mostly through text (descriptions of events and conversations) you get a deep story of this world and characters you play, meet or interact with.THE STORYIt’s really hard to tell you how awesome the story is and avoid spoilers. Throughout the game you play as leaders of caravans of Varl and human who faced a new threat, bigger than ever before, and trying to save their lives. Most epic thing in this part is the originality of each character you play or get to know with through the whole journey. They all are very thoughtfully developed, each has its own temper and you know it already after a few lines of dialogs.The story progresses without any breaks and the lack of twists. Don’t expect that all your lead characters are untouchable. You’ll constantly face some events and situations where you need to make a choice. And almost every time it’ll be hard to determine the right way especially when there is no such thing. Sometimes you’ll need to make a choice that would be less painful than others, or you'll lose your men. And the game manages to involve you so deeply in its world and events that you sincerely regret about every number of lost men in your caravan! About lifeless numbers! And when this happen to the character whom you already know (but for like an hour or few at most) you really sympathize for him. But there are a lot of fun moments too. It has it all: hard moments and moments of peace and fun in between, the love, betrayal, conflicts inside groups and families, and some crazy things.The story is deep, entertaining and beautiful. I really think about it like a book inside the game. You definitely should experience it yourself!Screenshot #2VISUALS AND MUSICVisual part of the game is stunning! I won’t talk much about it, I’ll just say that sometimes I just couldn’t move my hand from PrintScreen key. I’ve captured 450+ screenshots! Almost each frame can be taken for wallpapers. The art is really beautiful and along with awesome stylish soundtrack it makes a great atmosphere in the game. The music is very original, stand out and fits the game naturally.THE VERDICT10 out of 10 and totally ""must have"" for everyone who loves challenging tactical turn-based gameplay, the deep, mature and interesting story alongside with stunning art and music. Do yourself a favor — buy this masterpiece!P.S. Stoic, thank you guys!			"

												I've been waiting for a game like this for a long time, banner saga offers a great singleplayer experience in a fantasy world on par with the elder scrolls and maybe even LOTR. The characters are each crafted as individuals with their own personalities and engaging backstories. The world itself has been crafted from the ground up with each river, road, forest and village having its own backstory as to why and what it is. I find the Banner Saga to be a refreshing game in the ever flowing torrent of♥♥♥♥♥♥releases we see in this day and age. 10/10 Would bang.			"

												People saying this game is too slow or boring are truly doing this game an injustice. The visuals and soundtrack are stunning on their own, and to be honest make this game worth it's retail price. On top of that, there is an amazing story that lies behind some choices that actually matter (unlike a lot of games with 'choice'; *cough cough* Mass Effect *cough cough*), and a battle system that is very robust and unique. I recommend this game to anyone with an attention span larger than 3 seconds and is willing to put thought into choices and combat, and enjoys an immersive norse experience.I do not recommend this game to people who need instant gratification every second of gameplay.

												Gorgeous, interesting game with poor combat design highlighted by a flawed final boss fight.Pros:Beautiful game - Art design, music, and style are all incredibleImmersive and unique storyCons:Poor combat - teams alternate turns regardless of how many combatants there are. The result is that a small crew of powerful characters is far stronger than a  full complement of soldiers. This flaw culminated in a final boss that was far more frustrating than challenging, to a degree that sucked most of the joy out of a game that is otherwise very impressive. I would highly recommend changing the difficulty to easy before the final boss fight. Although it flips the fight from exceptionally frustrating and difficult to laughably easy, you will enjoy the end of the story much more if you skip the pain.			"

												Let me say the art and general atmosphere of the game is inspired. That being said, mechanics-wise, this game is frustrating. I was really looking for a new-style Final Fantasy Tactics or Orge Battle game, so take that as you will. The choices you make seem to be arbitrarily punished and affect your team permanently. It doesn't feel like a trade-off of strategies, but rather like a guessing game. Given that this isn't a rogue-like, the lack of control this imparts makes that playing the game discouraging. What's the point of restarting? I personally don't like feeling like I lost my way through a game, even if I win in the end, especially if there isn't a way I feel I could have improved.But this is exactly the way I felt playing The Banner Saga so I can't really recommend the game.

												From the art design and concept point of view, this game is great.But for the gameplay and mechanic, this game is mediocre at best.Everything is a dice roll and that's bad. You spent a lot of renown for a couple of heroes, take them into battle, got them the last hits to gain levels, but then you make one conversational choice, unfortunately they don't agree with you, and they just left. That's it, they just LEFT your caravan and in one case one of them even killed 2 of your main heroes from the start, yes TWO heroes. There goes your Renown (main resource in this game) and time in battle. And now with your high level heroes gone, all you have is low level heroes to fight higher level enemies.Brilliant.... Just brilliant.Another cons :-Too much loading screen. -You can't equip or change items on your heroes if they are on the Promote status and you don't have enough Renown to Promote them.-You can't go to your heroes screen freely. You must Rest or you can gain access when you're about to enter a battle.-Maintaining high Morale is too hard because you must Rest for a couple of days, Rest consumes Supplies, and Supplies bought with Renown which is limited (especially when you took control of Rook).-The end battle is just silly. This game encourages you to be tactical from the beginning, but when it comes to the final battle, the game force you to engage the boss as fast as possible or you'll get overwhelmed.-Last one : the ending. If you're somewhat satisfied with this game, the ending will probably ruined it for you. Not gonna spoil everything but it will leave you feels empty and that the game is unfinished.6/10.			"

												After having completed this game I am changing my review. This game does have some of the best music I have ever heard in a game and also some extremely beautiful artwork. Some of the story parts offer a very engaging expereince however, this game is padded out with filler and is incomplete. the combat is dull and actually requires little to no strategy. the story ""ending"" happens after the death of a character that has a very convoluted backstory. the many names thrown at you are also very confusing to keep track of. I have no idea what happens to everyone else still iving in the end including the massive serpent creature....which seems to only have been relevent to end a battle sequence. your decicions have actually very little effect on anything and it is quite obvious that on several decisions the outcome would have been the same regardless of your choice. The ending sequence in particular was ridiculous by forcing you to include Allete a weak underleveled, useless, character that, thanks to the poor story telling, I couldn't care less about. This game is ovepriced and very unsatisfying in the end. unless you have actually beaten it; dont fool yourself. this game leaves much to be desired. Maybe if more than a handful of people worked on it or they had another few years and double the money things would be different but this games ambition is too great for its own good. there are so many pointless features like the map for example and I'm completely disenchated by this game now. I would definitely think twice before buying any product from this company again. They owe every person who purchased it the rest of their unfinished game.			"

												Banner Saga is a fairly basic tactics/strategy RPG with an equally basic FTL-style semi-random adventure filling in time between fights. You watch a cutscene where a bunch of surly-looking white people with consonant-heavy names like Hrthfalk or Vrmnyr glare at each other, then choose a dialogue option. Something will happen, then you'll be treated to a 15-60 second unskippable, unspeed-up-able clip of your caravan walking to the right. Then an event will happen, which will most likely lead to a fight. The combat is super simple and not really worth discussing; imagine Advance Wars with even less depth and breadth. Fighting and choosing dialogue options makes up 99% of your gameplay, and about 20% of your time spent on Banner Saga in total. Yes, there really is that much fluff.Much like FTL, the events that happen to your characters and the choices you're given are often obscure. A made-up example for the sake of avoiding spoilers: someone is coming over the hill. Do you kill them, or welcome them with open arms? Kind of a dumb question; you don't really know enough to make a good decision. Choosing either is ridiculous, yet Banner Saga forces you to make these sort of choices all the time.The advertising copy for Banner Saga touts its difficult choices, but the choices are ""difficult"" for all the wrong reasons. Normally, that would be annoying enough to cause me to stop playing, but the outcomes of the events didn't bother me. I'd gain a few supplies, or lose a few dozen men in my army, or in the worst case, an actual hero would die. But I have lots of heroes, and as for the army...The army you're given charge of does almost nothing in this game, and exists solely as a currency you can gain or lose via random events. Ditto with the supplies that they consume. They only effect they have on your actual fighting is a small increase or decrease to a single stat for your real characters during fights. The RPG-standards, Experience and Gold, have been combined into a single resource, Renown, that you must divide up as you see fit. You won't have enough to do everything; you're going to have to balance levelling up your heroes with purchasing army supplies and equippable trinkets. I think this is actually really well-designed and I liked it a lot, but it has one glaring flaw.Renown being so precious means that the Right Choice is almost always the one that leads to a fight. You get Renown not only for winning fights, but also for each individual kill. So the safest way to go through the game is to kill everything and everyone, every chance you get. This way you can keep a well-stocked army with lots of high-level heroes. It's pretty unintuitive, and also makes you fight a lot more times than the meager battle system can really be interesting for.I played this game a lot longer than I was expecting to. None of the systems by themselves are very good, and they don't really form a cohesive experience. I kept expecting something interesting to happen, but I just go more and more of the same. If you really, really like the art and story, maybe you can get through this, but I personally found both pretty mediocre. I give this game a 5/10 - it's not *bad* bad, but it's not really worth the time.			"

												Nice visuals, music, and story (bad script, though). Decent combat mechanics but very limited customizability. The major problem with The Banner Saga is that the bulk of the game is just a Viking themed Oregon Trail where ""decisions"" that you have to make have random unpredictable outcomes (including killing off major party members). This is very frustrating. The game also gives the illusion of an open world with a huge map, but you have almost no choice where to go. Would not recommend to anyone unless it was on sale.			"

												The Banner Saga is a brilliant turn-based strategy game with a unique and beautiful art style. The gameplay takes a little bit to get used to, but it's very satisfying. The animations in battle are smooth and the abilities suit the characters. The story grips you. You feel very much involved as you take on the role of a few characters and their decisions. Some decisions are incredibly hard to make, and you must face the consequences of them. Part of what makes the story so good is how well written the characters dialogue is and also the world's lore. There is a lot of detail and it really adds to the experience. I would highly recommend The Banner Saga to anyone who enjoys interactive stories and/or good turn-based strategy games.			"

												This game is amazing. Turn based strategy game wrapped up in a beuatiful story and gorgeous art style. The combat can go over your head a bit with its depth but you get the feel of it after a while. You can blast through this game in one - rather long - sitting but it is quality that you get your monies worth for. "

												When I first got this game, I was reminded of Fire Emblem's combat system crossed with a couple choices I thought had no impact on the game. I was wrong, and I am very happy about that.First off, the combat is reminiscent of Fire Emblem, but it is actually much deeper with the addition of the willpower mechanic, separate health bars for Strength and Armor, and several abilities. It takes only the tutorial to get used to the combat system, but I find myself 5 hours in and I still discover things I didn't know. There is also a sort of mass combat system, where you issue a command to the troops that follow you and then dive into combat. This mass combat system, however bare bones, feels like it belongs, although it could use some improving, because as far as I can tell there are only four commands.The story is great, and more then earns it's title as a saga. Despite being a dying world,  as the gods are all dead and the sun has stopped in the center of the sky , its people are alive and vibrant, struggling to survive on this barren world. It reminds me of the D&D setting Dark Sun, except there is still some hope left in the world, however flimsy. You grow attached to characters, mourning their failures and deaths and cheering when they do something cool. At least twice I have figuratively shot myself in the foot to save a character I cared about.The art is beautiful, and I'm honestly not sure it would work in any other style. The art is realistic enough to portray the humans as human, but stylized enough to make the varl, who are awesome horned giants, and the enemy Dredge, who appear to be some form of automaton, seem right at home in the world.And the lore, don't even get me started. I play a lot of Dungeons and Dragons (and other role-playing games), and normally play the role of the GM, which means I do a lot of world building. As such, I apprieciate it when a game puts effort into building an interesting world, and I can often kill hours just reading lore and pouring over in-game maps. Stoic has created an excellent world for this, and I have been specifically avoiding the map in The Banner Saga because I know if I don't, I will read every entry and spend two hours doing nothing important.However, this game is not without it's faults (although some of these ""faults"" may just be personal preference). First off, the game feels hard. It isn't, at least not on the difficulty I'm playing on, but it feels as if I'm doing everything wrong. Second, it is a very dense game. As much as I love it, I can only play for maybe an hour before my head starts to hurt and I have to shut it off. This is only a complaint in that I have to shut off the game, and it's a fantastic game.In short, if you want a game with a deep story, deep combat, and deeper lore, play the Banner Saga. If you want a game where you make decisions, play the Banner Saga. If you want a game where the entire world is putty in your hands, play something else, because the Banner Saga is harsh and unforgiving.			"

												What an amazing game.The script writing is brilliant.  They have created beleivable characters with distinguishable personalities that you actually care about.  The music is perfect for this game and helps build towards the overall atmosphere.  The one thing you can actually see before buying the game is the graphical style so make your own opinion on that bought i thought it is very original.The gameplay mechanics is split into several main bits.  1) the battles; 2) the travel sections between towns and 3) dialogue.1) the battle system is based on a chessboard style grid (areas are more streamlined compared with battlescenes in FF Tactics or vandal hearts).  In each battle you control up to 6 characters each eith their own strength, defence, willpower, shield break and strain stats as well as a unique speical abilility.  I won't go into the mechanics in detail  (as there are plenty of videos on this) but I will say that it is cleverly designed system which encourages tactical and strategic thinking; this is evidenced through certain battles which are seemingly impossible to win but when reattempted with a different strategy become a doddle.  Characters generate renown through battle and can be promoted for improved stats.2) the travel sections  between towns require a small amount of resource management as you need food and supplies to keep your caravan of followers alive.  Whilst on the road you will be faced with events and decisions to make.  The results of your decisions will have real consequences ranging from the loss/gain in supplies or morale to the death of main character.3) throughout the game there is a lot of dialogue.  I thought I class this as a separate gamplay mechanic in itself as it is a big part of the scene setting.  The diaglogue is genuinely interesting which makes it readable (I tend to skip of text in games these days but this wasn't a problem).The only downside is that the ending felt abrupt and I felt there was more to the story which went unexplained.  Sequel maybe?  I hope so...			"

												Beautiful. Challenging. And addicting.It's rare that a turn based game draws me like Banner Saga has.... But Banner Saga is different.  The difficulty level is the biggest pleasure to me.  This game is tough until you really learn the mechanics of battle.  There is tons of depth (skill points, equipment, different types of units) to keep you coming back for more.  Every decision you make (apparently) changes the story... I lost characters in the first 30 minutes that my friends finished the game with.I can't recommend Banner Saga enough.  Buy it, and buy it now!			"

												I honestly think this is the best strategy/RPG since The King of Dragon Pass. It's heart-wrenchingly beautiful, immersive and original. The soundtrack is epic and the story is so intriguing it's like a good book that you simply can't stop reading since you have no idea what might happen next. No character is safe.BE WARNED, THOUGH. The story cuts really short. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the end credits. Now I'm just waiting for the sequel with my fingers crossed. I must have more of this, I simply must.			"

												There's something about this game that I can't put my finger on. It might be the entracing music, the Disney quality hand-drawn art, or perhaps it's the fact that everytime I play this game it's always 30 minutes later than I expected it to be. The combat is simple, for the uninitiated. As you begin to dive into the character types, their respective special attacks, and equipable items, you'll soon realize that there is a depth to the combat that will keep you coming back. When the odds are seemingly against you, and you do in fact manage to reduce your foe to a single unit vs. one or more of your own, you will feel like a champion. A real champion.What has surprised me the most about The Banner Saga is the number of choices and chances the game allows. Every combat decision, every discussion, every step on the map brings consequences.I can't tell you whether or not you should buy The Banner Saga, but I can tell you that you would almost be a fool not to.

												Tactical Oregon Trail with Norse warriors and giants!+Atmosphere+Story and characters+Choice elements that can impact your party and caravan+Interesting classes, races, and abilities for tactical combat-Combat becomes repetetive-Game feels a bit long-Poor save system can result in replaying long battlesWhile not exactly bad, I have to say that the combat system, specifically the way turns are taken, is strange. The combat plays out in turns with one or your characters getting a turn and then one of the enemy characters. When you're evenly matched or even slightly out-numbered, this isn't noticable. It becomes noticable when you have 6 characters, the enemy has 3, and the enemy characters are getting 2 turns to your 1. This can actually be a huge advantage for the enemy.The way turns are taken, forces you to employ a tactic to maim the enemy but not kill them until almost all of them are maimed. The reason maiming is effective is because enemies with low health don't hit as hard. By leaving maimed enemies on the field, you're often ensuring the enemy turn is ineffective.The impact of low health on combat effectiveness is great. It brings a very interesting mechanic to the game. Unfortunately, you're forced to use it every single time you're in combat. The lack of choice in combat tactics is what makes the combat feel so repetetive, which is a same because the game is, otherwise, very enjoyable.			"

												I really like SRPGs and I had high hopes for this game. I was a Kickstarter backer at one of the mid tiers.It just isn't very good. The combat system is terrible and actually penalizes you for killing your enemies. Optimal strategy is to whittle enemies down to low str (because of the dumb hp=attack strength system) and make the weaker enemies waste enemy turns. It's unintuitive and unsatisfying.The battles all feel the same because the terain is all flat and boring. The game consists of terrible battles, boring watching your people walk animations, and cutscenes where you have to make decisions with no idea what the result will be. These are probably the worst and I quit the game after one of these random decision events killed off my most powerful character. That just isn't fun. This game just isn't fun. I give up. "

												If you had asked me 5 hours into this game if I enjoyed it, I would have said yes.   The art is beautiful, the combat is interesting when you first play with it, and the story feels epic.  But about 10 hours in (at the end of the game) there are so many flaws you had to endure that you will be yelling at the computer.  You are given really sparadoic choices in an Oregon trail like traveling sequence,  which can kill off main characters that you love. So you try to reload realizing that the game only saves at the beginning of major battles. Meaning if you ever want to redo a choice, you just wasted 30 minutes because you have to do it all over again.  It made me so jaded that I just moved through the game without caring what happened.  (I got the achievement for forced march without even trying.)  The story is very vague and frustrating.  No one knows what's happening, that is what you will hear for 90% of the game.  No battles are a challenge, except the final boss battle, which because manipulating turn order is such a slog, is ridiculously frustrating. Not difficult, just frustrating as you try to kill a boss that keeps regenerating it's life while killing your men.If you still want to buy this game even though the gameplay is so weak: Here's a spoiler free tip for combat: don't kill anyone.  Just weaken them to 1 str and then kill them all. You're welcome.			"

												The tactical, grid-based combat mechanic is done well. You have to take the time to think through your moves and watch the opponent's turns closely if you want to complete the game on a harder difficulty, but defeating the enemies without losing any of your characters is rewarding enough to do that. I, however, was personally looking for a more chill experience, so I played the game on easy and massively enjoyed it that way.The story was surprisingly deep and immersive, and I found myself really mulling over every decision the characters face. Also, the artwork in this game is beautiful. Overall, I enjoyed it a lot, but I don't have a strong urge to go back and play it again on a harder difficulty.			"

A bleak, beautiful & relentless indie with plenty going for it in the turn-based tactics department.The small developer Stoic has pleasantly surprised with how well things go together in their game, The Banner Saga.  Art, music & story combine to provide a haunting world that drew me in.  The combat mechanics are a genuinely fresh twist on turn-based tactics for me too.My expectations were entirely met given the information provided on the Steam store page.  What I enjoyed most: Lore and setting inspired by Viking mythology. A soundtrack I immediately wanted on my playlist. A great art style with plenty of 2.5D hand drawn stuff (apparently inspired by Eyvind Earle, an artist I was previously unfamiliar with). Story & characters that moved me in spite of how brief the game actually is. A unique combat mechanic that provided solid fun & challenge.The story successfully creates a serious feeling of relentlessness, thanks to the Dredge presence & the caravan mode.  The lore mostly is on the surface with no opportunity to delve deeper into any history or such, but what's there is fun.  Character interaction is engaging through the entire game.  One thing that I find very odd is that the writing & dialogue reads like a bad translation into English.  I can't see any reason why that should be the case.I like the combat a lot.  Two of the primary stats are Armor & Strength.  Strength doubles as both Hit Points & damage dealt with normal attacks.  Armor mitigates Strength damage, but can in turn be reduced by armor-break attacks.  This puts a nice spin on the conventional experience.  There are light RPG elements as well.  Kills grant ""Renown,"" a currency used either to level up heroes (boosting their special abilities along with one or two stats) or to purchase Supplies and/or items at markets.  You'll need Supplies to keep your caravan alive & fed as they journey across a land dotted with cities, ruins, forests & a lot of dangerous encounters.Player choice is encouraged in The Banner Saga & results in a variety of good or bad outcomes for your combat encounters, caravan or individual heroes.  Yes, a game in which story decisions actually can make things easier or harder!  Most of these choices seem straightforward, although one or two felt arbitrary to me, as if any choice would end up hurting somehow.  These tough moments are just part of the game & in my opinion amplify the tension, desperation & relentlessness that characterize the plot.Of three difficulties (Easy, Medium, Hard) I did a playthrough on Medium & managed to nab more than half of the achievements.  It's hard to keep your caravan's morale from dipping too low!  I gave up on Hard difficulty.  Medium provided significant challenge.  I certainly had moments of frustration retrying fights after defeat, but each time changing my tactics worked out fine.This is the first of a planned series and I eagerly await the next installment which will supposedly be available in 2015.  If you're a player like me who appreciates artsy indie games, I'd recommend this highly.  Also recommended for any player who enjoys turn-based strategy & RPGs. "

												I really like the concept of this game. Banner saga introduces several new genre elements:1) Your damage output depends on how much health you have2) Decisions you make between battles can be life and death for your characters3) Turn order changes based on the number of remaining characters on each sideI think 1 & 2 are really awesome, but 3 detracts from the experience for me. Instead of trying to kill your opponents, each battle is a struggle to keep as many enemies alive as possible, but with only 1 - 2 life remaining, so they can't do any damage. If you kill an opponent, then the remaining enemies move up in order (essentially getting more turns), which means if there is a powerful enemy in a battle, then by the end, they go every other turn. Enemies like Bellower that heal on their turn make this mechanic even more ridiculous.If they make a banner saga 2 or come out with additional content, I hope they consider using a standard turn mechanic, where killing an enemy is actually favorable. Also, the map gives the illusion that the game is an open world with lots of travel options, but you are given very few opportunities to make travel choices; I'd like to see more variety in travel.

												A really great narrative game. The combat is simple and interesting, but you may find it repetitive. The storytelling is excellent, I love the artistic style, it goes neatly with the music and even the story itself, curious a thing as that is to say. But really, the big draw is that you get given a lot of decisions to make. Some that seem small, some that *are* small, and some that seem, and are, huge. And they all have pretty significant implications for how your story will pan out. Better yet, the choices you have to make aren't just bland good guy/bad guy caricatures. They're genuinely tough decisions that simple morality can't always answer. Loved it. Loved my time playing it, will love playing it again some time in the future.			"

												""Only the sun has stopped. ""That is how it all starts. But you aren't some lone adventurer trying to make the world work right again. In this decidedly Norse-inspired story, you are merely a person with the mantels of leadership thrust upon you, even if you don't really want to be responsible for the hundreds of clansmen, fighters and varl that trail after your banner. But they are your people now, and as each day passes you begin to understand how every decision you make has a consequence-- and that sometimes, even if there really isn't a good decision to be had... you still have to choose.AESTHETICSThis game is beautiful.One of the reasons I fell in love with Banner Saga is for its visuals. Aside from the fact that almost each and every piece of screenshot is an elegant work of art, the overall sound and music provide the mood for a sombre yet fairytale-like journey. The UI and animation in-game are also beautiful to look at and harks back to a time when animation styles were traditional and organic. The characters are also very well designed, as was the overall lore that added a sense of depth and mystique without using the standard RPG fare. I wish they could have had more time for delving deeper or a longer plotline, because at times it felt as if some parts were intriguing but left untapped.NARRATIVEBut what made it even more beautiful was its ""weight"". This game is the great kind of narrative, and one that you can participate in. Although other games usually give users free reign over characters' choices and plot lines (choices are technically as simple) Banner Saga gives implicitly moral dilemmas and decisions where you aren't particularly certain of the outcome-- much like in real life. And like real life, some outcomes may be grave.BATTLE SYSTEMYou are in control of your battles. Although the battle system takes a bit of getting used to, it makes tactical warfare as engrossing with all unique abilities per character. They all play differently. This is especially interesting because you feel like you are fighting as individuals and not as a certain class type. I admit, there are points where the UI or gameplay mechanics can be improved (an undo walk button? a way to know spell range before moving?) and the standard tactics would really be to maim rather than kill, but I think that they balanced this splendidly enough because I was neither too disheartened nor did I find it too easy to use. Overall, my experience with Banner Saga was wonderful. I recommend it to people who love narratives, pretty art and vikings, to people who are insightful about leadership, who want to manage circumstance and to people who are interested in thinking through their battles. I recommend it to people who are open to the possibility of their hearts breaking, and to those who are willing to give it some 12-14 hours of love. I thoroughly enjoyed my journey. <3			"

												A beautiful game with a great story and a brilliant combat system.The graphics are beautiful, the scenery is absolutely amazing and the fluid animation is very well done. This game is forged by your choices... Every choice you make has its effects, making or breaking relationships, saving or sacrificing the lives of your caravan, finding or losing supplies and wealth. The combat is tactical and turned-based, (Similiar to games such as Disgaea, Final Fantasy Tactics, Suikoden etc.) but is unique to anything I've played before due to its Willpower system. Using your Willpower sparingly and at the right moment can really turn the battle in your favor. The music score is also brilliant, it's the icing on the cake.I don't want to spoil anything about the story, but I will say it's compelling, it really does leave you wanting more. Also, as the story is shaped by the choices you make, I'm sure it'll be a different experience the second time around.It's rare to see this type of game now'a'days, truly a hidden gem.			"

												Beautiful and grim. Fatalistic and daring. Everything from the characters, to your choices makes the Banner Saga an incredibly memorable experience. If you have ever enjoyed games like Shining Force, Ogre Battle, Guardian War, or Final Fantasy: Tactics this game is for you. A mesmerizing art style draws the player in and helps to make your choices (and their consequences) that much more painful. Combat is very satisfying and challenging. If you have ever enjoyed Norse mythology, the Poetic Edda, or Viking Metal then welcome aboard. This is not a cheery world, and the sense of lingering despair and hoplessness may be oppressive to some just looking for a simple teen hero saves the world story. Highly recommended.			"

												The art-style of the Banner Saga is absolutely amazing. The gameplay, unfortunately, is less so.For anyone looking for a deep story-based Choose Your Own Adventure, I would strongly recommend King Of Dragonpass instead. At least the first installment of the Banner Saga falls desperately short of this. There are some decisions to make, but they only have an impact on a few scenes wide and far between. Occassionally the loss or gain of a character indicates interesting opportunities, but these are sparse.I had a lot of fun playing the Banner Saga, even though the obvious lack of consequences to whatever I did along the road was highly disappointing in the end.Maybe - and I really hope so - there will be real story-changing consequences to my actions in the later parts of the Banner Saga.I recommend getting the game, but only if you've already done playing King of Dragonpass and itch for something similar if less sophisticated. The art-style and music make for a wonderful journey, though one that leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste.			"

												This is a beautiful turn-based-strategy RPG. I was really drawn to the cartoon-like aesthetic. Unfortunately, only the opening cinematic is fully animated, but the rest of the game is still beautiful. The setting is vaguely Scandinavian-ish fantasy, featuring men, Varl (a race of horned giants), and the Dredge (a race of stone creatures that are invading the land). It is the end of the world, with a unique apocalyptic fantasy feel.The game is a mix of tactical combat and leading your caravan by making lots of little decisions as you travel. Some decisions have big long term consequences, which is nice. Once I got into the game a few hours, I got invested in the few main characters' stories. I really enjoyed the game and found a couple moments emotionally touching.The combat mechanics are pretty gamey in some ways. You and the enemy alternate taking turns with a single fighter, even if you don't have the same number of fighters. Losing one of your characters effectively lets your other characters act more often. If either side loses all but one character, the game switches to ""pillage mode"", where all characters on one side get a turn before the single enemy does. It encourages you to keep some enemies weakened but alive until you can take out all the more powerful enemies.I switched between 'Normal' and 'Easy' periodically throughout the game. There's quite a big difference between them. The final battle, especially, I found impossibly difficult on normal, but unexpectedly easy on easy.Highly recommended if you like turn-based strategy and the cartoon-like visuals.			"

												An exciting game. Very enjoyable, given that you know what to expect.Gameplay: First thing to note - this isn't a traditional CRPG at all. No open world, no exploring, no looting random enemies etc. etc. Basically, the game consists of story given in textual form plus tactical battles. Surprisingly enough, this game is actually very much like a Japanese visual novel: making choices in dialogues with some fighting in between. Nothing wrong with that, but I guess there are people who dislike that kind of stuff.Combat system: The game has an original turn-based combat system which can be a bit confusing in the beginning, but is, in fact, very consistent and coherent. Fights are interesting and challenging - this game isn't easy at all at Normal difficulty (though it isn't exactly hard, the balance is just right). So that part of the game is very well-executed.Graphics: The artwork in the game is to die for! For me at least it was love at first sight. I actually find it quite difficult to stop pressing F12 all the time. Every single screenshot is a piece of art!Music: Good, adequate, though I'm not exactly willing to listen to that soundtrack when not in game. Which isn't a bad thing, there aren't that many game soundtracks that can stand on their own.Story: I'm not quite finished with it so it's a bit early to say, but so far - not bad at all. And I would definitely play again to see what different choices can lead to. All is well here. If it wasn't for one thing... which is in fact the only thing I didn't exactly like about the game ->Writing: This is the only thing I find somehow... lacking. Don't get me wrong, I like the plot, I like the characters. I don't like writing itself, because it lacks style, it lacks flavor. It wouldn't be such a big deal if this game wasn't at least 50% textual. I'm not saying that all the characters have to speak like they are in the poetic Edda, but all those ""ok"", ""crap"", ""yeah"" and ""everything was a mess""-sort of descriptions are not to my liking. And there are typos too. As a part of the game, it's not crucial, because there's also artwork and music and other things. But had this been a book... I'd probably deem it a poorly-written one.			"

												Okay, so the game's pretty as ♥♥♥♥ and has an amazing musical score that's dynamically implemented.  That's great and all, but I care about how a game PLAYS.  And to put that into perspective, we're going to have to get some♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the way right off the bat.This game is a step away from the ordinary.  Some people are going to be turned off by that.  In fact, some people will cry.Me?  I praise the sun.See, The Banner Saga isn't a game that holds you by the hand.  It informs you of things to a degree, drops a few hints in the narration and dialogue that you have to actively seek out, and then expects you to make an educated guess on how the world around you will react to your choices.  And trust me, it doesn't always react nicely.  You'll have party members smashed for doubting in your own abilities.  You'll have friends betray you because you stuck to your opinion just a little more than they'd like.  You'll get mad.Deal with it.One of the best things about this game is that it's about prediction and reaction.  You're always given enough to predict things well enough, if you see the subtle signs in front of you.  And whether you catch those signs properly or not, you'll be reacting to how things play out, so keep a cool head and salvage your situation the best way possible.  Ultimately, you can replay it again and try to not make the same mistakes you did the first time around.  See how it changes your story.  I can guarantee that there will still be surprises even your third time around.  Replay value is basically the name of the game.  It's long enough to be an adventure, but short enough to keep multiple plays from becoming tedious and grinding.  There's a lot of choice, big and small, and all of it will impact your story in a major way by the end.The combat, in a similar vein, is largely randomized encounters.  You can affect the difficulty of each war encounter by how you choose to approach it as well.  Rush in and take on the harder enemies to spare your army?  Take a cautious approach and let your army take the brunt of the forces so your own battles are less stressful?  There's a handful of possibile approaches that further alter your experience.  And don't let the simplicity of the combat statistics fool you, there's a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥to think about for every battle.For everyone who's had the opportunity to learn the battle system via multiplayer battles in Factions, it's second nature already, but for all newcomers...there's a lot of subtle things that matter in very major ways.  Positioning is key.  Killing vs crippling a target can vastly affect momentum swings.  Effective use of willpower can clutch out an entire battle.  Sometimes letting a few allies actually die is exactly what you need to do to win.  There's a lot of forethought that can be applied and number crunching is crucial.  Can it be brutal at times?  Absolutely.  But it's never unfair.So, let's sum this all up.  -Do you value transparency in choices?  -Do you like to know exactly what's going to happen before you do anything?-Do you usually follow a walkthrough when playing through a game for the first time?-Do you reload whenever a character permanently dies?-Do you get frustrated when you can't just kill everything in your way?Sorry, game's probably not your cup of tea.-Do you like thinking ahead to predict outcomes?-Do you like learning how to manipulate a system to your advantage?-Do you value strategy over action?-Do you like role playing and value decision making?-Are you capable of taking responsibility for poor choices?If these are the case, be prepared for an amazing experience you'll never forget.With that said, this game gets my full recommendation.  I also encourage anyone interested to give The Banner Saga: Factions a try first, since it's free and will let you experience the battle system to your heart's content.			"

												The Banner Saga excels at telling a story in a way most games do not. The clans in Banner Saga sew their history into the fabric of the banner they carry. As you lead your clan through trying times and your story is sewn into the banner, you can't help but feel you are apart of something bigger. As you play, you are swept up into a vivid and palpable world that becomes your own. If that's not enough for you, the game is also full of exquisite art, a beautiful soundtrack, and challenging turn-based combat. This game is excellent. 10 out of 10.			"

												I can't even be bothered to go into detailed analysis on why you should buy this game.This is the single most beautiful (drop-dead gorgeous/stunning/breathtaking/jawdropping/insert synonym here, all apply) and atmospheric game I've ever played in my LIFE, and I'll be upset (and maybe cry) if you think I'm exaggerating. I clicked ""Play"" not knowing what to expect, and then nearly played the whole thing through in one sitting, holding my breath through most of it. It's like popping on the first episode of some show and then screaming at your monitor for a week straight, with foam at your mouth, a la raving lunatic fanboy/girl mode, because it ended with a cliffhanger and you're craving for MORE, DAMMIT. As implied, this is, unfortunately, only the first part of the trilogy and the second part isn't going to be out till 2015. Again, DAMMIT.If I were to sum it up quickly, it's like XCOM meets Oregon Trail meets Dragon Age (I mean, this IS being made by three former BioWare guys), except you control a bunch of burly, manly, hairy Vikings. Most of the time.But let me warn you, if you're expecting some sort of deep and complex strategic gameplay, you might as well just turn around and go back to said XCOM. This game is HEAVILY story driven - there's no guarantee a character X will stay by your side till the very end, whether you want it or not. So please, please, just SHADDAP YO FACES and enjoy the story, granted there'll be more of it. Soon™.			"

												A good game but not for everyone especially twitchy youngsters. It have some downsides like a bit to linear and that a lot of the chooses that you make have bad results or really bad ones. May just be me choosing badly of course, second playthrough should shine some light on that.The story is excellent such good writing and really capture the feel of dread and fleeing for your life chased by an overwhelming enemy. There is some light points and some humour in there as well to balance that out. The artstyle is so beautiful and every frame is so well crafted. Combat is fun and interesting even if it took me some time to get used to it and understand it completely and all hail turnbased combat I missed you so. If I should bring something up that is kind of bad and that frustrated me a bit it's the resource part of the game and the severely limited quantity of it. Sure one could say it portrays the flight and scarcity of supplies for refugees in war time. But when you use the same resources to buy food and equipment as you use for levelling your fighters it get's a bit to much. If I had my way the levelling system should be separated with it's own points from the whole food and equipment currency. I had several fighters that could level up ones or twice even but no possibility to because I needed to buy food for my caravan. Could not buy items for them and even if I could they would have been to low level to use them.Over all though it is a good game and for me worth the money and I do hope to see more as it's set up for a sequel or another chapter or two. Well done, well done.			"

												The Banner Saga is Norse-themed, turn-based strategy game with a traveling system that seems like something of an homage to The Oregon Trail.  Though the story ends up being rather short (I completed my first playthrough in ten hours), it is very well done and kept me interested from start to finish.The experience and leveling system is unique and rewarding.  As you defeat enemies, win battles, and make choices during text-based events, you gain Renown, the currency used to purchase items, level up you heroes, and buy supplies.  On each level up, you can add two points to your hero's stats.  These stats include Armor (used to reduce incoming damage), Strength (used as both health and damage potential), Willpower (similar to stamina or mana in other games), Exertion (the amount of Willpower that can be used to boost movement or damage in a turn), and Break (used to reduce enemy armor).  Combat with these heroes is continually a balance between choosing to break enemy armor so that future attacks do more damage, or attacking to reduce health, which also reduces that targeted unit's damage potential by that amount.While traveling, your units will need supplies, which you purchase with Renown as well.  If you run out of supplies, the non-hero members of your caravan (Clansman, Fighters, Varl) will begin to starve and die off.  This will make enemy encounters far more challenging and dangerous.Finally, the text-based events of the game play a massive role throughout.  You will continually be cycling characters in and out of your party based on your decisions.  For example, it's possible to have a hero with you from start to finish, but it's also possible that you will get that same hero killed in the first event that they are involved in.  This, I found, is what truly made this game shine as a unique experience.I highly recommend this game to those who like tactical strategy games, Norse mythology, and deep storytelling. "

The unique art style looks like a hand drawn cartoon but it doesn’t take away from the gravity of the plot.  The game primarily consists of two sections, the caravan and the battlefield.  The caravan is the player’s home base and mode of transportation.  A fair amount of time is spent watching the caravan travel along a 2d map as you travel, you encounter bandits, disease, fire, and numerous other things that can help you or kill of members of your group.  Most of the plot unfolds here as well.  The game does a great job of depicting the hopelessness and fear of your characters, but it’s worth noting that there is virtually no voice acting.  Reading the script isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but keep in mind there is a lot of dialogue to get through and that means a lot of reading. So be prepared.The combat is reasonably deep and combining health and attack power into a single statistic makes for a unique experience.  Unfortunately there can be quite a lot of repetitiveness in the battles.  After the first chapter or two, all of the non plot related fights feel far too similar.  Add that to the fact that there is no height in the battle field and the fights start blurring together.The art style has a unique beauty, and the combat is fun, if repetitive. If are okay with, or enjoy reading dialogue and like tactical RPGs then pick up a copy.  If you are on the fence then spend some time with the free multiplayer version, The Banner Saga Factions.  That might be good enough.			"

												The Gods are Dead.The lands of The Banner Saga are desolate and barren, the sun hang motionless in the sky, men speak of the end of days as death marches from the north. Stoic has made a game that is just like the land it is based in, stark, cold and beautiful.That beauty is the very first thing you will see when you begin your march in the banner saga. Half the time I was playing The Banner Saga I could not believe what I was looking at, the hand drawn feel and look of classic Disney or the better bits of ‘80s animation.  The aesthetic plays into gameplay as well, with the banner over your party getting bigger as your caravan gets bigger and as you accomplish what you can along your very hard journey. Characters and character classes have distinct looks which helps keep the many characters straight and to pick out what type of enemy you were fighting.The only place that the art slightly falls down is in the arenas that you spend a good chunk of your time in over the course of the game. They are simple grids, sometimes in interesting locations, other times in just fields of snow. There is no topography to the maps, which is good for keeping battles from getting too complex, but doesn’t help with battle variety.Tactical RPG battles are only part of the experience, but are quite important to the experience as a whole. The system brings some interesting mechanics to the tRPG genre while dropping some others. The central mechanic is built around managing two stats on both friends and foe over the course of a battle, Armor and Strength. Strength is interesting in that, it is both your health and how hard a character can hit. The more damage done to a character the less damage they can deal. That is where armor becomes important, blocking damage to strength and allowing characters to stay in battle. Being smart with how you balance your approach to the many fights that the game puts in your path will make impossible seeming battles, just barely winnable. Unit selection also plays a major role in The Banner Saga with not just character class mattering, but also character race. The game has two playable races, humans and Varl. Varl are half man half animal giants that take up four squares on the battle grid instead of one, they hit harder, but are far less mobile. Humans are smaller and can take less hits, but can pester enemies and make it possible to chase certain types of enemies down.Unlike some other games in the genre such as XCOM The Banner Saga does not feature permadeath in battles, but instead characters can be lost in a much more interesting way, your choices outside of battle.Story in The Banner Saga is second only to its art. The story is told from multiple perspectives, as characters deal with a world descending into chaos as an old enemy “the Dredge” a race of obsidian creatures invades from the north. The perspective shifts between an Varl Army and refugees fleeing from the dredge. I loved the contrast of the campaign trail  of the well stocked army of Varl Warriors as it marches home with the prince of man to solidify a long held treaty. You are never short on supplies or warriors and, while a few characters can die, you will mostly be losing faceless stats of Varl and human warriors.In contrast Rook the main character of the refugee campaign, and the main focus of the games story, has a much harder story, that is also full of much more interesting choices. Every choice you make is a pyrrhic victory, either making life harder for yourself or the caravan. On the run from “the dredge” you never feel like you have enough supplies to make it to the next town, which may not even be there anymore, or may be hostile to outsiders. Choices made early in the story, may crop up later as double crosses and or loss of supplies or even characters that you have invested a lot of time and resources on.Almost not choices that you have to make as Rook are easy, even small choices may have big consequences.  Even the meta game choices when you stop in town may effect the over all game for you, for example: the main resource in the game is renown, you gain renown from battle and certain actions outside of battle. Renown is treated as both a currency and experience for your party members, leaving you with the choice of feeding your caravan, so that you have enough men to make it to the next town, or leveling up your party so that you have a chance of surviving the next encounter.  And the game is ready to knock you down emotionally Game of Thrones style by having smaller seeming choices cost you a fully leveled character, just remember, be careful of who you trust.Overall The Banner Saga is a beautiful game that has a few issues in gameplay, but most of that is  settled out by having some the most accessible gameplay in the genre. Its story is dark, and leaves you with choices that are as interesting and difficult as choice made in any game before. I want the next chapter and I want it now after the dark and stark ending of the first chapter of this saga. "

												The Banner Saga is a tale of struggle and survival where the world is believed to be coming to an end after the gods have died and the sun has stopped. This game personally was a great game to end the year.So the Banner Saga is a turn based stratergy RPG with choose your own adventure choices. The combat is engaging as it is important to know when to strike an enemy's health or to break their armor. The characters you travel with are interesting with their own views of the situation for the most part. A couple of your members only show up once or twice and never appear again which is a bit of a shame. The lore in this game is actually quite cool to read which you can when you view the map.Nobody can talk about the Banner Saga without mentioning the artstyle. It's amazing and is truely wonderful to see though most of the cutscenes are just still images and that was a missed opportunity however the music is just as good and can really help immerse yourself in the game.The Banner Saga is a worthy game to play with good combat, great story and amazing art and music. It is a 9/10 and if you like the game the sequal is coming out sometime this year.			"

												Just finished it. Has the best artwork, music, and one of the best stories of any game I have ever played. Everything you do is impactful and you really come to like/hate people and the situations you get into. I only got it cause it looked mildly interesting. I was unaware that it would affect me in such a way. It's in my top 5 games of all time now.			"

												I bought this game under the premise that I was getting an in depth tactics based games were your decisions affected the story and the world around you, what I got instead was a lazily made snoozer of a game, where your decisions really have no affect on the game other than screwing you out of some supplies now and then, or killing off one of your characters. The game had some novel elements so I will list some pros and cons. PROS:Bold artworkDecent soundtrack (pretty good, nothing amazing though)Voice acting, what little there was, was pretty good. Pretty interesting storyI'm sure there were some other things about the game I enjoyed but I can't remember them CONS: Let me get this right, I can either buy items and supplies OR level up my characters?? I'm sorry but that's just stupid. In game they talk about goods costing MONEY not ""Renown"". This was a pointless trade off. Absolute minimal itemization. If you somehow manage to have enough renown to buy items (you won't) you can buy some items that have basically no affect on the game whatsoever, only they have level requirements and if you're spending renown on items you probably won't have any left over to level your guys. Yep, pretty stupid. The laziness in which the character portraits and animations are made. The art was interesting, but come on, one stance and animation for the entire game? Sometimes they try to make it look like everyone is standing around talking to eachother, but   it just doesn't work. If you didn't want to spend time making mulitple animations just don't do them at all. Instead you're left with some half finished piece of garbage. I remember arriving a town and meeting some Varl and thinking hmm, this guy looks familiar! Oh wait, that's because he was a complete clone of another character I had except he was wearing red instead of green. Same face, same weapon, same hair, same beard, same facial animations, literally the exact same character except his tunic was red instead of green. Shameful. The utter lack of abilities and customization. Each character has one ability and most of them are worthless. No skill trees, no talents. You get to put in stat points, but they have a cap and there really is no room for creativity. No topography on the battlefield. Every map was exactly the same, a large square with no obstacles or cover. They had some  interesting artwork, but it was all just the same square. Viking oregon trail. You just walk and walk and walk and walk and walk. Sometimes you get a choice! The choice usually screws you over or has no affect. Oh man I remember a game screen pops up and it talks about 'warfare mode' or something. I'm thinking, yeah, I have like 800 guys under my command right now, this will be one hell of a battle! Then a menu pops up and you're given a few choices with accompanying text (which is always the same, ALWAYS). It had potential and then just layed an egg. It was just the same ol battle again. The interface was terrible. Equipping items was weird. The promotion screen has no way to be closed and you have to exit the entire screen to get it to go away. IN SUMMARY:I bought this game for full price not knowing it was a kickstarter game. I was pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and thought it was a waste of money. Then I found out it was a kickstarter game and I thought ""Ah, I'll cut them some slack"" and then I got really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when I say that they raised around 700% more money than they asked for. So let me get this right, you rake in all this cash and then you fart out this half finished pile of rubbish with character clones,♥♥♥♥♥♥interface, 1 dimensional story and utter lack of depth and you charge $24.99??? AND, the game is ~8 hours long! 8 hours! Oh they're going to split it into a trilogy so they can charge you again and again for their half finished games! Brilliant. Raise a bunch of money on kickstarter, keep all of it for yourselves and then drill your customers. I love the preview videos, they show all these animation cutscenes which look awesome and then you buy the game and there's like maybe 2 or 3 of them. Seriously don't get tricked into buying this piece of garbage by all the fanboys. This game is miserable.  "

												I cannot express how enthralled I am by this game. It's a mixture of organ trail and turn based RPGs. I've seen people complain about the amount of ""useless dialogue"" but I love the characters and the choices that create this beautiful and deep story. Immediately upon starting the game, you feel immersed in the world. Anything you want to learn more story about (such as the places on the map or the characters) you can! The combat is unique and enjoyable, and when you choose Easy difficulty, it is very easy. I actually changed it back to normal because it was to easy, and normal is just right for me. Wonderful for those that love a good story.			"

												Great game, highly recommended.+ Beautiful, hand drawn graphics+ Great soundtrack+ Atmosphere+ Challencing battles± Great story but it will continue in Banner Saga 2 (and probably in BS 3), so it ends bit abruptly.± Choices matter but not as much as i would like. Now you can get few characters killed by making bad choices and that's about it. You can still finish the game even if you get whole caravan starved to death.- Resource management. You get renown by winning battles and doing ""heroic deeds"", which is then divided between keeping your caravan alive, leveling heroes and buying items. In my first playthrough i made mistake by using too much renown on caravan and leveling wrong heroes, thus making end game too challencing.			"

												While I understand I'm going to be in the minority here, I found Banner Saga very frustrating to play through, and I essentially had to drag myself to the end of the game. There's a lot of cases of 'false choice' in which it seems like you're able to change the paths of the game but one choice just ends up losing you people or supplies. There are choices that you make and then will have negative consequences later (such as killing your fighters) and you don't have much of a way to envision what is coming along. It wasn't a matter of ""Oh I didn't treat my fighter properly so he left"", but ""This guy randomly killed my other fighters"". By the end of the game, any decision I had to make I was dreading because I knew that there was a right and a wrong way to proceed, and one would just end up with everything progressing that little bit worse.Overall, I simply didn't find the game that much fun. It was a study in dwindling resource management while trying to guess what decision the developers wanted you to take. After dragging myself to the conclusion of the story, I was left not feeling as though anything had properly wrapped up, but as though I had just seen some long-winded introduction to a 'great saga' that I have absolutely no interest in forcing on myself.

												Overall, the atmosphere, the setting, the story, the decisions, and becoming a leader of various groups at the beginning of a desperate, almost apocalyptic scenario makes this game very satisfying.  The music is fantastic, the relationships between the characters feel genuine and real, and while there isn't as much VA as expected, it works out for the best.  Granted, I haven't played that much but so far it's great.This was a drunken buy.  I was afraid I would regret it, but I don't.  It's very well done.  What I like about it is how the story progresses.  This is a survival story, the beginning of the apocalypse.  It's enjoyable because you become the leader of these various groups.  You can feel like you're really in charge of these lives through the dialogue.  The choices you make can really affect you.  ""Bah, I should have done that!"" ""Shew, I knew it was a good idea to send her there, that was a good decision!""  I made a decision to bring a boy into combat with us and he was awesome!  Really glad I did, but then a decision not ten minutes later took him from me.  That's where the one-save is nice.  If I had another save slot, I would have reloaded.  Your decision are set and stone and that's satisfying in and of itself.The combat is simple but it works well.  I like it and I like leveling up and taking care of my heroes.  It's a good system.At first I didn't like how there were so little voice-overs in the dialogue, but frankly, it's better this way.  I can read it a lot faster than anyone can speak it.  So, really, I'm glad there's not that much VO.  People complain about it, but it's better.  Same for the cutscenes.  I'd rather have dialogue than cutscenes.  The VA that is there is great, especially the ones where you're approaching a village or something like that.			"

												This game takes about 15 hours to complete, i was dissapointed that its not a ""full"" game, meaning it doesn't conclude the story.  I would have waited until all parts came out if i knew this.Incredible art and music, kinda boring characters, never really cared what happened to anyone.combat is weird, difficult.  its a deep combat system and makes sense, i just never really enjoyed it or felt like it ""clicked"".  I would have liked to have tried more of the available characters in combat but renown is so scarce that i didn't have enough to level nearly enough of my people.  The caravan part was fun at first but ultimately doesn't really have any bearing on the outcome of things as i suspected-just felt random, every choice a gamble..  at certain times youre rewarded for being trusting and generous and then later you're punished for doing so.  perhaps this is supposed to be realstic, but it doesn't give you a way to get better at making these decisions, so i just ended up loading save games and trying the different options.Weird game, like the story, feel like it wouldve been a better movie than game.Its decent overall, nothing groundbreaking though.  The reason im not recommending it is because its the first episode of a larger story and doesn't deliver on much of the story.  the dredge are fascinating but you learn very little about them.  id wait till it is finished and then pick it up.

												game has a good base, and i generally enjoy the art, and how you command an army on the move where you manage food (altho ive never run out) and various acts you have to make decisions like a choose your own adventure book.The things that bother me to no end are that the enemy gets as many turns as you do until hes down to his last guy, so if you have a large party, then the same 2 guys get to attack over and over again and will generally target the same character while your trying to move your other characters into position.Ive watched 2 enemies hack through 5-6 of my toughest and full health/armor characters like butter and i have no ability to stop this.  The enemies also all have higher level abilities then you and can really surprise you when they do tons of damage from a guy you have reduced down to almost nothing when your people become completely worthless and have to run away.basically i just cant help but always feeling like the computer ai cheats and wont let you walk away without a black eye.  The starting grids are also painful and you generally have to setup in a very specific way that is more of a headache to figure out then it should be and restricts you from options you would normally persue.Also you generally have very little information to make descisions and either have to make it blind or look up solutions which kinds of spoils things.Overall i really wanted to like this game, but it bothers me greatly and i can only play it in short spurts.  If it goes on sale for $5 or less id pick it up, but no more.			"

												While I do believe that developers were sincere in their attempt to create something new, i.e. a story-driven adventure with challenging tactical combat, I do have to say that at the end of the day this game is neither a good story, nor a good tb-rpg/tactical combat game. Moreover, YOU ARE NOT EVEN BEING SOLD ""THE WHOLE GAME""-THE END OF THIS GAME IS BARELY THE MIDDLE OF THE MAIN STORY. So, it's also a bunch of bad marketing thrown into the mix.While not a terrible game, THIS SHOULD NOT BE SOLD AT $25. Even if this game delivered a long, developed story akin to a fantasy book (which it does not both in the quality of its predictable plot and in its length), the price would still be too high. Considering that in order to truly finish the game you will have to buy a future expansion, THIS IS A BLATANT MONEYGRAB.If you are a story-lover, then Banner Saga is NOT for you. It has developmental depth of a comic book and dialogue is not necessarilly great either. This game to reading a good book is what Cheez Its are to a good meal. If you are looking for role-playing experience and to make impactful choices in a dynamic environment, then, again, this game is NOT for you. This game is a ride on a rail-road track, with events that force you to make decisions half the time without giving you enough feedback on the possible impact of those decisions. You will have to simply guess many times, and then the game would try to anticipate your choices by delivering cheap plot twists. It's quite silly. Moreover, after completing the game, it is easy to see that there is actually an optimal way to run through the story.If you are expecting a deep, addictive tactical combat game, then just go for the f2p BS: Factions. Vanilla BS only delivers many boring copy-paste fights against highly-generic AI enemies.Conclusion:Under the pretense that this game is an interactive story deeply affected by your choices and spiced up by some awesome tactical combat you are being sold an elaborate beautiful Flash game akin to the games from sites like Armorgames and Newgrounds. This product lacks in content, delivering only the first chapter of the story, without a definitive ending. That is a giant no-no and a red flag for any story-based game, considering the whopping price of $25. While a good buy at a price of, let's say, $10 (considering the de facto NECESSITY of expansion purchase), this is a lackluster buy at $25.			"

												It is very pretty, artwork is very nice, setting is interesting, with a lot of effort seemingly having gone into creating a fascinating backstory for the world. There are some moments in the story which will provoke an emotional reaction. Mostly ""noooo!"", it is a bleak tale of the apparent end of the world after all.However, it is short, I felt, for the price asked for. It is also apparently part 1, and part 2 and 3 are as yet, unfunded, according to the developers - they are waiting to see how well it sells before they can commit to making any more.The balance at the moment, is somewhat off, as relating to management of resources. This is supposed to be addressed soon in a patch though. I experienced a few game lockups, which were very, very frustrating due to how the game saves its state. Having to force-close the game and reload, meant having to redo an hour or more.I'm conflicted as to whether or not to recommend this. On the one hand, if I recommend it, then it raises the chances of the story being continued, and finding out what happens next. On the other hand, the length of the game, for the price asked, and some of the problems I encountered, and the prospect that parts 2 and 3 may never exist, means that I can't honestly recommend it at this time.Pros: Art is great, setting is interesting, story is involving.Cons: Short length, price, a few glitches, cliffhanger with uncertain prospect of resolution.

												This game steps out of the box and grabs hold of you, refusing to let go. Not because it is addictive in its mechanics, not because it has flashy AAA graphics, and not because of gratitious violence or other cheap thrills. Because it has soul, and plenty of it. Stoic dared to go their own way an create something that is not only beautiful, but also enthralling and evocative in its simplicity.The mechanics for individual parts of the game are not amazing: the caravan mechanic has been over-simplified and sometimes the dialogues feel a bit rushed. The combat is engaging and has strategic depth but has a tad too much repetition to it. Yet the combination of the different parts makes the game special. Together they create a feeling that sticks with you long after you have quit the game.The magic is created by a combination of stunningly beautiful visuals, a haunting soundtrack that adapts to the story and a feeling of doom and despair. Every choice you make ends up bad. Every decision causes suffering. There is no hope, there is no future. There is only The Banner Saga.			"

												I tried to like this game. I really did. The story is engaging, the visuals are great, and the soundtrack is a masterpiece. But the gameplay is nonexistent. The different take on turn-based combat was cool at first but quickly turned stale. None of your choices matter: you are always forced to take a certain path. There is no point in really trying to choose what to do with your reknown (the games currency); if you use it to level up a character, that character may die or leave and you have absolutely no control on whether or not this happens, if you use reknown to buy supplies, those supplies will be destroyed or stolen regardless of the choices you make. This ""game"" only gives you the illusion of choice and the battles are basically a minigame. The Banner Saga is a visual novel that pretends to be an RPG.			"

												For the first eight hours, I was very into the story and tolerated the frustrating combat system. However, reaching a climax point in the story trying to defeat a boss left me in a position of almost no chance of success. My characters were underleved and had worse stats then the enemies. I found that I was against a boss that insta-shot all my characters and regenerated HP as fast as I could damage him. I want to like this game, I really do. The story, dialogue, and the sense of urgency and danger is really well done in this game. But to me, the combat is so frustrating and feels like it works against you. Movement is extremely limited and makes no sense. If my archer moves 3 spaces when he can move 5, he CANNOT move 2 more spaces afterwards. Why? I don't know. Archer range is shorter than enemy movement range, meaning you need a protective wall for your archer or else he will get destroyed by melee. Abilities have no range indicator before you move, so if you move one space short of your special ability range, too bad you wasted your turn. If you are serious interested in this game, wait for a sale when it's 5 dollars or so.			"

I wasn't overly familiar with turn-based combat, but the in-game tutorial was very helpful and after I'd settled in it stopped feeling slow/clunky. I connected to the story, so much that I played it through twice in a few days.Can't wait to treat myself to the next one!			"

												One of the most compelling stories that I've ever experienced in a game. You aren't a group of badasses roaming around the country side giving a beatdown to nerdowells. You play a group of rag tag characters, trying to survive in a dying world. The decisions you have to make give a feeling that you're barely surviving, and sometimes are heartbreaking, or frustrating. But in the end, if they were anything else, they wouldn't be the Banner Saga.			"

												The best things about The Banner Saga in my opinion are the storyline and art style. Some people don't like the combat system as you alternate every turn but it does offer a unique tactical challenge I've not seen in other games, if you can get past that. I also quite like the challenge of the renown system. You have a finite amount, so do you level up your heroes, get items, or buy supplies? Later in the game you can usually only choose one, so choose wisely.One misconception I had before buying the game was that your heroes could be killed in combat. Actually, the only way you lose them is by making the wrong decisions along your journey. That system is another aspect I enjoy about the game, even when you get it wrong (as you most likely will quite often.) Bottom line, would buy again.			"

												I'm no good at writing reviews, but I can put down a few reasons as to why I thought the game was spectacular and deserves a sequel. 1 - Excellent and unique art!2 - A progressing story with tons of potential!3 - A complex and yet satisfying combat system!4 - Morals and Ethics, and the consequences of your decisions. 5 - Character development.6 - And not to mention an awesome soundtrack!All in all though, the game was a bit shorter than I expected, but each moment ingame I thought was well used. If they come out with A Banner Saga 2 I wonder how well they will treat your files history with the events of the new game(like how bioware games are affected by previous decisions).			"

												The Banner Saga is a beautiful, stunning turn based strategy game with it's own mythology, set in a world of Varl (horned giants) and men. The gods are dead. The sun unresting in the sky. In this game you follow two groups. One is the group of Hakon, a leader of the Varl, still kind of uneasy in the role of leader. He has to get along with Ludin, the prince of men, and his bodyguards and entourage.The other group is lead by Rook, a hunter from Skogr. He is together with Iver, a varl he has known for a while, his daughter Alette, Egil, archer Oddleif and all of his clansmen.Along the way you can gather people to join your caravan as you travel the world, fleeing for the Dredge, stone creatures. Fighting them almost becomes monotone, as there aren't a lot of other enemies in the game, except for some enemy humans and varl. But the game makes up for that by fitting it perfectly in the story.The other thing that helps making this game not so monotone is that the special events (raids, attacks, fighting families, hunger, theft, curious characters, etc.) are sometimes random and don't appear in a certain order. You have to think wise though if you want to let certain people in or out of your caravan, as your actions can have heavy consequences.Sometimes, parts of the game seem a little buggy (losing people due to hunger while you aren't skipping a day for example).It takes a while to really understand the dynamics in fighting. I was a bit confused by how willpower and renown works, so my advice to players is to really read into it while the game explains and train with your character for practice-battles, or fighting enemies becomes frustrating and confusing. I almost finished my first playthrough and I'm very surprised. Definetely going to replay the game, as certain decisions seem to have a huge impact. What a worth for my money! I've fallen in love with the characters and can't wait for the next parts.			"

												Before I launch into my review, I highly recommend looking at a gameplay video to decide if you're really interested as this game is not going to be for everyone. This game is heavily story driven with a nice smattering of choice & consequence and turn based combat. While the story is fairly linear, you will end up in the same place no matter what, who is still alive when you get there will vary wildly from person to person. The game is built on the concept of an apocolypse and the developers had no problems bringing the harsh choices such an event would bring. The game gives a good frame work of the events and then allows the player to tailor how their individual journey plays out. Major plot points will be the same but the pieces that will in the blanks will be customized, and are often memoriable.Cons: Some people don't like cartoony art (I think it's beautiful in this game). There is no save system, it autosaves but it saves multiple copies so it's easy to backtrack. The combat is far inferior to the Banner Saga Factions and not just because it's next to impossible to create an AI on the level of a human. In Factions, every unit has a special ability making positioning and targeting key to success. In Banner Saga, a fair amount of enemies have no special moves, even into late game, erroding some of the tactical depth. This is further compounded by the lack of enemy types. The game is also very short (took me 8 hours), if you don't replay games often this might be a big deal to you. There's also a lack of exploration due to the onrails nature of the story. And finally, RPS has said they found the story hard to follow early on. They don't give you all the details about why what's happening is happening until later but, I never understood where this confusion comes from but feel it's probably worth mentioning.			"

												Do I recommend this game? YES, a thousand times yes.  Firstly, it's gorgeous. The art and the style are perfect.I loved the characters, even the ones that confused me didn't feel out of place or pointless.Gameplay is good, I like that I can relax a bit and enjoy the scenery sometimes. I wasn't overly familiar with turn-based combat, but the in-game tutorial was very helpful and after I'd settled in it stopped feeling slow/clunky. I connected to the story, so much that I played it through twice in a few days.Can't wait to treat myself to the next one!			"

												If you find hours of text-reading boring, this game is not for you however if you are a text based RPG and a TRPG lover, you are going to spend your time loving this game. The Banner Saga is an epic tale with male and female heroic characters based on Viking themes and Nordic mythology where your choices affect the course of events in the story so you have to make those choices carefully. You are going to choose your combat group, add skill booster items to your characters, add travellers/clansmen/warriors/varls to your caravan, control the food supply while travelling in harsh conditions, balance the morale of the people, etc. Briefly, you are going to learn how to be a leader in difficult times. (if you practice your play in normal mode first, it's likely for you to win the combats in hard mode later)Dialogue parts are simple, where you only see a brief animation of the active character however the simplicity doesn't lower the quality of the game, vice versa, every visual part of this 2D game are done by hand and Arnie Jorgensen achieved a great job on illustrating the beautiful characters and the setting. The music is totally enchanting. The fully orchestrated score was written by Austin Wintory, the composer of the soundtrack of Journey. It features Malukah, Peter Hollens, Johann Sigurdarson and Taylor Davis as soloists. You can buy the soundtrack as an extra.I always support the idea of donating money to indie game companies for their basic necessities and buying a legit copy of the game however the only part I dislike about The Banner Saga is the price of 25$ which I find too much.

												With visuals like these, does anything else really matter? Every screen of the game, be it the VN-style dialogues, the travelling, or the fights, look absolutely gorgeous. The Banner Saga is worth buying for them alone.On the other hand, one thing I didn't care for at all were the cheesy and over-the-top voiceovers, especially Rook's. Thankfully though, they are scarce.The fighting system is simple but effective, with a million different classes that beg to be explored and combined. Moreover, the fights mostly follow the story, so they don't become grindy; the moment you get used to your party, it splits, or the story focus shifts, or something else happens to add new conditions and spice up the formula. For these reasons, fighting never becomed boring.The fights also have little to no RNG, which is nicely balanced by the main part of the game being RNG-heavy. Your caravan travels across the map, encountering different events and conflicts that you are invited to resolve, but you're not expected to know which choice will lead to the most positive outcome. It boils down to guesswork—which is, like I said, compensated with the fights themselves being non-RNG-reliant.The story is nothing to write home about. It's rather generic low fantasy, which would be fine and dandy, if not for the fact that so much of the game is just a VN retelling said story. On the upside, it's unusual in that you're playing not a brave hero, but the leader of a fleeing group of people. On the downside, the ""there is a Darkness spreading"" plot premise is as lame as you can find in games. Another thing to note is that while the story is self-contained, it's not even remotely satisfying, since this is only part one, so in the end you beat a boss, but learn nothing of the events unfolding.Oddly enough, despite all the shortcomings of the story, the game is very fun to play. It's very well-paced, switching between its various types of gameplay as it goes, always throwing something different at you. The combat is challenging enough to be fun. The main character is actually charismatic for the whole low-key thing. And the visuals are incredible.			"

												Today I finished The Banner Saga, and after reading many reviews, I have some responses and things I liked about the game.Response to its ""unfairness"": that is the point of the game, that thousands of people are dying and it's going to be a bit unfair. I can understand being angry at that, but that's the direction the developers wanted to go into. The battle system is interesting, with two primary stats: Strength, and Armor. Damage = Attacking Strength - Defending Armor. Low armor/health allies usually are backed up with a bow or special abilities which are very helpful in the late game; being able to have full health and deal full damage in late-battle is a godsend. You can pick any ally you want to go into battle, with a cap, and what order they go in. If your enemies have less people than you, they are given a slight advantage because the order goes you-them-you-them. When you have 1 opponent left it goes into pillage mode, which essentially means that unless the last opponent is very strong the game will end. The story, with which I was most impressed, made me forget about anything else I didn't like. It was dark, depressing, and basically the Oregon trail with Vikings. Between story and fighting was traveling, where you had to balance supplies and leveling up your characters, as well as making decisions which could easily kill off characters (sometimes ""unfairly"", as I said above, sometime not - like if you decide to take up a dangerous thief in disguise). The animation is rather static with beautiful elements and scenery. I would pay thrice this game's value for an art collection of this game. Overall, good 7-8 hour experience, and I would recommend it to people. who are looking for a slow-paced game with a heavy story-driven experience. This game isn't really for everyone, but it is a unique game.			"

												The game is great! Very interesting storyline that pulls you right in! Honestly i didn't think i'd enjoy reading instead of watching scenes and listening to the speeches but that actually made me feel like i'm really involved in it. Played it on normal and it was quite challenging at some points, supplies were becoming more scarce towards the end of the game, lost quite a few characters throughtout the play due to choosing the outcome really wanted to go back to last save but it only lets you go so far so i stick to the idea that it is right to just move on and suffer the consequences, seemed very natural that way and i liked it! Only the last fight was hard on normal and i wanted to see the ending so i switched difficulty to easy, will definately play it all over on hard. It does seem to have many choices you make throughout the game and even the small one have effect. Several things did not really make sense, you lose so many landsman, fighters and varl if you travel without resources, and in the end you finish with however many of those left but does it make any difference with how many you finish it? Made no sense to me, but i havent serched for the answer either so maybe it does have some kind of effect. In my point of view game does have minor flaws as i would call them but those are not vital at all. Definately worth getting! Looking forward to continuation of the story!			"

												My band trudged through the snow, our Banner, bearing the history of our clan, flapped in the wind.Behind, a famously fearsome Dredge pursued us, and ahead their hordes raided and burnt towns. Our supplies dwindled and we became desperate. Still the ever-present threat of the Dredge hounded us. Conflicts broke out among the clansmen – both petty fights and terrible betrayals. Every encounter with the Dredge dropped the number of fighters piteously low and we then ran out of supplies. Clansman began to starve. I ordered them to rob an innocent farmer. My daughter judged me for the decision. At last, we arrived at a village. We were low on renown, with which to buy supplies, but perhaps with just a few days worth we could… the town was burned. There was nothing to buy.Read More...http://thegamespusher.com/2014/01/17/the-banner-saga-when-ragtag-means-something "

												So i bought this game on the spot simply because I saw the first 30 seconds of the trailer.  I promptly spent my homework time playing this game....and dinner...and well, 7 hours later I beat the game.  I really liked the flow of the game and the consequences of your choice.  So i decided to play it again, but make new choices.  The conversations didn't really change, but the results of my choices did.I enjoyed the intro movie and thought a lot of the game would have the same animation cut scenes, but they didn't. That i found to be a let down.  The music however was always spot on, which definitely added to the gameplay.There are parts that I may be missing, but some of the storyline hasn't been developed once introduced.  It may be because of my choices throught out the game, but huge chunks of potential story are just not there. I want to know what this ""darkness"" is, or wtf that snake has to do with anything.  Overall I liked the game due to the asthetics, and the Oregon trail feel of the game.  But some parts just fall short, mainly ending being so linear, especially after a variety of random encounters that require a diversity of choices.			"

												I found this game to be very enjoyable. Stunning visuals and design combined with good characters and compelling story full of tough choice made this one of my favorite indie releases in a while. Combat is also fun, although visuals and dialogues were definitely my favorite aspects.			"

												The game is great! Very interesting storyline that pulls you right in! Honestly i didn't think i'd enjoy reading instead of watching scenes and listening to the speeches but that actually made me feel like i'm really involved in it. Played it on normal and it was quite challenging at some points, supplies were becoming more scarce towards the end of the game, lost quite a few characters throughtout the play due to choosing the outcome really wanted to go back to last save but it only lets you go so far so i stick to the idea that it is right to just move on and suffer the consequences, seemed very natural that way and i liked it! Only the last fight was hard on normal and i wanted to see the ending so i switched difficulty to easy, will definately play it all over on hard. It does seem to have many choices you make throughout the game and even the small one have effect. Several things did not really make sense, you lose so many landsman, fighters and varl if you travel without resources, and in the end you finish with however many of those left but does it make any difference with how many you finish it? Made no sense to me, but i havent serched for the answer either so maybe it does have some kind of effect. In my point of view game does have minor flaws as i would call them but those are not vital at all. Definately worth getting! Looking forward to continuation of the story!			"

												My band trudged through the snow, our Banner, bearing the history of our clan, flapped in the wind.Behind, a famously fearsome Dredge pursued us, and ahead their hordes raided and burnt towns. Our supplies dwindled and we became desperate. Still the ever-present threat of the Dredge hounded us. Conflicts broke out among the clansmen – both petty fights and terrible betrayals. Every encounter with the Dredge dropped the number of fighters piteously low and we then ran out of supplies. Clansman began to starve. I ordered them to rob an innocent farmer. My daughter judged me for the decision. At last, we arrived at a village. We were low on renown, with which to buy supplies, but perhaps with just a few days worth we could… the town was burned. There was nothing to buy.Read More...http://thegamespusher.com/2014/01/17/the-banner-saga-when-ragtag-means-something "

												So i bought this game on the spot simply because I saw the first 30 seconds of the trailer.  I promptly spent my homework time playing this game....and dinner...and well, 7 hours later I beat the game.  I really liked the flow of the game and the consequences of your choice.  So i decided to play it again, but make new choices.  The conversations didn't really change, but the results of my choices did.I enjoyed the intro movie and thought a lot of the game would have the same animation cut scenes, but they didn't. That i found to be a let down.  The music however was always spot on, which definitely added to the gameplay.There are parts that I may be missing, but some of the storyline hasn't been developed once introduced.  It may be because of my choices throught out the game, but huge chunks of potential story are just not there. I want to know what this ""darkness"" is, or wtf that snake has to do with anything.  Overall I liked the game due to the asthetics, and the Oregon trail feel of the game.  But some parts just fall short, mainly ending being so linear, especially after a variety of random encounters that require a diversity of choices.			"

The story and atmosphere of the game kept me intrigued to keep going. The battles may not be as deep as something like Final Fantasy Tactics, but with some unique gameplay systems, the game kept me entertained.			"

												The Banner Saga is a beautiful, stunning turn based strategy game with it's own mythology, set in a world of Varl (horned giants) and men. The gods are dead. The sun unresting in the sky. In this game you follow two groups. One is the group of Hakon, a leader of the Varl, still kind of uneasy in the role of leader. He has to get along with Ludin, the prince of men, and his bodyguards and entourage.The other group is lead by Rook, a hunter from Skogr. He is together with Iver, a varl he has known for a while, his daughter Alette, Egil, archer Oddleif and all of his clansmen.Along the way you can gather people to join your caravan as you travel the world, fleeing for the Dredge, stone creatures. Fighting them almost becomes monotone, as there aren't a lot of other enemies in the game, except for some enemy humans and varl. But the game makes up for that by fitting it perfectly in the story.The other thing that helps making this game not so monotone is that the special events (raids, attacks, fighting families, hunger, theft, curious characters, etc.) are sometimes random and don't appear in a certain order. You have to think wise though if you want to let certain people in or out of your caravan, as your actions can have heavy consequences.Sometimes, parts of the game seem a little buggy (losing people due to hunger while you aren't skipping a day for example).It takes a while to really understand the dynamics in fighting. I was a bit confused by how willpower and renown works, so my advice to players is to really read into it while the game explains and train with your character for practice-battles, or fighting enemies becomes frustrating and confusing. I almost finished my first playthrough and I'm very surprised. Definetely going to replay the game, as certain decisions seem to have a huge impact. What a worth for my money! I've fallen in love with the characters and can't wait for the next parts.			"

The art and the style are perfect.I loved the characters, even the ones that confused me didn't feel out of place or pointless.Gameplay is good, I like that I can relax a bit and enjoy the scenery sometimes. I wasn't overly familiar with turn-based combat, but the in-game tutorial was very helpful and after I'd settled in it stopped feeling slow/clunky. I connected to the story, so much that I played it through twice in a few days.Can't wait to treat myself to the next one!			"

												Before I launch into my review, I highly recommend looking at a gameplay video to decide if you're really interested as this game is not going to be for everyone. This game is heavily story driven with a nice smattering of choice & consequence and turn based combat. While the story is fairly linear, you will end up in the same place no matter what, who is still alive when you get there will vary wildly from person to person. The game is built on the concept of an apocolypse and the developers had no problems bringing the harsh choices such an event would bring. The game gives a good frame work of the events and then allows the player to tailor how their individual journey plays out. Major plot points will be the same but the pieces that will in the blanks will be customized, and are often memoriable.Cons: Some people don't like cartoony art (I think it's beautiful in this game). There is no save system, it autosaves but it saves multiple copies so it's easy to backtrack. The combat is far inferior to the Banner Saga Factions and not just because it's next to impossible to create an AI on the level of a human. In Factions, every unit has a special ability making positioning and targeting key to success. In Banner Saga, a fair amount of enemies have no special moves, even into late game, erroding some of the tactical depth. This is further compounded by the lack of enemy types. The game is also very short (took me 8 hours), if you don't replay games often this might be a big deal to you. There's also a lack of exploration due to the onrails nature of the story. And finally, RPS has said they found the story hard to follow early on. They don't give you all the details about why what's happening is happening until later but, I never understood where this confusion comes from but feel it's probably worth mentioning.			"

												If you find hours of text-reading boring, this game is not for you however if you are a text based RPG and a TRPG lover, you are going to spend your time loving this game. The Banner Saga is an epic tale with male and female heroic characters based on Viking themes and Nordic mythology where your choices affect the course of events in the story so you have to make those choices carefully. You are going to choose your combat group, add skill booster items to your characters, add travellers/clansmen/warriors/varls to your caravan, control the food supply while travelling in harsh conditions, balance the morale of the people, etc. Briefly, you are going to learn how to be a leader in difficult times. (if you practice your play in normal mode first, it's likely for you to win the combats in hard mode later)Dialogue parts are simple, where you only see a brief animation of the active character however the simplicity doesn't lower the quality of the game, vice versa, every visual part of this 2D game are done by hand and Arnie Jorgensen achieved a great job on illustrating the beautiful characters and the setting. The music is totally enchanting. The fully orchestrated score was written by Austin Wintory, the composer of the soundtrack of Journey. It features Malukah, Peter Hollens, Johann Sigurdarson and Taylor Davis as soloists. You can buy the soundtrack as an extra.I always support the idea of donating money to indie game companies for their basic necessities and buying a legit copy of the game however the only part I dislike about The Banner Saga is the price of 25$ which I find too much.

If they come out with A Banner Saga 2 I wonder how well they will treat your files history with the events of the new game(like how bioware games are affected by previous decisions).			"

This is by no means a negative towards the game as Banner Saga mixes these elements superbly.The art style and music are beautiful and the story! Dark, gritty, mature and wonderful.

												This game is amazing. For many months I had seen this on Steam and thought ""It can't be that good, not worth my money"" but my god how wrong was I. This game is filled with beautiful animations for combat, thrilling and amazingly written story and realistic characters.The game has very rich lore that unfolds without you needing to collect secrets or some kind of optional trophy. The Banner Saga combines turn-based strategy with decision making, party management and army management, where you lead a warband in a struggle to find food and combat with the threat of bandits, weather and shadey characters along the way in a truely epic journey.The story itself throws you straight into the sad world of The Banner Saga and only builds up to a more sad and intense tale. The art style is unique and creates a world that really comes to life.In this review I feel I still didn't give it enough justice, just please buy this game because I feel everyone needs to experience their own story in the game, something that Telltale didn't manage to capture.

												Banner saga is a epic story set in a fantasy nordic-like world. It has RPG/tactical gameplay and a bit of resources management. But let`s go to the pros and cons.Pros:The story of this game is great, it has a depressive / end of the world mood that is rare to be seen. The soudtrack is outstanding, it fits greatly with the game helping creating the right sensations at the right moments.The artistic style is inovative and very beautifullThe choice making is good and make the game shape itself as you play it. It adds replay value and great a better bond between player and game.Cons: The game is kind of easy (played on medium)I feel the tactical mechanics and characters leveling could be more explored.  The story while it`s good doens`t fill complete, there are some things that will only be revealed on the second game (I hope).			"

												I am going to start off with a (kinda) spoiler and and the real kick in the teeth that comes with it before I lead up to a very positive review. In my opinion and in the opinions of at least a few hundred others the biggest problem with this game is THE ENDING....I can't decide whether to call it non-existent, unfinished or incredibly poorly executed. This game is 1 out of 3 in a planned trilogy by the way. This is something I was not aware of a when I initially purchased the game. There you are prepared now on the good...Now please bear in mind I do not think I would be nearly as bitter about the ending if the the rest of the game had not hit on so many levels. Initially I thought the combat in the game was based on too simple of a concept but after an hour of play I realized in execution there is a great deal of depth. The simple concept by the way is that of combining atack power and life into one stat for your characters. It really flips the whole concept behind a tactically rpg on its tail and made me think through every battle (and paiiiinfully so on the Hardest Setting). While the RPG style Character Progression of your characters are an Important aspect of gameplay I was pleased to find that the actually Tactical aspects of the game are firmly in the driver seat. To me this is the highlight and the reason any fan of the genre should take the opportunity to download this game (I admit waiting for a sale myself but I would not have been disappointed if I had paid the $19.99 it's currently listed at either).The story and experience itself is very dark one. It was clearly intended and I feel like the developers hit the nail on the head when it came to using every method and mechanic availalbe to them to create that atmosphere. Your watching this World Tear itself apart while the characters fight to hold it together. The animations, story, music, the gameplay all are all geared up to make you feel that way and were a resounding success.The complete butchering of the end of the game really hurt and pulled down the review a notch but overall the hours (and i have far more than 10.2 that steam has me at for some reason) of greatness vastly overshadow the final few moments and bad taste I had after finishing the game for the 1st time. This game is refreshingly different from anything I have played before and would recommend it to just about anyone intersted in this genre.8/10			"

												We’ve seen the world coming to an end many times now. Oftentimes it’s used as a meaningless crutch in order to get things going, to have an artificial reason as to why you have to kill a bunch of enemies. But there are stories that make the end of the world compelling yet again. Because there is something inexplicably fascinating about such a cataclysmic event. The Banner Saga makes the case for the latter. It creates an apocalyptic scenario and thrusts you directly into it. And it’s utterly brutal and unapologetic about it. Your actions have the power to save lives. More often than not, things will go wrong. People will die and the world may yet end no matter what you do. It’s a bleak proposition and yet so incredibly motivating.The Banner Saga is based on Viking mythology and takes place across a vast Nordic land inhabited by humans and varl. The varl are horned, giant-like creatures that were created by the gods. Humans and varl were bitter enemies for ages until the gods grew tired of it and created the dredge, monolithic stone creatures that have a particular thirst for destruction. The two warring races had to unite and push back the dredge into the far reaches of the northernmost wastes. A tenuous peace has lasted since. But the dredge are back in greater numbers than ever and they are mowing down everything and everyone in their path. But the real problem is – the dredge are on the move because they are fleeing an unknown darkness intent on engulfing the entire world. The lore isn’t particularly original or elaborate, but it is really intriguing.As the player, you will be controlling two separate caravans making their way across the lands. One is a varl expedition of kings and princes in the middle of human/varl peace negotiations trying to make their way to the varl capital whereas the other is a human group running to save their bare lives from the outpouring of bloodthirsty dredge. The goal is to survive. You will endure many hardships during your travels and you will have a direct impact on the outcome. Many choices will present themselves to you and the outcome will rarely be clear. You will face certain repercussions of your choices further down the line. Almost all of them are equally compelling and will directly influence who joins you, who lives, who dies and the overall state of your caravan. Other games tell you of hardships, The Banner Saga throws you right in the middle of it so as to feel the brunt of it on your shoulders.The production values will leave you in awe, wondering how is it possible that this game was made by a three-person team. The artwork is absolutely gorgeous, truly some of the most beautiful I have ever seen. Complimented by a superb soundtrack consisting of Viking-inspired tracks, the game manages to create an intensely thick atmosphere, one of beauty drowned in misery and despair. The importance that these elements have on the game and the overall experience cannot be overstated. Throughout the game, there are these calm scenes in which you just observe your caravan slowly moving through the lands and it’s so inexplicably memorable.When it comes to the actual gameplay, apart from the continual decision-making, the big star here is the turn-based combat system. I have played a rather large number of both turn-based strategy games and turn-based RPG’s and I have never come across a combat system quite like this one. What’s most interesting about is that strength and health are the same stat so as a unit loses more and more health, it becomes more and more useless. However, the armor stat is equally important because even if your unit is more powerful than the enemy unit, it won’t deal much damage until you take the armor down. And this is then complicated further because you can either choose to deal armor damage or health damage. Also, all the different units have different special abilities. All of this creates a highly tactical combat system which really makes you think about how you approach the battle.When it comes to shortcomings, the first thing that comes to mind is small enemy variety. Sometimes you’ll fight humans or varl, but mostly the dredge will be your opponents and it would have been nice if they had more unit types. Also, considering that it’s a 2D game, the loading times are unusually long. The game will also leave you wanting more once it ends which you may see as a negative as you’ll want to continue the story right away instead of waiting for the next chapter. However, this is offset by a relatively high replay value. A second playthrough will surely turn out completely different than the first.The Banner Saga is a fantastic game which will place the heavy burden of leadership and responsibility on your shoulders. It will lead you through a beautiful yet bleak world and it will provide a challenge in both its hard choices and tough combat. And it will be a journey to remember.9 OUT OF 10 (SUPERB)			"

												       I loved this game. It comprised many different types of gamplay styles into one beautifully enthralling unique piece of art. The game promises to be a game where decisions are vital and your choices matter. Some other reviewers think that the game is linear despite its promises. The game delivers in its story so well that it needs to have some form of linearity.      Banner saga is its own story and its your job to see to the end of it. You have to make choices that impact the survival and moral stability of your caravan. Right or wrong choices can be fatal depending on how YOU want the game to be played out. The story was phenominal  and the visuals were unlike any game I have ever played and will no doubt leave room for future games to copy this design.      When there was voice acting, it was well delivered and very well spoken. The game we are talking about here was a kickstarter project, and voice acting for every cutscene is just not going to happen. Some companies do not have the funding.  Luckily, due to the success of this game, we could hope to see improvements in the next part of this 3 part game series. This game was meant as an introduction to the beautiful spectacle that is banner saga. When buying this, you must understand that this game is not meant to be appreciated on its own, it is just a taste of things to come. So enjoy this amazing game because I am already waiting for the next addition in the series.			"

												First off I have to say that I enjoyed playing the Banner Saga (TBS) even though I found it “stressful” at times. Believe it or not, the story was actually affecting me – the pressure to find my clan a new home or even safe haven was unrelenting – and I realized later that the fact that I found it stressful meant that the game had succeeded, in a way. The story is told from two ends, from two perspectives. It’s a little confusing at first, but you get the hang of it as things pick up.+ (pluses): The game is beautifully rendered, even though it’s entirely in 2D. This goes to show that good games don’t require high frame rates, obscenely expensive graphic cards or computers that cost as much as a downpayment for a home.+ The score and authentic (I’m assuming) Norse vocals are mesmerizing and totally bring the game to a new level in terms of immersiveness.+ Turn-based combat, with a perk system for different classes of fighters. There is also a pre-combat setup phase, for deeper strategy, and special items that can be equipped to boost stats. + Compelling (and unrelenting) storyline. You feel the clan’s desperation, and pressure to find shelter as you flee from place to place. Some players complained that there is too much emphasis on logistics and feeding your party; at first I tended to agree but after I completed the game, I realized that this was necessary to hammer home the desperation of the quest.+ Believable characters and permadeath add to the RPG mix (games are only saved at fixed points). You lose a character and it’s like a kick in the gut. Should you have done something differently? Do you wait for stragglers or push on? Your decisions matter. = (neutrals): I realize that the feeding of the party is crucial; however, I feel that the gameplay could have been better balanced in this area. Using fame to buy food? Seriously? Maybe the party can be auto-replenished at locations instead? Otherwise the player simply skews the entire gameplay towards accumulating food, which makes this kind of meaningless, because TBS is much more than that. - (minuses): While the map is beautiful, it’s not interactive and rather pointless. I realize this is not a traditional RPG where you can backtrack and revisit locations, but the information on the map is difficult to correlate to what’s happening to you in real-time and where it’s happening. So why even bother having one?Overall, TBS is a good game and I enjoyed playing it. There is some replayability, even though the story is linear. Would a character have died if I did something differently? I’m looking forward to playing the sequel and to seeing where the story takes us this time.7.0/10			"

Humans and varl were bitter enemies for ages until the gods grew tired of it and created the dredge, monolithic stone creatures that have a particular thirst for destruction. The two warring races had to unite and push back the dredge into the far reaches of the northernmost wastes. A tenuous peace has lasted since. But the dredge are back in greater numbers than ever and they are mowing down everything and everyone in their path. But the real problem is – the dredge are on the move because they are fleeing an unknown darkness intent on engulfing the entire world. The lore isn’t particularly original or elaborate, but it is really intriguing.As the player, you will be controlling two separate caravans making their way across the lands. One is a varl expedition of kings and princes in the middle of human/varl peace negotiations trying to make their way to the varl capital whereas the other is a human group running to save their bare lives from the outpouring of bloodthirsty dredge. The goal is to survive. You will endure many hardships during your travels and you will have a direct impact on the outcome. Many choices will present themselves to you and the outcome will rarely be clear. You will face certain repercussions of your choices further down the line. Almost all of them are equally compelling and will directly influence who joins you, who lives, who dies and the overall state of your caravan. Other games tell you of hardships, The Banner Saga throws you right in the middle of it so as to feel the brunt of it on your shoulders.The production values will leave you in awe, wondering how is it possible that this game was made by a three-person team. The artwork is absolutely gorgeous, truly some of the most beautiful I have ever seen. Complimented by a superb soundtrack consisting of Viking-inspired tracks, the game manages to create an intensely thick atmosphere, one of beauty drowned in misery and despair. The importance that these elements have on the game and the overall experience cannot be overstated. Throughout the game, there are these calm scenes in which you just observe your caravan slowly moving through the lands and it’s so inexplicably memorable.When it comes to the actual gameplay, apart from the continual decision-making, the big star here is the turn-based combat system. I have played a rather large number of both turn-based strategy games and turn-based RPG’s and I have never come across a combat system quite like this one. What’s most interesting about is that strength and health are the same stat so as a unit loses more and more health, it becomes more and more useless. However, the armor stat is equally important because even if your unit is more powerful than the enemy unit, it won’t deal much damage until you take the armor down. And this is then complicated further because you can either choose to deal armor damage or health damage. Also, all the different units have different special abilities. All of this creates a highly tactical combat system which really makes you think about how you approach the battle.When it comes to shortcomings, the first thing that comes to mind is small enemy variety. Sometimes you’ll fight humans or varl, but mostly the dredge will be your opponents and it would have been nice if they had more unit types. Also, considering that it’s a 2D game, the loading times are unusually long. The game will also leave you wanting more once it ends which you may see as a negative as you’ll want to continue the story right away instead of waiting for the next chapter. However, this is offset by a relatively high replay value. A second playthrough will surely turn out completely different than the first.The Banner Saga is a fantastic game which will place the heavy burden of leadership and responsibility on your shoulders. It will lead you through a beautiful yet bleak world and it will provide a challenge in both its hard choices and tough combat. And it will be a journey to remember.9 OUT OF 10 (SUPERB)			"

												       I loved this game. It comprised many different types of gamplay styles into one beautifully enthralling unique piece of art. The game promises to be a game where decisions are vital and your choices matter. Some other reviewers think that the game is linear despite its promises. The game delivers in its story so well that it needs to have some form of linearity.      Banner saga is its own story and its your job to see to the end of it. You have to make choices that impact the survival and moral stability of your caravan. Right or wrong choices can be fatal depending on how YOU want the game to be played out. The story was phenominal  and the visuals were unlike any game I have ever played and will no doubt leave room for future games to copy this design.      When there was voice acting, it was well delivered and very well spoken. The game we are talking about here was a kickstarter project, and voice acting for every cutscene is just not going to happen. Some companies do not have the funding.  Luckily, due to the success of this game, we could hope to see improvements in the next part of this 3 part game series. This game was meant as an introduction to the beautiful spectacle that is banner saga. When buying this, you must understand that this game is not meant to be appreciated on its own, it is just a taste of things to come. So enjoy this amazing game because I am already waiting for the next addition in the series.			"

												Viking men, viking women and horned viking giants battling ancient robots made of stone in a scandinavian world where the sun stopped in the sky. Just that would make an amazing game, but The Banner Saga also brings a deep, intriguing and involving story, über charismatic characters and an art style that honours the greates Disney  classics, but with more blood.And on top of all that, a batlle system that's easy to get, but unfolds into a thousand of complex strategies. A must have to any  fan of RPG and strategy game.The best Tactics game ever made since Final Fantasy Tactics. And don't forget to check out the free PvP The Banner Saga: Factions, too.			"

												For me personally, Banner Saga is a frontrunner for my GOTY.ProsThe story/journey is phenomenal The decision making (while forcing you down a linear path to your next main progression point) is often weighty and mentally taxing.  If you let yourself get immersed, you will be rewarded.The combat itself is quite fun, though it has a few drawbacks.  You never get the opportunity to truly play around with the systems/characters/strategy side of things.  This is largely tied to.....ConsRenown.  It is used for supplies, character upgrades and items.  While it serves its purpose of ""hard decisions"", it simply isn't fun.  You don't get the flexibility to play around with characters/loadouts and buying items is pretty much out of the question.  You need to upgrade characters to survive, but if you upgrade them, you are in a sense stuck with them, due to resource commitment.  The bottom line is that its a poor mechanic, and it drastically strips away at the strategic elements of the game.Beyond that though, the game is fantastic, and anyone that likes serious/dark toned material, decision making, or turn based strategy games should check it out.

												this game is wonderful , for the art style and music . the presentation of this game is very very good.the same as the story. every choice has consequences and it's not a easy choice, it's all matter even a small simple choice can bite you in the long run. gameplay sprit between 2 part. move the caravan and turn-based RPG combat.caravan part is manage the resource and pick a choice which effect your jouney. making camp to rest and prepare to the next battle. and travel across the world (sadly you can't pick the destination the game story does).combat part is simple but yet challange and fun. it's good but not so special.story and lore is very good I'm gladly to read more but can't seem to find within game. so yeah....more would be nice.overall , it's a very good game and it can be a lot better.

But, after reading a lot of reviews, I thought I should try that game, and I did not even wait for a sale, even though I am a cheap♥♥♥♥♥gamer. I played it for 10+ hours and all I am going to say is that this game is a masterpiece. Maybe it does not have much replayability (even though I do not think that is the case), but everyone should listen to its story, experience the greatest journey of this times.

Posted: December 31, 2016
												My feelings about this game are a little mixed, but mostly positive. I like the Nordic background, the cartoon-like artstyle and the storylines. The concept of two groups of heroes starting at opposite sides of the map, uniting and mixing before endgame works very well. The system of character development and equipment is simple, but immersive enough. I also appreciate the additional gameplay layer of troop management (numbers of combattants/civilians, provision, motivation - finally reaching a village where you can buy food is a meaningful event after losing soldiers to starvation on a long march!) Morally ambiguous decisions in dire situations do appeal to me.One thing that prevents this one from being a really great game is the combat system. I appreciate the relative strategic complexity of separating armour and strength, while some other turn-based games only show a health bar, with unchanging damage and protection values. But still, I have my issues with it. Is it realistic that I can attack the body of an opponent without damaging his armour? I cannot imagine that. The distribution of heroes and enemies on the arena follows a few patterns that are repeated too often for my taste. I do not like that there is no chance involved when determining the damage your attacks do - even a weak fighter should have a lucky strike now and then (predictability kills tension). Also, I have a problem with the alternating order of action between the two fighting groups (instead of a more realistic principle of one action per character per round): For example, if one group has six fighters and the other one two, the two will act three times as often as each of their opponents. In the end, you keep weak enemies alive as long as you can just to prevent the heavy hitters from punishing your wounded soldiers. This is very unintuitive. Such things make the combat system feel a little artificial to me, and I do not see what some critics found so brilliant about it.More importantly, the decisions you make only have minor effects on the final outcome, the storyline has only one ending essentially, so you pay 20 EUR for a single playthrough unless you want to see the minor variations in the story that result from your choices. Do you really care wether the final boss is killed by hero 1 or hero 2? I did not.The gameplay serves its purpose, but it falls short compared with other roleplaying games. The substance of this game is the immersive atmosphere of the storylines. My verdict: 6/10.			"

												+ Great art and animations+ Some recognizeable music (Austin Wintory + Dallas Wind Symphony)+ Recognizeable characters+ Feeling of deep lore+ Alternating protagonists to control, different views on the events taking place+ Some freedom which paths to take and which fighters to let join (or leave) your group. When resting at villages/cities or when the caravan is moving events pop up giving you multiple choices, often difficult ones as either your caravan, your integrity as it's leader or the people in the surrounding area may suffer from your choice (like your supplies are low - steal from these peasants or pass by letting clansmen in your caravan starve?)+ The combat situations you are getting into are reflected in the actual combat fields you are fighting on (you are not randomly thrown into some generic landscapes; the areas are visibly designed accordingly to how they were previously described, and have fitting assets like buildings, corpses or passive fighters of all the participating factions observing the events).~ Final boss battle can be frustratingly hard (at least on any other difficulty than ""Easy"")~ Story is not finished. It was promising as long as it lasted, but ended rather abruptly, I didn't expect the game to end where it did. I guess this is where the line ""Saga"" comes into play. Stoic is apparently outlining or already working on the sequel. If you expect a conclusive story from this single installment you will be disappointed.~ There is a feeling of deep lore. There is a big world map, and literally any place, landmark and terrain formation you can click at to get a description of it's history or naming or whatever. This alone deserves some respect in my opinion. But not all - perhaps naturally - is used in any gameplay-related way. The worldmap itself only serves as an overview as to where you are, and where you will be going, to get an understanding of your journey. You can very well never look at the map and still get along. - Only very few voice acting, and never during character dialogues (the launch trailer falsely suggests there to be more).- Hostile AI is occassionally doing some strange moves, sometimes hurting their own combatants more than yours.- No idea if it's me but sometimes the game glitched a bit. I was clicking around the combat options of one of my fighters and somehow the game ended the turn of that fighter despite me never wanting to do that. In one occasion I noticed my fighter was teleported on another combat field too. It didn't happen >that< often, but often enough for me to notice, and in some instances it prevented me from finishing some combats as I had hoped to do.- Special moves of the fighters are sometimes a bit difficult to understand. A full explanation you can only look up before a battle. When in battle there is only a reduced description which sometimes lacks important details. So you either need to learn these moves beforehand (there are training battles in cities/villages and when resting with your caravan) or do trial and error (there is some room of error as long as you aren't a perfectionist, fighting on ""Hard"" or on ""Normal"" against the final boss). This could possibly have been made easier by allowing you to look up the full character profiles (and special move descriptions) during combat too.			"

												If you see this game on your Steam frontpage, and think: ""This game looks like some old tv series or movies."" Hell yeah, that's what I thought, and believe me, this alone is worth the 5 bucks you can spend in sales. (and you shouldn't pay MUCH more.)The Banner Saga is a turnbased RPG with adventure elements. Think of it like a mixture between The Walking Dead or Oregan Trail, with the fighting system of Wasteland 2 or Heroes of Might and Magic. The main aspect of the game is to get your caravan to a safe point, travel through the land, and while traveling, ensure you survive, don't starve and keep your morale up. Sounds boring? I tell you, it's not! Prepare to meet characters you won't forget, make super tough decisions with very hefty consequences, that make you want to restart the whole game (I seriously once did, lol).The fighting has some cool unique features, and, depending on the difficulty you chose, can be freaking hard. Another good feature though: Losing a fight doesn't simply get you to a gameover-screen, instead you have to live with that loss and it's consequences. Your comrades could die (yes, there is permadeath), your caravan could lose many people, and so on. Every choice in this game, makes a big impact.Now to the negative sides of this game. Unfortunatly, you can complete the game in around 4 hours, which is okay if you want to re-run it, but I would have preferred a longer story. (remember, don't pay more than 10 bucks!)Furthermore, there is no free saving, it all happens through checkpoints, which sometimes are a bit annoying and misplaced. Lastly, and that's really something I wished they would have changed, there is some brilliant voice acting in the game, only problem is, it only appears very rarely. Most dialogues between the main characters are not voiced at all, and that takes away something I feel.But, if you are looking for a game with stunning visuals (oh god, does this game look good), a neat story, cool fighting system, impactful decisions and a really good soundtrack, this is the game for you.

												The art is beautiful, music astonishing, gameplay solid. The combat system is fun, if a little simplistic for the lack of things like terrain modifiers and a little sparse on variety of units. The story is at once bleak and heartwarming. You feel for every senseless death in your caravan as little events give you snippets of what daily life is like on the road. You want to protect your people. The game will run on even the shakiest toaster and will run a skilled player around 10-12 hours for their first time through. Subsequent playthroughs are tantalizing, the desire to see if you can remedy past failures and save those whom you lost is strong by the end of the game.Highly recommended.			"

												it's challenging (can't beat any fight without losing at least 1 person), but not fun... in most games I see a fight as an opportunity to gain something, but in banner saga you only gain the chance to move forward to your next hopeless situation. Only played 4 hrs, and just not enjoyed it so far.Edited: After a couple more tries, I've come to the conclusion that I hate the battle system, specifically the way turns alternate between my team and the enemies. It makes no sense... If I have 6 units and the enemy 2, turns shouldn't alternate. Last game, i had a member who's health was low, so I moved him out of the way to retreat. This gave the enemy a free turn every time his move came up.What I should have done is let him die, and this drives me nuts, cause any game mechanic that involves ""sacrificing"" a player just so you don't give the opponent an advantage is dumb, and illogical.

												I enjoyed the game quite a bit. To start off one playthough takes about 10 hours. Since the game is fairly different than most games on the whole, I figured it'd be easier to point out the similarities it may have with some established games. The game's a little bit like: Fire Emblem -  grid based combat, but individual unit turn-based with a strength as hp mechanic and armor -- you can try out The Banner Saga: Factions, the corresponding free multiplayer game to try the combat, Oregon Trail - you travel along a fairly linear path making decisions as you go with a caravan nonetheless, Dragon Age - unlike Fire Emblem series where if you lose a character in combat, you lose him/her in the campaign, in TBS you can only lose characters through decisions you make out of combat -- falling in combat will only injure a unit for the next fight, unless you rest at camp or have enough time pass to heal the injuries, King of Dragon Pass - the decision system is similar and you will be given chances to wage war, however you only control the army by choosing one command, such as Charge, Formation, Defend, etc. which then prompts a regular combat scenario,---The campaign affects combat in several main ways. Probably most importantly, it affects who you will be able to play as in combat and which encounters will be combat encounters or bypassed through resolution or avoidance. You can add new characters to your party or even accidentally, or purposefully, kill off members of your team. Next,  your caravan morale affects how much willpower your team has starting the match. Willpower allows characters to use their special abilities, deal extra armor break or damage, and to move further in a single turn. If your caravan morale is low, your team will start fights with less than normal willpower, but if they start with high morale, they will receive bonus morale. Lastly, from making some decisions, you can gain reknown (the currency used to level up units and to buy equippment and supplies -- supplies are used to feed your whole caravan and maintain morale).---Strengths:As you'll see stated in most any other review, TBS is a gorgeous game. The combat is equally good and quite strategic.The vast and detailed world map shows the scope of the game's world in the classic Tolkien fashion.The characters and decisions are very impactful. You can lose or gain key characters (and their equipment) based on your decisions. Some decisions will have immediate results, while others may show up long after you've made them. Weakness:The biggest issue I had with the game is that it felt lopsided on the decision system. If you made a series of a few bad decisions, you wound up always struggling to get supplies, and on the flipside, if you make a series of good decisions, you have a fairly easy time. This is because all of the systems seem to compound on eachother. I preferred to be struggling, because it kept the tension of survival prominent.I enjoyed the overall structure of the story and the many decisions I had to make along the way, however the dialogue sometimes was poorly phrased, such as by using modern colloquial slurs. Some characters would use lore-based expressions, while others frequently sounded like they were from the current era. This was an odd issue. Some character and city names I did not know how to pronounce, and so I didn't commit many characters and places to memory.Lastly, you're always moving forward, from point A to point B. Once you leave camp or town you continue back on your journey. Instead of directly choosing your destination, you're sent in the general direction the story tells you to go, able to take detours or backtrack only when an event decision occurs.---On Combat:If you are not familiar with The Banner Saga's combat, I could see it being a fairly difficult game, as common strategic thought is to kill off units rather than leave them maimed and on the board. With TBS's turn-based system, one character takes a turn then control passes to the opponent to move one character. The order of character movement is established before combat and can be changed only by a few special characters once in combat. Although it might seem odd at first, this system requires much more strategy than just going from one side of the board to the other wiping out all enemy units. Each time you kill off an enemy unit, you are giving the opponent an advantage, slight or large dependent on the difference between both sides' total units.I find TBS's combat system to be a good addition to turn-based strategy family and prefer it to most other turn-based game systems.What I'd like to have seen:Skirmish mode - a mode to fight on all the different maps vs the AI using characters unlocked through the story-mode,Characters & Maps - story characters/classes added to The Banner Saga: Factions (the multiplayer version of the game);Multiplayer - The Banner Saga: Factions accessible in-game from TBS's client; I think leaving the two games separate can cause some confusion for players, some may only know about one version and not the other;			"

I enjoyed playing it but when the credit screen displayed infront of me.. I was really disapointed and kinda glad I didn't spend 20dls or € on it and got it on a sale for 5€, thats should be the real price. And of course they intend to make a second one to conclude the story but its going to be hard to keep the same characters because many will die or survive depending on the choices you make. Buy it on sale and spend arround 10 hours to complete you wont regret it if you truly love based turn, strategy game as FFT (Final Fantasy Tactics).			"

												This game was an interesting but disapointing experience for me.  It felt almost like Oregon Trail with giants and combat.  The combat was not huge on tactics, but turned out to be a click fest.  The staggered nature of player/opponent/player/opponent really killed what tactical feel the game did have. The Opponent types were repetative, and the game was extremely short for the price.  It took me 9 hours or so for a 25 dollar game.  The story was so so, not bad, but it will be forgotten within a few days.  I would wait untill it goes on sale, or find a copy of final fantasy tactics.  Heck, even Vandal Hearts was better than this game. "

												While the game has lots of flavour, a diverse soundtrack and a decent enough story, it unfortuneately is hampered by a strange combat mechanic that has completely turned me off The Banner Saga.In normal turn based strategy/rpg games, everyone rotates through their turns, going one after another. However in Banner Saga, it is one faction then the other faction, regardless of how many soldiers/characters are left. What this equals out to is that fights are brutally rough when trying to take out single tough enemies. More that that it feels so utterly non-sensical that if you fought well, and had all four/five/six characters, and your enemy has one left, that one will get to act four/five/six times more often then anyone of your characters.The whole concept is confusing if you think about it too much, but more than that, characters you like to use, are used less often in relation to the enemy in most fights, and they are more likely to die, if they catch a lone opponents ire, because that enemy can attack your one character four/five/six times before you can get them out of danger.

												Plot played out like a choose-your-own-adventure book, with ridiculous consequences for otherwise benign choices. Characters come and go more often than an RR Martin book, and for no good reason, so it's hard to feel attached to any one of them. The tactics gameplay itself was fairly standard. Overall I love the setting and I was curious about the world, but nothing about the game was actually fun to play. Just a long, frustrating slog to the end -- which didn't resolve anything about the questions set out in the beginning of the story.			"

												Not only is this game beautiful with it's unique and mesmerizing style, but it is also extremely engaging. The battles keep you on the edge of your seat. The choices you have to make about your people feel meaningful making you deliberate for long periods of time, wondering what is right and what is necessary. The soundtrack is great and well incorporated. I'm in love with this game and can't wait for more.			"

												Such a tragic game, at times. It tells a beautiful story very well, involving the player emotionally through the consequences of their decisions. Even when an outcome is sad, you're left to wonder if it maybe wasn't still the right thing to do.The art style is perfect to relay the feel and impact of the world. Definitely worth at least one playthrough.			"

												Tactical RPG fun with a compelling theme. A few quibbles about game mechanics though - the combat mechanism encourages you to bleed enemies until they're almost dead, but not kill them until you're able to do so all at once. And the food/starvation mechanism doesn't seem to have much effect on your battles. But overall, a fun and interesting game that presents good tough choices.			"

												I have quite a bit of love for this game, but I'll say one negative thing about it: the combat system, while getting points in my book for being unique, ultimately rewards a gameplay style that is unintuitive.   For those who haven't played it:   The combat follows a strict turn-based system.  It's always Your Team -> Their Team -> Your Team -> Their Team until one of the parties has only one surviving member, which then takes the turns into sort of a ""blowout mode"" where the entire opposing party gets to move for each of the single unit's moves.  A character's combat effectiveness is in large part determined by their remaining health.  A character with 0 health missing will do more damage than a character with 3 points of health missing that is otherwise identical.   These two factors work together and lead to an interesting quirk - contrary to most tactical games where grouping around a single unit and removing it quickly provides the greatest strategic benefit by removing the total number of enemies faced, in the case of the Banner Saga, it ends up being best to leave weakened units alive rather than finish them.  If you're having trouble understanding, take this example.  You have 3 units at max health and the enemy has 3 units at max health.  There will be 6 turns in a ""rotation"", one for each unit.  The order will be A1-B1-A2-B2-A3-B3.  If you were to completely defeat one enemy unit, there would then be 5 turns in a ""rotation"", one for each unit, and the order will be A1-B1-A2-B2-A3.  Now, the next turn will be B again, but it will be B1, who is a fully powered unit.  Had you left B3 alive at one or two hit points, the turn would be given to B3 instead, and since B3 is very weak, any damage dealt by it would be greatly reduced.  If B1 and B2 do 6 damage each while B3 will only do 2 damage, A1-B1-A2-B2-A3-B3 results in 14 damage to your party across three turns, while A1-B1-A2-B2-A3-B1 results in 18 damage over three turns. By eliminating the weakest unit as opposed to leaving them in the battle, you have reduced the time between turns for the two strongest units the enemy has.  The strongest tactical decision will be leaving multiple enemies at low health to force the enemy team into ""wasting"" turns on the ineffective units while reducing turns for the most powerful enemies.   I want to emphasize that I do appreciate the benefits and wrinkles of this system, one would be parties who have a dwindling number of units are granted an automatically incrementing advantage.  I also appreciate the flavor of the ""rout"" mechanic where the lone surviving unit must give priority to each remaining opponent - it makes battles feel decisive when you're on the good end and makes them feel hopeless when you're on the receiving end.   My complaint with this ""flaw"" as I view it, is that it seems to be a very ""meta"" strategy.  That is to say, it feels at times like you're gaming the combat system as opposed to making tactical decisions -- killing the Big Bad last after maiming the rabble to ensure you only get thumped 1 of 6 turns instead of systematically answering and removing threats.   Regardless, this is a game I highly recommend.  Mechanically, it has several other devices that are quite novel.  Both the Armor and Exertion systems lend themselves to interesting decisions and interactions.   Flavor-wise, the game is outstanding.  It really makes you feel like a survivor fighting an unstoppable enemy and the grinding attrition of daily survival.   Do be aware: this is part one of a trilogy.  I did not know that when I started the game.  Without getting too spoilery, there are quite a few WOW moments at the end of the game that lead into a final battle that is frankly anticlimactic.  Knowing it was only the opening chapter of a grand story would have made things much more satisfying the first time around.   If you haven't played this game yet but are considering it, you're already interested enough to buy it.  The art and music are breathtaking and though your decisions end up not being the most eventful in the long run, they always result in immediate and sometimes totally unforeseen consequences.   Banner Saga is great!  Buy it!			"

												A Gentleman Gamer's Review of ""The Banner Saga,"" developed by Stoic Games and designed by Alex ThomasIntroduction:- The Banner Saga is a turn and grid based, tactical RPG in the similar fashion of Final Fantasy Tactics and other games of the sort. However, the story itself is more interactive than those games, giving you, the player, choices to urging dilemmas in your journey, and your actions have parallel consequences; whether they are for the better or worse. Unlike most RPGs, The Banner Saga breaks traditional and has an icy, yet beautiful, Viking setting. Plot Summary:- The plot focuses on two different caravans with differing casts of protagonists that eventually interweaves together. You start off as an old and wise Varl, a towering race of horned vikings, named Ubin that joins a band of Varls that are tasked to escort a human prince, Ludin, to a far city to strengthen relations between the two races. The story also shifts to the perspective of a man named Rook and his daughter Alette. Unexpectedly, a third race of dark gigantic figures, known as the Dredge, threatens the existence of their world. This looming threat directs the two groups to eventually cross paths and band united as our heroes fend off this army of relentless, innumerable beings. The Dredge pillage any village in sight, fearing the end of days, they seek for a way to evade and ultimately end the Dredge horde.Presentation:- What immediately stands out from this game is its gorgeous, classic art style and animations. It is very Disney like visually; the story is anything but, however. You will soon understand that this world is a dog eat dog world; danger and death broods in the shadows. Cutscenes are very charming and well done; however, they are scarce and far apart. Even though I would like more of these crisp animated scenes, I may have become overdone and over stayed its welcome. Therefore, It is more spectacular to see a cutscene late game, because it may have lost meaning if they were at every few minutes. Though not very memorable, the music does set the tone and is relatively enjoyable; you feel the intensities of battle or the long journeys your caravans trek. However, with being such an odd setting in comparison to other RPGs, it was slow to grow accustom to the story and characters. Eventually, I became invested to the them and quite enjoyed the different personalities you mean through this adventure. One complaint I may add is at times, you are to make a decision based on situation you are in; unfortunately, a couple of times, it was vague on what I was deciding on so I just hoped I was making a keen decision, but these moments came rarely (perhaps it was poor reading on my part but I usually reread most things,)Gameplay & Mechanics:- Being a tactics game, the battle system consists of positioning your heroes on a battlefield strategically according to their attack type, specialty and so on. Some unique aspects about the battle system are: the order your units attack in is not by speed, for there are not speed stats in the game, but by order you wish you want them to move in. Another notable aspect is the Strength stat, because unlike other RPGs, your strength stat is actually two in one. It is both your HP and your physical power. As your character takes more and more damage, his or her attacks become weaker as well; therefore, you are to decide to focus on armor or strength, perhaps a balance of both. Characters in battle can exert themselves to either go farther on the map or do extra damage towards strength or armor. Every time you Rank and Promote (level up) a character, you can increase any stat of your choosing but only twice per level. This makes a simple RPG have deeper complexity. You can have other; weaker characters chip away at armor so enemies receive more damage or have a strong hitter that can go over most defences but be more vulnerable to attacks; this leaves it up to you on what you like to use in battle. However, the terrains are always flat and there are no physical obstacles or barriers in battle, just a grid. There are no random encounters in this game meaning that you can't grind and become undeniably over powered for the story; this makes the game a fair challenge through and through. When you are not in battle, you are either on travel mode or in a city. Just because you are not in battle doesn't mean you can take it easy, you must manage food supplies and make difficult choices. This can affect your morale meter. If it goes low, your party will perform poorly in battle. If one of your members falls in battle, they will be injured for a set amount of days and until they heal, they will do worse in battle. There is no perma death in battle; however, there is perma death outside of battle so think out your decisions. I reccomend for your first play through to commit to your choices even if you didn't like the outcome to create a unique experience. Final Thoughts:- I'd rather enjoyed The Banner Saga and recommend it to any RPG fans that want a refreshing take on the tactic genre. For a RPG, it's somewhat short; it taking me a good 13 hours to beat it my first go; however, seeing how my decisions affected the my journey, I would say it has replayability. The Banner Saga 2 has also been announced so if you are interested and end up enjoying the game as well, you can get right into the next journey winter of 2015. If you are still want more of this game style, there is a online game, The Banner Saga Factions; however, its user base is very thin; hopefully it grows.			"

												I highly recomend this game! People might say the game is a bit unforgiving, but guess what life is unfair too. Though, I felt that the story was a bit short. DO NOT FRET! Banner Saga 2 is currently in development. Gameplay-It's basically a turn-based strategy game and you can collect items and level heroes to improve their stats it can be hard at times, but I found it intriging and enjoyable enough to set asides its clunkyness. Art/Music- I was literally bloooooowwn away from the art and quickly fell in love with it, a decent amount of the game you can view the landscapes and stare in awe with the atmosphere it creates. The music felt like it had Nordic origin and it seemed to perfectly blend in with every scene.Writing: The game offers so much options, meaning so much replayability to discover the possible outcomes you could've have missed. Overall, this is a game that was money well spent and I hope you get to exprience the game the same way i did			"

Character development is solid. Sound/Music really amazing but I guess because of my Irish background I can say I like this sort of music. =PCons:Combat is somewhat shallow, really easy to pickup I guess this could be a pro also. Short, wow is the game short. (Beat it in eight hours.)Overall I recommend this game to anyone that is looking for a interesting story, it's a game that is a cross between xcom and oregon trail.			"

												This game is a beautiful and awesome experience, nailing its source material's tone while keeping itself unique among the flurry of TBSRPG's that have come out into the market since XCOM: Enemy Unknown. The campaign, which takes between 8-12 hours, is well-worth the price of admission, and the game questions not your morality, nor  your honor. The game consistently questions your judgment. Let these guys into your caravan? Trust the helmeted-guy over the crazy-looking one? Send out your damage tank, leaving your archers exposed? While The Banner Saga isn't the most emotionally-impactful game I've ever played, it's probably the most sobering. I wholeheartedly recommend this game at full price.Also, you get to be a viking. :D(For the full review, click here.)[www.tf2newbs.com] "

												What is there to say about The Banner Saga?It's near-perfect for one. The visuals are wonderful 2D Disneyesque paintings. The soundtrack, though somewhat sparse, really hits home when it's allowed to shine.The real pillars of game design, though, story and gameplay, are what really holds the thing together.The gameplay is split between dialogue choices, travelling supply management, and turn-based tactical skirmishes. The skirmishes are masterfully done, although a bit easy for strategy veterans like myself (still haven't played the game on very hard, though). The travelling sections are what caught me, I'd almost always go for days, sometimes weeks, without supplies, watching clansmen and soldiers fall left and right. Really, though, there are very few consequences for it, besides a last stand segment near the end where your warriors slowly tick away buying time for you to do things. It felt both forced and pointless, and while it helped my immersion early on, I realized that it didn't matter about midway through the game.The dialogue ties in more with the story, which is a mix of Walking Dead style branches and convergence (some things will happen no matter what you do) and meaningful decisions. There was only one point in the game where I felt one of the plot trees failing, and you'll know it when you get there (although it can also be skipped around with some finagling.)As for the story bits you can't control? Feels.Too many feels.10/10			"

												The Banner Saga is a quite short game but has high replay value. Because of these two attributes I've finished the game twice (on normal and hard difficulty). The game is divided into two things: the journey with strategic aspects and tactical turn-based battles.The journey strategic-wise is simplistic and bad. The whole morale-supplies-renown management, while quite interesting, is broken. I don't want to spoil it to you, dear player, but let's say that one thing is much, MUCH more important than the other. What I have to add is how strong narrative is. Characters are likable. Choices don't leave a lot to be desired (very rarely I was left with only unsatisfying dialogue options). Beware of outcomes of your choices though - they are merciless!The tactical turn-based battles are freaking good. The mechanic of initiative in this game is original and you have to get used to it (newbies cry a lot about it). All statistics are useful. Abilities are varied and most of them are VERY satisfying when used. The game doesn't give you much freedom with building your characters which is (just a little) disappointing. The battles have almost no luck factor. No critical hits or random points of damage but you have certain % to hit (although it appears only if enemy has higher defense than your strength, nothing bad).Graphically this game is great. A lot of backgrounds are similar to each other but some are simply beautiful. What you see on the screenshots is what you get. And that's good because artistic look of the game is one of the reasons I decided to buy this game.Music is diverse. In my case I was tired of listening to some types of music (Menhir ones) but others were pleasant. Battle music is what I like in this game.Bottom line, the game is linear, focused on story telling and choice making, has oversimplistic strategy elements. In my opinion it's amazing looking, decent sounding and has very good tactical elements. 7/10P.S.: This game has checkpoint system. You can't save whenever you want. It's not a big problem though because it saves quite frequently.			"

												Art: 10/10Story: 10/10Turn-Based Combat: 6/10Overall Game Balance: 7/10TL;DR:I am an old Turn Based Strategy veteran. Games like Front Mission, Final Fantasy Tactics, Vandal Hearts. If you want deep and balanced tactical combat this is NOOOOT your game. If you want engaging, dramatic dialogue and a colourful story give it a go.-------As a narrative experience, this game is incredible. (WHILE I DID NOT FINISH IT!) I found the story to be mysterious, rousing and very engaging. The writers do an excellent job of making you feel welcome and at home in the setting. The Gods that operate the heavens and earth are dead. The sun is stuck, hung dead in the sky. Humanity is crumbling. The Varl no longer bear children. An ancient evil race of golems, once banished to the northlands are once again descending from their lofty prison. These are the final days.You spend about half the game fighting, and half reading dialogue/choosing options. Choose wisely and you will be rewarded with extra food and followers, choose poorly and your desperate group of survivors will suffer. While I am not certain whether you can have EVERYONE in the caravan die and lose the game, it certainly did feel like a constant struggle to stay afloat. I was always weighing the decisions between using my experience points (Renown) to level up my heroes, or simply buy food for the women and children.The combat itself has simple features, and a hidden depth. Strength and HP are the same stat. The healthier you are, the more damage you do. Weakening the enemy group is sometimes much more important than killing them outright. Battles ALWAYS have one team take a turn, followed by the next team. So even if you kill an enemy combatant, another healthy one just gets more actions to hurt you with.Attacks ALWAYS hit. There are no misses, really. Deflections happen when an enemy has more ARMOR than you are able to pierce with your strength, but you're not rolling dice to determine miss chances. Whittle down the armor to do more strength/HP damage, or attack their HP directly in the hope that they can't hit you as hard right away. It's often a tough decision.I was very frustrated by many of the decisions I had to make in the game. I found that powerful combatants could be lost from the party forever by choosing poorly in a simple dialogue option, and if you want to load and try the conversation again, you have to load from before the last battle. This is a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ It adds to the feeling of desperation and hopelessness, but can really screw up your team composition for the next fight.Overall I definitely reccomend Banner Saga. But if you're looking for pure tactics and strategy, this title has little to offer.			"

Posted: January 29, 2014
												I have now completed the game twice and feel like I can properly review the experience. Starting off, this is a very nice change of pace from the regular game, mixing a blend of choose-your-own-adventure with some turn-based combat. Add to that a beautiful artstyle and a superb soundtrack and you get a thoroughly enjoyable experience from beginning to end.The first playthrough was definitely the most memorable as each choice you are presented provides a provocative and ethical dilemma that needs to be solved, often pitting you against a range of really bad choices where there's no real ""good"" outcome to any of them. The feeling of hopelessness and desperation oozes from every minute you play it, and it truly feels like you are the last hope and salvation of your entire caravan of people and fighters. On the second playthrough, things are a little less engaging, as you start to realise that some of the choices you can make through the journey are somewhat arbitrary and you end up running into most encounters and situations no matter what choice you make along the road. You are also aware of some of the more important events and can easily avoid them by, for instance, refusing to allow certain characters to join your party along the way.The combat is fairly well balanced throughout the game and often provides a nice challenge even on Normal difficulty. There are portions of the game where you are part of a smaller battle sequence where a regular turn-based fight can be extended into a second round, but you are almost always at such a severe disadvantage when you launch a second round that I ended up only attempting it a single time, getting my♥♥♥♥♥♥handed to me, and then staying away from them for the rest of the experience.Here I can take the time to address one of the problems with the game, being the isometric perspective of the battles. At times it can become very cluttered when a lot of allies and enemies are placed in squares next to each other, making targeting of enemies and using abilities somewhat annoying at times. The option to turn the camera, so to say, would have helped here, allowing for easier battle management. However, this could be seen as part of the design, making the heat of battle seem more confusing for the commander.This following paragraph is somewhat of a spoiler, but not a massive one, so skip to the next one if you want to experience everything for yourself: The very final battle (and the preparation leading up to it as well) is a very stiff challenge, and if you have been unlucky or have been spreading out your experience points and currency too much, you might not even be able to finish the game. On both my playthroughs, the final fight took a number of attempts to finish, and me winning mostly just comes down to being lucky in the rounds that I won on. The fight itself is very unfair at times and can leave you very frustrated. However, as it is the last fight in the game, the stiff challenge is somewhat appropriate, but it could be more fairly balanced. Seeing as you could possibly end up in a situation where the entire sequence becomes impossible, ruining a perhaps 12-hour game for a player and forcing them to restart or jump back to a previous point, I can understand that a lot of players are really frustrated at this part.The game also ends rather abruptly, but with a nice climax in the story. I can only imagine that this is because the developers are working in an episodic format and I have heard people mentioning that this is supposed to be the first part in a three part story, which would make perfect sense with the way the story is formatted. Overall, the story is engaging and you truly want to see the characters come through it.All in all, I strongly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys a good story-driven game with an emphasis on turn-based combat. If you're a fan of the old choose-your-own-adventure type games and books, this is also very appropriate for you. The beautiful artwork and soundtrack should also peak your interest, and if you're more interested in the story, the visuals, and the sound, you could turn down the difficulty to Easy and just enjoy the ride. You won't regret it. :)			"

												I am an artist, and I cannot praise the visual design and storytelling of this game enough. Is it a perfect game? No, but I still love it.Little needs to be said about the striking graphics, which seem lifted directly from a high-budget animated feature, so this review focuses mainly on gameplay. The battle sequences are what initially drew me to the game, in part because I prefer turn-based strategies to RTS. Elements of the battles remind me of the ""Tactics"" games (Ogre Tactics, Final Fantasy Tactics, etc.), which is a good thing. The system is carefully thought out, and a few bad decisions can see a character knocked out and unable to fight for one or more in-game days. This does create some potential for replayability, as a later run through would allow you to make different choices, but at this point, replayability is not something I see as a strength in the game. Why? That has to do with what happens outside the battles.Unsurprisingly, one must consider resources, which is standard fare in a TBS. But in the dialogues that occur, one's choices can mean losing characters, both individuals and groups. More so than most other games, there is a sense of permanence in these decisions, which brings to mind one of the strongest elements of this game: storytelling.Although the pacing often seems very slow—particularly when walking from one area to another—the story that unfolds is brilliant. On many occasions I found myself wishing The Banner Saga was a feature film so that I could just sit back and watch it happen.Overall, I highly recommend this game to fans of strategy games, with the caveat that those who prefer twitchy RTS games will probably find this too slow paced. For those new to strategy games, it may still be worth it, if only to enjoy the beautiful graphics and compelling storyline.Graphics: 9.5/10Audio: 9/10Gameplay: 9/10Replayability: 6/10Overall: 9/10			"

I LOVED when at a certain someone was given a Viking funeral on a burning boat. The scene and the music was spot on! The only negative thing I have to say, it took me only 21 hours to finish the game.			"

												Such a tragic game, at times. It tells a beautiful story very well, involving the player emotionally through the consequences of their decisions. Even when an outcome is sad, you're left to wonder if it maybe wasn't still the right thing to do.The art style is perfect to relay the feel and impact of the world. Definitely worth at least one playthrough.			"

												Somehow I put off buying or seriously looking at this game until the second game came out, and I am blown away! It has everything I enjoy the most in a game: just one more turn feeling, getting lost inside and looking up to discover several hours have past, and just the right level of difficulty. The graphics are beautiful and the game has been lovingly crafted by devs who CARE about their product. Lastly, the game is priced properly at $19.99 and worth EVERY penny. My new favorite game, and it proves that small indie games CAN compete with the big boys and do a much better job...			"

												Hard difficulty is the only mode of play I have experience on.That noted I enjoy this game, highly. I see alot of people complain about difficulty and leave bad reviews. If you do not setup and think for best engagements you will get rolled.But this is how it should be, I request the developers not relinquish difficulty for the more challenged generations. But instead lead an example as to how it feels to fail, and fail miserably. Hence the reward of reworking strategy.Some may be put off of the TBS/RPG infusion but I can say with most certainty.. It works.			"

												An evil threatens the land and you must lead your people to safety, but your choices mean more than you may think. Simple dialogue options will change the outcome of your party and effect options down the line. An intricate battle system leads to victory or to pain. Will you be able to save your people?PROS: A very intricate and fun battle system (when you learn how to use it) Beautiful graphics Amazing music and SFX and voiceovers Controls are easy to understand/options laid out wellCONS: If you don't take time to learn the battle system it's very frustrating Travel becomes tedious Dialogue options are vague/don't know until you try Couple boss battles are a B! Try until you get them right...Overall, it's an excellent game. I absolutely hated combat until one of the devs came by my stream and gave me some advice, then I absolutely LOVED the combat. I was just playing it wrong! This shone some light on the negatives of travel and how tedious it was. Also how dialogue was very vague. This aside, you will enjoy your time in Banner Saga and want to learn more about the where the enemy came from (there's a sequel!)			"

												Its like final fantasy tactics style combat mixed with oregon trail.  The game is a fairly linear story that you follow but gives you dozens of choices to make along the way that ultimate affect how the game plays out.  Sometimes in very major ways, sometimes in very minor ways.  The combat is very fun and on the normal difficulty it can be challenging at times.  There are three basic class types, humans, archers, and varl.  Each have their own subtypes that determine their unique skills.  As you play through the game you can level your heroes but at the cost of renown which is used for food and other things.  The story, music, and art is amazing as well.  It was a spectacular experience playing this game.			"

												This game is just gets everything right! The story is deep and the characters complex. The visuals are down right beautiful and the music is fitting, exciting and sometimes almost hartbreaking. The gameplay is original and gives a lot of room for strategies and personal prefference. It is hard for me to say bad things about this game, for me (an rpg and strategy gamer) this game is absolutelly perfect but for people that only like shooters and fast paced action games such as Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto this game will propably be to hard and they will find it boring. But if you've ever loved a game like Civilisation, heroes of might and magic, The oregan trail or Fire Emblem I assure you that you'll love The Banner Saga.

												This game is a beautiful and awesome experience, nailing its source material's tone while keeping itself unique among the flurry of TBSRPG's that have come out into the market since XCOM: Enemy Unknown. The campaign, which takes between 8-12 hours, is well-worth the price of admission, and the game questions not your morality, nor  your honor. The game consistently questions your judgment. Let these guys into your caravan? Trust the helmeted-guy over the crazy-looking one? Send out your damage tank, leaving your archers exposed? While The Banner Saga isn't the most emotionally-impactful game I've ever played, it's probably the most sobering. I wholeheartedly recommend this game at full price.Also, you get to be a viking. :D(For the full review, click here.)[www.tf2newbs.com] "

												What is there to say about The Banner Saga?It's near-perfect for one. The visuals are wonderful 2D Disneyesque paintings. The soundtrack, though somewhat sparse, really hits home when it's allowed to shine.The real pillars of game design, though, story and gameplay, are what really holds the thing together.The gameplay is split between dialogue choices, travelling supply management, and turn-based tactical skirmishes. The skirmishes are masterfully done, although a bit easy for strategy veterans like myself (still haven't played the game on very hard, though). The travelling sections are what caught me, I'd almost always go for days, sometimes weeks, without supplies, watching clansmen and soldiers fall left and right. Really, though, there are very few consequences for it, besides a last stand segment near the end where your warriors slowly tick away buying time for you to do things. It felt both forced and pointless, and while it helped my immersion early on, I realized that it didn't matter about midway through the game.The dialogue ties in more with the story, which is a mix of Walking Dead style branches and convergence (some things will happen no matter what you do) and meaningful decisions. There was only one point in the game where I felt one of the plot trees failing, and you'll know it when you get there (although it can also be skipped around with some finagling.)As for the story bits you can't control? Feels.Too many feels.10/10			"

												I quite enjoyed my time with The Banner Saga. It felt to me like a mix of The Oregon Trail and Final Fantasy Tactics.I liked the way that I had to balance my renown between upgrading my party and keeping the entire caravan alive. The combat was a little tough to wrap my head around at first, but it definitely made me play in a unique fashion from other tactical RPGs. Because attack power is limited by a unit's current health, and a unit from each team alternates in the turn order no matter how many characters are on each side, I found myself trying to damage enemies but leave them injured for a while instead of taking them out completely. The ability to damage armor made for some interesting decisions. (Should I hit the enemy's armor so that my archers can do more damage on their next turns, or aim for the body so they can't do as much damage to my units?) The giant Varl (and certain Dredge) take up much more space than humans, so I found positioning during battles to be incredibly important.The little events that pop up while traveling could be nail-biters at times. It was tough to figure out what might happen for each decision, and I wasn't always happy with the results, but I stuck with them anyway.I actually thought I was going to lose the final battle, but I got lucky and finished off Bellower with an attack that only had a 20% chance of connecting. To my surprise, it was a hit! If I missed, my party would have been wiped out.I played mostly during lunch breaks at work, so I played without any sound for almost the entire game. I've heard that the soundtrack is pretty great, so maybe I did myself a disservice there.I found the world of The Banner Saga intriguing, but it left many open questions so I greatly look forward to the next game in the series.

												Tactical RPG fun with a compelling theme. A few quibbles about game mechanics though - the combat mechanism encourages you to bleed enemies until they're almost dead, but not kill them until you're able to do so all at once. And the food/starvation mechanism doesn't seem to have much effect on your battles. But overall, a fun and interesting game that presents good tough choices.			"

Posted: April 17, 2015
												I have quite a bit of love for this game, but I'll say one negative thing about it: the combat system, while getting points in my book for being unique, ultimately rewards a gameplay style that is unintuitive.   For those who haven't played it:   The combat follows a strict turn-based system.  It's always Your Team -> Their Team -> Your Team -> Their Team until one of the parties has only one surviving member, which then takes the turns into sort of a ""blowout mode"" where the entire opposing party gets to move for each of the single unit's moves.  A character's combat effectiveness is in large part determined by their remaining health.  A character with 0 health missing will do more damage than a character with 3 points of health missing that is otherwise identical.   These two factors work together and lead to an interesting quirk - contrary to most tactical games where grouping around a single unit and removing it quickly provides the greatest strategic benefit by removing the total number of enemies faced, in the case of the Banner Saga, it ends up being best to leave weakened units alive rather than finish them.  If you're having trouble understanding, take this example.  You have 3 units at max health and the enemy has 3 units at max health.  There will be 6 turns in a ""rotation"", one for each unit.  The order will be A1-B1-A2-B2-A3-B3.  If you were to completely defeat one enemy unit, there would then be 5 turns in a ""rotation"", one for each unit, and the order will be A1-B1-A2-B2-A3.  Now, the next turn will be B again, but it will be B1, who is a fully powered unit.  Had you left B3 alive at one or two hit points, the turn would be given to B3 instead, and since B3 is very weak, any damage dealt by it would be greatly reduced.  If B1 and B2 do 6 damage each while B3 will only do 2 damage, A1-B1-A2-B2-A3-B3 results in 14 damage to your party across three turns, while A1-B1-A2-B2-A3-B1 results in 18 damage over three turns. By eliminating the weakest unit as opposed to leaving them in the battle, you have reduced the time between turns for the two strongest units the enemy has.  The strongest tactical decision will be leaving multiple enemies at low health to force the enemy team into ""wasting"" turns on the ineffective units while reducing turns for the most powerful enemies.   I want to emphasize that I do appreciate the benefits and wrinkles of this system, one would be parties who have a dwindling number of units are granted an automatically incrementing advantage.  I also appreciate the flavor of the ""rout"" mechanic where the lone surviving unit must give priority to each remaining opponent - it makes battles feel decisive when you're on the good end and makes them feel hopeless when you're on the receiving end.   My complaint with this ""flaw"" as I view it, is that it seems to be a very ""meta"" strategy.  That is to say, it feels at times like you're gaming the combat system as opposed to making tactical decisions -- killing the Big Bad last after maiming the rabble to ensure you only get thumped 1 of 6 turns instead of systematically answering and removing threats.   Regardless, this is a game I highly recommend.  Mechanically, it has several other devices that are quite novel.  Both the Armor and Exertion systems lend themselves to interesting decisions and interactions.   Flavor-wise, the game is outstanding.  It really makes you feel like a survivor fighting an unstoppable enemy and the grinding attrition of daily survival.   Do be aware: this is part one of a trilogy.  I did not know that when I started the game.  Without getting too spoilery, there are quite a few WOW moments at the end of the game that lead into a final battle that is frankly anticlimactic.  Knowing it was only the opening chapter of a grand story would have made things much more satisfying the first time around.   If you haven't played this game yet but are considering it, you're already interested enough to buy it.  The art and music are breathtaking and though your decisions end up not being the most eventful in the long run, they always result in immediate and sometimes totally unforeseen consequences.   Banner Saga is great!  Buy it!			"

Posted: June 21, 2015
												A Gentleman Gamer's Review of ""The Banner Saga,"" developed by Stoic Games and designed by Alex ThomasIntroduction:- The Banner Saga is a turn and grid based, tactical RPG in the similar fashion of Final Fantasy Tactics and other games of the sort. However, the story itself is more interactive than those games, giving you, the player, choices to urging dilemmas in your journey, and your actions have parallel consequences; whether they are for the better or worse. Unlike most RPGs, The Banner Saga breaks traditional and has an icy, yet beautiful, Viking setting. Plot Summary:- The plot focuses on two different caravans with differing casts of protagonists that eventually interweaves together. You start off as an old and wise Varl, a towering race of horned vikings, named Ubin that joins a band of Varls that are tasked to escort a human prince, Ludin, to a far city to strengthen relations between the two races. The story also shifts to the perspective of a man named Rook and his daughter Alette. Unexpectedly, a third race of dark gigantic figures, known as the Dredge, threatens the existence of their world. This looming threat directs the two groups to eventually cross paths and band united as our heroes fend off this army of relentless, innumerable beings. The Dredge pillage any village in sight, fearing the end of days, they seek for a way to evade and ultimately end the Dredge horde.Presentation:- What immediately stands out from this game is its gorgeous, classic art style and animations. It is very Disney like visually; the story is anything but, however. You will soon understand that this world is a dog eat dog world; danger and death broods in the shadows. Cutscenes are very charming and well done; however, they are scarce and far apart. Even though I would like more of these crisp animated scenes, I may have become overdone and over stayed its welcome. Therefore, It is more spectacular to see a cutscene late game, because it may have lost meaning if they were at every few minutes. Though not very memorable, the music does set the tone and is relatively enjoyable; you feel the intensities of battle or the long journeys your caravans trek. However, with being such an odd setting in comparison to other RPGs, it was slow to grow accustom to the story and characters. Eventually, I became invested to the them and quite enjoyed the different personalities you mean through this adventure. One complaint I may add is at times, you are to make a decision based on situation you are in; unfortunately, a couple of times, it was vague on what I was deciding on so I just hoped I was making a keen decision, but these moments came rarely (perhaps it was poor reading on my part but I usually reread most things,)Gameplay & Mechanics:- Being a tactics game, the battle system consists of positioning your heroes on a battlefield strategically according to their attack type, specialty and so on. Some unique aspects about the battle system are: the order your units attack in is not by speed, for there are not speed stats in the game, but by order you wish you want them to move in. Another notable aspect is the Strength stat, because unlike other RPGs, your strength stat is actually two in one. It is both your HP and your physical power. As your character takes more and more damage, his or her attacks become weaker as well; therefore, you are to decide to focus on armor or strength, perhaps a balance of both. Characters in battle can exert themselves to either go farther on the map or do extra damage towards strength or armor. Every time you Rank and Promote (level up) a character, you can increase any stat of your choosing but only twice per level. This makes a simple RPG have deeper complexity. You can have other; weaker characters chip away at armor so enemies receive more damage or have a strong hitter that can go over most defences but be more vulnerable to attacks; this leaves it up to you on what you like to use in battle. However, the terrains are always flat and there are no physical obstacles or barriers in battle, just a grid. There are no random encounters in this game meaning that you can't grind and become undeniably over powered for the story; this makes the game a fair challenge through and through. When you are not in battle, you are either on travel mode or in a city. Just because you are not in battle doesn't mean you can take it easy, you must manage food supplies and make difficult choices. This can affect your morale meter. If it goes low, your party will perform poorly in battle. If one of your members falls in battle, they will be injured for a set amount of days and until they heal, they will do worse in battle. There is no perma death in battle; however, there is perma death outside of battle so think out your decisions. I reccomend for your first play through to commit to your choices even if you didn't like the outcome to create a unique experience. Final Thoughts:- I'd rather enjoyed The Banner Saga and recommend it to any RPG fans that want a refreshing take on the tactic genre. For a RPG, it's somewhat short; it taking me a good 13 hours to beat it my first go; however, seeing how my decisions affected the my journey, I would say it has replayability. The Banner Saga 2 has also been announced so if you are interested and end up enjoying the game as well, you can get right into the next journey winter of 2015. If you are still want more of this game style, there is a online game, The Banner Saga Factions; however, its user base is very thin; hopefully it grows.			"

												I highly recomend this game! People might say the game is a bit unforgiving, but guess what life is unfair too. Though, I felt that the story was a bit short. DO NOT FRET! Banner Saga 2 is currently in development. Gameplay-It's basically a turn-based strategy game and you can collect items and level heroes to improve their stats it can be hard at times, but I found it intriging and enjoyable enough to set asides its clunkyness. Art/Music- I was literally bloooooowwn away from the art and quickly fell in love with it, a decent amount of the game you can view the landscapes and stare in awe with the atmosphere it creates. The music felt like it had Nordic origin and it seemed to perfectly blend in with every scene.Writing: The game offers so much options, meaning so much replayability to discover the possible outcomes you could've have missed. Overall, this is a game that was money well spent and I hope you get to exprience the game the same way i did			"

												I can not remember when I had to make such tough choices in gaming the last time. The story is brutal, makes you feel bad everytime you see the effects of your decisions. Because they matter. Because the world is tough and if you fail as a leader, your people die. Because if you decide that those resisting farmers shoudl give you their food so your clan can survive, you will have to kill them. This is Banner Saga, and it is awesome!I am not normally the one to play story-driven games, but this one had me at the first choice to make. The combat system is refreshing enough to make it feel your tactic matters. Someone that got hit a lot, can't hti back this hard, someone withotu armour left, gets hit harder as well. Pretty logical, but amazing how it surprised me with these mechanics I have never encountered in any game so far.By the way, if you are not the type for story-games, try out Banner Saga: Factions, it is free to play and features the same classes and battles as Banner Saga, but in a PvP-environment, where you fight against other leaders.9/10 just because there is a small bit of potential left. Let's hope they nail it again with the next chapter.			"

												A definite gem of a game, although rough on the edges at times.The hand of the ex-Bioware team is obvious in the compelling story, score of interesting characters and engaging Rpg-gameplay. Imagine Tell Tales’ The Walking Dead and Final fantasy having a baby that was to be nurtured and educated by Mass Effect and Baldur’s Gate.The world of The Banner Saga is grim, cold and beautiful, alive with people and lore to give it substance and plenty of mysteries to give it it’s magical, mythical feel.As the title suggests, you will play out the events in an epic Norse saga in which your choices have either a direct or long-term impact on the world. The story and it’s events, however, are harsh and dramatic making the choices on your path difficult and the following consequences  sometimes hard to swallow.In this, the developers have succeeded in bringing a Norse-themed Game of Thrones like world to their game. Wars, diplomacy between races and nations, strong heroes and faulty leaders in a ‘terror from the north’ story overshadowed by impending doom, add to this.The, at times, faulty grammar or punctuation doesn’t stand in the way of a great game and a wonderful experience. If you’re a fan of story driven RPG’s and solid strategic-turn-based combats The Banner Sage will provide! "

												Disclaimer: I played about halfway through, got sidetracked for a while by a bunch of other games, and then started over fresh and beat this game once. That is how familiar I am with this game at the time of this review.Let me say this first: the game is visually stunning. Every single environment, character, and frame of animation has an astonishing hand-drawn/painted feel to it. It seems as though they used a method of rotoscoping to bring the characters' motions to life, and it looks pretty damn impressive. Also, the score is brilliant. The song ""Onward"" is what gave me the final push towards picking up the soundtrack. Alright, so it looks and sounds nice, but what about the most important aspects: gameplay and story? For the most part, gameplay is top notch. Their unique spin on the turn-based genre is fairly hit or miss; you either love it or hate it. That stems from the fact that your fighters' health also determine their damage output. I personally found it very interesting and that it added an extra layer of strategy to each turn. It's all about calculating risks and how to combine each warrior's playstyle to create one combined force. My first main issue (of two) is what happens in between combat. The caravan sequences, despite being pretty, are pretty monotonous. They only serve as the ""resource management"" portion of the game, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I loved making decisions along the journey, and this is the first game I've played that actually has logical ways to handle each solution (not just a ""good"", a ""bad"", and a ""wrong"" choice), but some of the consequences that came from those actions were pretty unfair. I think it's fair to have someone's decisions mean life or death for some party members, but it almost seems like the odds are stacked against you in many cases. A second playthrough might remedy this, but I didn't even know you could have certain party members with you all the way to the end; it seemed like there was a point where they had to die, but I guess not. Also, using the same resource to buy both supplies and level-ups/equipment for your fighters seems like an interesting idea, but it falls flat. You either starve your caravan or fight battles with weak warriors.The story is both cliché and original. The setting, characters, and ideas make it fresh, but some of the creative decisions made (like referring to something evil as ""the Darkness"") make it seem like a slight retread of past ideas. Despite this, the world and its inhabitants are interesting, and that to me is more important. The viking/Scandinavian influences fit very well and gave the game (for me) an aspect of intrigue due to very few other games doing something similar. I seem to like the leader characters/father figures the most when it comes to narratives, so I naturally grew fond of Rook and his daughter Alette. I also enjoyed having Iver, Hakon, and Mogr around, all three of them being varl (giant horned men). My second main issue comes with the conclusion of the game. The length is decent, but it leaves so many plotlines unresolved that it hurts. I understand that Stoic Studio plans on adding on to this series and making it a trilogy, but some of the immediate questions/conflicts aren't touched on at all. The ending feels like a midseason finale rather than a season finale. I'll be happier once they actually do release the next chapter, but I was slightly disappointed. Even though I'm not into JRPGs, I am familiar with how long they are. I was hoping for something along those lines; a truly epic saga told in one tale. Unfortunately, this game is part of a trilogy and it knows it. Despite me complaining about it for the past paragraph, I can't wait to see what happens next. If you are a fan of turn-based strategy, Norse mythology (kind of), games with beautiful art styles, or you're just really in the mood for something that allows you to make decisions with real consequences, you really can't pass this one up.PROSGorgeous visuals/musicCompelling narrativeEngaging strategy gameplayInteresting setting/charactersCONSInconclusive endingSlightly tedious caravan/resource managementOverall: 8.5/10			"

												Art: 10/10Story: 10/10Turn-Based Combat: 6/10Overall Game Balance: 7/10TL;DR:I am an old Turn Based Strategy veteran. Games like Front Mission, Final Fantasy Tactics, Vandal Hearts. If you want deep and balanced tactical combat this is NOOOOT your game. If you want engaging, dramatic dialogue and a colourful story give it a go.-------As a narrative experience, this game is incredible. (WHILE I DID NOT FINISH IT!) I found the story to be mysterious, rousing and very engaging. The writers do an excellent job of making you feel welcome and at home in the setting. The Gods that operate the heavens and earth are dead. The sun is stuck, hung dead in the sky. Humanity is crumbling. The Varl no longer bear children. An ancient evil race of golems, once banished to the northlands are once again descending from their lofty prison. These are the final days.You spend about half the game fighting, and half reading dialogue/choosing options. Choose wisely and you will be rewarded with extra food and followers, choose poorly and your desperate group of survivors will suffer. While I am not certain whether you can have EVERYONE in the caravan die and lose the game, it certainly did feel like a constant struggle to stay afloat. I was always weighing the decisions between using my experience points (Renown) to level up my heroes, or simply buy food for the women and children.The combat itself has simple features, and a hidden depth. Strength and HP are the same stat. The healthier you are, the more damage you do. Weakening the enemy group is sometimes much more important than killing them outright. Battles ALWAYS have one team take a turn, followed by the next team. So even if you kill an enemy combatant, another healthy one just gets more actions to hurt you with.Attacks ALWAYS hit. There are no misses, really. Deflections happen when an enemy has more ARMOR than you are able to pierce with your strength, but you're not rolling dice to determine miss chances. Whittle down the armor to do more strength/HP damage, or attack their HP directly in the hope that they can't hit you as hard right away. It's often a tough decision.I was very frustrated by many of the decisions I had to make in the game. I found that powerful combatants could be lost from the party forever by choosing poorly in a simple dialogue option, and if you want to load and try the conversation again, you have to load from before the last battle. This is a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ It adds to the feeling of desperation and hopelessness, but can really screw up your team composition for the next fight.Overall I definitely reccomend Banner Saga. But if you're looking for pure tactics and strategy, this title has little to offer.			"

												Somehow I put off buying or seriously looking at this game until the second game came out, and I am blown away! It has everything I enjoy the most in a game: just one more turn feeling, getting lost inside and looking up to discover several hours have past, and just the right level of difficulty. The graphics are beautiful and the game has been lovingly crafted by devs who CARE about their product. Lastly, the game is priced properly at $19.99 and worth EVERY penny. My new favorite game, and it proves that small indie games CAN compete with the big boys and do a much better job...			"

												I can not remember when I had to make such tough choices in gaming the last time. The story is brutal, makes you feel bad everytime you see the effects of your decisions. Because they matter. Because the world is tough and if you fail as a leader, your people die. Because if you decide that those resisting farmers shoudl give you their food so your clan can survive, you will have to kill them. This is Banner Saga, and it is awesome!I am not normally the one to play story-driven games, but this one had me at the first choice to make. The combat system is refreshing enough to make it feel your tactic matters. Someone that got hit a lot, can't hti back this hard, someone withotu armour left, gets hit harder as well. Pretty logical, but amazing how it surprised me with these mechanics I have never encountered in any game so far.By the way, if you are not the type for story-games, try out Banner Saga: Factions, it is free to play and features the same classes and battles as Banner Saga, but in a PvP-environment, where you fight against other leaders.9/10 just because there is a small bit of potential left. Let's hope they nail it again with the next chapter.			"

												I've only had the pleasure of playing for a few minutes thus far, but I think I can safely say that this is one of the most beautiful games I've ever seen. It's a stunning panorama of Nordic art that holds both elegance and simplicity worthy of a fine graphic novel or top notch animation studio. The music too is excellent. The gameplay itself feels slick, simple, and efficient. Again, I've yet to play as far as some, but already I find myself enjoying this  excellent minimalist RPG. It feels fresh in a way I haven't seen in a while, and leaves me wanting more and wishing more game studios would try to branch out from the norm and take up the banner Stoic has so firmly planted.

												Not only is this game beautiful with it's unique and mesmerizing style, but it is also extremely engaging. The battles keep you on the edge of your seat. The choices you have to make about your people feel meaningful making you deliberate for long periods of time, wondering what is right and what is necessary. The soundtrack is great and well incorporated. I'm in love with this game and can't wait for more.			"

												Its been a long time since I got attached to characters emotionally. I really like the storyline, it keeps me curious whats gonna happen next. I believe this is why this game is quite successful. I also really like the character leveling, the items even if that aspect is more casual, the combat system makes up for it.Fun game. Try it if you want to relax by getting lost in a great story with nicely done art and puzzling combat.Only thing i wish for is a more perma death type of gameplay ( like in xcom ) with story tailored around it, but ofc that would be a ton of effort from the devs so yeah.

												The Banner Saga is a quite short game but has high replay value. Because of these two attributes I've finished the game twice (on normal and hard difficulty). The game is divided into two things: the journey with strategic aspects and tactical turn-based battles.The journey strategic-wise is simplistic and bad. The whole morale-supplies-renown management, while quite interesting, is broken. I don't want to spoil it to you, dear player, but let's say that one thing is much, MUCH more important than the other. What I have to add is how strong narrative is. Characters are likable. Choices don't leave a lot to be desired (very rarely I was left with only unsatisfying dialogue options). Beware of outcomes of your choices though - they are merciless!The tactical turn-based battles are freaking good. The mechanic of initiative in this game is original and you have to get used to it (newbies cry a lot about it). All statistics are useful. Abilities are varied and most of them are VERY satisfying when used. The game doesn't give you much freedom with building your characters which is (just a little) disappointing. The battles have almost no luck factor. No critical hits or random points of damage but you have certain % to hit (although it appears only if enemy has higher defense than your strength, nothing bad).Graphically this game is great. A lot of backgrounds are similar to each other but some are simply beautiful. What you see on the screenshots is what you get. And that's good because artistic look of the game is one of the reasons I decided to buy this game.Music is diverse. In my case I was tired of listening to some types of music (Menhir ones) but others were pleasant. Battle music is what I like in this game.Bottom line, the game is linear, focused on story telling and choice making, has oversimplistic strategy elements. In my opinion it's amazing looking, decent sounding and has very good tactical elements. 7/10P.S.: This game has checkpoint system. You can't save whenever you want. It's not a big problem though because it saves quite frequently.			"

												The Banner  Saga is a beautiful tale of survival in nordic-like fantasy world. It plays itself out in two halves: as a interactive novel with slightly animated art attached (in which you pick your choices and read the text of each character), and as a turn-based tactical combat game.Pros:-Beautiful art.-Ok plot, well narrated though.-Combats are fun, and challenging in Hard difficulty.-Your march in the caravan is fun and requires resource management, plus some RPG elements involving the characters.-Apparently your decisions do alter your experience.Cons:-No voice acting, dialogs have to be read.-Open ending (there is a second part already).-Combats are ok, but several improvements can be done: clearer effects of special abilities, more variety in enemies, maps and options (IMPORTANT: I played all of the game -except the final battle- in Hard difficulty, and I noticed that playing it hard offers a more variety of enemies -more evolved, harder- than Normal difficulty).-It♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off that you would have to spend points in characters to upgrade their level just to found them killed in the storyline. Upgrading should be points free.-The caravan march is fun, but the suppossed effects are not well planned: having your people starving or simply walking will either reduce your population or lower the morale, which eventually only affects the difficulty of your combats.-I'm not sure the reach of effect that your decisions have: seems like it affects more the ""how"" the story plays out than the ""wha"" (events).I clearly see several points that I'd liked the developers to improve for the second part, but this first game is a worthy experience: yes, combat could be better; and yes, your decisions could have much more weight in the story; however, this saga, franchise, has an amazing potential in all areas; and this first part is a good proof of it.7/10			"

												A Viking-themed tactical roleplaying game created by Stoic (which I believe is just three men who used to work for BioWare). The story has tonnes of Lore if you look around the map, but if you want the basics of the story then the return or a warlike race that despises humanity - The Dredge - led by an invincible leader called Bellower has sent the world into chaos.The gameplay is a strategical, turn-based sing-player combat against the Dredge or other survivors and each character in your caravan has certain skills and unique abilities that can help you develop solid stratedgies for taking down opponents. It has the novel idea of your health also representing strength, so the more health you lose the less powerful your character's attacks will be. You have a whole array of units such as archers, shieldbangers, warhawks, etc. Inbetween battles there are chapters, in each chapter you will play as one of three POV characters leading a caravan across this hostile world in a way similar to ""Oregon Trail"". Here you will make conversation choices with other characters and sometimes the wrong ones will result in your characters dying or leaving for good, which results in you having less units to fight with in the tactical combat - a lot of people have a problem with this but it actually works as good incentive to level up everyone rather than just focus on one character and make them the best; you could lose them at any point. One character in particular, Egil, who has a special ability that let's him block almost any attack (so pretty useful when utilised correctly) can be killed about 8 times during these conversation choices and you actually get an achievement for keeping him alive! The choices also offer a bit of replayability in terms of characters but there is little in the way of overall change.The game isn't perfect; in the ""Oregon Trail"" part you have fighters, clansmen and varl (Varl are part of the mythology and are giants with horns) that you are charged with keeping alive, managing supplies to do so, but many players point out you can let them all starve to death and still complete the game without consequences, however it seems this will remedied in the sequel which will make your caravan more important.Another issue is that there is little difference in terms of combat scenarios with everyone with the terrain remaining basically the same and the enemies changing only slightly over the course of the game, due to the different number of units you have to experiment with the game rarely gets boring or too repetitive but given it's estimated run time of about 8 hours you're unlikely to get tired of it in that time.A lot of people take issue with the game opening with a cinematic scene and not having any more in the game and their is little voice-acting. But if you judge this game by that then you are missing out. The artwork is beautiful and it is well written if a few of the in-universe words (such as the insult ""Skal"") can take a while to understand.Ultimatley, the game has its little imperfections, but they don't take away from this being a spectacular and original game that is definitley worth playing. A fun experience that is excellently presented and executed with a diverse cast of characters, intricate and compelling story and a solid combat system.			"

												I don't have a deep history with turn based strategy games, but I really enjoyed this. Amazing music, and good story, though it was hard to follow along in places. Part of me wants to play it over again, knowing what I know now, but I'll probably pass.There are a few mechanics that were annoying, and others that were cool, and all told I'd say it is a good game, though not a great one.I'm a little perturbed, I had no problems in combat until the final battle, and after five wipes I dropped the difficulty and walked all over them. Maybe I should have opted to fight more, but balancing resources (you use the same resource to buy more food or level up your heroes) was taxing - though I'd imagine that's exactly what they were going for.As a father of a daughter, parts of this game weighed on me more than I had anticipated it would.8/10.

												I played this game about half-way in so far, and I can only recommend it.It has an beautiful artstyle, an interesting story and generaly an incredibly well done atmosphere.Many negative reviews critisize the combat system. However, I do not think the unique combat system of this game is a flaw. It's an authentic design choice, making Banner Saga an interesting alternative to the ""usual"" RBS.Especialy on hard mode it becomes quite challenging, considering you will likely lose units from it, it adds to the strategic choices you have to take outside of the battle. Will you rest some more, to get you heroes back up, allthough you might soon run out of supplies? Or will you march on regardless, hoping that you can avoid fights for now? Or maybe you got some more heroes, which can substitute for the missing ones, while they tend to their wounds.Nope. Can't say I find the combat system ""flawed"" or ""broken"". It's an unique and interesting distinct flavour, working well together with the game as a whole.			"

												After a discrete experience as a videogamer I learned to classify games into macro-categories, more or less like steam tags. But there are some games, some little pearls, that lie outside every class. If you open the store page of The Banner Saga, it'll tell you that the game is a turn based RPG. Don't believe it. The tag is a lie. That is such a reductive definition that is like to say that the Hamlet is just a tragedy.The Banner Saga redefines itself presenting a game experience that does perfectly what a game should do: it carries you into another world, makes you feel what the characters feel, to the point I wasn't able not to finish it in one day.In the short, but at the same time long days of marching followed by your caravan, you feel the weight of leadership, the eyes of every person weighting your decisions, the fear of hunger for every day you pass in the open, with the supplies running short, the relief of entering a village and rest.Regarding the combat system, it may not be very innovative, but it wasn't meant for casual players, that's sure. On normal difficulty, enemies will smash you and leave you wounded for days, even after victory, if you don't put strategy and caution in your decisions. To cut it short, just because you are giant wielding a battle axe that doesn't mean that rush into enemies swinging it is a good idea.I suggest everyone to play this game. If you want more than entertainment from a game, if you want to feel something, if you want to fear, joy and cry (I admit it, just a little in the end), give it a try.""Why are we alive, when even the gods are dead?""

												The Banner Saga is a game about a world. There are dozens of characters, all with compelling personalities and motivations, and while you only take full control of a couple of them, the story sections are filled with so much thoughtful dialogue you will end up relating to just about everybody. But even more than that is the world they find themselves in. Drawing largely from norse mythology while adding a few twists of it's own, The Banner Saga shows us a land rich in narrative and life. The first time the map opened up I spent the better part of an hour exploring and reading and understanding it all- it's just that well thought out. You lead your band of warriors and clansmen through hostile lands, trying to unearth the secrets of the most recent crisis. The sun has stopped, the gods are dead, new behemoths loom large, and hordes of stone-skinned warriors threaten to destroy everything. The world of The Banner Saga almost gives the feeling of the real world- much bigger than your individual experience, yet you still eke out your own path and do what you can to help. Whether you help yourself or the world at large is your choice.Now this game has a lot of moral choices in it. There's no morality system (thank god), but very frequently you will be choosing between many tough decisions to make. Almost everything counts, too. If you ever wondered what leading a large group of people in tough times feels like, I think this game gives a very flavorful taste of that. Definitely not something to be missed, if only for that experience.I've already gone on a while- I leave the sound and art direction for the interested player to look into. Needless to say both are beautiful and compelling. I can't recommend this game highly enough. It delivers on several fronts- gameplay, story, music, art direction- this game has it all. If you happen to dislike the game in one of those areas, you're in luck, because there are three more to please you.			"

To cut it short, just because you are giant wielding a battle axe that doesn't mean that rush into enemies swinging it is a good idea.I suggest everyone to play this game. If you want more than entertainment from a game, if you want to feel something, if you want to fear, joy and cry (I admit it, just a little in the end), give it a try.""Why are we alive, when even the gods are dead?""

												Felt like my choices mattered. Great art, great music! Alright combat, could be improved. In fact, there were instances I wish they could've gone without the combat.  However, I feel that the choices take the spotlight here, which I actually had some difficulty choosing between. Wish there was more voice acting, since a lot of the game is cutscenes, but it's not too big of a deal. Just finished, and I'm buying the sequel. 8.5/10			"

												Banner Saga is a beautiful, investing game, but it defiitely has its issues. If you buy items or stumble upon them you can never sell them in favor of better items, food, or to upgrade your characters instead. The game is also incredibly short, allows you to make decisions that you'd think would have severe consequences as far as the story goes but don't, and worst of all, feeding your caravan isn't necessary. You don't need them. You can just let them all starve to death and you'll be perfectly fine, and so basically you're simply spending renown for nothing.			"

												3/5 Story3/5 Gameplay3/5 Graphics2/5 Music2/5 Replay ValueAlthough The Banner Saga is a tactical rpg, it is a distinct departure from other games with that label. The story is more linear, the composition of your party more limited, and the battle options less diverse. Nevertheless, it is an intriguing game. The story focuses on the survival (rather than adventure and exploration) of two seperate groups traveling from one city to the next. Your caravan is composed of hundreds of npcs rather than just a party of a dozen or so like in many games and it is important to procure enough resources to feed them all. If you don't your clansmen and fighters begin to die off or abandon you. Likewise it is important to maintain good morale by resting during your travels, but doing so uses up a day's supplies without making any progress. It can be difficult to strike a balance especially since your resource for buying supplies is the same resource you use to level up your hero units and buy items to give them boosts. Sometimes throughout the game you will engage in a War event in which you choose whether to attack aggressively, defend yourselves, or even run away. This decision determines how difficult your battle with the enemy will be and how many casualties your bulk forces will suffer. Additionally throughout the game random events will occur requiring you to make leadership decisions, like whether or not to aid the sick and injured, how to handle a drunkard, or whether or not to give in to bandits. These decisions are presumably meant to give you the sense that you truly are part of a large caravan of people, but you never have the option to talk with random clansmen on your own, or interact with them in any meaningful way. Essentially every clan interaction is a text box and a few options to choose from. Personally it fails to give me that immersive quality I was hoping for.There is a vast map for the game world but you don't get to choose where to go or what route to take so the map hardly serves any purpose at all. Additionally it detracts from the beauty found in other areas of the game with it's childish scrawl and rough depiction. Similarly jarring are the many Godstones your caravan passes on it's travels. Each one is an opportunity to earn a special item but it is also a massive eyesore on the landscape and I hated having to see one each time. Otherwise the art was generally quite attractive with sweeping landscapes and beautiful splashes of color. Battles employ an interesting mechanic in which your health and your attack are the same stat. As a character loses health they also less effectively. Characters also have an armor statistic that reduces damage they take from enemy attacks. So for most battles the goal is to reduce your opponent's armor until you are able to deal damage to their strength and kill them. While some strategy is involved essentially the game amounts to beating on your opponent until you win. What little variety in abilities and strategic options exists is hindered by the lack of characters to choose from who employ them. Each character, with few exceptions is unique, but it's impossible to level them all up so you generally end up choosing the strongest few and sticking with them. Completley ignoring the rest of your party. I was also displeased to realize that if a character was equipped with one of my items when they left or were killed for story purposes, I lost the item forever. This made me paranoid about my party equipment and I would unequip everything from my characters after every fight, just in case.Ultimately the rpg aspects of the game fell flat for me and the story didn't feel substantial enough, but the overall mood of the game and the unique battle system and story progressing were intriguing. It feels to me like an unfinished game in desperate need of polish and expanding. Nevertheless I do believe it is worth playing, even if it leaves you feeling a bit unsatisfied and wanting more.			"

												This game is basically an interactive storybook with tactical combat!  I was very impressed by the depth of the combat tactics, and I loved acquiring new warriors throughout the story so that I could try out new strategies.  Thankfully the game includes a Training Tent when your caravan camps, so you can test out new tactics and soldier combinations without risk.I found playing this game was very relaxing, and the inability to create a save game in the traditional sense actually enhanced the sense of ""there's no going back now"" that the story really needs.  There are so many times during the story when you end up wishing you could've made a different choice, but you have to play the game again to make different choices.I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys turn-based tactical combat and some light reading.

Once the game was unlocked and I could play I enjoyed the storyline and gameply just as much. As most people have said it is an isometric tactics styled game with some feel of FFT and other such games. The story line is interesting and the characters have some wonderful temperments thrown in. I've found the combat system rather interesting as you can go into a battle with the same people and some times not come out with the same result every time. I am really enjoying this game everytime i start it up to play and highly recomend it to other people as well.			"

												After a discrete experience as a videogamer I learned to classify games into macro-categories, more or less like steam tags. But there are some games, some little pearls, that lie outside every class. If you open the store page of The Banner Saga, it'll tell you that the game is a turn based RPG. Don't believe it. The tag is a lie.

												I recommend this game but with some caution: here's why.The game is still in some early development, and you can see bits of it in its playthrough. For example, you have three stats that represent your community: clansmen, fighters, and varls (giants). Throughout the story you make many decisions - some may end a characters life - but most of them augment your ability to keep your clansmen alive. The clansmen do NOTHING by the end of the game. Having lots is the exact same (as far as I can tell) as having few. What would be excellent for the developers to do, is to allow different decisions to arise based on your stats - for example: an event might only happen if your have poor morale, or a whole bunch of clansmen. Furthermore, although it is hard to write, make the decisions change the story permanently, and derail the plotline into something new (in particular there is one decision like this in the game and it is excellent!).The games inception is excellent. You definitely feel as if your are part of a big world; the culture, music, characters, and even the art style all help contribute to this excellent asset. Unfortunately this alls falls a little short at the end of the game, because it is the first part of a yet to be developed trilogy, and the game ends rather suddenly (although the ending is pretty interesting)In sum, this game has absolutely huge potential, and the developers are taking feedback to heart for the second and third games. I recommend this game, but for its price, you might want to wait it out and see how the second game is recieved. Pick it up if it is on sale, or if you want to support the game's potential.			"

												Final Fantasy Tatics meets the Oregon Trail. The Gods of this world have died and the world has fallen stagnent as legions of stone Giants called Dredge begin to fill the land. Holy crap this game is a doozy. It's story book Norse ""viking"" astetic is absolutely gorgious from the first to the last minute of the game, and the music always masterfully and amazingly fits the tone of the story. The gameplay itself consists of mainly 3 parts.-Combat-Making difficult choices-Managing your caravan and refugees.Combat is difficult. The AI is smart and spot on so you better bring your A-game. If you've played the likes of Fire Emblem or Final Fantasy Tatics you'll get the basic elements but others might have a bit harder time.Choices are by far the defining part of the 3. You will often make choices that will at first may seem simple or obvious but will have far reaching consiquences. A simple press of a button and 1 or 2 of your parties members will die, no matter how strong they are. This merits making sure you think over each choice. At times, there are choices you must make that simply make your heart pound, your mind race as you think of the consequences.Managing your caravan is simple, but not easily done. Morale and food are what you need to keep your band of weary refugees moving....but this is not a easy task. Not in the slightest. The aforementioned choices may very well make your caravan's abysmal morale into normal or good...while another may drain all of your supplies or end up with members dead.One thing that may catch people off guard is it's length and the lack of manual saving. The lack of manual saving is obviously there to prevent or discrouage save scumming. Whats the purpose of having life and death choices if you just reload after your Varl(friendly horned giants in this world) gets killed. The length it self actually caught me off guard since I felt there are some plot points that the story did not resolve and were very important, but we will see if said points are explained if there is a sequal(which I most certainly hope there is)I didn't really know what I was getting into when I bought this but I'm certainly glad I did. Banner Saga is grueling, hard, and beautiful. When you have moments of peace while playing the game, you find yourself as relaxed and releived as the characters are. I absoultely recomend any fans of tatcial stratagy, epic fantasy tales, or people looking for a different experience to give this game a whirl. ""We may not survive, but will all be remembered!""

												I'm not sure I've ever felt as vulnerable in a video game as in The Banner Saga. In most tactical RPGs, the barrier to difficulty can simply be hurdled by a spot of grinding. Here, there's no such opportunity. At every stage of the game you are hounded, chased from one location to another, the weight of the enemy always at your back, with hard decisions (which often only make you weaker) stacking up as you move along. There's no chance to pause and grind the game's singular currency - renown - which leaves it always scarce in quantity. This forces you to choose between purchasing supplies for your caravan, strengthening your warriors, or purchasing a shiny item to give you a small power boost, and it never feels like enough. At no point in my playthrough did I feel overpowered. Even my strongest warriors could be felled in one blow if I made a bad tactical decision. At the start of each encounter, there was always the sense of, ""I don't know how I'll make it through this one,"" and following each battle, ""I can't believe I made it out of there alive."" And that's only the combat. The game also constantly forces you to make difficult decisions throughout, which frequently lead to the death of your party members. It's not always obvious, either, and since the game has no manual saves - only a handful of sporadic auto-saves - you can only change your mind so often. Sometimes, a decision you made hours ago will come back to haunt you much later, wreaking havoc on your party. So yes - in this game, there isn't just the illusion that your choices matter - they do, and you're bound to make some bad ones along the way. It's a bleak game, and feels like Game of Thrones meets The Walking Dead in terms of tone, and hope (or lack thereof). Luckily, it's also a gorgeous game, with a hand drawn aesthetic that looks quite unlike anything else out there. The combat system is interesting, but not nearly as varied as Japanese TRPGs like FF: Tactics, or the Disgaea series. By the end of the game, the mechanics do feel like a bit of a slog - but then, it suits the game's mood perfectly. To come out as some super charged badass capable of leveling a whole army isn't the point here, and wouldn't suit the story. Here, the core is survival, and the grim likelihood that at any moment, any one of your party might not make it to see the next day.			"

I'll certainly play through it again, and probably soon. The tactics were interesting, the moral decisions heartbreaking. The ending is what you make it to be, but expect loss whichever path you take.I am filled with an odd, hollow sensation at the completion of this game. It is not the pure satisfaction derived from the completion of a game with a satisfactory conclusion, but the mixed pleasure and pain of victory and defeat. I hope there will be a sequal.			"

												FIRST IMPRESSIONS REVIEW:Best way to describe this game: Oregon Trail meets Baldur's Gate meets X-Com.  With VIKINGS.I've only played a little ways in and I'm very impressed.  The art style of this game is fantastic - the art is a little like a mix of a 'good' version of the rotoscoped animation from Bakshi's Lord of the Rings, plus some of the stylization in 'secret of the kells.'  it feels like playing through a carefully crafted fantasy novel where the creators took it quite serious.  The tactical combat feels pretty satisfying, and the sobering choices that matter not in a 'good versus evil' context, but in a morally gray 'actions have consequences' context where you make your own morality makes this title feel very adult and mature.  On that note, so far I am enjoying playing a wise big-hearted viking giant who helps the weak and makes personal sacrifices while making wise decisions about protecting his warband.			"

												The BEST turn-based combat in video games.It is not an RPG, it is in fact a series of games of highly original chess with fantasy-like Scandinavia-themed pieces. And this chess is wrapped into a very engaging story where you make decisions which affect what pieces you're going to play the next game with. If you like sophisticated turn-based tactical combat (somewhat but not exactly similar to XCOM, Divinity: Original Sin, King's Bounty), you will appreciate it.			"

												The Banner Saga is sure to entice you to visit its world through its early Disney-like artwork, but it is the game's melancholic universe along with its thoroughly thoughtful twist on tactical turn-based rpgs, accompanied by an outstanding soundtrack from the composer of the PS3 game Journey, that will keep those eyes locked to the screen.Storywise, in short, The Banner Saga's story thrusts you into a norse-inspired world where the gods have died and the sun has stopped high in the sky. This has caused an old rock-like enemy of human and giant, the Dredge, to resurface and begin tearing a bloody swath across the land. Taking on multiple characters, you take to the road to either stop, understand, or escape this catastrophe. The Banner Saga's gameplay is split into two portions: an Oregon Trail style caravan mangement system that puts you squarely in the shoes of quartermaster and a turn-based tactical RPG.The former portion of the game may occasionaly have you gritting your teeth. The Banner Saga is a game that is committed to its themes of kinship, journey, and perseverance both through its story and gameplay. As such, you will not only be required to make diffcult choices through the story, but also on rationing a relatively limited single currency system that is used for purchasing items, upgrading characters, AND buying supplies for your caravan (without these, they will die of hunger). It is the managing of all these things, along with endeavoring to keep your caravan's moral high, that some may find unfair. I, on the other hand, find it exhilarating and refreshing that Stoic has enough faith in the player to acctually put them through the very challenges that characters suffers through. It will give you a sense of accomplishment for each passing day late in the game. If this kind of challenge is your thing, this game will be an excellent match for you.If you're a fan of the combat in Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem (to a lesser degree of similarity) this will keep you excited to engage in every battle. The variation on characters losing health and armor directly tying into their strength in battle will provide you an interesting challenge. Also, there are plenty of characters and classes that bring their own unique stats and special abilities to the field that are sure to keep you devising new strategies with each new, powerful recruit. That is, if your choices do not get them killed!Speaking of choice, certain events do feel scripted, or dare I say ""linear"". They are, however, judiciously mixed with tragedies that are completely avoideable. For this reason, Stoic has struck a balance between pushing forward a narrative that has an end and allowing the consquence of your choices to play out. The game will ocassionally make you feel disheartened and it may even make you fruastrated over the difficulty of managing the caravan and party if that is not your thing, but it will challenge your sense of saftey in choice, tell you a bleak and whimsical epic, and provide you a incredibly fun tactical rpg.

												The Banner Saga is a beautiful strategy game that has a beautiful artistic presentation. The story has depth, and the characters are well made.The game is a mix of strategy chess like style and traditional board game. The progress of the story is through a journey where the player can have a limited control in where it goes through choices. This will give re-playability value to see the different outcome. The strength of the game in my experience is through the art and the game play.

												The pros to The banner saga- it has an intense turn based combat system similar to that of XCOM's, with a wide variety of characters to use while in combat, each with their own unique abilities.- the environments are beautiful, and while there are no free roaming elements it still has a tonne of dialogue and in depth story to go through- you can play as multiple characters who all have different perspectives, positions and roles to play in the world- the story is split up into sections, one time you will be travelling with your caravan, the next you will be making life choices, going into combat or continueing the story with lots of dialogueThe cons- if you don't like a story that involves reading with little to no voice acting, this is not for you- if you don't like slow paced strategy combat similar to XCOM, this is not for you- There could be some more customisation options for the characters clothing and weapon designs but it doesn't matter as muchOverall, this is an excellent turn based RPG with an intense combat system, a new indepth story with a lot of meaningful decision making and a lot of lore and dialogue behind it - 10/10			"

												FIRST IMPRESSIONS REVIEW:Best way to describe this game: Oregon Trail meets Baldur's Gate meets X-Com.  With VIKINGS.I've only played a little ways in and I'm very impressed.  The art style of this game is fantastic - the art is a little like a mix of a 'good' version of the rotoscoped animation from Bakshi's Lord of the Rings, plus some of the stylization in 'secret of the kells.'  it feels like playing through a carefully crafted fantasy novel where the creators took it quite serious.  The tactical combat feels pretty satisfying, and the sobering choices that matter not in a 'good versus evil' context, but in a morally gray 'actions have consequences' context where you make your own morality makes this title feel very adult and mature.  On that note, so far I am enjoying playing a wise big-hearted viking giant who helps the weak and makes personal sacrifices while making wise decisions about protecting his warband.			"

												I suppose there's been some worthwhile criticism of this game through the weird use and abuse of Kickstarter. But the resulting game is very rich, with properly studied art production drawing from Heavy Metal, Eyvind Earle, music from Austin Wintory, and quite excellent writing. I have been pleasantly surprised all the way through. It doesn't look like many others are playing it, though.			"

												If you played the free multiplayer before, you will know what the main part of the game will be - a lovely drawn yet brutal viking Fire Emblem. However, you will also fight aztec-viking stone golem aswell.If you search for a great turn based strategy game with character development and decision making, here it is. If you seek a nordic-skyrim-experience, here it is. If you seek a gracious artstyle, you probably have already seen it in the screenshots. If you seek a challenging and at times unforgiving difficulty, here you go!Minor complaints go only into the safe system, some choices and the ""war"" system. You have one real safe point that auto-saves after all important events. So if you made a mistake and let a companion die (which can happen every minute as it appears, but the game usually gives subtle hints that your current choice of actions might be stupid), you have to replay the whole chapter, which can take half an hour. When travelling, some choices give you the option to ask some people about their opinion. Too bad they take that as an invitation to ""do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they please"", robbing you of the possibility to make your own choice. Whenever you meet such an situation, copy said mentallity. The ""war"" system on the other hand is rather intransparent and will only determine against how much enemies you will fight and how many of your followers will fall instead. There is sadly no visualisation of said battles, which turns war into some kind of ""random encounter"" with adjustable difficulty.Also spotted one bug where the warden shows the Hunters bow when he attacks to the north. Fix pls, I like the Warden.			"

												I'm not sure I've ever felt as vulnerable in a video game as in The Banner Saga. In most tactical RPGs, the barrier to difficulty can simply be hurdled by a spot of grinding. Here, there's no such opportunity. At every stage of the game you are hounded, chased from one location to another, the weight of the enemy always at your back, with hard decisions (which often only make you weaker) stacking up as you move along. There's no chance to pause and grind the game's singular currency - renown - which leaves it always scarce in quantity. This forces you to choose between purchasing supplies for your caravan, strengthening your warriors, or purchasing a shiny item to give you a small power boost, and it never feels like enough. At no point in my playthrough did I feel overpowered. Even my strongest warriors could be felled in one blow if I made a bad tactical decision. At the start of each encounter, there was always the sense of, ""I don't know how I'll make it through this one,"" and following each battle, ""I can't believe I made it out of there alive."" And that's only the combat. The game also constantly forces you to make difficult decisions throughout, which frequently lead to the death of your party members. It's not always obvious, either, and since the game has no manual saves - only a handful of sporadic auto-saves - you can only change your mind so often. Sometimes, a decision you made hours ago will come back to haunt you much later, wreaking havoc on your party. So yes - in this game, there isn't just the illusion that your choices matter - they do, and you're bound to make some bad ones along the way. It's a bleak game, and feels like Game of Thrones meets The Walking Dead in terms of tone, and hope (or lack thereof). Luckily, it's also a gorgeous game, with a hand drawn aesthetic that looks quite unlike anything else out there. The combat system is interesting, but not nearly as varied as Japanese TRPGs like FF: Tactics, or the Disgaea series. By the end of the game, the mechanics do feel like a bit of a slog - but then, it suits the game's mood perfectly. To come out as some super charged badass capable of leveling a whole army isn't the point here, and wouldn't suit the story. Here, the core is survival, and the grim likelihood that at any moment, any one of your party might not make it to see the next day.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed playing Banner Saga. I enjoyed the art work, though at certain times the scenes were a bit long and repetative (such as watching your part slowly move across a backdrop that looks similar or repeated.) The whole Banner Saga universe is quite interesting, though I would have loved to learn more about the Varl.The same is simplistic in some ways, but the story itself is great. The different options you have for decision making, and the result of the decision making, seemed a bit random at times but in a hostile environment like your heroes face in the game, you never know how your story will go.I spent about 6 or 7 hours through my first play through and will likely go back and see whatever endings or outcomes I can get.

												The Banner Saga is a beautiful strategy game that has a beautiful artistic presentation. The story has depth, and the characters are well made.The game is a mix of strategy chess like style and traditional board game. The progress of the story is through a journey where the player can have a limited control in where it goes through choices. This will give re-playability value to see the different outcome.

I mean, there's a relatively major event that occurs, but instead of the story continuing to a point where the overall issues can be remotely resolved, the game ends. So... you're buying a third of a game where the rest may never be made.Otherwise, it's pretty and it plays pretty well.

												The BEST turn-based combat in video games.It is not an RPG, it is in fact a series of games of highly original chess with fantasy-like Scandinavia-themed pieces. And this chess is wrapped into a very engaging story where you make decisions which affect what pieces you're going to play the next game with. If you like sophisticated turn-based tactical combat (somewhat but not exactly similar to XCOM, Divinity: Original Sin, King's Bounty), you will appreciate it.			"

WHAT IS THE BANNER SAGA?The Banner Saga is an epic role-playing game inspired by Viking legend. She filled with dead gods, apocalyptic events and somber landscapes juxtaposed with beautiful shots of your caravan, all brought to life by breathtaking art and animations.The Banner Saga is set in a Nordic fantasy universe where giants (named varls) live alongside humans. The game alternates between two intertwining stories — one starring human archers Rook and his daughter Alette, and the other following a varl consortium led by Hakon.Over 25 playable characters, 7 different classes, each with unique abilities and upgrade options to fit your play style.Decisions have consequences. Every decision, no matter how small, render an impact on the story.Turn-based strategy. The turn-based tactical combat is reminiscent of classics.Renown is hard to come by — only success in battle will net you enough, and it's the only currency you can use to grab supplies and items. These, in turn, are necessary to keep you in fighting shape. It's a tough but fair system.The Banner Saga wants you to have to fight to stay alive, and I loved it for that. I could not put it down.

												The Banner Saga is not for everyone. I'm not everyone though I love the stories that are portrayed, the atmosphere, the music, the general melancholy vibe that I get from a lot of Nordic materials and other things that specify how Viking culture was in the Germanic age. Now with that being said I usually favor action based games, but this game is not that, and that's not bad. It makes me feel like my decisions matter in this universe that has been crafted in front of me and that's what I love about it. If I mess up then my party tells me and if I bring reknown to the party they exonerate and exalt me. It puts me in a different world where things matter and people depend on me. Great game definitely a buy for the price point. (y)			"

												I'd say that the metacritic score for TBS is fairly accurate. However, it isn't exactly a true traditional RPG as described. In fact it's a turn-based tactical RPG in the mould of Agarest etc. It is refreshingly original in its setting and themes and the combat is quite interesting. It appears to be a little on the short side and is not without other issues but, nevertheless, remains a very good game all round and there is at least a measure of replayability for those who like to discover alternate ways of completing the game. Its main drawback is that the ""random"" encounters just aren't random enough and trial and error will leave you knowing the best response to most situations. Faults aside, I really enjoyed playing this and its price presents good value for what you get. 80%			"

												I have to say, this game is an absolute success, probably my favorite genre of game (Fire Emblem-esque strategy rpg), and has a deep backstory and setting as well. That alone would make it 8/10 minimum, but I think the deciding factor for me was the type of situations they threw at you as far as being the leader of a caravan in a nigh-apocolyptic situation. It's bleak to say the least.The world seems to come apart at the seams at a wildly quick pace, it's an absolute nightmare to manage and navigate. I was robbed, beaten, betrayed, almost murdered, and lost a fifth of my caravan to attrition during a bad stretch of road that would have been survivable, if not for the previously mentioned murderous thieves. I lost at least two characters to unforeseen (not plot related) events, and I loved every second of it.It's a leadership simulation at it's finest, that does not coddle you at all. This game really drives the point that being a leader is not being a cheerleader and making speeches every ten seconds, or planning your every move like you're playing chess, it's making hard decisions. Making decisions that could as easily lose you half your supplies or kill your most valuable fighter, as gaining fighters that are direly needed, or creating a distraction so that your caravan may pass to the next town.It's incredibly shocking to lose in-game characters to out-of-combat events, but it really helped suck me into the game. I was completely immersed with the dire need to see that caravan through everything, and seeing that my decisions were being affected by conditions completely outside of my control could not have been more depressing. It was the kind of depression that comes with leadership, watching men die because you had chosen incorrectly, and having to pick yourself up and keep moving, because that's what the caravan needs. This is the kind of game that cements video games as a legitimate form of expression instead of childish escapism, and it does it tastefully without any pretentious subtext, very impressive for a kickstarter.

												I just finished the game mostly offline, so don't let my low hour record fool you.The Banner Saga is an imperfect jewel. It's clear that what it contains is beautiful, but there are a few problems. I won't go into it at length - the bottom line is that it's a great game and worth playing. One playthough will last you about 10-12 hours on Normal, well worth the cost of entry.To be brief: The game is beautiful, from stem to stern. Its visuals are like a hyper-realistic fever dream of Saturday morning cartoons drenched in the beauty of a thousand years of northern European history and design cues. The music from Austin Wintory (of Journey fame - the game, not the band) consistently floored me. You spend quite a bit of time simply watching your caravan mosey along from crushing disappointment to miserable turn of events to death and misery - and the music is what makes it intense and enjoyable.If I had to describe the gameplay, I would call it Oregon Trail Tactics Emblem. As you move from place to place on your journey, you are presented challenges. The right answer may not always be clear, but you always have to make a choice and reap whatever consequences or rewards that come. This makes every decision intense, as you weigh between three or four different possibilities, any one of which could lead you to starvation, death, or an unexpected moment of kindness. The battles are where the Tactics part comes into play. If you like Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, or XCOM, you're pretty familiar with how this works. There is a lot of room for strategy, employing big hulking Varl or your shield bearers to both block movement and set up counterattacks, while having your archers strategically placed to persecute weakened enemies.All of that sounds positive, and it is. However, here's the imperfect part: The story, while in my opinion quite good and entertaining, feels like the first few chapters of a book. Or like a story that ends at the beginning of the first part of what should be a trilogy - like Lord of the Rings just suddenly stopping at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring. It is a tremendous climax, coming at the end of a very difficult trial, with absolutely no resolution after the fact. I had bought up a huge amount of supplies expecting an epic journey afterward, and right after the following battle I was treated to a (very moving) cinematic and the credits.The reason I am annoyed by this is because I desperately wanted more. I was misty-eyed by the end, but ready to forge onward. It was, to say the least, disappointing. However, all I can do is hold out hope that Stoic produces a sequel worthy of picking up the banner and carrying onward.			"

The Banner Saga is a hand crafted masterpiece with hands down the best artwork I have seen in a game to date.The Banner Saga is the first in a trilogy of games where you play a hero given the responsiblity of leading a ragged caravan of fighters, faimilys and Varl (Giant horned Viking like charters often depicted in game art.) under your Banner - and tword saftey in a breaking world, where all races are forced into a struggle for resources and survival.Excellent writing leads to a well crafted feeling of the desperation of your situation and the story quickly draws you in. The choices are hard and often involve sacrifice making your decision really seem to matter.(I advise you skip all the online guides & tutorials for this game and just play by your wit.)Mixed in with the RPG format is a a unique turn based combat system you can really dig your teeth into, refreshing and challenging, a real tacticions treat.I can't recomend The Banner Saga enough, while it does have several shortcomings to do with choice and consequence they are vastly overshadowed by the great character of the game.Grab some coffee and buckle up your in for a real treat 9/10			"

It has turn based combat and its totally gripping some of the battles especially in my first run through were nail biting, real fights to the death. Great fun! Your choices do have an affect but not too much on the story. I have played it twice and although the story does take you pretty much on the same path, your choices do effect the characters and who will end up with you or not or dead. Theres some Rpg elements in building characters and buying or finding equipment also. It looks great as well, it is very stylized and looks awesome.Great little game!!			"

												I've put a couple hours in with TBS now, and I'm pleased. The game is beautiful, feels like playing an adult version of a Disney film, but you can tell that from the screenshots. It has a very interesting combat system, although it may be a bit tough if you aren't familiar with tactical rpg's. It reminds me a bit of Vandal Hearts if anyone remembers that game. The character progression system is also interesting, though it could be a little more explicit on things like what each stat really does. So far the story is compelling, and I do look forward to seeing it through, and possibly playing it multiple times to see what my choices may change. If you were a fan of Final Fantasy Tactics or anything of the like, pick this up, it's a good price and I think you will enjoy it.			"

												The Banner Saga's unique flavour first caught my attention when it was first hinted over a year ago.  It has a unique art style and the music and mood set a steady tone from the very beginning.  I expected a rich story and interesting characters and, while I wouldn't say that I'm disappointed, it does come off as a wounded product in some regards.Don't get me wrong!  I love the game and the story is deep and dark enough to add gravity to every decision you make.  The creators did an excellent job of giving the player powerful agency in developing their story--a weight and caution in your tactics that I have only seen elsewhere in Fire Emblem games.  The consequences of your actions are severe enough that you will take your time and address every issue with the true consideration of a leader of men and varl.  The pace of the game is also quite nice; I finished my playthrough in about eight hours.  I had expected more, but on the same note, I consider this game to have exceptional replay value.  I see myself completing it in full at least one more time, perhaps even a third.My gripes with the game generally submerged in the latter half.  The story is steady and alluring in the early chapters, but once you reach the halfway point, it begins struggling to play catch-up and develop the world it somewhat neglected while it was busy developing the characters and their conflict.  It's very rushed and, without spoiling anything here, it feels like every major event introduces more questions than it answers.  The end of the game does not feel so much like the end of a game as the end of a single episode.  It is my hope that Banner Saga 2 will come to be and fill in the blanks.  Voice acting would have done wonders to add further depth to this story as well and I hope the creators will keep that aim in mind.All in all, while I may have had somewhat unfair and lofty expectations from a game that brandished such a beautiful first impression, I would say that I remain pleased with the result.  This game is well worth your dollar and I hope that you will play through it more than once to experience the variety in the secrets of paths less travelled.  Cheers!			"

												What's here is very engaging, the problem is it's not all here.  Saying ""The Banner Saga is the first part of a planned trilogy"" at the bottom of the expanded ""read more"" section apparently gives the dev team carte blanche to dice up a cohesive story and sell it to you one part at a time.In a trilogy each episode has to stand on its own, have its own arcs and resolutions even if it's part of a greater arc.  The Banner Saga leaves everything up in the air, ending abruptly after terminating a single minor character arc in a moment of cutscene-forced incompetence.  It isn't a natural end to a story, in context it begins way more character development than it concludes and it feels as though the game is just throwing up its hands and saying ""that's about a third of the story, roll credits.""Imagine if Baldur's Gate II ended right after you arrive in the Kuo-Toa city, or if Dragon Age: Origins cut off when the Antivan Crows ambush you, then they asked you to buy the rest of the game a few months down the line.  Cutting this story up the way they have they didn't even try to bring the game to a natural conclusion, they're simply forcing it to be a trilogy.The aesthetics are solid, the combat is serviceable and the caravan mechanics reinforce the tone and setting of the game.  But the bottom line is you're coming to this game for the narrative and your agency within it, that's what you want from a team with this pedigree and that's what it's being sold on.  It's a good story well told, but it stumbles massively on a single bad design choice that thoroughly spoils the experience as a stand-alone game.Other quibbles: lack of cloud and controller support.Assuming the quality of the writing remains consistent buy it when you can pick up all 3 in a bundle.  As it is now, I cannot recommend it.			"

												A very good game. The story is excellent. The only flaws it has is that the combat system could be deeper and that the end of the game is a bit open. The daily events on the journeys are nice to see and that even something you made a long time ago can affect the story near the end. Overall the game had me addicted until I was through, only a sandbox mode would me amazing.			"

												OMG... this game pretty much has it all. Beautifull graphics, perfect sound and score. It makes you think in the battles. Devs you did an outstanding job in fact very few game have acheived this high of level in gaming. The only other game that had perfect music with graphics with gamplay was Skyrim. You guys for first timers are just outstanding. Only one problem that I had and it wasn't even game breaking. Was when selecting you next place in the first city to goto. The words blended into the background to where they could bearly be seen. But over all you guys made a very impressive game. The drawings and attention to the details of the characters is what these big companies need to go back to and learn something from you guys. I did pre order the game and wasn't at all let down from it.			"

												The Banner Saga is a game with an original concept that I would describe as a union between consequence heavy strategy games like Final Fantasy Tactics and a pioneering simulator like Oregon Trail where you have to manage resources and make hard decisions that effect your journey in unexpected ways.On paper, this sounds amazing, especially when you start to be engrossed by the powerful artwork and storytelling of the designers.Unfortunately, I've reached a kind of personal impasse with The Banner Saga, which ironically is due at least in part to the orginal intent of the designers.  The journey these characters are taking is meant to be bleak and arduous, and playing the game feels like an extention of this as the days slog on: you have been starving for weeks, the characters you've invested the most resources in have died inexplicably, and on top of it all, you face the endless hordes of monotonous battle vs the same enemies over and over and over again.So for now, for my own sanity, despite my admiration of the creators intent and craft, I can't go on.  I can't help wondering if this is a personal flaw and not one of the games design.(note:  the designers have a patch planned which will lower the difficulty of the notoriously difficult last battle)			"

												8/10 Beautifully tragic taleI finished this game and now I have a sad.While I recommend this game, I know it's not for everybody. The turn based combat system at its heart draws a lot of fire, but a lot more praise. This can be tried beforehand, I suggest you take a look by playing the free ""Factions"" game. If the fighting, and the artstyle appeal to you, then by the love of the dead gods get the full game and then make hard choices about your caravan. The caravan part is superficially like Oregon Trail with a twist. The RPG parts with developing a team of heroes fit for a saga takes a lot of thought. keeping your playable heroes alive and content to the final showdown is a lot harder than it sounds, and you can't just throw around the loots and promotions. Watching somebody run charging into a horde of enemies withh your best rare magic item and half your caravan's XP is a real tragedy, especially with the permadeath...			"

This happened to me, not in-game, but after playing nearly 7 hours straight of The Banner Saga, the first game I backed on Kickstarter that has given me every penny's worth and MORE. It's a rare blend of Game of Thrones, Disney flicks of yore and ""Choose your own adventure"" that will engulf you in it's rich history and keep you on the edge while watching 2D caravans march through the land.Don't buy DayZ or Rust.Give the good people of Stoic your money instead, they also need to be rewarded for making good decisions.

												The Banner Saga Reviewby DaniAngione----------------------------Art - 9 / 10Sound - 9 / 10Gameplay - 8 / 10Emotional - 10 / 10Community - 9 / 10----------------------------Overall - 9----------------------------The Banner Saga; I've never heard of this game until the multiplayer spin-off, Factions, came to Steam. Only after that I've googled it and realized that Stoic's kickstarter campaign passed under my radar. And that was most unfortunate for me, because we're talking about a game that breathes norse mythology, is beautifully crafted with hand-drawn artwork inspired by '1950-60s Disney genious' Eyvind Earle and has an amazing soundtrack by Austin Wintory, the guy behind the musical score from Playstation's big indie hit 'Journey': the only game that makes me cry like a baby after EVERY god damn playthrough.So, yeah. How did I miss that Kickstarter? I don't know. What I know is that since discovering about Banner Saga I've hyped it so much inside my head that I dare say that, in a way, it was a little disappointing. But not in a way that compromises the game - just in a way that doesn't satisfy the 'almost-fetichist' personal desire I built up for this.You start playing as Ubin, a varl (horned giants) that leads a tax caravan through the frontier cities between the varl lands and the human cities. After some time, however, you get to meet and play as Rook, a small village huntsman, and Alette - his daughter. They're being chased by Dredge, these humanoid stone creatures that seem to be quite strong and suddenly start pouring from everywhere. From there on the game is a long and arduous road for survival - as simple as that.Putting it that way, however, doesn't make justice for the beautiful landscapes, the amazing characters and the incredible tale you'll weave along the way. And more importantly: death is around every corner. Choices are tough, choices are insecure and you'll find yourself questioning your own morals for the sake of the people that follows you. Sometimes you'll have to be harsh, sometimes you'll be kind... And might even regret it later. Or be rewarded, even. There's nothing sure in The Banner Saga. Nothing is guaranteed, so it's advised to be careful about who you're going to care about.I'd certainly give Art and sound a 10 - I'm giving a 9 for two reasons: for art, I must admit that the initial cutscene is so beautiful that the game left me wanting more. There is, however, no more fully animated cutscenes. Not even the ending. So I was a little disappointed there. And for 'sound', the reason is very similar: sometimes I miss some voices or a better use of 'human sounds'. For a game that clutches you so deeply on emotions and attachment, it feels a little out of place that all dialogue is only written.Gameplay works well. It's not great but it's enjoyable. The fighting mechanics are good and I really liked the balancing and tactics around armor and strength. I wish there was a little more variety, but that's not a big deal.Emotionally... Well, just play it. I recommend you don't, ever, load your game when something bad happens. Seriously. It's a game about a journey - a true viking saga - and about the pain and the loss and the sadness in said journeys. It's a game about decisions, a game about caring for those you love and losing them because YOU thought that this was the best thing to do... And it wasn't. This is very, very functional as a player-driven narrative. And if you take the plunge into the fantastic and beautiful world of The Banner Saga, it will reward you intensively. I assure you.Community, well... I didn't play the multiplayer part much, but a few rounds have shown me that people are nice and fun, so I suppose it's ok.Overall, The Banner Saga is a beautiful yet silent game. And by silent I mean that it has a lot to offer but you have to go there, you have to take it's hand and walk into the forest. If you do - you'll be so immersed that when you're done you'll realize that we are just guests upon the land...PS.: Just a warning - this game is the first part of a TRILOGY. Don't expect much closure, all will be explained in time...			"

												This is not a fun game, this is an experience. The choices you make will be hard, and there's almost never a right one. Thinking about the choices in a video game sense won't help you either. oh you bought all the supplies from a store so you know you'll have food? thieves stole it. The combat is spot on, in some of the best strategy combat I've ever played. It's hard, tight and engaging, almost never will you get through a battle without someone falling. The story is interesting, and you'll find yourself caring for the characters in your party or hating them, especially when they make decisions for you, sometimes even against you. It adds to their personality and makes them feel more like people. This game has an incredibly strong sense of narrative, lose a battle, you'd expect it to just ask ""try again?"" like most games would, but it doesn't, losing a battle is like making a choice, it will affect what happens to your party, how people treat you, and what decisions you are limited to. This is not a game for the faint of heart, no because it's scary, or intense but because of it's ability to make you stare at the screen and think ""well, what the hell am I supposed to do now?"". The game makes you care about this group of people that you control and must lead to survive, going to the ends of the world, or to death.			"

												I would highly recommend this game for anyone who is a big fan of Viking lore and RPG team building. The battle system is good on all accounts but nothing fancy here and there though - items being limited and all. But the good experience I had from this game was from it's story. While choice-wise, decision making in the game can feel arbitrary, I get that the developer guys wanna bring out a bleak setting for the protagonists. There is no best ""happy"" ending in this fairy tale, and people do die even the good ones. Enemies can be trusted allies and good friends can back stab you at any moment's notice. This is the reality the characters in the game must face when food became scarce, a horde of murderous army is upon them - while doomsday is emminent.Get this game - probably not for the gameplay - but definitely for its storyline, artwork, soundtrack and your casual leisure.

												A wonderful little gem I found at the Steam Sales. If you're a fan of North-European Mythology (from which the game draws inspiration), Strategy RPG's (think: Shining Force) and an epic storyline, then look no further. The world is ending, a horde of iron giants is invading and you can feel the desperation growing as the game progresses, and you lead an ever growing (or shrinking, depending on how things go) caravan of clansmen across the known world.The main currency is Reknown, which is used to buy food and items, but also to upgrade your units, leading to difficult decisions: will you invest in more food to keep casualties minimized? Or will you level up your units for the battles ahead?			"

You can get about 15-20 hours of gameplay out of this game without repeating the exact same content twice, which is pretty good for the price.

												Viking themed strategy RPG. Basically its about the world is going under, much like Ragnarök foretold and the giant serpent, much like Midgårdsormen, is destroying the world.  the story is told through two diffrent parties, that later join up with each other, basically one is from the perspective of a hunter and his daughter who later lead a tribe and the other is through a bunch of Varls, giant with horns, who acts and behaves like Dwarfs. Both sides fight and flee the Dredges,  who are basically like orcs in armor that is killing everyone and destroying anything. It plays just like an ordinare SRPG with leveling, equipments,turnbased combat on grids etc but has an unique spin on breaking down armor before doing damage on enemies. This means you have to think carefully if your gonna break down someones armor fast for a fast kill, or breaking down their strenght to make sure the same enemy cant dish out a lot of damage fast. And makes you build up parties in which you make walking tanks with a lot of armor, and other weak, but hard hitting fighters. The graphic and soundtrack is amazing - def 9/10. Great viking music with insanely beautiful backrounds as you travel around in the world.Also, the caravn part where you have to handle supplies and make sure you have enough supplies for your trops is pretty fun but ... whatever choice you pick - your caravan will be ""beeep"" beep"" beep"" which fits into this ragnarök theme and the world is going under I guess...Anyway I give this game 8.5/10, it ends just when things is getting intresting :O Also, this game reminds me nothing of Sword Art Online, but It should.

												This game is not a sandbox storytelling game like King of Dragon Pass or Crusader Kings II. It's far too linear for that, even though you can somewhat influence where the story branches at certain points. Don't expect too much control over things.This game isn't that much of a turn-based tactics battler. Sure, the combat is okayish and gives you something to do in addition to clicking through dialogue, but I never found the fights that engaging and at times it was dull and repetitive. There are way more interesting turn-based combat games out there, don't grab this if that's what you're looking for.However, this game is a pretty good visual novel! The story and characters were interesting, the world is mysterious and the art and music side is well done. If you want to experience a pretty gripping viking fantasy survival story, this game works. Well, at least until the end, when there's not enough closure and it becomes pretty obvious that this is actually The Banner Saga: Episode 1 and it's definitely building up to a sequel. At least the game doesn't over-explain things so the sense of mystery remains.Still, if you enjoy nice hand-painted visuals and very light RPG story elements and just want to be told a neat story, this is a decent experience for that. Just don't expect any sprawling larger-than-life epic, this is quite quickly over even though the world and lore probably could support a larger game in the same setting.			"

It has one of the best tactical battles systems I have played, and I have played almost all tactical turn based games since 2000. Its also an work of art. The game is worth recommending simply as a visual experience.My suggestions for the next installment - allow open ended explorations, stuff like raids etc. Some sort of sandbox mode. I think the ingredients are all there. And I dont think it should be too difficult to do.Cheers to Stocic. "

												Played this game for the first few minutes, and you quickly get immersed. The music and beautiful scenery complement each other, setting the mood for this breathtaking epic. As you go along through the story, you meet new groups that travel the land and see the different areas of this vast world of Banner saga. Your groups run into interactive scenarios that change your storyline so there is a few careful choices you have to make. This game has a decent tutorial mode as you start, teaching you the units of the game, as well as placement ranges for your attacks, plus learning the perks in battle. Overall, this game has very little flaws and the story is engaging that spans for quite some hours. Definitely worth the 20$ that I have spent.Overall grade: 9.5 / 10Pros:- Breathtaking storyline- Stunning Visuals- Engaging Score, sets the mood nicely- Battles are well done, can set difficulty if it gets too hardCons:- Save states are always automatic, can't manually save and go back			"

												I really really wanted to like this game. The developers have put forth a laudable effort in the aesthetic arena, and the game mechanics are surprisingly tolerable for an unadulterated turn-based scheme. While this offering is apparently only the first of a forthcoming trilogy, there is simply no exuse to end the game so abruptly. As someone who enjoys games primarily for the story, such an unsatisfying denouement taints the whole experience. The rest of the package is developed to a point that is more than satisfactory, but when a game is centred around the plot it seems rather silly to leave in such precarious shape. I won't delve into details, but a significant proportion of the interesting strands of the plot remain unresolved (or worse, unexplained to begin with) and the tale's rather clichéd conclusion fails to have any emotional impact due to the lack of character development over such a short timeline. Unfortunately for me, The Banner Saga (at this point) remains a cautionary tale of how not to deliver on a very promising premise. Again, I really wanted to like the game... but I didn't.			"

												This game is fantastic.  War is coming, the world is ending.  Blast the viking music as you strike down your foes.  Decide what to do on the road.  Do you take time to raid that village for supplies when the enemy is hot on your heels, do you lead the charge in battle.  Do you set a raging inferno for your enemies?  Your choices have weight, the combat is meaty, and in this game, unlike many, your decisions matter, mechanically, emotionally, it's got it all.  It is only through glory that one may enter valhalla!			"

												The Banner Saga is a convoy management game with turn-based strategy fights that augment your heroes and convoy, and ultimately affects the future of your game.In terms of art direction and theme, they strike such a dischordant tone, it might actually hurt your head. Not that either the art or theme are bad. The art is good and the story seems solidly written. Except they're totally opposite. The art is colourful, vibrant and almost child-like in its presentation. The story is about death, hard decisions, starvation and single parent trying to raise a young girl in an uncontrollable apocalypse.Like a WWII history documentary as illustrated by My Little Pony.The game itself has strong central mechanics, and the turn based combat is good. The heroes level up with kills in an RPG style. The elements are solid, and if the final battle wasn't an exercise in throwing everything the game had taught you out the window, it might have recieved a thumbs up from me.It's supposed to be the start of a three part series, but they've made the mistake of not creating the first of the trilogy as a self contained story. It feels like a beginning, like you've wasted time on getting nowhere, and though it purports to be a story driven by your choices, it isn't, your decisions affect nothing but your hero roster.			"

												This game is not a sandbox storytelling game like King of Dragon Pass or Crusader Kings II. It's far too linear for that, even though you can somewhat influence where the story branches at certain points. Don't expect too much control over things.This game isn't that much of a turn-based tactics battler. Sure, the combat is okayish and gives you something to do in addition to clicking through dialogue, but I never found the fights that engaging and at times it was dull and repetitive. There are way more interesting turn-based combat games out there, don't grab this if that's what you're looking for.However, this game is a pretty good visual novel! The story and characters were interesting, the world is mysterious and the art and music side is well done. If you want to experience a pretty gripping viking fantasy survival story, this game works. Well, at least until the end, when there's not enough closure and it becomes pretty obvious that this is actually The Banner Saga: Episode 1 and it's definitely building up to a sequel. At least the game doesn't over-explain things so the sense of mystery remains.Still, if you enjoy nice hand-painted visuals and very light RPG story elements and just want to be told a neat story, this is a decent experience for that. Just don't expect any sprawling larger-than-life epic, this is quite quickly over even though the world and lore probably could support a larger game in the same setting.			"

												Its rare when a computer game is able to convey the feelings and connection to a story that normally only a book can. Banner Saga is much a case. The game is predominantly its story and its unfolding through your own actions.I wont go into the details of the story, because it would be a shame to spoil any of it. Suffice to say that it is heavily influenced by Northern European Mythology and that it takes place in a similarly cold and ""bleak"" setting.The game inter-mixes tactical strategy with graphic adventure elements very well, even if the combat and character traits are somewhat simplistic. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter cause once again its all about the story. A story that is most of all, well told.It is this point that makes the game great, as the developers have managed to convey the story and a multitude of emotions that manage (in a very short time span) to tie you (emotionally) to many of the characters and their situations.Don't expect action sequences or cinematic or anything of the sort, the graphics are reminiscent of hand drawn Disney classics and the accompanying music is superb.While there are alternative paths to the end (and different endings apparently), I believe that the average person will not bother to go through a second play-through, if nothing else mostly because they will be satisfied with it enough to not want to spoil it.So at the end of the day if you like story driven games (and can enjoy a fantasy setting), don't miss this game, it is quite the experience.

												I do not recommend and am disappointed of the game because:- the core element, the fights, are very repetetive and do not offer a great variety of strategic possibilites. Also, you might have a choice not to fight, but wont be able to upgrade your characters or earn any reknown otherwise. (Yes, you can get little reknown for other good choices, but far from enough) This renders the fight necessary but boring.- the story only scratches the surface of what would have been possible. The game stops with the first real boss and shortly after all the main characters are introduced. It also leaves a big story gap in between the two main ""armies"".- the ""choices"" you can make will all end in the same story progress and actually all your choices will make everything worse, like being kind to people will almost always end in you being screwed over by these people, and you wont get any reknown. - the ""armies"" lack significance. It doesnt matter how big your army is. At least it didnt matter in my play-throughs. At one point i had only 3 varls in my army and could defeat the enemies army by charging in.- the atmosphere lacks depth. The pictures are beautifully painted and the army wandering the lands look great. But the characters remain static, because their depictions are static and do seldomly show emotions. I couldnt connect to any of them. Also, it seemed to me that any character you like will die anyway, no matter what you do. - the way the story is told is patchy at best. Important or emotional scences are just told as text without any visual or audial aid. Ok, videos are expensive to make, but a picture or speech would have been possible. Like the scene where you can decide weather to take the enemies child with you or not. This scene remains hollow and undetached.+The story, the music, the artwork is great, but its just not a whole game.PS: I backed this game from the beginning. Not unlike Broken Age, it feels very short and shallow.			"

												As a person who likes turn based strats HoMM, Disciples, KingsBounty I had high hopes for this game. After finishing it for the most part on normal difficulty I want to but I really cant reccomend people buying it. The good : Amazing visuals, animation and sountrack. Thats about it. The bad: it would be easy to say everything else but im going to elaborate.With such an amazing score and visuals the game has virtually no voicework to accompany the dialogues. Which would ok if it werent for hte fact that they are either poorly translated or just badly written. You can skip 90% of the dialogue and still be on the same page if you had been paying attention.The unitally cool and challenging combat quickly becomes boring or unfair depnding in you difficulty level. There arent many different enemies so you end fighting the same 4-5 guys for 9 hours and the strategy never evolves beyond gang up on the weak guy. The special abilities of each hero are very situational and I maybe used 3 abilities regulary. Some mechanics are downright broken. The demand for provisions to supply the caravan is completely optional since there virtually no penatly to loosing clansmen/varl. The renown points (with which the game is very stingy) are better spent on your crew and gear.  Beware some party memebers are prone to sudden death during the random encours on the road. So dont be surpised if a badass warhawk level 5 gets killed by dregeling off screen with little infleunce by the player.Despite the strong visual and audio presentation the story is moot and the characters never evolve beyond thier booring achetypes. The pampered prince, the innocent girl, the reluctant leader etc. Over all I would say stay away from this beatiful siren fo a game no matter how tempting the and song lull you to its purchase "

												I don't know where to start on this so I guess i'll just state my conclusion and work back from there:Should you buy this at the current price 24.99(usd), No. Should you buy it if it's on sale at around 75%? Hell yeah!There are many problems i have with this game but there are also some things that were done right that i found as well. Here's list of things I found and you all can be the judgePro's:Pretty cool story, when all is said and done.The whole leading the caravan part of the game, awesome, felt like i was playing the war scenes from a game of thronesAll the characters had pretty decent stories and personalitiesThe combat was pretty cool once you got the hang of it. Think tactics ogre mixed in with some wierd type of chessArt fit the feel of the game perfectlyCon's:You obviously set yourself up for a sequel. By this i mean, there are good cliff hangers that leave me thinking ""oh, well what are they going to do now?"" and then there's  ones that leave me saying ""What the ♥♥♥♥ you spent all this ♥♥♥♥ing time mentioning these things that your not even going to tell me about? Seriously? Not even a hint?""; the later of which you did, and i'm kinda upset about that.There are bugs still in this I had it crash a couple times on me and the load times for the graphics in the game are pathetic. Borderlands 2 loads quicker than this game does for me. (check out ivrir's story background after that big thing to him happens, btw, it's bugged)Game feels rushed half way through, and heres why i say that:You just randomly stop switching between rook and what's his horned face. Just stop. You could've totally split off with him and gone off on his on journey up to the point that he regroups, but you didn't and i was kinda disappointed.You're ending is abrupt, i wasn't quite sure that i hit the end untill the credits popped up.There are 2 GAPING WIDE plot points that never really come to surface, which is too bad becuase I kind of wanted to see more of it.]The army combat parts are a little lacking. Honestly, I felt like i  could have led a charge the entire time and been better off.I would have like to actually have command of my armies as well instead of just saying how to engage. A perfect example of how i'd've liked this game to play the army scenes would be Suikoden. Do some like that with your army combat.In conclusion(again), Don't buy this game unless its on sale or the cost has gone down to around 10-15$ and you'll be much much happier. Took me about 14 hours to complete and i was a terrible leader who told every one to do what they want, which i'm sure divertered most combat situations, so i could see this game lasting at most 20 hrs on the first play through.

												If viking Oregon trail and a turn based tactics game had a baby it'd be a lot like banner saga. First thing you will notice about the banner saga is the art, rotoscoping isn't something that you see everyday let alone in a video game and the bannar saga excels at making each person, place or thing you encounter on your journey really come to life with beauty.Speaking of journey the music in this game is composed by Austin Wintory who did the music for the game Journey. The entire game sounds fantastic from the heavy beating of drums to the triumphant bellow of horns the entire sounds epic from start to finish.As I said before the game really feels like a great mix of turn based tactics and Oregon trail. Combat takes place on a grid and you and the enemy take turns bashing each other. With each character having different strengths and weaknesses and a simple yet deeping twist on how your units health works the game really makes you feel accomplished for each and ever battle you win. That is a good thing because honestly this like to give you a bad hand a lot.The other half of the game is the traveling part, as you and your viking caravan cross mountians and icy wastes you must deal with a number of issues such as ""Do we have enough food?"" ""Can we trust these strangers we just met?"" The game makes you choose and everything you do has an effect on the caravan as a whole. Letting some strangers join you might mean they steal a bunch of the food in the night and then suddenly you are in the middle of nowhere and people are starving to death right and left as you push forward. You must make tough choices often times sacrificing one resource or another while trying to keep the people and warriors you take on in good spirits.In the end the Banner saga is a deep game with rich lore and a enduring characters and it's a adventure worth taking.

												God we need more games like this one! The Banner Saga is the first part of an ambitions adventure game created by indie developers. The gameplay is quite simple but entertaining and enhanced with 3 levels of difficulty. The level design is gorgeous, it's deeply inspired by the art of Eyvind Earle but it still has it's own identity. Anyway it's the story that makes this game different from other RPG/Adventure games.First, the world is a perfect mixture between nordic mythology, fantasy and apocalyptic fiction. The story is about survival and beliefs, in this chaotic snowy and cold landscape three races try to escape the forthcoming shadows. This first part is centered on the story of Rook, a hunter, who try desperately to save his kin and his traveling companions from starvation, killing each other and from the dredge's return. The story really evolves depending of your choices, you can build strong relations with some characters and at the same time don't even meet the other ones. You can easily loose your best mates after making a mistake that seemed to be the good thing to do at the time. It makes the story really moving, mature and immersive. And personally that's why I play video games, not to kill dozens of monsters but to feel something. I'm waiting for the second part with great excitement and you should do the same !			"

												A shining example of what developers can do when given the freedom to create their own product within a set budget. I simply couldn't stop playing it once I started. The story draws you in, it's written to a mature audience and each character has a real feeling of authenticity to them. Then the gameplay hits you. If you like making strategic choices that have true consequences and you aren't afraid of tough decisions, then you'll love it. What I love most about the strategy and choices in The Banner Saga is that there are multiple ways in which you are given choices, not continuously being asked whether you want to loot a village or continue on. Instead you make choices about who to side with, choices about how to manage your caravan of fighters, choices in the heat of battle, and choices about how to spend your limited resources (more supplies to keep you going or upgrading heroes through stats and items).This game lets you make those choices, and lets you deal with the consequences.Edit: Oh and how could I forget the visuals, this game is beautiful to look at, the caravan scenes are gorgeous and the character drawings are delicious.

The story is interesting, following more than one character through this epic journey. Your stuck making morale choices for a whole group of people and you care about whether they live or die, even though you haven't met many of them, your characters care enough to make you show the same amount of affection for them. You feel like a leader, striving to survive against a seemly endless enemy and hopless odds. This has and is one of the most enjoyable experiences in gaming I have ever had and I highly recommend it to any and everyone!			"

												I'd like to preface this review with some advice for playing it: In combat, weaken your enemies to about 1-3 health before starting to kill them, because the more enemies you kill, the more turns their surviving comrades get. People not getting this and getting beaten constantly is the number one source of criticism I see - people don't like it the combat because they don't understand this. To be fair to these people, the game never explains this, you have to learn it on your own. If you learn to use this approach early you'll get a lot more out of the game.The way this game presents choices is a breath of a fresh air. To contrast with BioWare, where the major choices are all set pieces in Banner Saga they're presented much more organically. I've yet to beat the game, but already the story feels very personal based on my choices, compare this with other RPGs, where you often don't see the outcome of your decisions until the end.*Possible Spoilers Below*Something that's very interesting is the use of two protagonists. They manage to make playing as each caravan feel very different, in a good way. In one it's all about war and diplomacy, in the other it's all about desperation and survival. The different feel of playing as each is much appreciated.*End Possible Spoilers*The combat is incredibly satisfying. Normally, I prefer real time with pause combat, but Banner Saga's system is great. It's very tactical without feeling overwhelming.The music and the art are just phenomenal. I can't do them justice here.The world building is also great. It manages to draw effectively on Norse mythology and culture without feeling derivative. There's lots of familar imagery and themes but they're presented in a very fresh way. I'm playing the game as much to find out what happened in the world's past as I am to find out where the story goes. The setting is one of the game's biggest triumphs.EDIT: Having now finished the game I'd like to add some more thoughs. The game as a whole is fantastic. I can't wait for the next episode - I want to see how my choices will affect the rest of the story. More than that, after the events of this episode I'm very excited to see how certain characters develop. The character writing is very, very strong. I was surprised just how attached I became to some members of my party. There are some truly memorable personalities in this game.The major set pieces of game are also fantastic. There are a couple of situations that you face that spread over multiple in game days, where you will be forced to make a lot of hard choices in rapid succession that are truly epic. I can't say any more than that as I couldn't imagine a greater disservice than spoiling in any fashion the two events I have in mind.EDIT2: I'd like to add, if you liked The Walking Dead you'll enjoy Banner Saga. The characterisation of the protagonist and approach to choices are very similar and the stories even have some similar themes.			"

												Blown away by this game. Excellent decision based story. It does a great job of clearly putting a choice in front of you, without tying you down with a morality guage (light/dark side, paragon/renegade). The combat is fun and engaging, although I found myself always wishing it was over so I could further the story. Solid RPG elements, great Oregon Trail management, but last but not least gripping characters and plot. This is the old BioWare we all miss. My biggest complaint was going in I was not aware it was the first of a trilogy, so be ready for it to end with you wanting more character development and plot.			"

												A good game, but not amazing.  I'm rather baffled at some of the gameplay decisions the designers made for the combat.  The tactics are actually pretty flat, largely owing to completely flat battle maps and chess-like mechanics that encourage you to beat down your enemies but not finish them off.The caravan management system is nice, but much too linear for my tastes - there's a map, but not much point to it since you have little choice in destination or even route you take.  Resource management definitely could have used more balancing.  There's a single game currency - renown - that acts as both your money and your experience points.  This is designed to force you to make hard decisions between having enough supplies to keep your clansmen fed and having heroes powerful enough to beat the challenges they face.  In truth, you'll often find yourself short on both starting at around the half-way point of the game and continuing right up until the ending.I'm not sorry I kickstarted the game, but had I known the end result I probably wouldn't have given quite as much money as I did.  Like I said, a good game, but not amazing.  The most frustrating thing is that I feel like it could have been amazing with some tweaks - the writing and the art direction are definitely there.  I'd give it a 7/10.			"

THe choices that are presented to you throughout the game also have consiqence, and I quite often found myself stopping at a decision and painfully trying to work out what the results of my actions might be.Overall I would really reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys something different and appreciates a good story!

It does really well at building connection with the characters, then forces you to make decisions that can have gut-wrenching consequences. The plot twists are frequent, unpredictable and unforgiving.I'd heard mixed reviews, so didn't try it out until a sale. There's some valid points made against it, but overall its a well polished game especially for the price. It's worthwhile just as a really beautifully told story, but the turn based combat is fun and challening too. I hope they add DLC or a whole new chapter.			"

												This game is essentially The Oregon Trail, but with a Nordic fantasy theme and a rudimentary turn-based combat system akin to Final Fantasy Tactics or X-Com (but with substantially less depth). The art style is refreshing, and the lovingly crafted world is enjoyable to immerse in for a while. Unfortunately, it is a very short while; most players will find themselves wanting more content after the final battle. Buy the game if it is on sale for less than $20 and I suspect you will feel rewarded by the purchase. In my opinion, the $25 price point is just a bit too high for the amount of gameplay you get.I sincerely hope that a sequel is in the works; one with a hundred hours of gameplay and a more robust combat system. This is a world I'd like to inhabit again.			"

												The game doesn't demand much from your PC/Mac but stills delivers a very nice gameplay, artstyle and music. Its pretty hardcore in that you can't do manual saves (just auto-saves) and thus forces you to live with the decisions you've made. If you want to undo a decision you made, you have to go back to the last auto-save which sometimes might involve fighting certain battles again to rereach the point when the decision was made.I feel that this gives the gameplay more dept though can lead to some frustrations especially once you made a command that leads to the death of some characters.All in all, I really enjoy playing this game. If you're a fan of turn-based startegy games like FF Tactics with added decision making, this game is highly recommended. "

												If you're a fan of tactical strategy games, this is more than worth your time.  The grid-based fights are different from anything else I've played in the genre, tying your remaining health to your ability to do damage, incentivizing keeping your party in good health.  There's a real emphasis on fighting against a team, as a team, and once you start to hang back and create opportunities the strategic depth really shines through.The heroes/caravan/item system strung on top of the combat is well put together and systemized in a fun way, harkening back a bit to things like the Oregon trail.  There seems to be a number of decision points strung through the story that can create some interesting divergences, resulting in losing/gaining new heroes, as well as the permanent death of major characters. The animation style of the game is fantastic, 2d artwork in the style of say, old Ralph Bakshi movies from the 70s and 80s.  It's a fairly unique look for a game in this genre.  Music is fantastic, by the always on point Austin Wintory.Definitely worth your time.			"

												The Banner Saga is an excellent turn-based RPG, where decisions you make affect the outcome of the story and changes the lives of the games characters.  The story is engrossing and revolves around a march to save your kinsmen from danger.  You lean to care about the people in your caravan, which make some of the decisions you have to make very difficult.  Although, this also gives the game a lot of replay value, as you strive to make better decisions, and protect more people in your caravan.  Decisions are more than just choosing when to fight, or dialogue choices; when it comes down to it the entire game is a decision of how best to spend your resources.  Do you buy supplies for your caravan to help you get to the next area? OR upgrade your combat team? Or buy items to have your combat team? They each use the same resource, so you have to decide where to put your limited resource.  Even choosing how often and when to rest effects gameplay.The combat is isometric turn-based, and involves a lot of strategy, and can at times, be surprisingly challenging.  There are three game modes, to provide more or less challenge to the player.  Hard mode being very challenging indeed.Overall an enjoyable experience that will leave you wanting more.  As soon as I finished the game, I began researching if there was to be a sequel, and I was pleased to hear the play is for this game to be part of a trilogy.Definitely worth playing, and highly recommended.

												Interesting start to a new franchise. Not perfect by any meaning, but for what its worth, I had fun, was gripped by the story and moral choices and while the ending is *SPOILERS* a HUGE cliffhanger *SPOILERS* , I hope this game gets a sequel to expand on the story and universe.The bad things:-The game is really hard. Even on the easiest difficulty. But this doesnt need to be a bad thing, since loosing characters is integrated into the storyline and can help shape the story of each playthrough new.-Its not terribly long...if you do everything right, the campaign is done in around...8-9 hours, maybe less if you are more skilled and just accept the outcome of your choice instead of save scumming because a certain event left you with a sour taste.-The story starts promising, has a huge buildup, a dramatic climax...and a really bad cliffhanger. I won't spoil much more, but lets say that unless the devs actually get a sequel done (which may or may not fail depending on their current conflict with King.com over the word Saga in their title), this will be a huge dissapointment, not unlike other promising projects like Kingdoms of Amalur or Loom.That said, its not too pricey and definitly a nice spin on the genre. So I can recommend it if you dont mind the above drawbacks and like challenging turn-based strategy rpgs.			"

												Utterly amazing game, truly what inspires what people want to see when they hear 'role playing game', this is a true SRPG.  Many strategy games seem to lack this essence, this game has it spot on more than any in years for it's calaber and genra. Don't get me wrong, as much as I enjoyed this game, it was also too short, while replayability is high, you are essentially playing nordic organ trail after all---It simply leaves you wanting more.I'd part with 10 USD to play this if given a proper price range to assume my moneys worth.

												I really loved playing this game, the story is engaging and even the smallest of choices feels as though it has meaning. The battle system takes a little getting used to (I kept failing to get my raned units within range of the enemy at first), but is very good. The story and choices are the main part of the game for me though, as they're more engaing than the battles. I definately agree wuth the comparison to GoT as you do feel characters may be killed off at any moment if you aren't careful.  One decision I actually decided to sleep on as I knew it would probably be a bit of a game changer and I was torn between two options.The only thing I would say is a big downside to the game is that it is the 1st part of a trilogy so the game stops very suddenly. The price and the descrition do not prepare you for this and some people may feel a bit ripped off by it as you aren't getting a full game. However I got it on sale so don't mind as much (although I am dying to know what happens next). I would say Steam should make a note of this being a ""Part 1"" so people know the emotional turmoil they will be in upon finishing the game.			"

												Firstly, this game is incomplete in terms of story. The developers have tried to make The Banner Saga complete on it's own as best as possible, but depending on the success (which has been good so far 25/01/2014), they will make Banner Saga 2 and hopefully 3 and or more.The game has beautiful art, although it is repeated throughout the game, it's still amazing to see the line work, balance of colours and Disney quality environments. The music is simply exquisite.There is a moderate learning curve involved as the tutorial is weak & combat mechanics may take a while to get used to. You can test out combat mechanics/strategies in training camp during your travels whenever you camp to rest. Throughout the game you will come across situations where you will have to make choices that can affect your party & caravan. If you're unsure, try out the free multiplayer version ""Banner Saga : Factions"" to see if this is the sort of game that appeals to you & if you like it, don't hesistate to get this beautiful game.The soundtrack on Steam store page only has three tracks, so if you're interested in the complete soundtrack, go to http://austinwintory.bandcamp.com/album/the-banner-saga "

												The Banner Saga looks very promising. Visually gorgeous, it describes its world graphically through a very accomplished illustrational style. Ambient sound is understated yet emotive, and the strong musical score emphasizes the twists and turns of the plot and the interspersed turn-based fighting.The Banner Saga is set in a mythical world very much inspired by Norse legend, and being norwegian myself, I can vouch for the fantasy names, although constructs, being of the right timbre. There is an emotional relationship with the old sagas of Snorre et al.You should definitely check out The Banner Saga if you like to think and strategize, and soak yourself in the atmosphere of the vikings and their mythology. If however, you are impatient, have any sort of attention deficiency - then this is not for you.Bravo to Stoic, Bioware escapees, on The Banner Saga!			"

												Absolutely fantastic. Hard as hell, a lot of planning involved and I can tell already there is going to be some serious replayability in it.. My two gripes about the game: 1 No rotating camera in combat. When enemies cluster it is difficult to tell what is going on. I really need to rotate a camera for this. Which brings in the second issue. You sometimes make movement pathing errors. You can't take these back, there is no undo so you can get screwed by no undo for just basic movement when you haven't taken any skill / combat actions.Besides these two flaws. The game is fantastic! Great combat, art, music, story, and definitely replayability. 9/10 if you need a numeric scale. Honestly though if you enjoy tactic games like Fire Emblem. Think of it like that plus oregon trail.

												I didn't actually beat this game yet, but it's damn good. Think the Oregon trail meets Game of Thrones meets an actually good game, and you get this one. A lot of games talk about trying to make all your decisions matter, and a lot of games say they do, but in the end it simply doesn't feel like your actions really matter. Banner Saga is probably the only game I've played where I felt like it was true. When I need to make a decision in-game and someone dies, I feel like their blood is legitimately on my hands. Sometimes the only ones that die are nameless clansmen, and, honestly, that doesn't affect the game much, but one time I made the decision of trusting the wrong guy, and one of my best combatants, a centerpiece of my offense, was just straight up killed. From what I've seen so far (because I've started playing the game twice), the main plot doesn't change, there are no grand branching paths far as I've seen, but you definitely feel the weight of responsibility as decisions constantly have you weighing morality vs. personal survival, risk vs. chance of reward, and sometimes just posing a genuine question of morality. (Choices? 10/10. Your move, AAA studios)Now, without the choices, how about the story itself? The world is nicely built, the story is compelling, the characters are interesting, and there are some really good quotes. It gets trippy as hell, though. Like I said earlier, I never beat the game, so I can't attest to the quality of the ending.(Story? 8.75/10. Worthwhile.)Now that we got this girly nonsense talk about ""story"" out of the way, let's talk about combat. The real men's subject. It's a grid-based, turn-based rpg system, but instead of attacking you decide whether to strike armor or strength. Each does a thing we're not getting into now. How does this effect the gameplay? Enough to distinguish itself. It definitely gives a unique feel, and the tactical question of ""Should I attack strength or Armor?"" rarely has an obvious answer. So it adds a layer to strategy. It's not necessarily ground-breaking, but it adds a little spice. (Combat? 8/10: can't complain; pretty good) It adds just the right amount of spice, really. A classy amount. The Banner Saga is lIke something from a fancy resturant. Just don't actually eat there because the waiter poisons people at random.Overall: 9/10 I would easilly recommend this game to any strategy player, and some non-strategy players.			"

												Turn-based combat RPG with interesting story, decision-making and combat system.The art is very crisp. Sound is good too.The combat system involves armor and health/strength. Losing health diminishes the strength of a character, and losing armor means they are more vulnerable. If strength is too low itll be hard to attack an enemy with higher armor level. First time Ive seen such a system in a game and it makes for more thoughtful and careful play. As I began figuring out the system my enjoyment of combat increased a lot as I began to make the right decisions and win more battles. For example, archers arent very strong against armored enemy, but they can plink away at armor whilst the melee character moves in - once both have broken they can both finish off the enemy quick.Also theres a practice battle option which provides random set of enemies. It doesnt improve or injure your heroes, just practice. These are usually harder than what you face in the normal game, allowing you to improve a lot and learn how to beat the odds. Playing on the hardest difficulty is essential I think otherwise you might find it too easy. If you like the game's combat is a good addition and adds a bit more to the game's challenge. You can also change how many heroes you go into the battles with so that can make it more of a challenge and make you a better player.			"

												The most remarkable aspect of this game is presentation. From the soundtrack to the art direction to the interface, everything is immaculate and elegant. Nothing feels rough around the edges or half-finished as far as those elements go. The gameplay is unique- a combination of choose-your-own-adventure style frequent decision-making, an Oregan Trail-like survival and travel element that involves some resource management, and the battle system itself which involves tactical strategy and some interesting components like individual health and defense bars to attack, and the Varl race of characters who take up a lot of unit space in battle but have high attack power. There are so many characters to choose from during battle- as many as 20 are encountered by game's end and even character usage involves some decision-making as characters only level up by not only actively participating, but getting in a number of kills.Now for some of the downsides- though there are such a plethora of options and routes to go on, nearly all lead toward the same end and plot points seem black and white in nature- you either picked the ""right"" answer leading to hidden items or a surplus in resources, or you picked the wrong one which can set you back in progress. But making wrong decisions matters little since the difficulty level is low until the end, and the initially interesting tactics-driven combat is actually quite simplified compared to other strategy RPGs. Aspects such as equipment management involve collecting numerous accessories and each character can hold just one. Character classes and stat allocation is similarly straightforward. On the bright side, that makes this title a great choice for those new to the genre and not very interested in micro-management. The storyline is interesting and involved, but there is not much clarification of the lore. While the character and plot development is nicely done, it can be vague with some side characters receiving barely a line of exposition. While I compared the decision-making to a choose-your-own-adventure novel, it has nowhere near the verbosity of visual novels or many story-driven RPGs. The writing is of an appreciably high standard of quality though and the lack of meandering over any particular element (whether it be storytelling or the various types of gameplay present here) keeps the game fast-paced. I achieved completion at around 10 hours and do feel there is some replay value here, but the general asking price ($24.99) is very high for this amount of content. I would suggest waiting for a sale of at least 30-50% off. The exception being if the subject matter is particularly riveting to you, in which case I'd say go ahead as it is likely to impress.			"

												Being the first part of an expected trilogy, this was definitely very enjoyable and challenging enough to be satisfying. Liked the visuals/music, but with the story being a cliffhanger and ending rather abruptly, it leaves more questions than answers. Looking forward to the next two in hopes that, for a relatively short playthrough, the sum is far greater than its parts.			"

But the story, music and just about everything about this game is incredible. I can not reccomend it enough. I found myself saying ""Just one more battle"" or ""just one more story choice"" for almost two straight hours the first night I played it. If anything I regret I took so long to purchase it.			"

												Rated eleventy million out of ten.Earlier today I rushed out of my study to find my girlfriend so I could bemoan the enormity of making decisions I knew might cost the lives of many of my clansmen.  ""I can't handle this responsibility! People are looking to me to lead and I'm constantly letting them down."", I wailed.For me, the hallmark of any exceptional game is that it leaves you pondering the wider story and the lives of the characters within it, even when you are far away from your computer.  The Banner Saga most certainly falls into this category. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to find myself dreaming of Dredge and Godstones again tonight.The Banner Saga game mechanic is essentially a modern multi-choice story-driven take on The Oregon Trail, with a squad-based tactics battle engine bolted on top.With captivating writing, stunning graphics and an engrossing, mood-setting soundtrack, the twists and turns of the story have at times left me setting my jaw or blinking away tears. I have found myself incredulous, mouth agape at the narrative's brutality and unfairness.  Knowing in my gut that survival is unlikely, I grip the mouse tighter, hoping it may somehow force my starving caravan up the next desolate snowy peak...			"

												I really loved playing this game, the story is engaging and even the smallest of choices feels as though it has meaning. The battle system takes a little getting used to (I kept failing to get my raned units within range of the enemy at first), but is very good. The story and choices are the main part of the game for me though, as they're more engaing than the battles. I definately agree wuth the comparison to GoT as you do feel characters may be killed off at any moment if you aren't careful.  One decision I actually decided to sleep on as I knew it would probably be a bit of a game changer and I was torn between two options.The only thing I would say is a big downside to the game is that it is the 1st part of a trilogy so the game stops very suddenly. The price and the descrition do not prepare you for this and some people may feel a bit ripped off by it as you aren't getting a full game. However I got it on sale so don't mind as much (although I am dying to know what happens next). I would say Steam should make a note of this being a ""Part 1"" so people know the emotional turmoil they will be in upon finishing the game.			"

												Beware, you haven't known crushing despair until you've played this.It's actually a pretty amazing game, beautifully designed with an innovative combat system.The difficult choices you make are the defining feature. It does really well at building connection with the characters, then forces you to make decisions that can have gut-wrenching consequences. The plot twists are frequent, unpredictable and unforgiving.I'd heard mixed reviews, so didn't try it out until a sale. There's some valid points made against it, but overall its a well polished game especially for the price. It's worthwhile just as a really beautifully told story, but the turn based combat is fun and challening too. I hope they add DLC or a whole new chapter.			"

												TLDR: Banner Saga left me with an intense hunger for more, which is so much worse as the game is so awesome!If you like the Fire Emblem series, consider playing this game. It has some interesting takes on the tactical RPG genre, an awesome art style with beutiful scenery and rich characters. I found the story interesting and was especially impressed by the hardship and difficult choices of a refugee story arc. I was, however, also a little frustrated. The skill caps of your heros are very low, and I feel the leveling/customization choices  are quite limited. At least you get a lot of heros to try out but you don't get enough time and resources to explore them all very well. I also did not like that the narrative unnecessarily imposes that you play a certain character. Especially in a part, where Alette, a relatable girl, could easily be the main character you are forced into the role of Rook, her father, and have to decide her fate with some patronizing choices. And then the story ends very abruptly.			"

The combat style takes a while to get used to, but it really pushes you to think tactically to take down the enemy. I understand why some people may not find the combat appealing, but everyone is different.In my opinion the only real downside was I got too attatched to some of the characters, and, well... I won't spoil anything.Protip: don't be so trusting of people.			"

												The Banner Saga is an extraordinary game. Starting with the obvious, the landscapes and soundtrack are both breathtaking and plain epic. But what what really reeled me in, even more than the wonderful and immersive atmosphere, is the storyline. Twisted, and relying so very much on the player's choices. You often don't know where you're going, what to decide, whom you should trust or not, and must rely on your own judgement (often wrong !) and guts to advance. It is such a pleasure to feel like you're are actually choosing, or creating your own path rather than following the same patterns as always ; and it's not so often that a game really makes you think twice about a choice that will (maybe) haunt you until the end... The Banner Saga is really a refreshing creation, dark indeed, but beautiful nonetheless, and takes you in without mercy. I just finished it, and already want to discover all the other paths that lie ahead... I recommend it whole-heartedly !			"

												Having just finished The Banner Saga, I'm simply in awe by its majestic, epic, sensitive, mournful, and haunting atmosphere that is conjured up and served to you by skillful writing, thoughful, believable characters, and gameplay that will lead you to test the tactician you always knew you secretly are. The art deserves an extra mention; I'm inclined to think the old-school 2D animation is able to capture character and spirit in a unique way. Don't forget to entertain yourself with the soundtrack, ""We are all guests upon the land"" is my favorite.Praise aside, the game could have used a hefty chunk more of the talented well-picked voice actors. Some cutscenes loose their edge because of it, but it does little to hinder the overall wonderfully positive experience.			"

												Świetna gra taktyczna. Wykorzystywanie skilli i odpowiednie ustawianie wroga na planszy - klucz do zwycięstwa. Chwilę zajmuje żeby to ogarnąć. Grajcie na najwyższym poziomie trudności - trzeba nieźle kombinować. Nie ma nagrywania w każdym momencie, niektóre decyzje przynoszą efekty po kilku godzinach od jej podjęcia - to wszystko sprawia,  że gra się ciurkiem i trzeba godzić się ze swoimi wyborami. Postaci giną, odchodzą, walki trzeba powtarzać aby osiągnąć optymalny efekt. Gra raczej dla starszych graczy, bo nie prowadzi za rękę. Tutorial jest ubogi. Wszystko wychodzi w praniu. Jedna rzecz, która mnie lekko zirytowała to ostatnia walka. Fabuła narzuca udział w walce postaci, której w ogóle nie rozwijałem. Trzy dni się męczyłem i nie dałem rady - musiałem wgrać stan sprzed decyzji o tym kto bierze strzałę. Przechodzę zaraz po raz drugi na pozomie normal - pierwszy raz zagrałem na hard i ani nie rozwinąłem wszystkich postaci, ani wszystkich fajnych artefaktów nie mogłem kupić. Prawie 50h zabawy, przy czym wiele walk powtarzałem. Teraz zagram dla wygody i przyjemności - zrobię sobie dream team pakerów. Polecam - każdemu kto nie lubi banalnych gier.			"

												This game puts off an Illusion of making choices that have real consequences but once you have played threw the game once, you realize that the game is more about reading forums and faqs to find the exact course threw the game because it’s a♥♥♥♥♥♥shoot otherwise. You could do everything right and the next move you could literally be starving your caravan to death. Not that that makes any difference because the amount of people you have with you means nothing to the game. The very few full scale battles you get into are staged because you haven’t gotten to a point where you could have lost members of your caravan.Being able to purchase items is also a joke because if you care about your people even in the slightest bit then you will just be using your renown to buy supplies and leveling up your characters, who just wind up dying off at the slightest whim anyways. Ill mention Egil as an example and I know that it’s supposed to be an achievement to keep him alive, but really? Is the life of people just a joke/game? How can I possibly create a bond with anyone when their lives are so trivial?I don’t know about you but I can’t stand games that are intentionally impossible to play for the casual player. I’m just saying that if you want to have any sort of success at this game, it is impossible to do so without some sort of walkthrough. Oh by the way, loved the combat, music and scenery. "

												Do you feel like playing an RPG that can punish or reward you for every single moral decision you ever make? Are you prepared to redefine what you consider ""moral"" as your mental and strategic mettle are put the the test constantly? And finally, can you handle the emotional consequences of your actions as you struggle to balance the needs of keeping yourself, your party, and the rest of your caravan alive?Banner Saga puts the questions to the test as you traverse through a gorgeous, norse mythological world...albeit on the run from dire enemies all the while. The game is fantastic overall, despite the rather monotonous and somewhat flawed battling system (e.g., an odd turn-based system that alternates your turn and the enemies every time; thus, even if you have 6 members alive and they have only 2, they still get to go multiple times while your characters only get to go once in turn). However, the real appeal is essentially the entire story itself: It is full of twists and turns, celebrations and mourning, and heart-wrenching choices through every step along the way. And the music! Oh, the music is simply some of the most aesthetically pleasing sounds you will ever hear; fitting seamlessly throughout the gameplay.This game is only part one of several (out of a total of three I believe that are in development), so pick it up now while you have the chance (and when it is on sale of course!). I believe this game cuts a well-earned 9 Varl (Viking) axes out of 10 Dredge heads. If you have any questions for me about the game, please leave a comment on this review and I will be happy to try to answer them.			"

Final Rating: At $5.00 or less, 10/10. At $12.00, 6/10This is a great story-driven game. Combat is easy to learn but still requires some skill/strategy on normal difficulties. Beautiful artwork and pretty good music (especially during pivotal scenes.) My only gripes are a huge diffuculty spike during one fight in the game, and that only a tiny portion of the game has voice acting. Also, some of the choices you make seem wise but may have arbitrary/unintended negative consequences. Your party will only die through story events, not combat, and it can be frustrating to have your best fighter killed in a freak yox stampede because you chose not to let the traitorous yox herdsman live a few miles back. Overall a great game if you can get it on a good sale.			"

In it is a fear that you will never quite feel.  If the game had been longer, two, three times the length it is, then you might feel the pressing in of time and resources a little more, but with a little willpower (ha) you can fiat a bit of emotional depth and let the characters interact with the world. The combat is decent, just keep in mind that those with the least health can be ignored and spend your time chipping away at the others. 1 damage over two turns is better than four over one, while a Dredge Collosus tenderizes your face. The game is not perfect. Few games are. However, the game is a pleasure from start to finish.

												Banner Saga is a study in videogames as a storytelling medium. The score, the sounds, the visual style, and the writing all work together beautifully to tell the story of a merciless world falling apart. It's tense and you're always on the verge of annihilation, and the music alone could tell you so. It's gritty, and the crunches of axes breaking armor and the grunts and moans of the injured make you feel it. People are fragile and the perpetual march is exhausting, and the heavy shambling motions of bodies shows you so.  As the leader, you constantly have to arbitrate the problems of your followers, keep them optimistic, keep them fed, and keep them alive while a continent of panicking and desperate people is being overrun.  Everything harmoniously comes together to weave an atmosphere where feelings of dread and anxiety are constant. Your choice isn't whether or not people die, it's who dies now so that fewer will die later.  In every artistic regard this game is an achievement.Unfortunately it's not for everyone, though. Its roots are in the artistry, not the gameplay--people have some valid complaints about that. Only some. I didn't dislike the gameplay at all, but I was very wrapped up in every other part of the game. Play it for the experience.			"

												As a fan of turn based strategy games I can't say that The Banner Saga is a great game. The strategic part is very basic and isn't more complex than a game of checkers. Also the user interface is really abysmal, the worst I've ever seen in a strategic game. For example you can't inspect your team members attributes and abilities when choosing who to bring in battle. While in battle the interface isn't better and choosing the action to perform feels very cheap. Abilities are described ""with text"" like a game from 20 years ago, no icons and no visual aids. Very very basic.Despite all this I still recommend the game; why? Because the story is tragic and mature like it rarely happens in games lately. It is really up to Norse Myths standards... The music is a masterpiece that is alone worth the price of the game and the experience, as whole, feels like a work of love from its developers. So even if I can't fully recommend it as a game I still recommend it without hesitation as a work of ""art"".			"

												This is the best-looking game made to-date. It's combat is wonderful, the environments are beautifully atmospheric, the music does a decent job of aligning senses to the threatening circumstances, and the story is very enjoyable so far.It isn't for morons, though - like some of the little ♥♥♥♥♥es on the forum who complain because the combat isn't real-time, with all they know being some♥♥♥♥♥♥like League of Legends.

												Highly recommend this game for fans of tactical RPGs, or turn-based RPG combat in general. It makes some questionable design decisions at various points, but is well worth every cent of the asking price. (If you pick it up later on during a Steam sale, congratulations, you're winning.)Selling points: this is possibly amongst the most beautiful games I have ever played. Not in terms of ""graphical fidelity,"" of course, but the cel-shaded art style is extremely well-done all the way through and quite captivating. I would happily take games in this style over mainstream AAA titles living in the uncanny valley over and over again. My only complaint in this area is the extremely limited character animation during ""cutscene"" conversations; what is there simply serves to highlight how little there is. I probably wouldn't even have noticed if not for the few efforts they made on this front. (A very, VERY minor complaint, since the game is not relying on FMV-style, and even in still shots, the artwork is simply gorgeous)The tactical combat is engaging, and the mechanic which links a character's health to his damage output makes an otherwise simplistic system compelling (do I do limited damage against this enemy to lower the danger they bring, or reduce his armor to make my next turn that much more effective while risking him bringing the hurt in the interim?) and makes level-up decisions on characters agonizing. I went the route of ""specializing"" each character I used frequently, resulting in characters of similar class and starting stat reaching the end-game with vastly different skill sets (i.e. of the two archers I used every opportunity, one was the absolute best at knocking enemy armor out of the picture, while the other was a damage-and-willpower fiend who had my highest kill count by the last fight). Also, while I'm not huge on harping for realism in games, it has always somewhat annoyed me that characters with 1HP out of their 1,000 maximum were just as potent as at full health, and this is a nice way of remedying that.The story arc is compelling and kept me interested the whole way through without relying on many overdone tropes and archetypes, taking place in a very interesting setting I would happily p[ay to see more of. There is also quite a bit of background lore and information made easily accessible without forcing it to the forefront through excessive exposition, leaving its perusal to those willing to spend the time to enjoy it and letting those less interested mostly ignore it without detracting from the direct experience.The Renown system, which irritated me a great deal, but in a good way (as odd as that sounds). EVERYTHING in this game - level-ups, food for your tribe, items to supplement your heroes - is purchased with renown, which you gain from victory in battle as well as certain C&C moments in between. While it can be frustrating at times, after beating the game, I view it in a wholly positive light - rather than making something like EXP and Gold to be used for two separate purposes, incorporating both resource pools into one base stat increases the strategic element, and makes every expenditure that much more risky and demanding. I entered the final battle with three fully-leveled characters, and two weaker ones, simply because I had spent the renown necessary to do so along the way to ensure nobody in my caravan starved to death along the way. (Which can also say a lot about you as a person, I suppose, in terms of how you choose to spend it) At times, I would have preferred separate pools for the various resources, but only because it would have made my inherent min-maxing tendencies easier to oblige, and I cannot legitimately call out a design decision that increases complexity and the importance of a player's strategic choice.Detriments: the touted choice & consequence mechanic, while always nice to see, seems to mostly amount to extremely random and jarring consequences; each major decision seems to have one ""correct"" option which yields a positive outcome, and the negative consequences of ""incorrect"" decisions are never forewarned adequately, resulting in major impact up to and including losing substantial characters with absolutely no warning (on courses of action they themself recommend, even). Think the Witcher in terms of its unforseeability, but without the time delay or overall neutral tone which was par for the course in that game. (To be fair, there were a couple consequences - one VERY major one - which took half the game to  conclude and did have ample but not flagrant warning, so the game did this quite well in some instances, but failed in others)The combat never changes or develops in a significant way after the first battle outside of levelled-up abilities and new character classes with different special skills opening up different strategic options. What you see in the first battle is largely what you're going to get.In the combat mechanics, again, the game seems to settle in the middle; the endgame battles (especially the final boss) had me biting nails and languishing over every turn, and the beginning was not far removed, but I had comfortably established a routine throughout the middle half of the game which pretty much ensured I'd win any given battle ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥d-drunk with minimal unit injury in the process. A more level experience would be nice.A mechanic I rather like (linking health and damage output to the same attribute) has its flaw; in many situations, it is often tactically better to leave an enemy unit on the battlefield at very low HP rather than killing them outright. Due to the mechanic Il ike, their damage potential is next to nothing, but this goes against general gaming instinct and raises concerns in compliance with the point below...MIXED FEELINGS: the way the turn-based system is executed. Instead of some stat which addresses/influences initiative, the game will always go YOUR SIDE-ENEMY SIDE-YOUR SIDE-ENEMY SIDE until only one unit remains on either, at which point one side will execute all of its turns and then the other proceeds. On one hand, I like this to an extent, because it makes battles lopsided in terms of numbers not unwinnable; on the other hand, I think it's fairly backward in terms of a good mechanic; if it were kept the same throuh the last round, it would give that moment of despair when you haver one unit left against four an air of possibility, thinking if you execute well enough you can pull this situation out of the fire (or, conversely, keep you thinking your moves over in the last moments of a fight, as an enemy acting that quickly could turn your 4-1 advantage into a one-on-one exchange if you ♥♥♥♥ it up badly enough). While I do like the mechanic as a whole as opposed to the general turn-based style, it loses its punch with that particular element making the last few turns of any given fight a foregone conclusion when it could have served to bring each and every one down to the wire.ALL IN ALL: a very, very good game. I didn't catch this game's Kickstarter in time to contribute, but most likely would have, and do not at all regret spending full price for the experience once it released. I'm hoping it does well enough that multiple follow-ups/sequels are developed, so long as they equal or improve on the quality of the original. If you enjoy slower-paced games with combat more tactical and mindful than visceral and egoistic, this is a no-brain purchase that I wholeheartedly recommend. If Call of Duty is your favorite game series... 1. this is probably not for you; 2. please die as painfully as possible in a fire as soon as possible so as to possibly rectify the damage you have already done to the industry as a whole.

												The Banner Saga is a good game with very strong atmosphere and a great, dark story in a Nordic, Viking like fantasy world. Although you have to read a lot of dialogs the strategic battles are fun. The music adds a lot to the depressing atmosphere. You are permanently on the run, chased by an overwhelming foe you can not expect to defeat. The game is a narrative of your flight. Prepare to lose friends and loved ones during your journey.If you do not mind reading a lot of dialogs I definitely recommend this game.			"

												The Banner Saga is fantastic from start to finish. Been sitting in my pile of games to play for a while, and I'm glad I finally go around to checking it out. This game combines a rich story set in a nordic mythology, turn-based combat that harkens to X-com, and survival decisions that remind me of the old Oregon Trail.Three great things about the game:- Decisions matter. They shape the way your party forms over the course of a solid 12-14 hour story.- A solid combat system that keeps action interesting- Fantastic story of the end timesIt's not without a few faults however. The surival-ESQUE gameplay is definitely in service to the story. Things like caravan supplies and army size feel inconsequential at times. Sometimes you will spend a bunch of currency on supplies for a long haul... only to have the supplies made meaningless by cutting a long journey short due to a story element. Other times you make sacrifices to keep your army numbers high, only never to fight or encounter another large army. Why? Because the story didn't call for you to run into an army yet. I would have much rather used the currency buy items or upgrade my party members. But there's no way to know when supplies and army size are actually needed, before you actually need them... making their currency system a bit of random guessworkThe story is good, so the above points are forgivable, but I would have liked to see them strike a better balance between the story, and the game-y parts.You should buy this game. You will enjoy it. Can't wait to play The Banner Saga 2.			"

												Oregon Trail meets Final Fantasy Tactics!-Overview-Seriously this game is very fun and has a way of drawing you in. The neatest part that will also be the most frustrating is that you cannot create save slots. So if you are at a juncture and someone dies, they stay dead in your game. Don't worry, characters that fall in combat will only be injured for an amount of days equal to how badly they got gibbed in battle (at least on normal difficulty). But sometimes people will die as a result of your actions and then they are just dead. The story is well done with some twists along the way. The setting is the real powerhouse though - it's the end of the world and you are trying to eke out some survival. It's reminiscent to zombie apocalypse games because the dredge you fight seem rather mindless. What saves it is the nordic fantasy theme and the varls. The varls are apparently a cross between human and ox, but they live for hundreds of years and are basically giants. Also they cannot reproduce anymore so the amount left is finite.-Gameplay-There are 2 main screens in the game, the traveling screen which tracks how many people, varls, and supplies you have as you trek across the landscape and the grid battle view where you fight tactical combats. Overall both of these systems work very well. I was frustrated at first by how frequently my archers and other squishies died. Now I treat them like fragile objects and play very carefully with them. It isn't worth it to run halfway across the map for a kill only to get swarmed and killed. Send the tanks in first, create a wall, then pepper them with your long-range units. Instead of getting gold and experience you acquire Renown which functions as a currency for everything in the game. Want to buy an item? Spend renown. Want to buy food supplies? Spend renown. Want to level up your army? Spend renown. Obviously you don't get enough to do it all, so you balance losing women and children with wanting to have a stronger army to fight through and save the rest of the caravan. Lots of little decisions come back later in the game too, which shows you that your choices do matter. Overall it's very fun and addicting, with a ""One More Turn Style"" gameplay.-Story-It just throws you into this lord of the rings inspired setting, but instead of dwarves, elves, and orcs, you get human, varl, and dredge. Along the way you start piecing together the history and relationships of the world, but rather than show a setting where the fantasy races are leaving or dying off, everything is dying off. The sun has literally stopped in the sky and people are constantly asking you what to do because its the end of the world. While this might make the whole thing seem pointless, you do get sucked into the characters and their struggle to survive through some good characterization and lots of poignant moments with your own personal choices driving the narrative.-Music-A bit halting here and there, sometimes there will be silence for a long time and then suddenly music begins! The quality of the tracks is very high though, I am usually glad when the music does come on. It's also voice-acted but I can't tell you to what extent because I prefer reading walls of texts.-Verdict-Great tactical game. If you like tactical combat and reminisce for Oregon Trail style random stuff happening then this is for you. The whole thing plods along and is very slow, so take your time with it and you will be richly rewarded. I've sat at a key decision juncture for 5 or 10 minutes trying to deduce how things will play out. Since I can't just reload and find out, it may actually get a replay out of me too. The combat is unforgiving but once you learn some tricks you'll feel unstoppable.			"

												I absolutely loved this game, so simple and kind of reminds me of Hearthstone in the way that the Health/Armour works, although subtle differences.The artwork is pretty good although sometimes got a bit repetitive with all the snow, it made you unable to see most of the background other than the main path however when there was less snow it was beautiful atmosphere. Overall I love the cartoon feel to it.Enough of the graphics. The main thing I love about this game is the fact that the decisions you make, actually do have an effect. Not only that but it makes you think about what you want to say, Do you need another character? Do you need more suplies? What one should I choose to keep my character alive? Should I take a risk?All these questions I was asking myself as I progressed.However sometimes I felt that some decisions made no sense to me - personally - and that some were harsh as it sometimes causes some of the characters to die, it obviously has no effect on the story but it is annoying as you may have levelled that character to a high level and spent your XP points on him and then he is gone, seems like a waste.I also dislike the fact that one group of characters you get to play with are not as powerful as some of the other groups and I felt like some characters I was able to level up easier as they did more base damage, the ""archer"" type felt fairly useless in most circumstances as the space the ""Dredge"" can move is so great compared to the range of the arrows, it felt like a wasted character to me, they have low armour and low strength and it just did not gel with my preferred playstyle and also I felt like the Varl were FAR superior to the humans.However the storyline was interesting although fairly short, it also had me addicted for the 5-10 hours it lasted and I am on my second playthrough on a harder difficulty and choosing different options. It has replayability in that way.The final boss fight is extremely challenging and I enjoyed it thoroughly, with many retries, and many rages.Amazing animations in combat and although the Voice acting was scarce, it was effective when used. It could have been used more and there is A HELL OF A LOT OF READING, which I am fine with but you may not be. When speaking to people, it sometimes felt like it was drawn out and too much text but I liked it nonetheless. Requires patience.I would advise you to pick this game up, mainly if it is on sale. 100% worth $15 and less but I picked it up for $5 I think.An amazing game overall and I loved it so much while it lasted.

												Hello,I'm going to start off by saying that this is a beautiful game. By beautiful I mean soundtrack, artwork and story. It's really enjoyable and definitely worth playing. It has a very... ""Authentic"" feeling to it.Pros:Artwork - The artwork is beautifully drawn and everything is nicely animated. Even though a bit simple at times, even the simplicity of it all seems to blend in perfectly with everything.Music - The soundtrack is nice and gives off an appropriate vibe considering the setting, but it's not incredible. It's nice, really, but it could have been a bit more diverse.Story & Character development - The story and character development are amazing. Even though they have small flaws, everything seems somehow inevitable and most of the time you are basically doing everything to make the best out of an impossible situation. That's the real struggle. Doing the best you can - no matter how bad it is.The characters are nicely designed and some of them actually evolve in unexpected ways, even if they do scream cliché at times.Skills and attributes - These go hand to hand with their usability in combat (which I will explain below) and how much you really need to think about when you upgrade them.Combat - I assume that we've all seen this type of combat by now and its basics should come as no surprise to anyone. I like the general combat style, but what I love about it are some small touches that make it... Unique. Crippling the armour of an enemy is generally optional in games, but not here. No way. If you want to actually have a chance at slaying Dredge, then you really need to buff up your armor breaking. Also damaging an opponent will not only hurt them physically and take down their hp, but will also reduce the damage they do.I like the fact that the game forces you to weigh your decisions carefully, most of the time having to choose either damaging an opponent with a small burst for the moment or simply working your way until being able to constantly damage them for higher values.Cons:Voice acting - Although sometimes done well, a large part of the voice acting in the game could do with improving. Of course, it's understandable seeing how the actors were chosen and the fact that Stoic didn't exactly have an immense budget for this project.Decisions - This is the type of game which is, for the most part, story-driven. Generally the types of fans that play this type of game are the ones that expect their role and their decisions in the to be important. It is exactly the type of game from which fans expect every decision to be important and to have significant consequences. Don't get me wrong, they're important, obviously, but I wish that some of the decisions that ulteriorly end up with the same result to have some more depth to them. The fact that quite often anything you choose to do will lead you through the same events is not what bothers me. What bothers me is that the game is quite transparent about that and lets it off quite easily.Character leveling - I really think that they should have sticked to the standard form of leveling (Everyone who's still standing at the end of the fight will get exp), buuut they didn't. Instead you gain exp for dealing the killing blow on enemies. Normally that wouldn't be so bad, but it's just so much easier for some characters to get the kil than others, that it basically makes the process of leveling certain classes very, very difficult. There's always that one big guy, with the two-hander that comes in and beats the crap out of everything that's still standing.Equipment - Well, there's really not much I can say about the equipemnt section because it didn't actually stand out. I expected equipmented rooted into the lore of the game that can help an immense deal, but I actually got a lot of items which could situationally help... Somtimes. Some items are good, sure, but not really that much. The difference they make isn't all that noticeable if you spend your points properly.Conclusion:This is a great game, definitely worth buying if you enjoy your good ol' tacitacal turn-based. But it's more than that. It's actually a great buy if you simply enjoy a good story. Combat isn't all that difficult and it's easy to get into, even if it does, at times, get a bit tiring (I'm talking about you, people who want to try out every possible path and never want any characters to get knocked out.

												The Banner Saga is great because you develop a deep understanding of the knowledge that every situation that you're presented with in the story will result in you picking the wrong option, trying to load the game in frustration only to realise that you didn't save it soon enough, and the autosave didn't go back far enough, so then you have to leave the game entirely to break open your piggy bank, raid your mother’s jewellery box and re-mortgage your house just to find the money you need to speed down to the nearest bar, drink yourself into a bitter stupor, call everyone you know on your contact list and pour abuse at them until they swear to disown you, crawl back to your home and restart the game from the beginning.

												Impressive strategy RPG with beautifully hand drawn animations and travelling sequences. Choices in encounters during caravan travels add both to the story and battle strategy, introducing a population and resource management aspect which changes depending on how the player chooses to engage enemies in group battles vs using army reserves in a cautious or direct manner. The Banner Saga has turned out to be a far more charming and deeper game than I had ever expected. More and more mechanics are introduced as one gets further into the campaign. This is one of the most satisfying SRPG / adventure experiences in a long time. I had hesitated due to the price, but for the current midweek madness sale, $10 is an amazing deal. If you were holding off for any reason, now is the time to pick up this title. I see now that even the price of $14.99 or even $20 still seems very reasonable!			"

												Amazing art and animation. Taking inspiration from Eyvind Earle (Disney's Sleeping Beauty) gives this game a classic Disney feel. The writing is a bit slow and drawn out, borderline amateur. But overall I'm pretty happy with the game so far. The battle system is simple and well explained. It's a bit slow overall so if you're one of those ""need it done now"" type of people this game may not be for you. Wish there were voice acting but I shouldn't expect much from a Kickstarter game. You play multiple perspectives from the different main characters each chapter. Overall it's a very Sleeping Beauty mixed with Game of Thrones story and vibe with a heavy Viking mythology sway. Overall a pretty cool experience and one of those games you'll play and be in awe of the art direction. I hope the story pans out a little better as I progress through the story.As it stands I have NOT FINISHED the game. But from this point I'd give the game a nice clean 8/10. Mostly due to the art direction and battle system.			"

												Having just beaten The Banner Saga, I can now say that it will remain one of my favorites games for many years to come. The story/lore was superb, the soundtrack was fantastic ( I highly recommend getting the edition with the soundtrack), and I found myself protective of the games main characters Rook and his daughter Allete. The meat of the game revolves around balancing the level progression of your characters while also providing resources for your caravhan, which both use the same resource to manage. It can be a struggle depending on what difficulty you're playing on, but if you're just looking to enjoy the story it is very possible without sacrificing any fun. I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of turn based strategies, deep emotional stories, and worlds that are rich in lore.			"

I came to really appreciate the characters and even became invested in them as was revealed by certain turns in the plot.  I like the mechanic pretty well, but compared to other tactics RPG's the options for fighting seem somewhat limited.The whole game isn't based around fighting, though.  A good portion of it is spent ""Oregon Trail""-style journeying across a landscape and making choices which affect the fate of your group.Highly recommended.			"

												First of all, I loved it. I think it is one of the most beautful games I ever played with immersive story where you constantly make tough decisions. And it gets emotional. Not many games have that. So my biased rating is 10/10. It was just the perfect mix for me. I love tactical turn-based combat and story driven games.Objectively, Banner saga is just ""choose your own adventure"" book with turn-based combat in x-com or fallout fashion on small simple maps. Reading other comments it is clearly not for everyone. Do not buy it just for the combat part. The good stuff is in the dialogues and atmosphere.			"

												I've really enjoyed the banner saga. It is beautifully drawn and the Mythic Norse fantasy milieu is engrossing. The turn based Combat is simple enough, but has hidden depths. The story has real heart to it.The tale is wrapped up nicely, though bear in mind it's the first part of a proposed trilogy, or you may find the conclusion a bit abrupt.			"

												Awesome art direction.  The combat put a great spin on the turn based strategy game with its use of health as your attack stat, causing combat to flow a lot differently than say XCOM.  It also has an Oregon Trail feel, as not combat parts of the game flow very similar to that.  The game tends to be very heavy, as you often make hard choices.  I found myself having to give it a break here and there just because the wieght of my decision got to me. In my opinion a must play.  Also, good replay value.			"

												The Banner Saga ranks as one of my favorite games of all time. The reluctant viking themed universe makes me giddy and jump at the chance of learning more about the lore of The Banner Saga. While there is no actual audio dialogue except in the intro, the game really allows your mind to wanter and the art and graphics of the game are amazingly beautiful. Gameplay is almost like chess and once you get to the hardest difficulty, stratagy and character choice are imperitive to your success. Amazing game, recommended to anyone who enjoys this style or the immersive story telling.			"

												Raise your banners it's the saga... The Banner Saga.This game... There aren't a lot of fantasy settings that really get me, but this one was one of the few. It's a kind of desolate, nordic setting with some focus on a few political aspects. Love it.The game has a special art style which wasn't really my thing, but nevertheless very thorough and unique, it has a strong focus on story, but not in your typical fashion, and has a strategic HOMM/XCOM-like battle system with RPG features, like individual character levels, skills and Items.If you want about 8-12 hours of story-driven gameplay with a pretty good but not amazing combat system, this is a really good choice and the release price wasn't extremely expensive. My biggest complaints are the length and that I want a sequel to delve further into this fantasy world.			"

												If you're a fan of tactical strategy games, this is more than worth your time.  The grid-based fights are different from anything else I've played in the genre, tying your remaining health to your ability to do damage, incentivizing keeping your party in good health.  There's a real emphasis on fighting against a team, as a team, and once you start to hang back and create opportunities the strategic depth really shines through.The heroes/caravan/item system strung on top of the combat is well put together and systemized in a fun way, harkening back a bit to things like the Oregon trail.  There seems to be a number of decision points strung through the story that can create some interesting divergences, resulting in losing/gaining new heroes, as well as the permanent death of major characters. The animation style of the game is fantastic, 2d artwork in the style of say, old Ralph Bakshi movies from the 70s and 80s.  It's a fairly unique look for a game in this genre.  Music is fantastic, by the always on point Austin Wintory.Definitely worth your time.			"

												Really enjoyed playing this game, I got so addicted I played it through in two sittings. The Art work is beautiful, and the combat, while simple, is satisfying and it is nice to see something new being tried in relation to grid based combat systems,The story is well told, and the characters are unique and memorable. THe choices that are presented to you throughout the game also have consiqence, and I quite often found myself stopping at a decision and painfully trying to work out what the results of my actions might be.Overall I would really reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys something different and appreciates a good story! I couldnt summarise it better than another review I read, this is a mixture of Game of Thrones, Disney and classic RPG systems, and I love it! :)			"

												The Banner Saga is an excellent turn-based RPG, where decisions you make affect the outcome of the story and changes the lives of the games characters.  The story is engrossing and revolves around a march to save your kinsmen from danger.  You lean to care about the people in your caravan, which make some of the decisions you have to make very difficult.  Although, this also gives the game a lot of replay value, as you strive to make better decisions, and protect more people in your caravan.  Decisions are more than just choosing when to fight, or dialogue choices; when it comes down to it the entire game is a decision of how best to spend your resources.  Do you buy supplies for your caravan to help you get to the next area? OR upgrade your combat team? Or buy items to have your combat team? They each use the same resource, so you have to decide where to put your limited resource.  Even choosing how often and when to rest effects gameplay.The combat is isometric turn-based, and involves a lot of strategy, and can at times, be surprisingly challenging.  There are three game modes, to provide more or less challenge to the player.  Hard mode being very challenging indeed.Overall an enjoyable experience that will leave you wanting more.  As soon as I finished the game, I began researching if there was to be a sequel, and I was pleased to hear the play is for this game to be part of a trilogy.Definitely worth playing, and highly recommended.

												Banner Saga is starkly beautiful and moving and has an interesting combat system. It is a lot like Oregon Trail for sad vikings and horned giants. You will be forced to make tough decisions about who lives and dies, and who will be remembered as a hero or a villain. It is however, quite short and has zero replay value.

												Beware, you haven't known crushing despair until you've played this.It's actually a pretty amazing game, beautifully designed with an innovative combat system.The difficult choices you make are the defining feature. It does really well at building connection with the characters, then forces you to make decisions that can have gut-wrenching consequences. The plot twists are frequent, unpredictable and unforgiving.I'd heard mixed reviews, so didn't try it out until a sale. There's some valid points made against it, but overall its a well polished game especially for the price. It's worthwhile just as a really beautifully told story, but the turn based combat is fun and challening too. I hope they add DLC or a whole new chapter.			"

												This game is essentially The Oregon Trail, but with a Nordic fantasy theme and a rudimentary turn-based combat system akin to Final Fantasy Tactics or X-Com (but with substantially less depth). The art style is refreshing, and the lovingly crafted world is enjoyable to immerse in for a while. Unfortunately, it is a very short while; most players will find themselves wanting more content after the final battle. Buy the game if it is on sale for less than $20 and I suspect you will feel rewarded by the purchase. In my opinion, the $25 price point is just a bit too high for the amount of gameplay you get.I sincerely hope that a sequel is in the works; one with a hundred hours of gameplay and a more robust combat system. This is a world I'd like to inhabit again.			"

												What a great RPG game. I kind of found this game by accident while navigating through Steam and after reading a bit about it online I decided to go ahead and buy it. It was a damn good decision. It is a bit of a different RPG as for most of it you are left with managing your caravan supplies and day to day problems. The game is linear so there isn't room for you to walk around and explore things like Skyrim or any other RPG out there. The thing about The Banner Saga is it story and how you go about it. Despite being straightforward regarding where you are going you have a say on how you are going to get there. The how in question is not about which route to take physically but rather emtionally and morally. As you travel with your caravan and your supplies dwindle should you threaten a farmer in order to obtain food? Or would you rather negotiate with him?  When a baby is born in your caravan do you stop and celebrate given people have been dying left and right? Or do you say, nope we don't have the resources to cheer, let's carry on? Another thing that really hooks you are the characters. Despite being rather short the game makes you care about each and everyone of the main chars. The problem with this is that no character is exempt from being killed during the game, and it ends up to you to choose weather to add a character to the lineup and potentially risk his/her death. At the end of the game, you end up feeling quite pleased of having survived the ride and also a bit depressed for all the bad things that happened to your party and caravan along the way. For me it was a sad thing to have killed Alette, the main character's daughter, at the final battle as she was my favorite character. Her funeral, in viking manner where her body is placed in a burning ship and sent along the river, was one of the most emotional moments in gaming for me.			"

												I wrote a bit about this game  here [hits.raygunsue.org], which I'll quote below for the super curious. Overall, I really enjoy it, but it gives you a funny feeling. Initially I felt a bit cheated by the twenty dollars it cost me, because so much of the game seemed extremely formulaic -- yet it burned through a Sunday for me when I really did have other things I needed to do. It seems like formulaic aspects of the game don't stop the choices you make from feeling important, even though you are constantly under-informed as to their consequences and nothing every seems to go right. That seems to be part of the point. It's a great game for winter, though I'd recommend having a precise time limit in mind.Here's the much longer version:Those old Hanna-Barbera cartoons used to have these funny tells. Velma Dinkley would be inspecting a book case for clues, and you could always tell, because of a marked difference between shelves, which one would have a trap door. I’m sure this was just an artifact of the animating process, such that there was a distinct difference between the background and moveable foreground items, but it also functioned brilliantly with the premise of shows like Scooby-Doo, the three-second anticipation of animation and the formula to every episode braiding together so that nothing really unexpected occurred. Dull, but delightfully so.

The Banner Saga shares some of these elements. Much of the game consists in the shift of a caravan proceeding horizontally across landscape and screen, and though there are animations, much of these are repetitive, glancing eyes and twisting hair. But though these are dull, in a sense, the effect isn’t unfascinating. The game is dull in an aesthetic way, in the way that wintry world would be, where it seemed at every point that my caravan was simply going from bad to worse circumstances, and when they would cut to those animations of the characters, glancing eyes and twisting hair, it seemed realistic, that people in a cold and godless world would address their inevitably sour options with little change in expression. Dull, like hit too much too often.

That safe feeling, in Hanna-Barbera and The Banner Saga, is tied to seeing nothing change except the foreground. Now, for the latter, this isn’t strictly true. Terrible things occur at various points in the game, directly affecting both the brave caravan and the landscape of the world around you. Yet so much of the game feels the same. You careen from danger to danger, watching food run out, watching the number of units following you ebb. Until a red pop-up tells you that two mothers are fighting over the marital prospects of their daughters, or that a varl, (a horned immortal) was found clawing himself in the woods — or, more dramatically, that someone important, to the characters and to your goals in the game, has died, or betrayed you. When things happen, they happen textually. Beyond that, the in-game visuals are limited to varieties of landscape, varieties of battlefield, and varieties of campsites. (And, as said, the occasional animated exchange, where this animation involves very little beyond glancing eyes and twisting hair and printed dialogue.) But these limitations don’t feel like laziness.

A Song of Ice and Fire has similar levels of dull-ness and bad-to-worse-ness and also occurs in a rich, historied world, where big things are happening. But, being a series of books, it happens entirely textually. And that seems important. When I played Final Fantasy 8, my actions scar the world, and I see it, in the world map or otherwise. Things change, and also you are constantly chased from bad-to-worse. Neither ASOIAF or FF8 offered me quite the same experience I’m having here, but for different reasons. Since I do not make choices in Westeros, I can empathize with the plights of the ASOIAF characters, but though I am certainly rooting for some, I am never anxious, usually simply in a state of proto-grief. Though I did make choices in FF8, there was never a sense (supported by in-game information) that this was all business as usual.

I think The Banner Saga provides a kind of game delicacy: the sense of making decisions in dreadful world, where your decisions have weight, yet so routinely lead to bad consequences, where one feels very ordinary and not up to the task, in just the way the characters do.

To get that sense, I think you need elements like formulaic visuals, but choices, too, presented textually. There’s something either very powerful or sadly impotent about one’s imaginative capabilities when reading: I rarely notice inconsistencies. Part of that might be because I’m invested too much mentally, such that I pull out everything I can to make it all work, or I’ve invested too little, such that I haven’t even really imagined things enough to notice inconsistencies.1 That a significant part of the game is textual, and that what is significant within the game occurs textually, seems important. When you pair the formulaic visuals with a rich2 imagined space, I think you get tugged in two directions. You’re anxious because of textually presented decisions, and yet you keep scrolling through the same-old-same-old. Even though there are terrible things happening in the world, the formula for game-play presented in the visuals never seems to reflect the anxious sense you get from the textual decisions, and so their weight never seems to be fully evidenced in the game play. It gives me a rainy-day feeling that literature usually lacks. “All these things need to get done!”, even as the years slip forward. "

												Banner Saga is a study in videogames as a storytelling medium. The score, the sounds, the visual style, and the writing all work together beautifully to tell the story of a merciless world falling apart. It's tense and you're always on the verge of annihilation, and the music alone could tell you so. It's gritty, and the crunches of axes breaking armor and the grunts and moans of the injured make you feel it. People are fragile and the perpetual march is exhausting, and the heavy shambling motions of bodies shows you so.  As the leader, you constantly have to arbitrate the problems of your followers, keep them optimistic, keep them fed, and keep them alive while a continent of panicking and desperate people is being overrun.  Everything harmoniously comes together to weave an atmosphere where feelings of dread and anxiety are constant. Your choice isn't whether or not people die, it's who dies now so that fewer will die later.  In every artistic regard this game is an achievement.Unfortunately it's not for everyone, though. Its roots are in the artistry, not the gameplay--people have some valid complaints about that. Only some. I didn't dislike the gameplay at all, but I was very wrapped up in every other part of the game. Play it for the experience.			"

												As a fan of turn based strategy games I can't say that The Banner Saga is a great game. The strategic part is very basic and isn't more complex than a game of checkers. Also the user interface is really abysmal, the worst I've ever seen in a strategic game. For example you can't inspect your team members attributes and abilities when choosing who to bring in battle. While in battle the interface isn't better and choosing the action to perform feels very cheap. Abilities are described ""with text"" like a game from 20 years ago, no icons and no visual aids. Very very basic.Despite all this I still recommend the game; why? Because the story is tragic and mature like it rarely happens in games lately. It is really up to Norse Myths standards... The music is a masterpiece that is alone worth the price of the game and the experience, as whole, feels like a work of love from its developers. So even if I can't fully recommend it as a game I still recommend it without hesitation as a work of ""art"".			"

												This game is epic. What appears to be a simple tactical combat engine is an incredibly in-depth system. You can learn through experimentation or through paying attention to some dialogue. The ""tutorial"" bits at the beginning help too. I strongly urge people to avoid reading how to play the game, just play it through. Struggle with it. Let that struggle immerse you in the amazing story. Ask yourself who you are.Really, though, I play a lot of games, and from a technical standpoint they did a really great job on this. Both a satisfying ludic experirience, as well as a narrative one.  No need for fancy graphics to hide the mediocrity found in most modern games. But that's not to say that the art isn't just as beautiful as the music in this game.  I think it's even worth another one or two playthroughs.			"

												The game is simply fabulous. A rare mix of a tactical combat with equal dose of text adventuring, where both parts are most interesting by themselves and manyfold so due to their interaction. Tactical combat is an exquisite work of visual gaming art by itself, a rare case when out of elegance of simplicity a stunning complexity of battle is wrought. Adventuring part is equally a first-rate experience, where the most innocent (or well-intentioned) decision may lead to disastrous consequences, and sometimes vice-versa. And, last not least, all of it set with lovingly (and as for me, also breathtakingly) made CG.Also, it is very reminiscing of a much older game with many similar moments (including somewhat similar nordic setting) - King of Dragon Pass[en.wikipedia.org], which I recommend to anyone who liked Banner Saga.

Some of the decisions are hard. It makes you wonder what you would do in their situation. The game has a great replay value and I can't wait to play it again to see what happens differently.			"

												Good tactical game with reasonable strategy element. Different philosophy from the standard strategy game of ganging up on the weakest. Combat a little frustrating at first but once you learn the meat of the strategy and get the hang of it it will be easier.Okay storytelling and have decisionmaking which will impact the content of the story, but not the ultimate ending. The story itself however, didn't manage to hook me.The ""oregon trail"" part is linear, no real choice on what location you want to go. The weakest part of the game IMHO.Still, a good game to sank 15 hours of your life.			"

												Utterly amazing game, truly what inspires what people want to see when they hear 'role playing game', this is a true SRPG.  Many strategy games seem to lack this essence, this game has it spot on more than any in years for it's calaber and genra. Don't get me wrong, as much as I enjoyed this game, it was also too short, while replayability is high, you are essentially playing nordic organ trail after all---It simply leaves you wanting more.I'd part with 10 USD to play this if given a proper price range to assume my moneys worth.  If you don't like this one, I want to know whats wrong with you.			"

												The Banner Saga is an excellent turn-based RPG, where decisions you make affect the outcome of the story and changes the lives of the games characters.  The story is engrossing and revolves around a march to save your kinsmen from danger.  You lean to care about the people in your caravan, which make some of the decisions you have to make very difficult.  Although, this also gives the game a lot of replay value, as you strive to make better decisions, and protect more people in your caravan.  Decisions are more than just choosing when to fight, or dialogue choices; when it comes down to it the entire game is a decision of how best to spend your resources.  Do you buy supplies for your caravan to help you get to the next area? OR upgrade your combat team? Or buy items to have your combat team? They each use the same resource, so you have to decide where to put your limited resource.  Even choosing how often and when to rest effects gameplay.The combat is isometric turn-based, and involves a lot of strategy, and can at times, be surprisingly challenging.  There are three game modes, to provide more or less challenge to the player.  Hard mode being very challenging indeed.Overall an enjoyable experience that will leave you wanting more.  As soon as I finished the game, I began researching if there was to be a sequel, and I was pleased to hear the play is for this game to be part of a trilogy.Definitely worth playing, and highly recommended.

												What a great RPG game. I kind of found this game by accident while navigating through Steam and after reading a bit about it online I decided to go ahead and buy it. It was a damn good decision. It is a bit of a different RPG as for most of it you are left with managing your caravan supplies and day to day problems. The game is linear so there isn't room for you to walk around and explore things like Skyrim or any other RPG out there. The thing about The Banner Saga is it story and how you go about it. Despite being straightforward regarding where you are going you have a say on how you are going to get there. The how in question is not about which route to take physically but rather emtionally and morally. As you travel with your caravan and your supplies dwindle should you threaten a farmer in order to obtain food? Or would you rather negotiate with him?  When a baby is born in your caravan do you stop and celebrate given people have been dying left and right? Or do you say, nope we don't have the resources to cheer, let's carry on? Another thing that really hooks you are the characters. Despite being rather short the game makes you care about each and everyone of the main chars. The problem with this is that no character is exempt from being killed during the game, and it ends up to you to choose weather to add a character to the lineup and potentially risk his/her death. At the end of the game, you end up feeling quite pleased of having survived the ride and also a bit depressed for all the bad things that happened to your party and caravan along the way. For me it was a sad thing to have killed Alette, the main character's daughter, at the final battle as she was my favorite character. Her funeral, in viking manner where her body is placed in a burning ship and sent along the river, was one of the most emotional moments in gaming for me.			"

												Only negative aspect i found in this marvellous game: it's lenght. Really way too short for such beatiful, well narrated story with such stunning visuals and sounds. Every single choice you make changes something, even if little; and there is so much to choose. The battles are hard and some tactics is needed. Enemies are evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that will ravage you. And if you lose the battle, the story will go on...unless you want to retry the whole chapter again. Your people will die if you choose to fight an hard battle, and so they'll die if your supplies aren't enough or simply you make bad decisions when out in the wild. They will either respect you if you prove to be a valorous leader, or pity and despise you if you only think about yourself. And this changes everything about how the story goes on.Harsh environment for a strong story, with quality narration and a mature theme. 7/10 for me, the 8-9 hours lenght really killed it. For such a masterpiece i expected like 20-30 gameplay hours atleast.			"

												This is a very hesitant thumbs up. See, what this page kinda neglects to mention is this is part one of a planned trilogy. I mean, I don't think I can verbally describe to you the look of ""what?"" on my face when the credits rolled just after what felt like the end of the first act. And while I don't generally mind multi-part stories, I think each game should at least have a satisfying self-contained story that ties in with the larger story. One series I like to point to on that is Harry Potter. Each book in that series has a self-contained story, but they also all tie in to the series-long story. This game... there's not much in the way of resolution by the end is what I'm saying. I guess in some ways that's a good thing, since if the game were much longer it would start to drag a bit, but... I just wish I'd known.Other than that, it's got a unique story, an interesting world, a unique visual style, the combat is decent (albeit a bit repetitive after a while), and I do genuinely think it's a good game; it just isn't a finished story.

												Banner Saga is a study in videogames as a storytelling medium. The score, the sounds, the visual style, and the writing all work together beautifully to tell the story of a merciless world falling apart. It's tense and you're always on the verge of annihilation, and the music alone could tell you so. It's gritty, and the crunches of axes breaking armor and the grunts and moans of the injured make you feel it. People are fragile and the perpetual march is exhausting, and the heavy shambling motions of bodies shows you so.  As the leader, you constantly have to arbitrate the problems of your followers, keep them optimistic, keep them fed, and keep them alive while a continent of panicking and desperate people is being overrun.  Everything harmoniously comes together to weave an atmosphere where feelings of dread and anxiety are constant. Your choice isn't whether or not people die, it's who dies now so that fewer will die later.  In every artistic regard this game is an achievement.Unfortunately it's not for everyone, though. Its roots are in the artistry, not the gameplay--people have some valid complaints about that. Only some. I didn't dislike the gameplay at all, but I was very wrapped up in every other part of the game. Play it for the experience.			"

												As a fan of turn based strategy games I can't say that The Banner Saga is a great game. The strategic part is very basic and isn't more complex than a game of checkers. Also the user interface is really abysmal, the worst I've ever seen in a strategic game. For example you can't inspect your team members attributes and abilities when choosing who to bring in battle. While in battle the interface isn't better and choosing the action to perform feels very cheap. Abilities are described ""with text"" like a game from 20 years ago, no icons and no visual aids. Very very basic.Despite all this I still recommend the game; why? Because the story is tragic and mature like it rarely happens in games lately. It is really up to Norse Myths standards... The music is a masterpiece that is alone worth the price of the game and the experience, as whole, feels like a work of love from its developers. So even if I can't fully recommend it as a game I still recommend it without hesitation as a work of ""art"".			"

												God we need more games like this one! The Banner Saga is the first part of an ambitions adventure game created by indie developers. The gameplay is quite simple but entertaining and enhanced with 3 levels of difficulty. The level design is gorgeous, it's deeply inspired by the art of Eyvind Earle but it still has it's own identity. Anyway it's the story that makes this game different from other RPG/Adventure games.First, the world is a perfect mixture between nordic mythology, fantasy and apocalyptic fiction. The story is about survival and beliefs, in this chaotic snowy and cold landscape three races try to escape the forthcoming shadows. This first part is centered on the story of Rook, a hunter, who try desperately to save his kin and his traveling companions from starvation, killing each other and from the dredge's return. The story really evolves depending of your choices, you can build strong relations with some characters and at the same time don't even meet the other ones. You can easily loose your best mates after making a mistake that seemed to be the good thing to do at the time. It makes the story really moving, mature and immersive. And personally that's why I play video games, not to kill dozens of monsters but to feel something. I'm waiting for the second part with great excitement and you should do the same !			"

												Where do I start with this game. Well...it's amazing.The art and animation are beautiful, story is book worthy, and this is one of the rare games I've played where choices actually matter. I think of this as part Fire Emblem and part Oregon Trail. Fighting is turn based and requires a good deal of strategy as when to take off enemy armor or go straight for their health as well when to use your characters abilities. In the overworld you need to make sure you have enough supplies to get you from city to city and along the way events will happen from thieves stealing supplies to possible permanent character death. The same points you use to buy supplies are used to upgrade you heroes. Do you use the points to make your fighters better or do you buy supplies so that you can get to the next city? I had moments while playing where I felt acutal despair as I watched my supplies run dry hoping that maybe I could find some more supplies from an event and cursing myself for using to many points to upgrade units.Did I mention the art? Oh I did...WELL IT'S FREAKING GREAT!Though I only saw one animated cutscene in the game just watching your caravan walk across the plains and seeing beautiful mountains at your back. The God Stones with their elaborate designs that also give you a little insight to the lore of the world. The in-fight animations are also very good and I think there's something really cool about the way the magic looks in the game. I think this game was worth shelling out $25 but hey that's just me. With all of the choices you can make in the game I'm very willing to do a second playthrough on a harder difficulty.			"

												I'd like to preface this review with some advice for playing it: In combat, weaken your enemies to about 1-3 health before starting to kill them, because the more enemies you kill, the more turns their surviving comrades get. People not getting this and getting beaten constantly is the number one source of criticism I see - people don't like it the combat because they don't understand this. To be fair to these people, the game never explains this, you have to learn it on your own. If you learn to use this approach early you'll get a lot more out of the game.The way this game presents choices is a breath of a fresh air. To contrast with BioWare, where the major choices are all set pieces in Banner Saga they're presented much more organically. I've yet to beat the game, but already the story feels very personal based on my choices, compare this with other RPGs, where you often don't see the outcome of your decisions until the end.*Possible Spoilers Below*Something that's very interesting is the use of two protagonists. They manage to make playing as each caravan feel very different, in a good way. In one it's all about war and diplomacy, in the other it's all about desperation and survival. The different feel of playing as each is much appreciated.*End Possible Spoilers*The combat is incredibly satisfying. Normally, I prefer real time with pause combat, but Banner Saga's system is great. It's very tactical without feeling overwhelming.The music and the art are just phenomenal. I can't do them justice here.The world building is also great. It manages to draw effectively on Norse mythology and culture without feeling derivative. There's lots of familar imagery and themes but they're presented in a very fresh way. I'm playing the game as much to find out what happened in the world's past as I am to find out where the story goes. The setting is one of the game's biggest triumphs.EDIT: Having now finished the game I'd like to add some more thoughs. The game as a whole is fantastic. I can't wait for the next episode - I want to see how my choices will affect the rest of the story. More than that, after the events of this episode I'm very excited to see how certain characters develop. The character writing is very, very strong. I was surprised just how attached I became to some members of my party. There are some truly memorable personalities in this game.The major set pieces of game are also fantastic. There are a couple of situations that you face that spread over multiple in game days, where you will be forced to make a lot of hard choices in rapid succession that are truly epic. I can't say any more than that as I couldn't imagine a greater disservice than spoiling in any fashion the two events I have in mind.EDIT2: I'd like to add, if you liked The Walking Dead you'll enjoy Banner Saga. The characterisation of the protagonist and approach to choices are very similar and the stories even have some similar themes.			"

												Blown away by this game. Excellent decision based story. It does a great job of clearly putting a choice in front of you, without tying you down with a morality guage (light/dark side, paragon/renegade). The combat is fun and engaging, although I found myself always wishing it was over so I could further the story. Solid RPG elements, great Oregon Trail management, but last but not least gripping characters and plot. This is the old BioWare we all miss. My biggest complaint was going in I was not aware it was the first of a trilogy, so be ready for it to end with you wanting more character development and plot.			"

												I just want to say I'm completely enchanted by this game...I love the story and the lore, the thought that was put into crafting this story. I find the artwork beautiful, and the combat fun.

												this turn-based rpg is soooo cool! It follows the stories of a species called Varl and Men fighting alongside each other for the first time in centuries against the evil force of the Dredge. The story is great and your choices really carry weight. I love the strong female characters and the art is beautiful~ It has a strong Viking feel to it and just about anyone could enjoy it.			"

												The Banner Saga is probably one of the best games I've played in recent memory; the cast is made of characters who are dynamic enough to be difficult to explain in one sentence or trope, the aesthetics are a marvel for the eyes, and Austin Wintory's score for the game compliments the desolate nature of the game quite well.It's also quite nice to see a strategy game where--for the most part--turns go back and forth, almost like a game of chess, instead of moving your entire army and dominating in one turn. Many of the choices presented to you throughout the story are legitimately hard decisions to make, and the possibility of losing party members or forsaking rewards makes you think about your options, and makes each run of this game a little more unique.I do have my gripes with it though: some of the classes don't feel too unique from each other, special attacks aside, and for the most part, the story doesn't really branch out much. Your decisions do indeed affect immediate events, but you're still locked on the story progression the game wants you to take.Don't let that be a turn-off, however. I've poured nearly 12 hours into this game, and I've enjoyed each one of them.FINAL GRADE: A-Highly recommended, but there's considerable room for improvement.			"

												Simply excellent.  A well crafted tale of sorrow, suffering, and sacrifice.  The unique visual style and easy playing controls help the narrative flow easily in a game more geared towards your decision making (and living with the consequences of those decisions) than fast reflexes or crafty maneuvers.  At its core, the game takes many classic RPG tropes and turns them on their head.  Expect to be forced to make a choice between two or more bad options and to have it cost the characters the writers are so good at making you care about.Well worth the buy, I hope to see more work from the same developers in the future!

												This is an exquisitely crafted game.  The visuals speak for themselves, and along with stunningly stark dialogue, they bring the Scandinavian roots of the story to life.  The solemn acceptance of difficult decisions shines in this grim context; choice and consequence have rarely been this profound.I'll try again:  If you took Oregon Trail, and then mashed it together with some Front Mission, borrowed the themes and flavour of Snorri Sturleson, and then had it lovingly painted by Disney's best artists, it might look something like this.Games which are this difficult to concisely describe probably deserve your attention.

												Achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s:This is not an easy game to get 100% completion (took me around 90 hrs.). However, it is easy to get half of the achievements, give or take, with one playthrough. It took me around 6+ playthroughs to get all of the achievements (I did NOT plan it out well), and some of them are pretty tough when doing the hard mode ones.Updated Review (07/2016):This game is worth buying if you like dark-themed, turn-based, and linear RPGs, but keep in mind some possible CONS: -The game is fairly short for an RPG (taking my time, I beat the game in 13 hours on normal difficulty for my first playthrough). -It has an abrupt and unresolved ending as it is episodic (The Banner Saga 2 continues the story but doesn’t finish it yet).-It is not an open world if that is what you are looking for—it is linear with auto saves (you cannot choose where and when to save, although each auto save has its own save to access if you want to try something different or screw up).-The game has a lot of reading involved (you rarely hear a person speak). In fact, this plays out similar to a point-and-click choices count story, but the turn-based fights in-between reading provide excellent strategic game play that typical point-and-click games do not.With that said, many PROS to the game include:-The story is dark but creative and refreshing with a unique feel and well-developed characters (be prepared to laugh, curse, and possibly cry). -The dialogue and choices are often entertaining and feel realistic for the setting (the little bit of voice acting in the game is excellent). -The art and score are beautiful. -The game play/turn-based fights are addictive, and the fights even get a little challenging on the normal setting (I cursed at my monitor A LOT on hard mode, but I also like the challenge). The game is worth multiple plays not only for achievements, but to also try out different choices as they can have a fairly large impact on the story that can transfer to the second game (The Banner Saga 2 gives you the option to continue your saves from the first game). Even though I have completed all of the achievements and played the game many times, I will probably play the game again. :]			"

												I was engrossed from beggining to end. The Banner Saga delivers an engaging story, amazing bee-you-tee-ful art, and turn-based combat goodness amid an original and interesting setting/lore.As the game starts, an ancient race of stone men that have mostly kept to themselves for centuries, are coming from the north en masse, killing, maiming and destroying. Thus, you are forced to leave your viking hunter-gatherer days behind and start a haphazard perigrination carrying your banner and leading your caravan. As you move on, you will be forced to make difficult decisions, manage supplies/people/morale and battle when necessary (or unavoidable).Along the way, events will arise and you'll be faced with tough decisions. This is not Mass Effect 3 where you just choose in which way you kick♥♥♥♥♥even though the galaxy is supposedly being extinguished... here the severity of the situation means you'll be time and again counting your loses and licking your wounds.It has minor drawbacks. Don't expect mindless AAA spectacle, I'm sure some people may find dialogue parts or other elements a bit sparse. You'll also jump between playable characters a couple times in an awkward, non-organic way. There was one instance where I was really getting into the story only for the game to yank me away to the other side of the map into some other character I had barely noticed before.All in all, a great game that leaves me expectant for the sequels.

												One of the best games in my library!I actually prefer the story line of this game to the second - there are so many powerful and dramatic moments, and it keeps it relatively simple, which in a way is what makes it so touching. The actual fighting mechanics are great, and have some very interesting features to play around, but I didn't find it to be the main selling point of the game.The aesthetic to this game is a work of art (so many overwhelming backgrounds), massive amounts of replayability due to all of the different paths to choose from, but most of all a soundtrack that defies the genre. Austin Wintory must have been so inspired to produce such an imaginative and engaging score, and a very wide variety of colourful motifs. The score to both this game and the sequel are some of Austin's greatest game scores to date, possibly only beaten by his score for Abzu, which is some of the most descriptive and moving music written for games, and perhaps ever (although my laptop could never run the game, so I couldn't really review the actual game).

												If viking Oregon trail and a turn based tactics game had a baby it'd be a lot like banner saga. First thing you will notice about the banner saga is the art, rotoscoping isn't something that you see everyday let alone in a video game and the bannar saga excels at making each person, place or thing you encounter on your journey really come to life with beauty.Speaking of journey the music in this game is composed by Austin Wintory who did the music for the game Journey. The entire game sounds fantastic from the heavy beating of drums to the triumphant bellow of horns the entire sounds epic from start to finish.As I said before the game really feels like a great mix of turn based tactics and Oregon trail. Combat takes place on a grid and you and the enemy take turns bashing each other. With each character having different strengths and weaknesses and a simple yet deeping twist on how your units health works the game really makes you feel accomplished for each and ever battle you win. That is a good thing because honestly this like to give you a bad hand a lot.The other half of the game is the traveling part, as you and your viking caravan cross mountians and icy wastes you must deal with a number of issues such as ""Do we have enough food?"" ""Can we trust these strangers we just met?"" The game makes you choose and everything you do has an effect on the caravan as a whole. Letting some strangers join you might mean they steal a bunch of the food in the night and then suddenly you are in the middle of nowhere and people are starving to death right and left as you push forward. You must make tough choices often times sacrificing one resource or another while trying to keep the people and warriors you take on in good spirits.In the end the Banner saga is a deep game with rich lore and a enduring characters and it's a adventure worth taking.

												Hello,I'm going to start off by saying that this is a beautiful game. By beautiful I mean soundtrack, artwork and story. It's really enjoyable and definitely worth playing. It has a very... ""Authentic"" feeling to it.Pros:Artwork - The artwork is beautifully drawn and everything is nicely animated. Even though a bit simple at times, even the simplicity of it all seems to blend in perfectly with everything.Music - The soundtrack is nice and gives off an appropriate vibe considering the setting, but it's not incredible. It's nice, really, but it could have been a bit more diverse.Story & Character development - The story and character development are amazing. Even though they have small flaws, everything seems somehow inevitable and most of the time you are basically doing everything to make the best out of an impossible situation. That's the real struggle. Doing the best you can - no matter how bad it is.The characters are nicely designed and some of them actually evolve in unexpected ways, even if they do scream cliché at times.Skills and attributes - These go hand to hand with their usability in combat (which I will explain below) and how much you really need to think about when you upgrade them.Combat - I assume that we've all seen this type of combat by now and its basics should come as no surprise to anyone. I like the general combat style, but what I love about it are some small touches that make it... Unique. Crippling the armour of an enemy is generally optional in games, but not here. No way. If you want to actually have a chance at slaying Dredge, then you really need to buff up your armor breaking. Also damaging an opponent will not only hurt them physically and take down their hp, but will also reduce the damage they do.I like the fact that the game forces you to weigh your decisions carefully, most of the time having to choose either damaging an opponent with a small burst for the moment or simply working your way until being able to constantly damage them for higher values.Cons:Voice acting - Although sometimes done well, a large part of the voice acting in the game could do with improving. Of course, it's understandable seeing how the actors were chosen and the fact that Stoic didn't exactly have an immense budget for this project.Decisions - This is the type of game which is, for the most part, story-driven. Generally the types of fans that play this type of game are the ones that expect their role and their decisions in the to be important. It is exactly the type of game from which fans expect every decision to be important and to have significant consequences. Don't get me wrong, they're important, obviously, but I wish that some of the decisions that ulteriorly end up with the same result to have some more depth to them. The fact that quite often anything you choose to do will lead you through the same events is not what bothers me. What bothers me is that the game is quite transparent about that and lets it off quite easily.Character leveling - I really think that they should have sticked to the standard form of leveling (Everyone who's still standing at the end of the fight will get exp), buuut they didn't. Instead you gain exp for dealing the killing blow on enemies. Normally that wouldn't be so bad, but it's just so much easier for some characters to get the kil than others, that it basically makes the process of leveling certain classes very, very difficult. There's always that one big guy, with the two-hander that comes in and beats the crap out of everything that's still standing.Equipment - Well, there's really not much I can say about the equipemnt section because it didn't actually stand out. I expected equipmented rooted into the lore of the game that can help an immense deal, but I actually got a lot of items which could situationally help... Somtimes. Some items are good, sure, but not really that much. The difference they make isn't all that noticeable if you spend your points properly.Conclusion:This is a great game, definitely worth buying if you enjoy your good ol' tacitacal turn-based. But it's more than that. It's actually a great buy if you simply enjoy a good story. Combat isn't all that difficult and it's easy to get into, even if it does, at times, get a bit tiring (I'm talking about you, people who want to try out every possible path and never want any characters to get knocked out.

												I absolutely loved this game, so simple and kind of reminds me of Hearthstone in the way that the Health/Armour works, although subtle differences.The artwork is pretty good although sometimes got a bit repetitive with all the snow, it made you unable to see most of the background other than the main path however when there was less snow it was beautiful atmosphere. Overall I love the cartoon feel to it.Enough of the graphics. The main thing I love about this game is the fact that the decisions you make, actually do have an effect. Not only that but it makes you think about what you want to say, Do you need another character? Do you need more suplies? What one should I choose to keep my character alive? Should I take a risk?All these questions I was asking myself as I progressed.However sometimes I felt that some decisions made no sense to me - personally - and that some were harsh as it sometimes causes some of the characters to die, it obviously has no effect on the story but it is annoying as you may have levelled that character to a high level and spent your XP points on him and then he is gone, seems like a waste.I also dislike the fact that one group of characters you get to play with are not as powerful as some of the other groups and I felt like some characters I was able to level up easier as they did more base damage, the ""archer"" type felt fairly useless in most circumstances as the space the ""Dredge"" can move is so great compared to the range of the arrows, it felt like a wasted character to me, they have low armour and low strength and it just did not gel with my preferred playstyle and also I felt like the Varl were FAR superior to the humans.However the storyline was interesting although fairly short, it also had me addicted for the 5-10 hours it lasted and I am on my second playthrough on a harder difficulty and choosing different options. It has replayability in that way.The final boss fight is extremely challenging and I enjoyed it thoroughly, with many retries, and many rages.Amazing animations in combat and although the Voice acting was scarce, it was effective when used. It could have been used more and there is A HELL OF A LOT OF READING, which I am fine with but you may not be. When speaking to people, it sometimes felt like it was drawn out and too much text but I liked it nonetheless. Requires patience.I would advise you to pick this game up, mainly if it is on sale. 100% worth $15 and less but I picked it up for $5 I think.An amazing game overall and I loved it so much while it lasted.

												Highly recommend this game for fans of tactical RPGs, or turn-based RPG combat in general. It makes some questionable design decisions at various points, but is well worth every cent of the asking price. (If you pick it up later on during a Steam sale, congratulations, you're winning.)Selling points: this is possibly amongst the most beautiful games I have ever played. Not in terms of ""graphical fidelity,"" of course, but the cel-shaded art style is extremely well-done all the way through and quite captivating. I would happily take games in this style over mainstream AAA titles living in the uncanny valley over and over again. My only complaint in this area is the extremely limited character animation during ""cutscene"" conversations; what is there simply serves to highlight how little there is. I probably wouldn't even have noticed if not for the few efforts they made on this front. (A very, VERY minor complaint, since the game is not relying on FMV-style, and even in still shots, the artwork is simply gorgeous)The tactical combat is engaging, and the mechanic which links a character's health to his damage output makes an otherwise simplistic system compelling (do I do limited damage against this enemy to lower the danger they bring, or reduce his armor to make my next turn that much more effective while risking him bringing the hurt in the interim?) and makes level-up decisions on characters agonizing. I went the route of ""specializing"" each character I used frequently, resulting in characters of similar class and starting stat reaching the end-game with vastly different skill sets (i.e. of the two archers I used every opportunity, one was the absolute best at knocking enemy armor out of the picture, while the other was a damage-and-willpower fiend who had my highest kill count by the last fight). Also, while I'm not huge on harping for realism in games, it has always somewhat annoyed me that characters with 1HP out of their 1,000 maximum were just as potent as at full health, and this is a nice way of remedying that.The story arc is compelling and kept me interested the whole way through without relying on many overdone tropes and archetypes, taking place in a very interesting setting I would happily p[ay to see more of. There is also quite a bit of background lore and information made easily accessible without forcing it to the forefront through excessive exposition, leaving its perusal to those willing to spend the time to enjoy it and letting those less interested mostly ignore it without detracting from the direct experience.The Renown system, which irritated me a great deal, but in a good way (as odd as that sounds). EVERYTHING in this game - level-ups, food for your tribe, items to supplement your heroes - is purchased with renown, which you gain from victory in battle as well as certain C&C moments in between. While it can be frustrating at times, after beating the game, I view it in a wholly positive light - rather than making something like EXP and Gold to be used for two separate purposes, incorporating both resource pools into one base stat increases the strategic element, and makes every expenditure that much more risky and demanding. I entered the final battle with three fully-leveled characters, and two weaker ones, simply because I had spent the renown necessary to do so along the way to ensure nobody in my caravan starved to death along the way. (Which can also say a lot about you as a person, I suppose, in terms of how you choose to spend it) At times, I would have preferred separate pools for the various resources, but only because it would have made my inherent min-maxing tendencies easier to oblige, and I cannot legitimately call out a design decision that increases complexity and the importance of a player's strategic choice.Detriments: the touted choice & consequence mechanic, while always nice to see, seems to mostly amount to extremely random and jarring consequences; each major decision seems to have one ""correct"" option which yields a positive outcome, and the negative consequences of ""incorrect"" decisions are never forewarned adequately, resulting in major impact up to and including losing substantial characters with absolutely no warning (on courses of action they themself recommend, even). Think the Witcher in terms of its unforseeability, but without the time delay or overall neutral tone which was par for the course in that game. (To be fair, there were a couple consequences - one VERY major one - which took half the game to  conclude and did have ample but not flagrant warning, so the game did this quite well in some instances, but failed in others)The combat never changes or develops in a significant way after the first battle outside of levelled-up abilities and new character classes with different special skills opening up different strategic options. What you see in the first battle is largely what you're going to get.In the combat mechanics, again, the game seems to settle in the middle; the endgame battles (especially the final boss) had me biting nails and languishing over every turn, and the beginning was not far removed, but I had comfortably established a routine throughout the middle half of the game which pretty much ensured I'd win any given battle ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥d-drunk with minimal unit injury in the process. A more level experience would be nice.A mechanic I rather like (linking health and damage output to the same attribute) has its flaw; in many situations, it is often tactically better to leave an enemy unit on the battlefield at very low HP rather than killing them outright. Due to the mechanic Il ike, their damage potential is next to nothing, but this goes against general gaming instinct and raises concerns in compliance with the point below...MIXED FEELINGS: the way the turn-based system is executed. Instead of some stat which addresses/influences initiative, the game will always go YOUR SIDE-ENEMY SIDE-YOUR SIDE-ENEMY SIDE until only one unit remains on either, at which point one side will execute all of its turns and then the other proceeds. On one hand, I like this to an extent, because it makes battles lopsided in terms of numbers not unwinnable; on the other hand, I think it's fairly backward in terms of a good mechanic; if it were kept the same throuh the last round, it would give that moment of despair when you haver one unit left against four an air of possibility, thinking if you execute well enough you can pull this situation out of the fire (or, conversely, keep you thinking your moves over in the last moments of a fight, as an enemy acting that quickly could turn your 4-1 advantage into a one-on-one exchange if you ♥♥♥♥ it up badly enough). While I do like the mechanic as a whole as opposed to the general turn-based style, it loses its punch with that particular element making the last few turns of any given fight a foregone conclusion when it could have served to bring each and every one down to the wire.ALL IN ALL: a very, very good game. I didn't catch this game's Kickstarter in time to contribute, but most likely would have, and do not at all regret spending full price for the experience once it released. I'm hoping it does well enough that multiple follow-ups/sequels are developed, so long as they equal or improve on the quality of the original. If you enjoy slower-paced games with combat more tactical and mindful than visceral and egoistic, this is a no-brain purchase that I wholeheartedly recommend. If Call of Duty is your favorite game series... 1. this is probably not for you; 2. please die as painfully as possible in a fire as soon as possible so as to possibly rectify the damage you have already done to the industry as a whole.

												I'm a fan of tactical games and RPGs; and this one did quite well on both accounts.  It managed to do so with an amazing live score, voice acting, and beautiful artwork to boot.  I came to really appreciate the characters and even became invested in them as was revealed by certain turns in the plot.  I like the mechanic pretty well, but compared to other tactics RPG's the options for fighting seem somewhat limited.The whole game isn't based around fighting, though.  A good portion of it is spent ""Oregon Trail""-style journeying across a landscape and making choices which affect the fate of your group.Highly recommended.			"

												Freaking loved this game. (And who doesn't love vikings?)It has a great story and quite an unique art style. People tend to forget how immersive animation can be in both video games and movies/series, I mean.. How often do you see an animated game these days? While you are travelling the land with your caravan you'll never get bored of the background.. it so addicting to watch at, same goes for your caraven which increases in size in time.. it is kind of satisfying seeing all those people march with you upfront.The music is incredible nicely song and again.. immersive, I did notice a lack off of it while travelling with the caravan sometimes though. But beautiful nonetheless it grabs all the dangerous and emotional moments.Choices are rather important in the story.. If you make a certain choice one of your hero characters can suddenly betray you or your army gets sick by picking fruit from certain trees. Also don't let too many people join your caravan no matter how nice it might seem. (You will run out of supplies and most of them will starve to death!)The combat gameplay itself isn't that impressive but.. It's fun and can be very difficult (depening on your difficulty ofcourse).I would certainly recommend this game to those who love good story telling, characters and immersion.			"

												Through its amazingly beautiful artworks, The Banner Saga unfolds its story before your eyes like a good book: It doesn't explain you everything firsthand, or spoil its world with ""explanations for dummies"" of why this story and where is what. No, it treats you as an intelligent reader (rather, gamer) and only leads you by hints, letting your imagination to fill the gaps between the narrative, like in a proper novel. Although you are not quite sure where the story is going, you know it's epic, desperate, and at the same time, contains enough rays of hope that let you long for your characters to reach peace and a better day. True, from a pure gaming perspective, although clever, its mechanics stay very simple, and could be seen as repetitive. But you don't want to win every battle out of cleverness, to ""beat the game"". You want to win them so that maybe, hopefully, this will save more of your clansmen, fighters and varls. Because the story infuses you with empathy for its likeable and complex characters, offers you few but tough choices, you end up really carring for them, not because you have level them up, but because of who they are: Rook, Alette, Iver, and all the others, struggling to survive, being doubtfull about their (yours !) decisions, hoping they will reach a happy ending.The Banner Saga is quite a unique game, because it manages something very hard to reach with this media: It conveys emotions.I can understand it's not a journey for everyone, but it definitely transported me...

												After completing this game once here's the best way to describe it:Breathtaking.Now I don't mean that in a lame metaphorical way specifically, but suffice it to say that there will be times where you will be caught completely off guard by the plot, and the fact that you had direct influence on it. I immediately started playing again, not for the sake of acheivements or even getting a ""best ending"" but just wanting to do things a little differently.I'm not really a connoiseur when it comes to music, but unlike other games I never listened to my own music on top of the game's.Visually this game is amazing. Boiled down, yea its a bunch of simply cycling illustrations, but those illustrations are brilliantly done, and never make you feel like you're watching some dumb gif loop. In line with that it is one of the only games I can play on my laptop's fan run like a jet engine, which is to say, it is in no way demanding for any computer to run.That said, assuming that the place where my first game ended is in fact the ending of the game, I think the loose ends did catch my attention. That didn't at all take away from the overall experience, and if anything it makes me think that they will (hopefully) be releasing a sequel, what with the girth of lore that was given to the game. Over your travels within the game you travel not even a fifth of the presented world, but it never feels like you're missing anuything. In actuality it just made me wish I could go farther, which is probably the right way for a game to make you feel.The combat is fantastic. I was amazed and enthralled with Factions, and the minor tweaks that were made to pre and during combat gameplay was done with this game in mind, not bending to any sort of predesigned border. Such a thrilling experience during every battle.A small thing that I really did appreciate was that RNG was in the hands of the player. Only by equipping certain items did RNG ever come into play, which is something I wish a lot of Tactical Strategy RPGs (or what have you) would do as well.TL;DR,A game with the smallest of blemishes that left me wanting more, 9.5/10			"

												Blown away by this game. Excellent decision based story. It does a great job of clearly putting a choice in front of you, without tying you down with a morality guage (light/dark side, paragon/renegade). The combat is fun and engaging, although I found myself always wishing it was over so I could further the story. Solid RPG elements, great Oregon Trail management, but last but not least gripping characters and plot. This is the old BioWare we all miss. My biggest complaint was going in I was not aware it was the first of a trilogy, so be ready for it to end with you wanting more character development and plot.			"

												Where do I start with this game. Well...it's amazing.The art and animation are beautiful, story is book worthy, and this is one of the rare games I've played where choices actually matter. I think of this as part Fire Emblem and part Oregon Trail. Fighting is turn based and requires a good deal of strategy as when to take off enemy armor or go straight for their health as well when to use your characters abilities. In the overworld you need to make sure you have enough supplies to get you from city to city and along the way events will happen from thieves stealing supplies to possible permanent character death. The same points you use to buy supplies are used to upgrade you heroes. Do you use the points to make your fighters better or do you buy supplies so that you can get to the next city? I had moments while playing where I felt acutal despair as I watched my supplies run dry hoping that maybe I could find some more supplies from an event and cursing myself for using to many points to upgrade units.Did I mention the art? Oh I did...WELL IT'S FREAKING GREAT!Though I only saw one animated cutscene in the game just watching your caravan walk across the plains and seeing beautiful mountains at your back. The God Stones with their elaborate designs that also give you a little insight to the lore of the world. The in-fight animations are also very good and I think there's something really cool about the way the magic looks in the game. I think this game was worth shelling out $25 but hey that's just me. With all of the choices you can make in the game I'm very willing to do a second playthrough on a harder difficulty.			"

												This game is essentially The Oregon Trail, but with a Nordic fantasy theme and a rudimentary turn-based combat system akin to Final Fantasy Tactics or X-Com (but with substantially less depth). The art style is refreshing, and the lovingly crafted world is enjoyable to immerse in for a while. Unfortunately, it is a very short while; most players will find themselves wanting more content after the final battle. Buy the game if it is on sale for less than $20 and I suspect you will feel rewarded by the purchase. In my opinion, the $25 price point is just a bit too high for the amount of gameplay you get.I sincerely hope that a sequel is in the works; one with a hundred hours of gameplay and a more robust combat system. This is a world I'd like to inhabit again.			"

												Raise your banners it's the saga... The Banner Saga.This game... There aren't a lot of fantasy settings that really get me, but this one was one of the few. It's a kind of desolate, nordic setting with some focus on a few political aspects. Love it.The game has a special art style which wasn't really my thing, but nevertheless very thorough and unique, it has a strong focus on story, but not in your typical fashion, and has a strategic HOMM/XCOM-like battle system with RPG features, like individual character levels, skills and Items.If you want about 8-12 hours of story-driven gameplay with a pretty good but not amazing combat system, this is a really good choice and the release price wasn't extremely expensive. My biggest complaints are the length and that I want a sequel to delve further into this fantasy world.			"

												The Banner Saga is an excellent turn-based RPG, where decisions you make affect the outcome of the story and changes the lives of the games characters.  The story is engrossing and revolves around a march to save your kinsmen from danger.  You lean to care about the people in your caravan, which make some of the decisions you have to make very difficult.  Although, this also gives the game a lot of replay value, as you strive to make better decisions, and protect more people in your caravan.  Decisions are more than just choosing when to fight, or dialogue choices; when it comes down to it the entire game is a decision of how best to spend your resources.  Do you buy supplies for your caravan to help you get to the next area? OR upgrade your combat team? Or buy items to have your combat team? They each use the same resource, so you have to decide where to put your limited resource.  Even choosing how often and when to rest effects gameplay.The combat is isometric turn-based, and involves a lot of strategy, and can at times, be surprisingly challenging.  There are three game modes, to provide more or less challenge to the player.  Hard mode being very challenging indeed.Overall an enjoyable experience that will leave you wanting more.  As soon as I finished the game, I began researching if there was to be a sequel, and I was pleased to hear the play is for this game to be part of a trilogy.Definitely worth playing, and highly recommended.

												What catches the eye - this is an excellent graphic performance. As an illustrator I was very pleased to recognize). This wonderful videos and charming style, detailed animation fight. The next thing that impressed - it's the sounds. This is a very melodic music, and accompanying sounds (someone sneezes, wheezing, flaps its wings, shuffling foot,  energy  armor opponents buzzing).  :)  As for the body of the game - it's combat system and dialogues. All that I like too. First, about the combat system. Nothing super new, but there are some pleasant little unusual moments. The main thing that is quite thought out and not annoying, interesting to play (especially at the most difficult level of difficulty).The combat system allows you to use characters to help each other. (They have distinctive features. Such a blow that all who are near allies also hit the enemy, even if the allies had already made ​​their move) In other words, each character beats here not only for themselves but also the team That is a good impression.By the way I love tactical games (Heroes 3, Fallout 2, Hoshigami, Front Mission 3, Kings Bounty, Vagrant Story, Disciples 2) Dialogues done at a good level. Loved the style of communication. And most captivating-  bifurcation versions of the story in small segments. For example you have finished an hard battle (but the game is not saved) then immediately draw you into a dialogue where you choose options from which you can lost one of characters. I had to replay the battle 7 times to guess the option of dialogue that will lead to the fact that the characters remain aliveOverall, the game is and lures in a single stylish amazing world of fascinating atmosphere and strong components.

												Banner Saga is a real treat from former Bioware employees and the writing, tough decisions, and attachment to the story / characters is on par with earlier Bioware titles (KOTOR, Dragon Age: Origins). The game is a mash-up of Bioware storytelling, Oregon Trail-like treks, and fairly deep turn-based rpg combat (Final Fantasy Tactics, Disgaea). The treks transverse a fantasy nordic realm and you have to deal with having enough food for your soldiers / civilians, encountering hazards, and sometimes deviating from the ""main"" route. Visually they were inspired by Disney's Sleeping Beauty and the nordic soundtrack compliments the awesome landscapes and story well. There is some voice-over work, but nearly all the dialog is text.I backed this game on Kickstarter and I'm happy to say the game has surpassed my expectations. To be clear, this is Chapter 1 of a trilogy Stoic has planned and additional chapters will not be free. My first playthrough lasted a little over 14 hours and I felt the journey was fulfilling and satisfying, while still wanting to continue the narrative. I can see myself replaying the story once or twice again, since there were numerous choices I'd like to see pan out differently.There is also a free-to-play multiplayer client, The Banner Saga: Factions, which features this game's combat and is worth a try imo.

""I can't handle this responsibility! People are looking to me to lead and I'm constantly letting them down."", I wailed.For me, the hallmark of any exceptional game is that it leaves you pondering the wider story and the lives of the characters within it, even when you are far away from your computer.  The Banner Saga most certainly falls into this category. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to find myself dreaming of Dredge and Godstones again tonight.The Banner Saga game mechanic is essentially a modern multi-choice story-driven take on The Oregon Trail, with a squad-based tactics battle engine bolted on top.With captivating writing, stunning graphics and an engrossing, mood-setting soundtrack, the twists and turns of the story have at times left me setting my jaw or blinking away tears. I have found myself incredulous, mouth agape at the narrative's brutality and unfairness.

												Fun and dynamic battles filled with strategy. Beautiful character and scenario design, simply flawless, the sort of thing you wish disney made an epic animation. Although characters have their own personalities and philosophies, the lack of voice acting spoils the experience during dialogue parts a bit. Investing your renown on characters that suddenly leave your host of fighters is rather disappointing. The story and the world's own mythology which supports it are incredibly interesting, the map exposing a little bit of information of every element is stunning, but the game final scene brings and abrupt end for this rather short chapter, leaving most of the main conflict and most of the world unexplored when those features are already revealed there. It gives you the feeling that this planned 'trilogy' could have been released all together in a single bigger game. Also. Vikings. Vikings everywhere.8/10			"

With difficulty selection you can tailor the game to your skill in turn-based combat, and I suggest that all try to play through it at least on Normal, as Easy is a bit of a walk in the park. You will be absolutely enthralled by the environments, and the story is particularly intresting, although very dark.

It tells a compelling story both on a grand scale and at a personal level.At first I thought I'd be disappointed by the lack of terrain features during the combat, but to be honest I didn't mind. Between the big bodies of the varl and the need to worry about managing armor vs strength there is enough going on in the combat to keep me satisfied for the length of the game.If I do have one complaint, it would be how arbitrary some of the dialogue choices' consequences seem to be. I felt like I was at the whim of one of the dead gods sometimes. And it IS an issue because half of the game is about making hard choices in-between the fighting. It keeps things interesting, at least.			"

												This is a very stylish game and it's easy to learn. However, at the tougher difficulty settings, it's challenging and rough. The one thing that I didn't like is that the game claims that my choices in the story matter, but honestly, they don't. The storyline is very strict and linear. Hopefully, the sequels will be better when it comes to this facet of the game.			"

												A beautiful game, the art style and music make sure the world really comes to life. I love the combat, it's tactical and tense, and the nice animations and art make it a pleasure to watch. The story is engaging but you're not very free in big decisions, if you're looking for a game where you can construct your own story you shouldn't bother with this one. Nonetheless I enjoyed the story and found it very engaging. One of the things i disliked was the occasionaly small dicisions you had to make without any idea of the consequences which could be very punishing. Overall highly recommended!!			"

												Beware, you haven't known crushing despair until you've played this.It's actually a pretty amazing game, beautifully designed with an innovative combat system.The difficult choices you make are the defining feature. It does really well at building connection with the characters, then forces you to make decisions that can have gut-wrenching consequences. The plot twists are frequent, unpredictable and unforgiving.I'd heard mixed reviews, so didn't try it out until a sale. There's some valid points made against it, but overall its a well polished game especially for the price. It's worthwhile just as a really beautifully told story, but the turn based combat is fun and challening too. I hope they add DLC or a whole new chapter.			"

												This game is essentially The Oregon Trail, but with a Nordic fantasy theme and a rudimentary turn-based combat system akin to Final Fantasy Tactics or X-Com (but with substantially less depth). The art style is refreshing, and the lovingly crafted world is enjoyable to immerse in for a while. Unfortunately, it is a very short while; most players will find themselves wanting more content after the final battle. Buy the game if it is on sale for less than $20 and I suspect you will feel rewarded by the purchase. In my opinion, the $25 price point is just a bit too high for the amount of gameplay you get.I sincerely hope that a sequel is in the works; one with a hundred hours of gameplay and a more robust combat system. This is a world I'd like to inhabit again.			"

I got it on sale after a D&D friend recommended I give it a whirl seeing as I rolled a Nordic barbarian.Beautiful backgrounds and artwork, engrossing storyline and great character design and development. The combat style takes a while to get used to, but it really pushes you to think tactically to take down the enemy. I understand why some people may not find the combat appealing, but everyone is different.In my opinion the only real downside was I got too attatched to some of the characters, and, well... I won't spoil anything.Protip: don't be so trusting of people.			"

												The Banner Saga is an extraordinary game. Starting with the obvious, the landscapes and soundtrack are both breathtaking and plain epic. But what what really reeled me in, even more than the wonderful and immersive atmosphere, is the storyline. Twisted, and relying so very much on the player's choices. You often don't know where you're going, what to decide, whom you should trust or not, and must rely on your own judgement (often wrong !) and guts to advance. It is such a pleasure to feel like you're are actually choosing, or creating your own path rather than following the same patterns as always ; and it's not so often that a game really makes you think twice about a choice that will (maybe) haunt you until the end... The Banner Saga is really a refreshing creation, dark indeed, but beautiful nonetheless, and takes you in without mercy. I just finished it, and already want to discover all the other paths that lie ahead... I recommend it whole-heartedly !			"

Even you like vikings, chess, and realizing that nothing you do will save them all, then this game will please you even more,This is the story of the apocalypse. Not yours, but theirs. In it is a fear that you will never quite feel.  If the game had been longer, two, three times the length it is, then you might feel the pressing in of time and resources a little more, but with a little willpower (ha) you can fiat a bit of emotional depth and let the characters interact with the world. The combat is decent, just keep in mind that those with the least health can be ignored and spend your time chipping away at the others. 1 damage over two turns is better than four over one, while a Dredge Collosus tenderizes your face. The game is not perfect. Few games are. However, the game is a pleasure from start to finish. I am so very very glad that helped allow Stoic to create their dream and cannot wait to find myself once again esconced in the lore and visual spendor of The Banner Saga.			"

												I didn't actually beat this game yet, but it's damn good. Think the Oregon trail meets Game of Thrones meets an actually good game, and you get this one. A lot of games talk about trying to make all your decisions matter, and a lot of games say they do, but in the end it simply doesn't feel like your actions really matter. Banner Saga is probably the only game I've played where I felt like it was true. When I need to make a decision in-game and someone dies, I feel like their blood is legitimately on my hands. Sometimes the only ones that die are nameless clansmen, and, honestly, that doesn't affect the game much, but one time I made the decision of trusting the wrong guy, and one of my best combatants, a centerpiece of my offense, was just straight up killed. From what I've seen so far (because I've started playing the game twice), the main plot doesn't change, there are no grand branching paths far as I've seen, but you definitely feel the weight of responsibility as decisions constantly have you weighing morality vs. personal survival, risk vs. chance of reward, and sometimes just posing a genuine question of morality. (Choices? 10/10. Your move, AAA studios)Now, without the choices, how about the story itself? The world is nicely built, the story is compelling, the characters are interesting, and there are some really good quotes. It gets trippy as hell, though. Like I said earlier, I never beat the game, so I can't attest to the quality of the ending.(Story? 8.75/10. Worthwhile.)Now that we got this girly nonsense talk about ""story"" out of the way, let's talk about combat. The real men's subject. It's a grid-based, turn-based rpg system, but instead of attacking you decide whether to strike armor or strength. Each does a thing we're not getting into now. How does this effect the gameplay? Enough to distinguish itself. It definitely gives a unique feel, and the tactical question of ""Should I attack strength or Armor?"" rarely has an obvious answer. So it adds a layer to strategy. It's not necessarily ground-breaking, but it adds a little spice. (Combat? 8/10: can't complain; pretty good) It adds just the right amount of spice, really. A classy amount. The Banner Saga is lIke something from a fancy resturant. Just don't actually eat there because the waiter poisons people at random.Overall: 9/10 I would easilly recommend this game to any strategy player, and some non-strategy players.			"

												Achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s:This is not an easy game to get 100% completion (took me around 90 hrs.). However, it is easy to get half of the achievements, give or take, with one playthrough. It took me around 6+ playthroughs to get all of the achievements (I did NOT plan it out well), and some of them are pretty tough when doing the hard mode ones.Updated Review (07/2016):This game is worth buying if you like dark-themed, turn-based, and linear RPGs, but keep in mind some possible CONS: -The game is fairly short for an RPG (taking my time, I beat the game in 13 hours on normal difficulty for my first playthrough). -It has an abrupt and unresolved ending as it is episodic (The Banner Saga 2 continues the story but doesn’t finish it yet).-It is not an open world if that is what you are looking for—it is linear with auto saves (you cannot choose where and when to save, although each auto save has its own save to access if you want to try something different or screw up).-The game has a lot of reading involved (you rarely hear a person speak). In fact, this plays out similar to a point-and-click choices count story, but the turn-based fights in-between reading provide excellent strategic game play that typical point-and-click games do not.With that said, many PROS to the game include:-The story is dark but creative and refreshing with a unique feel and well-developed characters (be prepared to laugh, curse, and possibly cry). -The dialogue and choices are often entertaining and feel realistic for the setting (the little bit of voice acting in the game is excellent). -The art and score are beautiful. -The game play/turn-based fights are addictive, and the fights even get a little challenging on the normal setting (I cursed at my monitor A LOT on hard mode, but I also like the challenge). The game is worth multiple plays not only for achievements, but to also try out different choices as they can have a fairly large impact on the story that can transfer to the second game (The Banner Saga 2 gives you the option to continue your saves from the first game). Even though I have completed all of the achievements and played the game many times, I will probably play the game again. :]			"

												Simply one of the most beautiful games I've ever played. The music, the art, the writing, the worldbuilding, it's all flawless. The story is deep and meaningful, full of emotional weight that never feels cheap or easy. The decisions I made had a direct impact on events in the game, and I really felt for the characters that I lost.The only issue I have is that the game is incredibly short. I'm more than happy to pay for The Banner Saga 2 - I love the game, and I'm attached to the characters and world and want to know what happens - but when the credits rolled I was a little shocked that the game was already over. I felt like I was just getting started, that the story was beginning to pick up and that I'd just hit the first major milestone in the game. But the first major milestone was the end, and now I'm forced to spend more money to play on (which, again, I'm happy to do, but I'm not a fan of this model). Overall I'd highly recommend this - just be aware that there are only a few hours of gameplay here.(EDIT: Having just posted this review I now see that I completed the game in 7 hours. It honestly feels a lot shorter than that. Knowing that it's longer than I remember means I'm less disappointed by the length, and more impressed by how immersed I was in this world while playing.)

												Generally, these are not the types of games I play, but after more than one person recommended it I decided to check it out. There are good points and bad ones to this game as there are with any, here are my general observations. First the good:- Game lasted longer than I anticipated- Animation was beautiful- Music was great- Difficulty levels were appropriate- Overall game play was entertainingThe bad:- Story ended abruptly and was somewhat anticlimactic - Regardless of your choices it forces you on a very obviously predetermined path- The story was weaker than it should be for this genre- Combat can get very dull and repetitive- Actual time playing is short (vs. watching the clan march around or clicking through dialogue)- Price is a bit steep for this kind of gameNot a bad start though for a newcomer indie company. Worth picking up during the steam sale if you are into turn based RPG type games.80/100			"

												I had no idea what this game would be like when I got it, it was very much something purchased on a whim.However I am so glad that I did pick it up - it is a lovingly crafted and beautiful game, with an amazingly rich setting and background.The mechanics of both caravan management and battles are simple, yet elegant. It makes for a very rewarding game that it is geniunely fun to play.I would heartily reccomend this game to anyone I know.			"

												(Disclaimer: The following review was done before playing the sequel(s) and is exclusively pertinent to it.)Banner Saga is the first chapter in a series that weaves nordic mythology and aesthetic with an interesting unique fantasy world that is quite apocalyptic in tone. It mixes tactical RPG elements with a survival ""on-rails"" traveling mechanic (the term ""viking orion trail"" describes it quite well), both dictated ultimately by a visual novel ""choice-based"" gameplay structure.This game's strongest qualities are by far its brilliantly crafted artistic elements: Story, graphics and music. The graphics are wonderful and seeing traditional hand-drawn 2d animation in a world where 3d animation is the norm is refreshing. The backgrounds are inspired by artist Eyvind Earle (they even named a character after him) and are quite breathtaking. The music sounds quite authentic in its attempts to complement its theme, as it mixes elements of traditional nordic folk music (with singing), and is very well composed and was recorded in an actual orchestra which brings it to a whole new level. The story is quite interesting and in parts quite brutal. The worldbuilding is well done and pulls you in quite intensely - though it feels a bit narrow in its scope, lacking a bit of cultural and political diversity at times. As for the plot, there are definately some ""game of thronesy"" ruthlessness (minus the outward adult elements to it), feeling like you're never really safe and anything can happen - except perhaps for some degree of ""plot armor"" that perhaps can't be avoided when you're writing a protagonist-driven narrative.Now for the gameplay, which is where the real faults of this game unfortunately lie:As I said before there are three elements that compose this game: A tactical RPG element that takes place in battles, a on-rails Orion Trail style travelling mechanic which takes place when going from one place to another, and a visual novel, ""choose-your-adventure book"" type of gameplay where the story and dialogue is presented to you and you have to make decisions to lead the game foward, decisions which can prove fortuitous or give you trouble. The problem and the biggest flaw of this game is the fact that it pretends that it is not linear. It constantly throws you game elements that tease you into a false sense of freedom - such as the battle system, which is the only part where the ""RPG"" element really takes place - like for example the map system, which shows you a richly detailed world with many places to go, but never giving you the choice to actively opt to travel to any of those places, but instead claustrophobically forcing you to follow a set trail from which you can never stray off (and from which you can't even go back - once you're going foward, there is no stopping). The resource system is quite simplistic, and the game ""money"" is only acquired in battle and is used for everything, including leveling up your characters. And to make it worse, it's in quite short supply, essencially robbing you with the pleasure of making your characters stronger in case you don't want to, you know, starve to death. This is where the Viking Trail element comes in - yes, you need food to feed your caravan. And not only it's difficult to find supplies, but you also lose them very easily, especially due to events that happen over which you have no control.The game also doesn't make clear what the advantage of having a large caravan even is.Now I have only played this game once, so I only know the extent to which choices matters from other people talking about it, but as far as I know, a lot of the choices don't actually change the story very significantly. Which can be kind of dishonest as it sabotages the feeling you get when first playing the game of you having crafted your own story.All in all, the game feels way too much like a book. A book where you sometimes play ""chess"" against, and a very good one at that, but still a book. But anyway, I really enjoyed playing it, and I appreciate the effort that went into it, so I'm giving it a positive review. But it could certainly be more of a ""game"", or at least be more honest about how much it isn't.			"

												Simply excellent.  A well crafted tale of sorrow, suffering, and sacrifice.  The unique visual style and easy playing controls help the narrative flow easily in a game more geared towards your decision making (and living with the consequences of those decisions) than fast reflexes or crafty maneuvers.  At its core, the game takes many classic RPG tropes and turns them on their head.  Expect to be forced to make a choice between two or more bad options and to have it cost the characters the writers are so good at making you care about.Well worth the buy, I hope to see more work from the same developers in the future!

												This is the kind of game that I want to like. I like turned based combat. I like the setting. It has great art, and a fantastic musical score. But I can't recommend it, certainly not at this price. For ten dollars, maybe. I love games, and I love trying out games. I just felt really put off by this one however. Maybe they overstretched themselves, got too ambitious. There are some big aspirations here. But the core game mechanics are not so strong, and the story line is hard to follow.Maybe it will be improved down the road, but if you are interested I suggest at the very least waiting for a sale and a substantial discount. I got it on a 25% discount and I am kind of regretting it.See http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-banner-saga/user-reviews?dist=negative for more reviews to balance out all the gushing press.			"

												This is an exquisitely crafted game.  The visuals speak for themselves, and along with stunningly stark dialogue, they bring the Scandinavian roots of the story to life.  The solemn acceptance of difficult decisions shines in this grim context; choice and consequence have rarely been this profound.I'll try again:  If you took Oregon Trail, and then mashed it together with some Front Mission, borrowed the themes and flavour of Snorri Sturleson, and then had it lovingly painted by Disney's best artists, it might look something like this.Games which are this difficult to concisely describe probably deserve your attention.

												I just want to say I'm completely enchanted by this game...I love the story and the lore, the thought that was put into crafting this story. I find the artwork beautiful, and the combat fun. I love the fact that my choices have consequences, even if some of the consequences are painful...when something bad happens I just consider what I might do on another play through. I find the combat interesting and somewhat complex...it is taking me a little time to figure out what each characters' strengths are and how to best use them (and I'm sure I haven't got it all sorted just yet, but I like the challenge). I'm not in a rush to finish, and am enjoying every moment. The only thing ""bad"" I can say is that I've read there is only about 9 hours of gameplay...I would have preferred to pay $50 and gotten a full game if that is the case. But that being said I am really loving this game and wanted to provide a different perspective to some of the naysayers. Someone said that the outcome of choices weren't ""transparent"" enough, lol yes, that's kind of the point I think. What fun would it be if you knew exactly what would happen with each choice you make? I like the uncertainty, I like that bad (and good!) things happen unexpectedly based on what you do. I like this game in general, and applause the devs for creating something so unique. I know that you can't please everyone, but consider me one of the pleased! Thanks! And can't wait for more <3			"

												The Banner Saga is probably one of the best games I've played in recent memory; the cast is made of characters who are dynamic enough to be difficult to explain in one sentence or trope, the aesthetics are a marvel for the eyes, and Austin Wintory's score for the game compliments the desolate nature of the game quite well.It's also quite nice to see a strategy game where--for the most part--turns go back and forth, almost like a game of chess, instead of moving your entire army and dominating in one turn. Many of the choices presented to you throughout the story are legitimately hard decisions to make, and the possibility of losing party members or forsaking rewards makes you think about your options, and makes each run of this game a little more unique.I do have my gripes with it though: some of the classes don't feel too unique from each other, special attacks aside, and for the most part, the story doesn't really branch out much. Your decisions do indeed affect immediate events, but you're still locked on the story progression the game wants you to take.Don't let that be a turn-off, however. I've poured nearly 12 hours into this game, and I've enjoyed each one of them.FINAL GRADE: A-Highly recommended, but there's considerable room for improvement.			"

												Fantastic game. I got it on sale after a D&D friend recommended I give it a whirl seeing as I rolled a Nordic barbarian.Beautiful backgrounds and artwork, engrossing storyline and great character design and development. The combat style takes a while to get used to, but it really pushes you to think tactically to take down the enemy. I understand why some people may not find the combat appealing, but everyone is different.In my opinion the only real downside was I got too attatched to some of the characters, and, well... I won't spoil anything.Protip: don't be so trusting of people.			"

												The Banner Saga is an extraordinary game. Starting with the obvious, the landscapes and soundtrack are both breathtaking and plain epic. But what what really reeled me in, even more than the wonderful and immersive atmosphere, is the storyline. Twisted, and relying so very much on the player's choices. You often don't know where you're going, what to decide, whom you should trust or not, and must rely on your own judgement (often wrong !) and guts to advance. It is such a pleasure to feel like you're are actually choosing, or creating your own path rather than following the same patterns as always ; and it's not so often that a game really makes you think twice about a choice that will (maybe) haunt you until the end... The Banner Saga is really a refreshing creation, dark indeed, but beautiful nonetheless, and takes you in without mercy. I just finished it, and already want to discover all the other paths that lie ahead... I recommend it whole-heartedly !			"

												Świetna gra taktyczna. Wykorzystywanie skilli i odpowiednie ustawianie wroga na planszy - klucz do zwycięstwa. Chwilę zajmuje żeby to ogarnąć. Grajcie na najwyższym poziomie trudności - trzeba nieźle kombinować. Nie ma nagrywania w każdym momencie, niektóre decyzje przynoszą efekty po kilku godzinach od jej podjęcia - to wszystko sprawia,  że gra się ciurkiem i trzeba godzić się ze swoimi wyborami. Postaci giną, odchodzą, walki trzeba powtarzać aby osiągnąć optymalny efekt. Gra raczej dla starszych graczy, bo nie prowadzi za rękę. Tutorial jest ubogi. Wszystko wychodzi w praniu. Jedna rzecz, która mnie lekko zirytowała to ostatnia walka. Fabuła narzuca udział w walce postaci, której w ogóle nie rozwijałem. Trzy dni się męczyłem i nie dałem rady - musiałem wgrać stan sprzed decyzji o tym kto bierze strzałę. Przechodzę zaraz po raz drugi na pozomie normal - pierwszy raz zagrałem na hard i ani nie rozwinąłem wszystkich postaci, ani wszystkich fajnych artefaktów nie mogłem kupić. Prawie 50h zabawy, przy czym wiele walk powtarzałem. Teraz zagram dla wygody i przyjemności - zrobię sobie dream team pakerów. Polecam - każdemu kto nie lubi banalnych gier.			"

												First of all, this is such a beautiful game. The art direction is fantastic and very memorable. I have played many games where developers claim that 'your decisions affect the overall game'. This is a very bold statement and most games never truly live up to it. The Banner Saga more than lives up to this statement. The story is brutal and the gameplay can be unforgiving (in a good way), which only adds to its charm. In a time where developers will often play it safe and produce what is sure to sell, The Banner Saga is an absolute breath of fresh air. What I found most interesting about this game was the world, lore and its characters. It's deep and very well structured. It truly feels like an epic journey and when tragedy does strike it's often a very powerful moment. I can't wait to experience more games within this saga. 100% recommended.			"

												The Banner Saga is an incredibly beautiful game, and not just in terms of the astounding artwork. The characters, the monsters, the dialogue, and the interactions are all incredible. I found myself caring deeply for this intricately drawn Norse-ish people. Playing it for the first time, before my friends knew about it, was incredible. I powered through the game, only taking a break to sleep, and had a hard time holding back my tears. I love seeing the popularity it's grown into, and find it very well deserved. It's probably not for everyone, but if you like a good story that really immserses you as the party leader, you'll fall in love.			"

												Three things make The Banner Saga excellent:First, the setting is well done.  The plot is interesting even if, in a general sense, it is unoriginal.  It really shines in the details and nuances (especially how the plot and characters interact) and the feeling of desperation and struggle really comes through as the game progresses.  The music is exceptional.  It's epic when it needs to be without being over the top and subtle when it needs to be without being unnoticeable.  The visuals and sound effects are also solid, and I especially enjoyed the animation style that Stoic used for this game.Second, the choices.  Your choices really drive this game in a way I haven't seen in many others.  Sure you have games where you're faced with a choice that may have implications later, but they're usually easy choices that are morally unambiguous and where the repercussions easy to predict.  In the Banner Saga choices are not so easy.  Choices that seem to be clear and easily made result in unexpected consequences sometimes immediately, sometimes not until much later in the game.  Other choices are just difficult.  The consequences of your choices can be serious as well.  For example, one plot choice I made early in the game resulted in the death of two of my characters much later in the game.  There's also the constant choice of what to do with your primary resource in the game.  It's very limited and you have to decide if you are going to use it to make your characters more powerful or make sure your party can eat for another few days.  You'll be sitting there, sometimes agonizing over your choices and wishing the game were more obvious but loving the fact that it isn't.Finally, the combat.  I like the system a lot.  If you've played turn-based, party-focused combat games before, the basic mechanics are essentially the same.  But there's enough thrown in there to change how you fight and make things interesting.  For example, a unit's health and damage potential are linked (same stat) so the more a character is wounded the less damage that character can do to another character's health.  This alone is an interesting element but you also have another factor with armor mitigating damage to the point where, if a character's armor is high enough, you may not be able to damage that character at all.  This forces you to figure out if it's better to inflict less health damage on an enemy, making him weaker but keeping him in the fight, or if it's better to risk that same enemy being able to do higher damage to your party while you soften him up for a death blow.  Add to that special abilities that are varied and can take some clever playing to set up for maximum effectiveness and you have a combat system that is both consistent enough to get the hang of and become proficient at, but also varied enough to keep things interesting.But there is a bit of bad with the good:First, the game is pretty short.  I was actually surprised when I beat it, and for $20 I think this game could have included a bit more content.  I didn't time myself but it probably took me between 12 and 15 hours to beat the game.  There's some replayability with the fact that there are so many choices to be made and you could spend hours exploring them all but, being so plot-driven, once you've experienced the plot, repeated playthroughs become more mechanical than anything else.Second, this game could have benefitted greatly from a skirmish mode.  There is something of a skirmish mode with the Training Tent, but the only variables you control there are the party you bring and this is limited by where you are in the game, who you have in your party, what their levels are, and what items you've obtained.  A separate skirmish mode where you could set up your own custom battles would have been perfect and enhanced the replayability of the game by giving the player the opportunity to explore all the aspects of the combat system they're interested in, or just hop in and smash some skulls for fun.All in all, I really enjoyed this game and am excited for the sequel.  If an excellent setting and interesting plot are your thing, this game has them.  If you're interested in a game where your choices can have a serious impact on how your game plays, this game does that.  If you're even just into turn-based combat RPGs, this is one worthy of your time.			"

												Don't get me wrong - I am not dissing the game. Let me say that this game is pretty cute, it has a nice story and a few intuitive dilemmas... but more non-intuitve or at least not intuitive and a lot of random in the effects. All in all the choices you make doesn't really influence the story at all.A game that claimed that choices matter is the walking dead games. The graphic there is more advanced so I kind of realized that wouldn't work. The bragging of my choices being important turned out to be m00t to the point I felt it was dishonest as it never mattered who I saved, or even if i made smart choices. The only thing that changed was a few lines of text or audio about other peoples attitude.Ok, back on topic. The banner saga doesn't brag itself to death, but have the same marketing and consequence issues. It really doesn't matter much what I do, the game will end the same and mostly it will play out the same. As someone else pointed out, not caring about the caravan doesn't really matter either. This makes me get bored in conversations AND mostly in dilemmas as it really doesn't matter for my success. Now, success isn't the only thing that is fun... but to me asking me to make choices that are purely or 95% cosmetical makes me think that they could have skipped it and showed me a movie instead.Another thing that annoys me is when the game makes me feel that I have failed due to random events. I spend renownd to level people that simply just die on me 8lr leave like Elof). Not because I made the wrong decision, but because the movie ..ehrm.. the game I *cough* is scripted that way. So I end up losing hordes of renown and cannot level the character the game arbitrary let me keep because the developers choose to kill off character in the story.I have nothing against the story telling aspect of killing off characters... but then I shouldn't lose because I choose to level those characters and not others. That is just... random. The same issue goes with new characters. To be able to use them I should not have leveled the others so much. The point of having many to choose from is m00t as you cannot leve everyone so you are better of sticking with the generally best characters (that you guess won't die or replay after you know which will) and optimize from there. That makes the game poorer from a tacical and diversity stand point.The game is (again) a nice story telling game, with feeling. Too much time sinks for me and unfortunately too little consequence of my actions that make me care enough to read the conversations. I would give it a 6/10 (well not compared to normal judgin where people seem to always give 9 or 10 if they like something. I use the full scale) for those who cares about my opinion. I don't regret buying it, but I am not longing for a sequel.			"

												Be aware that you are going to play this game for about 8 hours and absolutely love it, and then you'll be left dumbfounded by the direction it suddenly takes. As I said, you'll love it; that is if you like the idea of a role-playing turn-based strategy game in which almost every character has their own unique abilities, and thus worth to a battle. Characters level up like in typical RPGs and you can equip them with stat-enhancing gear (only one though, and the highest level is 5). You'll quickly decide your front 6 and rarely deviate from it.You will also learn that this game outright hates you, dealing you pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cards when you are called upon to make a decision. Not always ♥♥♥♥♥♥, however - some lead almost nowhere. But this where the story is primarily told, and because of these infrequent horrible decisions, and the occasional story-affecting choices, the saga feels like it's yours. I'm quite confident that someone out there has done precisely the same things as I did in this game, but, whilst I was playing it, it didn't feel that way.The art style is pretty. Think 50's-80's Disney style stationary art with basic movements programmed in for battles, but with the minimal, yet highly appreciated, foreground and background falling snow to give it an easy 3D effect. Nice all around.My only beef with this game is it's story, particularly the ending. It just ends to soon to put it plainly. Any self-respecting storywriter (who knows or does not know that they may be writing a trilogy) would not have ended it in this way. So many great and interesting angles are left unexplored and hardly explained! The Gods are dead (not much of a spoiler as it's right at the beginning of the game) and yet no explanation is offered. The sun has stopped moving (again, beginning) and no explanation is offered. The (apparent) main boss is introduced 2/3 of the way through without any previous hinting of how significant he's going to be. Why? Because his significance is paired with his existence. Very poor. And it's not even like he's a good main boss: there is a literal earth-shatterer that would have made for a killer main boss!The storywriters need firing for this one. Actually, just fire the ones who argued that it should end in this way because they need to go back to junior school. I don't care if a trilogy had been in the plan the whole time, a good story does not introduce a key aspect of the storyline and then just do nothing with it.I do recommend this though. It's a great game. The tone is excellent and it really feels like your saga. When you finish in a day (if your dedicated enough) you'll see what I mean by just how ♥♥♥♥ing disgraceful the ending is.			"

												I found this to be a challenging and enjoyable strategy/rpg game, which storywise managed to capture the feel of the old nordic myths. I found the combat to be rewarding, especially later on when you have a decent, levelled up team to work with. However the part i found most tricky was balancing between levelling up my characters and keeping supplied with food, meaning at the end of the game i found myself wishing i'd levelled up a couple times rather than staying well stocked and well rested, so bear that in mind if you decide to play the game! I picked this up in the summer sale and have found it good value for money and would recommend this game to fans of strategy rpgs.			"

												Basically, the game has three things about it that make it great:1: The visuals2: The soundtrack3: The storyAll of these things on their own are amazing, but its how they work together that really make this game shine. Throughout the game you're travelling through these vast, beautiful landscapes that make you want to hope in and explore them yourself. The soundtrack however, really drives home this bleak feeling of foreboding which contrasts with the visuals spectacularly. The story is filled with twists, turns, decisions which are going to pull at your heartstrings and characters who you care about. You're taking this long, ardous journey through this beautiful world, but you're being followed by something that won't stop until it has destroyed you. You're going to be making decisions for a lot of people and some of them are going to get hurt. When you combine these three things together, you're left with a game that you won't forget anytime soon.I'm really, really looking forward to what the next chapter will bring.  "

												One of the best games in my library!I actually prefer the story line of this game to the second - there are so many powerful and dramatic moments, and it keeps it relatively simple, which in a way is what makes it so touching. The actual fighting mechanics are great, and have some very interesting features to play around, but I didn't find it to be the main selling point of the game.The aesthetic to this game is a work of art (so many overwhelming backgrounds), massive amounts of replayability due to all of the different paths to choose from, but most of all a soundtrack that defies the genre. Austin Wintory must have been so inspired to produce such an imaginative and engaging score, and a very wide variety of colourful motifs. The score to both this game and the sequel are some of Austin's greatest game scores to date, possibly only beaten by his score for Abzu, which is some of the most descriptive and moving music written for games, and perhaps ever (although my laptop could never run the game, so I couldn't really review the actual game).

												One part tactical combat, one part RPG, one part Oregon Trail. The game has an intense storyline that makes the player really feel the urgency of the characters. Part of this is due to the way ""renown,"" or the game's version of XP works. Renown can either be spent leveling up your characters OR on supplies to keep people alive -- and there's never quite enough renown to go around. The use of scarce resources works really well into the storyline and even more into the player's decisions of what to do. I'm not really much of a tactical combat fan so I was surprised by how much I really enjoyed the game. The best part, however, are the really amazing visuals (outside of cutscenes). I plan on playing through the game a second time just so I can screencap some of the scenes. And even better than the graphics? The music. Really the only thing I could complain about is that the end of the game doesn't really feel like an ending. It's more of a resolution to the current situation than a resolution to the entire storyline. Of course, this may mean a sequel in the future!			"

												Amazing art, soundtrack, story, and characters. Fun combat. Harsh choices, though wish there were more of them with not so many just related to losing battles. The caravan portions could use some fleshing out in the next game. Supplies don't do anything too meaningful, and you can easily win with low morale. Despite that it was hard to keep stocked, and I only kept buying them to satisfy my own personal sense of accomplishment from not letting people starve. There should be greater story consequences when you run out of supplies...because you probably will. Took me 14 hours, taking my time, and will probably replay near the release of a sequel to try and get a better carryover file.			"

												There is so much that made me want to love this game. However, the strength system is horribly unbalanced heavily favoring units like warhawks while units like archers have little recourse once an enemy is upon them. Couple this with the fact that units you invest in can very abruptly die via text menu decisions and you've laid the path for a brutally unlikable experience. I'm also not terribly fond of the inability to move after issuing a command nor am I fond of chain battles when there isn't any sort of healing. Not being able to move through my own units was also not well thought out.While you can advance units by spending Renown on them it quickly becomes expensive and the stat points you're allowed to allocate are sparse at best. Couple this with the fact that a unit can leave or die at any time and I have to wonder why anyone would bother. As well, the save system is janky as hell. Want to save and come back whenever you like? Too bad - you're back at the start of the chapter. I guess now you can maybe stop that party member from abruptly dying. Sloppy decisions. It's a shame - the game is beautiful.			"

The game play is very fun once you get the hang of it. What I enjoy the most is the varying levels of difficulty you can play at, as most strategy based games tend to be a default hard. The story is fairly well done and does lend itself pretty well to replayability. The story does seem fairly short though and the choices presented do make a bit of difference, but don't seem as life or death/story altering as say a game like Wolf Among Us.			"

												Verdict: Many of the reviews on Steam do this game a massive disservice. I understand, I do. It's not what they were expecting. Like most gamers, they want to feel empowered, feel like they are affecting the outcome in meaningful and tangible ways. This is not that kind of game. This game is about disempowerment and despair, accepting consequences you cannot change, and showing resilience in the face of the end of the world. Most of the choices are between outcomes that are bad or worse, and you will feel like you have chosen poorly very, very often. But therein lies the magic of this game; when you fail 9/10 times, the 10th time brings incredible pathos when you miraculously succeed against terrible odds, when a comrade unexpectedly returns, when you find that timely cache of supplies to sustain your march just one more day. It is an emotional antidote to the automatic success meted out by most video games these days. I can't recommend the Banner Saga enough. It is one of the most engaging and affecting experiences I have had in a game. 10/10Story: This game is driven far less by the story as defined by specific plot elements, and far more so by the general feeling it engenders through its overall presentation. Information is seldom just handed out; as the player you have to infer a great deal from subtle hints. Characters are elusive and rarely forthcoming but, even if their role is brief, most hint at significant hidden depth. Many things are left open and unexplained in the end, and that is exactly how it should be. 9/10Gameplay:  There are two main elements to the gameplay: the simulation element where you manage resources and make decisions for your followers, and the turn-based (and sometimes punishing) tactical battles. The simulation part is simple, but wrenching. There are never enough resources to go around, and never a simple choice. Consequences are unforeseen and permanent. The tactical part is standard but given added depth by the armour-break system. Some players will be frustrated by the criminally short range of archers and other distance fighters, but it feels right that there is no hiding on the battlefield. Battles often feel unfair, but that fits the game perfectly. It’s one of the first games where, when a hero dies, I accept and mourn the loss rather than reloading an earlier save. 8/10Graphics: The art and presentation is the soul of this game, and it would not feel the same without it. Everything is rendered in a beautiful, hand-drawn style, with layered backgrounds to add a sense of depth and distance. 10/10Sound/Music: The sound and music are both excellent, and the soundtrack is worth downloading. The ambiance in every scene is incredibly atmospheric and immersive, despite its simplicity. Less is more in this game, and sometimes there is nothing more solemn than a winter wind.  10/10			"

												[+] Interesting blend of convoy management, adventure game dialogue choices & turn-based tactical combat[+] Beautiful art & animation via rotoscoping[+] Expansive lore, spent a while poking around the immense map of the world[+] New take of tactical combat with concept of health & armor as well as bigger-sized units[-] 2D art style prevents rotation of scene, often resulting in smaller units and enemy traps being obfuscated[-] Convoy management meta-game seemed pointless[-] Lack of quality-of-life features such as inventory management before battles & enemy team movement/combat range during combat[-] Frustrating difficulty spike in final battle that resulted me lowering the difficulty to complete the gameDespite what seems like a mixed bag, the game, which I bought initially to support Stoic's stance against King.com, hooked me in for hours of fun. I'm still looking forward to the next part of the Banner Saga.			"

												The game is essentially Oregon Trail, but instead of pioneers, it's vikings, and instead of hunting ducks, you fight monsters. The story is so damn good and the art is so beautiful that it's pretty much impossible not to get sucked in though, and combat system is fun, with enough strategy in it to keep things interesting.Although it looks like an animated movie, it's pretty dark at times, and some of the decisions I've had to make have made me feel legitimately guilty IRL. And I can't say enough how beautiful the art in this is. I would legitimately put up some of the backgrounds from this game as art on my wall.			"

												Bought this in the Summer Sale. Great game, played the feck out of it. 14 Hours in 2 days. Heartily reccomended. 8.5/10There's a heavy enough story but it's delivered with cool art and a nice soundtrack. The story doesn't detract from the gameplay in anyway but rather adds to it and engrosses you in the world. You get to choose which characters to use so you even get attached to some. The theme is like Ord Norse gods/ Viking warriors twinned with other fantasy elements. If you've read David Gemmel, I kept on thinking of the Varl as Druss the Legend type guys.Essentially this is a turn based rpg, like X-Com,  with story elements and travel/ market mechanics. If you loved X-Com, which I did, you will love this.			"

												The wellwritten story sucked me deep into the game's world and characters. I thoroughly enjoyed playing it through. Both the soundtrack playing and setting the atmosphere and the casual simple yet changing gameplay from story to strategic battle along with getting to know to characters and their capabilities kept me at it. I loved the nordic scandinavian mythological inspired setting and the options in it. What I sit back with having finished is a feeling of wanting to try it over again some time, see if I can alter the things I did in my past game and how it will change the experience. I'd recommend this to any of my friends who enjoy a good story, a casual game, a grasping and nice story along with a track of music that will make you love the game even more.			"

												Don't get me wrong - I am not dissing the game. Let me say that this game is pretty cute, it has a nice story and a few intuitive dilemmas... but more non-intuitve or at least not intuitive and a lot of random in the effects. All in all the choices you make doesn't really influence the story at all.A game that claimed that choices matter is the walking dead games. The graphic there is more advanced so I kind of realized that wouldn't work. The bragging of my choices being important turned out to be m00t to the point I felt it was dishonest as it never mattered who I saved, or even if i made smart choices. The only thing that changed was a few lines of text or audio about other peoples attitude.Ok, back on topic. The banner saga doesn't brag itself to death, but have the same marketing and consequence issues. It really doesn't matter much what I do, the game will end the same and mostly it will play out the same. As someone else pointed out, not caring about the caravan doesn't really matter either. This makes me get bored in conversations AND mostly in dilemmas as it really doesn't matter for my success. Now, success isn't the only thing that is fun... but to me asking me to make choices that are purely or 95% cosmetical makes me think that they could have skipped it and showed me a movie instead.Another thing that annoys me is when the game makes me feel that I have failed due to random events. I spend renownd to level people that simply just die on me 8lr leave like Elof). Not because I made the wrong decision, but because the movie ..ehrm.. the game I *cough* is scripted that way. So I end up losing hordes of renown and cannot level the character the game arbitrary let me keep because the developers choose to kill off character in the story.I have nothing against the story telling aspect of killing off characters... but then I shouldn't lose because I choose to level those characters and not others. That is just... random. The same issue goes with new characters. To be able to use them I should not have leveled the others so much. The point of having many to choose from is m00t as you cannot leve everyone so you are better of sticking with the generally best characters (that you guess won't die or replay after you know which will) and optimize from there. That makes the game poorer from a tacical and diversity stand point.The game is (again) a nice story telling game, with feeling. Too much time sinks for me and unfortunately too little consequence of my actions that make me care enough to read the conversations. I would give it a 6/10 (well not compared to normal judgin where people seem to always give 9 or 10 if they like something. I use the full scale) for those who cares about my opinion. I don't regret buying it, but I am not longing for a sequel.			"

												One part tactical combat, one part RPG, one part Oregon Trail. The game has an intense storyline that makes the player really feel the urgency of the characters. Part of this is due to the way ""renown,"" or the game's version of XP works. Renown can either be spent leveling up your characters OR on supplies to keep people alive -- and there's never quite enough renown to go around. The use of scarce resources works really well into the storyline and even more into the player's decisions of what to do. I'm not really much of a tactical combat fan so I was surprised by how much I really enjoyed the game. The best part, however, are the really amazing visuals (outside of cutscenes). I plan on playing through the game a second time just so I can screencap some of the scenes. And even better than the graphics? The music. Really the only thing I could complain about is that the end of the game doesn't really feel like an ending. It's more of a resolution to the current situation than a resolution to the entire storyline. Of course, this may mean a sequel in the future!			"

												One of the best games in my library!I actually prefer the story line of this game to the second - there are so many powerful and dramatic moments, and it keeps it relatively simple, which in a way is what makes it so touching. The actual fighting mechanics are great, and have some very interesting features to play around, but I didn't find it to be the main selling point of the game.The aesthetic to this game is a work of art (so many overwhelming backgrounds), massive amounts of replayability due to all of the different paths to choose from, but most of all a soundtrack that defies the genre. Austin Wintory must have been so inspired to produce such an imaginative and engaging score, and a very wide variety of colourful motifs. The score to both this game and the sequel are some of Austin's greatest game scores to date, possibly only beaten by his score for Abzu, which is some of the most descriptive and moving music written for games, and perhaps ever (although my laptop could never run the game, so I couldn't really review the actual game).

												Well.First things first: it's short, it's part of a trilogy so this is merely chapter one. Kind of irks me that the price for a single chapter is the better part of $25 but I also hope they're going to offer the following chapters as DLC. Otherwise this is a massive cash-grab.That being said - wow. An amazingly well-constructed world and lore out the wazoo. Grammatical errors and switching from second- and third-person narratives willy-nilly aside, the story was also very well written. My skin crawled and shivered several times during the playthrough.I had moments where I wanted to throw my keyboard at the game. I wanted to quit, to uninstall it and leave it to rot in my basement where I would keep it until such a time where I had forgotten the injustice it had done to me and I would allow it a glimmer of sunlight once more. But I didn't. I decided it wasn't the game, it was me. I felt like a victim of household abuse. If the companions I had fought so hard to keep alive suddenly died because of a wrong decision by me, then it's my fault. Mine and mine alone. I learned to live with my regrets, learned to cope with them and keep going; by far, the best thing the creators of the game could have done was not have a savegame feature. You live with the consequences of your choices - and more often than not, there's always a second side to the story. The story ended just as it had begun to make a small portion of sense, though by asking more questions than answering them. I went back to the title screen and was about to hit ""Restart"" when a message popped up - ""If you restart the game, all your previous decisions will be overwritten"". I stopped. Yes, I can go back and play the game and know what to expect now, and probably make a lot less of a fool of myself by making better decisions. But then, it wouldn't be the experience it was meant to be. The experience of putting you in a world that is dying, possibly already dead, where your only hope is to survive; to save a few lives on the way is a bonus, but hard decisions will need to be made. Hard decisions that will stick with you, long after you've finished playing the game. So I didn't restart it, and my ill-conceived decisions are going to sit there until Chapter 2, where I can relive them again. And I will miss some characters dearly, while others I will not bat an eyelid to. This is what a great game is meant to encourage. In a bleak world where the hopelesness and fear seem to be the only constant, where even mountains can be torn asunder, you cling on to the fact that though you may have sacrificed a few men, you survived. And that's all that matters.Because don't you know, the Gods are dead?			"

The art, story and music completely pulls you in to this dark and wintery world full of beared humans and horned giants struggling to survive. Getting use to the combat takes a bit of trial and error, but there is something about the mechanics that i prefer over other grid based games. There are minimum dice rolls, so it feels much more like chess where positioning of units are vital.The game does have some flaws though. Keeping your caravan alive and well fed while leveling up your units is a pain.. yet there is little consequence other than low morale when you start losing clansmen due to no supplies.

The caravan portions could use some fleshing out in the next game. Supplies don't do anything too meaningful, and you can easily win with low morale. Despite that it was hard to keep stocked, and I only kept buying them to satisfy my own personal sense of accomplishment from not letting people starve. There should be greater story consequences when you run out of supplies...because you probably will. Took me 14 hours, taking my time, and will probably replay near the release of a sequel to try and get a better carryover file.			"

												The Banner Saga is by far one of the greatest games I have ever played. The combat is engaging and challenging and once you get a feel for it you waste no time in placing your units exactly where you want them to go. The story is gripping, if a little sad; It allows to you connect to the characters through the main protagonist, Rook, and then takes away some of them who you had come to rely on. The most difficult thing I fould were the different choices you had to make, because no matter which one you ended up choosing you ended up taking the consequences, good or bad, for your actions. One thing I didn't like was the way you had to choose the difficulty of the game. Choosing the difficulty of the game is never an easy thing to do especially when you haven't had any experience in the game, and choosing easy feels like the short road out. Normal mode challenges you a fair bit, while hard mode I've never beaten and would recommend only those who are willing to invest a very serious amount of time into it. Aside from the difficulty the mechanics, story, and overall theme of the game make this a great experience for any who enjoy tactical rpg games.			"

												There are not many games that can boast being remotely as beautiful, challenging, and atmospheric as The Banner Saga.The Banner Saga is, at its core, a turn-based RPG. The turn-based combat is conducted on a ""game board"" with square spaces for your units to occupy. Truthfully, The Banner Saga's combat works well enough, but it's not anything special - there's nothing innovative or exceptional about it. It serves its purpose well enough, is fun, and offers some challenge. What makes The Banner Saga so wonderful is just about everything else about it.It's difficult to summarize all of the aspects The Banner Saga does really well. Right off the bat however, you'll probably notice both the art and audio of the game are fantastic. It's rare to find a game that creates a unique artistic vision and implements it so well, while still managing to include a great, effective soundtrack. It's probably fair to say a lot of games struggle with nailing either one of these, let alone both. But, The Banner Saga creates a beautiful, deeply atmospheric experience with its classically inspired animation visuals and moving soundtrack. Of course, this could be all for nothing if it's being used to prop-up a weak story; fortunately, it isn't.If I'm being honest, I don't think I could name another game that comes close to creating such an oppressive story and atmosphere. The pacing of The Banner Saga is excellent; there's a true feeling of dread and desperation constantly building from chapter to chapter as you try to make (what you think are) the best decisions for your caravan, while fighting through seemingly impossible odds. This is a game full of choices - who to accept into your caravan, who to help, when and where to camp, who to take with you into battle - there are many, often tough, decisions that you'll have to make. All of these decisions are presented well, and all of them have consequences, some dire. This makes each playthrough potentially unique.In The Banner Saga, the world is crashing down around you, and you're left facing insurmountable odds. It will be up to you to lead men, women, and varl. You'll make many decisions, some of which you may come to regret. The world of The Banner Saga is bleak and grim. It's hard not to look at this game with a sense of both wonder and despair, and for that it's impossible for me not to recommend it.			"

The combat is engaging and challenging and once you get a feel for it you waste no time in placing your units exactly where you want them to go. The story is gripping, if a little sad; It allows to you connect to the characters through the main protagonist, Rook, and then takes away some of them who you had come to rely on. The most difficult thing I fould were the different choices you had to make, because no matter which one you ended up choosing you ended up taking the consequences, good or bad, for your actions. One thing I didn't like was the way you had to choose the difficulty of the game. Choosing the difficulty of the game is never an easy thing to do especially when you haven't had any experience in the game, and choosing easy feels like the short road out. Normal mode challenges you a fair bit, while hard mode I've never beaten and would recommend only those who are willing to invest a very serious amount of time into it. Aside from the difficulty the mechanics, story, and overall theme of the game make this a great experience for any who enjoy tactical rpg games.			"

												Be aware that you are going to play this game for about 8 hours and absolutely love it, and then you'll be left dumbfounded by the direction it suddenly takes. As I said, you'll love it; that is if you like the idea of a role-playing turn-based strategy game in which almost every character has their own unique abilities, and thus worth to a battle. Characters level up like in typical RPGs and you can equip them with stat-enhancing gear (only one though, and the highest level is 5). You'll quickly decide your front 6 and rarely deviate from it.You will also learn that this game outright hates you, dealing you pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cards when you are called upon to make a decision. Not always ♥♥♥♥♥♥, however - some lead almost nowhere. But this where the story is primarily told, and because of these infrequent horrible decisions, and the occasional story-affecting choices, the saga feels like it's yours. I'm quite confident that someone out there has done precisely the same things as I did in this game, but, whilst I was playing it, it didn't feel that way.The art style is pretty. Think 50's-80's Disney style stationary art with basic movements programmed in for battles, but with the minimal, yet highly appreciated, foreground and background falling snow to give it an easy 3D effect. Nice all around.My only beef with this game is it's story, particularly the ending. It just ends to soon to put it plainly. Any self-respecting storywriter (who knows or does not know that they may be writing a trilogy) would not have ended it in this way. So many great and interesting angles are left unexplored and hardly explained! The Gods are dead (not much of a spoiler as it's right at the beginning of the game) and yet no explanation is offered. The sun has stopped moving (again, beginning) and no explanation is offered. The (apparent) main boss is introduced 2/3 of the way through without any previous hinting of how significant he's going to be. Why? Because his significance is paired with his existence. Very poor. And it's not even like he's a good main boss: there is a literal earth-shatterer that would have made for a killer main boss!The storywriters need firing for this one. Actually, just fire the ones who argued that it should end in this way because they need to go back to junior school. I don't care if a trilogy had been in the plan the whole time, a good story does not introduce a key aspect of the storyline and then just do nothing with it.I do recommend this though. It's a great game. The tone is excellent and it really feels like your saga. When you finish in a day (if your dedicated enough) you'll see what I mean by just how ♥♥♥♥ing disgraceful the ending is.			"

												The Banner Saga is one of those indie games you just gotta try out! So deep, challenging and fun to play. Tons of little stories and choices you take, make an impact on you, and they all feel important for your caravan! It is so fun to lead your people through mountains and valleys while managing supplies and moral of your caravan. Ending is a little bit weird, and leave a lot of things unsaid. Maybe we're to expect and expansion or sequel? Hope so :) Very good RPG, 8/10			"

												This game is outstanding. The art and story are among the best I've ever experienced in video games. I'd recommend this to anyone who puts story first in games, because the Banner Saga is heavy with conversation and exploration - that said, the combat is great and there are plenty of opportunities to choose diplomacy by sword over conversation if that's more your style.I'll never grow tired of looking at screenshots of this game. Absolutely incredible.			"

												I wanted to play a turn-based strategy that reminded me of the old PS1 Final Fantasy Tactics and this game was highly rated on Steam.

												Really enjoyed this game, worth every cent.Overall, both the detailed art and the storyline of The Banner Saga were my main attraction to this game, however I really liked the combat mechanics as well. I have completed 3 playthroughs so far, and haven't yet come across a single bug/glitch. VERY polished.One criticism I have is that if you don't use or promote certain key characters, you can find the final battle of the game relatively hard as you are forced to use those characters. 9/10 :)(Can't wait for the second installment of the trilogy) "

												There are not many games that can boast being remotely as beautiful, challenging, and atmospheric as The Banner Saga.The Banner Saga is, at its core, a turn-based RPG. The turn-based combat is conducted on a ""game board"" with square spaces for your units to occupy. Truthfully, The Banner Saga's combat works well enough, but it's not anything special - there's nothing innovative or exceptional about it. It serves its purpose well enough, is fun, and offers some challenge. What makes The Banner Saga so wonderful is just about everything else about it.It's difficult to summarize all of the aspects The Banner Saga does really well. Right off the bat however, you'll probably notice both the art and audio of the game are fantastic. It's rare to find a game that creates a unique artistic vision and implements it so well, while still managing to include a great, effective soundtrack. It's probably fair to say a lot of games struggle with nailing either one of these, let alone both. But, The Banner Saga creates a beautiful, deeply atmospheric experience with its classically inspired animation visuals and moving soundtrack. Of course, this could be all for nothing if it's being used to prop-up a weak story; fortunately, it isn't.If I'm being honest, I don't think I could name another game that comes close to creating such an oppressive story and atmosphere. The pacing of The Banner Saga is excellent; there's a true feeling of dread and desperation constantly building from chapter to chapter as you try to make (what you think are) the best decisions for your caravan, while fighting through seemingly impossible odds. This is a game full of choices - who to accept into your caravan, who to help, when and where to camp, who to take with you into battle - there are many, often tough, decisions that you'll have to make. All of these decisions are presented well, and all of them have consequences, some dire. This makes each playthrough potentially unique.In The Banner Saga, the world is crashing down around you, and you're left facing insurmountable odds. It will be up to you to lead men, women, and varl. You'll make many decisions, some of which you may come to regret. The world of The Banner Saga is bleak and grim. It's hard not to look at this game with a sense of both wonder and despair, and for that it's impossible for me not to recommend it.			"

												If you like a good story, some moving moments, interesting characters and excellent strategy (much like chess), this is for you!It is not sandbox, but your choices will change the character roster and they will make a difference in several battles you'll fight. The art is... how can I put it? It's beautiful in its simplicity. Not style-beautiful, universally beautiful. Go on, take a peek. You deserve it. You owe this to yourself. Especially if you love drawing, painting and digital art.AI is nice. I'd be happy and relaxed if the story didn't put so much at stake at each battle. Man, this game kept me going, and kept me hooked!Totally recommended!P.S.: going through TBS 2 now. Where's 3, guys? C'moooon! ;)			"

												This is a great game to grab if you own a macbook pro or an air. I play it on PC too with no problems. It runs great, plays very well with other apps, slipping in and out of full screen nicely (at least on OS X Mavericks). It's also gorgeous. And hard... very hard. There are few games I've dropped back to easy mode on but I was getting so frustrated with not being able to progress in the story that I did. And it has still been challenging. Lots of branches in the story and different characters to level so the replayability looks very good. Did I mention it's gorgeous? Maybe it's because I'm a father with a daughter of my own, but I also found the storyline between Rook and Alette to be quite touching. There is little actual spoken dialogue but what there is makes me wish they had been able to do more, especially for some of the characters, not just the narrator. I think the only thing that bothers me a little sometimes is the isometric view can get a bit mucky in big fights with a lot of characters and I would love to be able to see things easier. I think that is the only gripe I can think of. I hope the people that made this game keep making more. Best money I've spent for some time.			"

												It's a gorgeous game, in every possible way.At first I was pretty skeptical, as the art style reminded me of something out of the old Rankin/Bass cartoons - but I warmed up to it really quickly when the game began. There's a really elegant way things look, move, and even sound in the game that contributes to a rock-solid 'gestalt'.The tactical elements of combat aren't crazy deep, but engaging enough to hold you in between the real highlights- the phenomenal story bits. There a lot of story and lore going in the game that doesn't come across as ham-fisted at all, and there's a distressingly real sense of permanence with each choice you come across in your journey. Wither its a short term hit or boon to your stats- or a huge branch in the story that occurs 9 hours of playing later, everything feels like part of a bigger picture.Very cool game that left me hungry for the sequel.

												Game of Thrones meets Oregon Trail. In the short amount of time it takes you to play through this game (my hours are inflated due to leaving the game on pause) you’ll grow attached to many of the characters and be crushed when they’re maimed or die. The Banner Saga’s art is very well done, it reminded me a little bit of the Asterix comics I would read as a kid, and the storyline is solid. I don’t mind the degree of randomness inherent in this game - you are after all playing as a group of refugees fleeing for survival - but the combat is a real drawback. It’s supposed to be turn-based strategy, but even after beating the game on normal I only vaguely understand how you're meant to play. Not that it seems to matter that much. The one time I lost a battle my party kept marching along regardless.The Banner Saga is definitely worth playing, just buy it on sale, it’s not quite worth the $20 asking price.			"

												I waited to review the game after completing it. I loved playing it from start to finish. In order to give you a sense of what this game is about I will use keywords that describe the game.- Tactical gameplay: Final Fantasy tactics / XCOM style (turn based moves)- Choices matter: throughout the game you need to make choices which will have consequences in situations- The game is difficult, played it on normal and found it challenging.- RPG: you level up, can gear your units (limited, but enough imo).- You can clear the campaign in estimated 15 hours (normal mode, might take longer if its difficult),- Amazing and unique art and music. Loved every second of it.- Story rich: the story is solid. Loved it and it was very interesting.- Alot of reading texts and making decisions based on themThe developers put alot of effort into the game and it is visible. From the story to the art to the music, it was all in line. The game has some minor flaws, but which game doesn't? What is important is that the game has an amazing and heartfelt story with enjoying gameplay. Funny thing is: the game was brought to live through kickstarter, which makes the entire game more amazing. If the keywords earlier spark your interest, I would suggest you buy the game. You will not regret! P.S. There will be a sequal (announced on E3)			"

												Background: It is in the realm of games like Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics.Replayability: Some story changes can allow you to bypass or experience new things but overall the game shines in its Storyline.  Low Replayability.Combat Mechanics:  Standard Grid based, range oriented, simplified stat mechanical battles. Each character has a specific set of abilities and death and failure are very easy to attain even on Easy Mode. Not much Class overlap as the cast of characters is Small but this makes them memorable as you progress through the 10-15 hour story.Social Mechanics: Social interaction plays a big part in who you recruit, battles you fight, who dies...sorry for the minor spoiler, but look you're humans running from an unstoppable horde of shadow soldiers and its dead Winter.  People are gonna die from swords and starvation.Notable Notes: Oh my gosh the Artwork in this game is RIDICULOUS. Like I got distracted by the look at feel of the paintings. Even the Combat Grid and atmosphere is just a thrill ride of pure unadulterated Artistic Expression.  It reminds me of the same feeling I had when I first picked up Okami back in the day.Final Thoughts: Those of us old guys from the 90s who have fond memories on the GameBoy Advance slugging through the massive influx of Grid based JRPGs will find a ray of light in the Banner Saga. <3 Play well my friends.

												Rating: 8/10Budget: It's a fairly short game, so get it on sale. Length: Very short I think. Replayability: Moderate to low. This game is actually incredibly good, I personally think. The combat system is nice, the travel and dialogue system is also cool. I like the ""choices=consequences"" sub-genre, and this is a shining example. Unfortunately, the game suffers from a majority of extremely annoying setbacks, such as practically no background info on the extremely weird world you play in, a tutorial that quite simply DOESN'T explain in detail how to play this game properly and finally that it sort of just ends right when it was getting exciting. It seems cheap to me, to end the game where it ends. Like they sold me half a game, and now expect me to buy the sequel. Which I probably will, so of course, there is nothing wrong with their marketing tactics... You're expected to make educated choices without having ANYTHING to base those choices on. You. first of all. do not know anything about this fantasy world, you try to plan trips but you're not really informed how many times you can expect to be able to resupply on your trips. Someone in your group of people, must necessarily have been somewhere and have a clue that a village is coming up in the next 3 days or something, right? Alas no! Everytime you come to a village, it's like it's the first time that village has ever been discovered, even though you're somehow leading the people along a road you're familiar with. To get back to what I like about the game, the consequences are severe and brutal. Very harsh. You can, like in Mass Effect 2, essentially get pretty much everyone killed. The story goes on - it just gets sadder. I really didn't like one of the main characters, so I just sort of.. Got rid of that character. My entire game experience was improved as a result. Win! All in all - This game is very good, but expect to have to do a test run of the game. Sit down, play for a full hour and call it a tutorial - Don't ever load/save. Just play. Then, restart the game now that you get it, and have SO much more fun with it, than you otherwise would.			"

												Prior to playing this, I didn't really know what to expect from ""The Banner Saga"". All I had seen was TotalBiscuit's ""WTF is..."" video and I knew it was something of a Tactical RPG... with a lot of story involved.Now, after have played the game from beginning to end, I don't regret buying it. Not a single bit. I love storydriven games and this game has got a GREAT story that keeps the player engaged in the characters and the world the game takes place in. The story is mostly told through text so it is somewhat of a visual novel at times, but that didn't bother me just because of the great... yeah, you get it.Often do you run into enemies who wants to kill you and you have to take part in turn based combat. I read that some players found the system in the game to be bad, but I found it to be pretty good and kept the tactical aspect of the game alive, it never came down to a battle being TOO easy or anything like that.The graphics are hand drawn and looks A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I LOVE IT! The soundtrack is great as well, the voice acting (the little there is) is great. Nothing to complain about here. Well... maybe we could ask for some more animations in the dialogue scenes but hey, you can't have everything, right?I've heard there will be a ""The Banner Saga 2"" this or the next year... I'm so looking forward to that and I will totally pre-order that game so I won't miss the continuation of this dramatic story. I truly do recommend it.			"

												The Banner Saga's art style is what initially drew me to the game. I loved the beautiful hand drawn backrounds and 80's cartoon style cutscenes. However few and far between they were.  The characters in The Banner Saga are also all hand drawn and look fantastic, With slight movements to give each of  them some life and characteristics. The only frustration I have with the art style would be that I wanted more. More animation. More cartoon style cut scenes,. I guess wanting more is a good thing.There is not much to say about The Banner Saga's music exept that it is incredible. A perfect soundtrack.  If you really like the music on offer the soundtrack is avaliable to purchase alongside the game.The Banner Saga's story is one of doom and glome. A dying world under siege. You will play as aViking leader in charge of a caravan. Trying to outrun or defeat the drege menace, who has begun to poor across the world (again). It will be your decisions that decide the fate of the 100's of people in you company. including main story characters who can die perminatly and will not show up in future Banner Saga games.From the first moments of the game you will notice that Banner Saga's overall story is pretty weak, The overall narative it is trying to tell is fuzzy at best. leaving to many unanswered questions and plot points that pop up out of nowhere.  That said, the game regains most of its glory in its character stories. Making you care at least a little about the people your are in charge of. Watching one of the main chracters charge head long into certain death. Axe at the ready. Was one of the best feelings I had in the game. It's  the decision making and tense moments between life and death of a chracter that will keep the story intresting.The games ifficulty settings can make The Banner Saga a brezze. Or an absolute chore. On easy difficulty the game is basicly story mode. Allowing players to march through the various battles and challanges without having many wounded characters. On Hard mode however the games difficulty ramps up so much so that the game can feel unfair at times. In my playthrough for example. I had so many playable characters, that I couldn't level them all effectivly. Leaving four or five of them far to weak to help in combat. This is a small gripe considering that you can simply prioritize a few characters, but it would have been nice to see some of the other bad♥♥♥♥♥vikings swinging thier axes in battle.That brings us to the combat . On offer here is a Tactical Turn Based system. In which the player,  alternates moving or attacking with one of thier characters, then the enemy takes a turn,. Moving and fighting this way until the battle is over.  Combat uses some unique mechanics I will not delve into here, but veterans of turn based games will pick them up quickly and new comers to tactics games will learn durning early few battles.Now Don't get me wrong combat in The Banner Saga is fun and most of the time engaging and tactical, but some of that is taken away toward the middle and end half of the game. I played The Banner Saga on hard Difficulty, and boy was it ever a challange. I lost so many seemingly unbeatable fights that I 'll admit I Iowered the difficulty a few times just so I wouldn't have to play some battle for the 30th time. This could just be my lack of game knowledge or not leveling my characters effectivly, but it was an annoyance that got old fast. I would suggest playing the game on medium difficulty. It's a nice mix of strategy and forgivness that makes you think without punishing you for minor mistakes.I  very much enjoyed my time with The Banner Saga. It's characters were odd, unique and badass. IIs world was bright, beautiful and engaging. And although the game can be frustrating at times,  I think the reason I like The Banner Saga the  most is becuase it's  somthing diffrent. And for  only 20$ The Banner Saga is a must own .			"

												Awesome game. :)I backed this, during its Kickstarter run, primarily because of the art style. I'm very, very happy with the end result. The visual style in-game is amazing. The vista while the caravan is travelling is just a treat to see, and there are so many portions which could stand alone as works of art in themselves. The character designs and combat animations are all great, IMHO. The only thing that could, perhaps, make it ""better"", would be if they had millions of dollars to spend on full animation and voiced dialogue...but from what I've seen and played through, that wouldn't really be necessary, and may even detract from the experience. It took me around 12 hours to finish. Normal Difficulty.I enjoyed the gameplay, overall, particularly the story choices (and, well, the story itself). The management of the ""resource"" you can earn and spend, Renown, keeps things interesting: do I use it to level up my characters? to buy my characters items to buff them? or do I spend it all on supplies for my caravan?Combat itself is quite well done. It seems relatively simple, at first glance, but turn order, unit placement (both during setup and combat) and target prioritization soon become quite important and can make for some very engaging and even stressful fights.The armor and strength stats mechanic is also an interesting feature: Each character has an armor and strength value, with armor reducing damage, and strength acting as both health and damage capability, with the latter decreasing as strength is damaged.Taking all that into account, along with each combatant's innate/passive ability plus their activated abilities, along with the willpower mechanic (which boosts damage, or movement, or pays for ability use)...and it may not seem so simple anymore. Which isn't a bad thing. :)The soundtrack's great. I loved Austin Wintory's work on ""Journey"" (I wish it'd get ported to PC; I'd gladly buy it a second time if it came out for PC). From the softer, somber tones of some of the caravan marching tracks, to the faster and heavy beats of the combat track...all great. I love the tracks with the strong vocals in them, and the last piece in the game was amazing (the credits song/music, too). I'd definitely recommend getting the Soundtrack.Bugs? Glitches? I had one freeze after several hours of play, but I was alt+tab'ing a lot and had stuff running in the background. I also had one combat glitch that required me to load a game, but it was a one time thing.Complaints? There's only one save ""track"". If you start a new game, it'll overwrite your previous saves. It's an autosave system that saves at key points (like entering/leaving a town, after an encounter, etc.), which may also be a problem for some. I'm fine with it being autosave-only (since it keeps every autosave point), but the lack of extra save ""tracks"" or profiles is kinda annoying, esp. since I'm now thinking of a new playthrough and, this being the 1st chapter (of an intended trilogy? still fuzzy on that. I should re-read my backer emails...), saves could carry over and other stuff like that.Volume control. There isn't one. It's either you have music/sounds on, or you have them off. There are also no subtitles. It's not really that important, as the voiceover parts are few, but it'd still be nice to have 'em.TL;DR:I loved the game. I'm looking forward to the next installment. Amazing art (waiting for my digital art book) and soundtrack (if you're going to get it: get the one w/ the Soundtrack), and engaging combat and gameplay. I'm very glad that I backed this game's Kickstarter. :)			"

												The strategic turn based combat is very reminescent of other tactics based games, but the greatness of The Banner Saga really lies in its stylized animation and storytelling. The animation in this game is absolutely beautiful, and reminds me a lot of the work of Ralph Bakshi.			"

												Both painfully short and heart-breaking, The Banner Saga is something you will come to for the story, and stay for the fun and strategic turn-based combat that takes up a good chunk of the game. I would have loved to learn about the world, but at the same time I feel like the lack of knowledge helped contribute to the overall despair of the caravan and their own lack of knowledge throughout the game. I look forward to playing the sequel when I get the chance!			"

												This game was so much fun when I played it. I actually played it twice to see some alternative choice consequences and both time I got engaged in the game so much. You  must keep in mind that this is NOT a fairy tale RPG. The advertisement slogan for the BS2 applies just as much to the first installment. You can lose heroes you got attached to not because a battle went wrong but because you made a wrong choice during the storytelling sequence. Sometimes it can get you down but all in all it’s still a great entertainment.I think adult players will have more fun with the game just because they can see the second bottom to the story and the message of the game better than younger audience. This being said I think all players that enjoy difficult (!) turn based strategies will enjoy this game.Game mechanics are fairly easy to learn and flexible enough that you can replace any fallen hero (in battle or outside of it). Thou incorporating a new class to the battlegroup might force some tactics adjustments.All in all I enjoyed this game very much. The story is sad and a bit emotionally heavy if you engage heavily into such things (as I do) but hey – it’s just like life. Not pretty all the time ;)			"

												What a pleasant surprise that was. After forcing myself to finish some AAA titles lately, just because I've already put some hours in, it was nice to get sucked into a game and dragged all the way to the finish line for a change. The presentation might be simple, but what it lacks in budget it more than makes up in style, coherence, and genuine heart. Interesting story, great combat system, and a really dense, end-of-the-world atmosphere. Must play for any fans of tactical combat, narrative-heavy games, or anyone looking for a well-made, creative title. Aside from ridiculous difficulty spike in the final battle, there's nothing here to complain about.			"

												The Banner Saga - A Viking Tale of Tragedy and Survival----PROS-----Art. The art is the most striking part of this game. It shows you the beauty of hand drawn creations coming alive in what one could only assume is a painful effort to create wonderful animations that flow well. The backdrops show you snowy mountains and barren wastelands to ravaged villages and burning cities, all colored in to show the intense to the calming.-Music. Wonderful pieces that fit each scene quite well. Loud drums and deep bellowing for combat, and soft orchestra-styled music for traveling and such.-Story. It's difficult to find a game where your choices truly make a diffrence. In the Banner Saga, you could make the choice to invite more people into your caravan only for your food to run out in a wasteland and have so many starve. Choose to have your heroes charge head first into the stony masses of your enemies and end up being dragged back on the backs of your friends wathcing the rest of the battle fail.-Characters. From the proud Varl, a group of horned giants who have no women or children to hold them back in battle to the Dredge, a mysterious horde of stone men that never cease in their equally enigmatic plight, every race, character, and hero is wonderfully written.-Troop Management. Ah, the troop management. Keeping your caravan alive in this masterpiece is... unique, for lack of a better word. Your troops have to be promoted (leveled) by killing troops, however each soldier requires renown (the game's universal currency) to level up. This means you must choose between promoting your heroes, buying life-sustaining supplies, or purchasing trinkets that could keep the battle going in your favor.-Good Combat. The combat feels like a mix between chess and final fantasy tactics advanced (thats the only ff I played). The player must use each hero's special abilities to break through an enemy's armor (a seperate health bar) to get to their strength (or health and hitting power), creating a nice style of combat that forces players to use armorbreakers alongside tank and dps units.-Length. Yeah, it's a good sized game.-Flow Between Games. Your save carries over into the next like Mass Effect. I like that alot.----CONS-----Bad Combat. Yeah, I had to split it into two groups. The combat gets unwieldy as you kill enemies. Say the enemy has 5 units and you have 5 units: each player swaps off every time they ""use"" a hero (ie moving and attacking). Now say you killed the ♥♥♥♥ out of two of their units (5 to 3): they still get to move every other turn, meaning they get more movement per hero. This could be considered good, which I can definitely see, but it causes alot of problems. I see this as a neutral, but alot of people tell me they think it corrupts the rest of their experience. I decided to put this in the cons as a warning for those who would like to avoid this. For these people, I suggest easy mode which strips the need to let your heroes heal up after battle.----Summary----This game is clearly a work of art. I have personally introduced this game to many people (some of which think video games are a nonsensical hobby) and all have said it is breath-taking. This game is beautiful in so many more ways than one. I hope you enjoy your adventures as much as I have. See you in Abberang, my viking amigos. My Final rating: 9.7/10			"

												Awesome game. :)I backed this, during its Kickstarter run, primarily because of the art style. I'm very, very happy with the end result. The visual style in-game is amazing. The vista while the caravan is travelling is just a treat to see, and there are so many portions which could stand alone as works of art in themselves. The character designs and combat animations are all great, IMHO. The only thing that could, perhaps, make it ""better"", would be if they had millions of dollars to spend on full animation and voiced dialogue...but from what I've seen and played through, that wouldn't really be necessary, and may even detract from the experience. It took me around 12 hours to finish. Normal Difficulty.I enjoyed the gameplay, overall, particularly the story choices (and, well, the story itself). The management of the ""resource"" you can earn and spend, Renown, keeps things interesting: do I use it to level up my characters? to buy my characters items to buff them? or do I spend it all on supplies for my caravan?Combat itself is quite well done.

												I backed the Kickstarter, donating twice the value of the retail game (fifty dollars), because even at that early stage it was clear that this was a game with two of the ingredients required for greatness: a story worth telling and the people capable of telling it. All they lacked were the funds to bring it into being.So, what did I get for my money? Was it worth paying double? In a word, yes. The Banner Saga is clearly influenced by Bioware's golden age of games in the social aspects with your followers (Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect), as well as the Oregon Trail, oddly enough,  but for the most part it is its own being. The art and music are achingly beautiful. The characters are written robustly, so that we get to know them slowly, over this chapter of the saga. I was actually surprised at how much I cared about them, and how much more I wanted to know. The combat, once you get the hang of it (I jumped right in since I played a lot of the multiplayer) is fun, and the addition of magic items that allow you to tweak your characters is welcome. The choices you make along the journey, whether to rout or regroup, how much food to buy, when to train your followers, have definite consequences, made all the more dear by the fact that you cannot jump back to old saves if something goes disasterously wrong.Having already finished the game on normal nut the climax on easy, I am now going to play it again, which is, you'll agree, the test of great game. I want more! The developers have created a new world of in gaming, populated with their own unique population of giants, men, and magic. I very much hope that this is the first of many chapters in the Banner Saga, and that future iterations with expand and enrich the spectacle and vibrance of the world they have created with voice actors and longer sagas.

												The Banner Saga pulls you in immediately with its perfect illustrations, then plunges you into a world of heavy responsibility and grey melancholy. But this is a good thing - it pushes the story along and keeps you wanting to make things work out for the poor Norsemen in your caravan. To top things off, The Banner Saga has one of the best strategic combat systems I've ever played with. Combat keeps you on your toes, as there is not a single round to waste. Every decision you make is crucial in this game, both in combat and out of it.The soundtrack is also riveting. It is so earthy and yet so grandiose, and to add to the Norse flavor of the game, the lyrics are in Icelandic. Buy it. It is one of the few games ever made that is a unique experience rather than just another color of the same thing that's been done a million times. It's definitely worth your money.			"

												If you are in storytelling and turn-based combat this game is just perfect for you. At the beginning I was a bit sceptical because of the few animations during conversations and the very slow soundtrack at the first hour... but later I was so much into the story and the soundtrack changed that i did not care. The art in this game is drawn with love. But the thing that impressed me most was the handling of saving in the game... you cant choose where to save or just reload the game when you made a desicion and you did not like it's outcome. You just go on with that bad feeling that you lost one of your favorite. You have to handle the results. Even if you lose a battle, the is no rewind button. You have to live with it and it's results, which infulence your caravan, your supplies and the life or death of your clanmen and heroes!The story unfolds with time and you reveal the secrets of your partymember with some time (if they survive). The story waits with some unexpected changes and outcomes.			"

												I backed this game on Kickstarter back in 2012 and it's one of the few projects I donated to that I feel lived up to my hopes. It's a beautiful game and a memorable experience, and you can easily forget what a small budget it was developed on. The combat is not what you'd get from an AAA title, but the beauty of the game's aesthetics and the experience of the story were a  truly fresh experience to me after 25 years of gaming. I especially loved the feeling of responsibility and the weight of the decisions you have to make. So many games these days play up war as a glorious and fun adventure, which is fine, but so much of what people experience in times of conflict is glossed over. The uncertainty and the dread out in full force in this game. I see some people complaining about the very limited saving system, but really I feel like you're only cheating yourself if you try to redo everything in this game to get the optimal outcomes. It's an experience, and part of that experience is spoiled if you don't feel any real danger, risk, or consequences. I recommend this game to people looking for an amazing story, beautiful aesthetics, a gripping experience, and something entirely novel. If you're only looking for combat, you probably won't appreciate it, but it's really your loss.			"

												Banner Saga...A cold wind blows across your face as you survey the battle-hardened warriors and their kin huddled around a hastily prepared bonfire. There are fewer of them now, a product of your leadership, though, you are resolute in knowing that your courage and pragmatism saved many of them. Despite the hardship you have endured, you can hear laughter and merriment in the distance, dancing and joyful music. A smile graces your chapped lips.Your daughter stands besides you, clinging to your tunic, and with a gentle word she speaks looking on with you,""I think it's time, Father.""With a bellow from your lips the camp is broken down, and once again you find yourself on the road headed toward adventure, your banner, telling the story of your people all the way back to the beginning, flapping defiantly in the wind. This is your time. Banner Saga is a game about the burden of leadership in the face of adversity. The tale is told from many points of view and unlike other games, I have yet to find a game over screen. Your choices are permanent & resounding. Failure sticks and has consequences. If you're familiar with X-Com, this is Ironman. If you're interested in a great norse inspired story of men, beasts, and giants, in a time where the gods are thought dead, then this is the game for you. You won't be disappointed.			"

												I just completed the game and I have to say, that it was a beautiful experience.The plus points of this game:- Rich and Vibrant 2D graphic-novel style artwork.- Haunting and Melodic Musical Soundtrack.- Well-written dialogue with pretty well rounded characters.- Combat reminiscent of old-school games like Vandal Hearts (set number of unique characters instead of armies).However there were a few things that I did not enjoy, so please take these into account (these are just more wordy... not that I think the bad outweighs the good!):- Very Short Game; I have no idea why the game ended where it did. The Store doesn't say it's an episodic game or anything like that, so I've no clue why through the story you're characters are talking about doing something... then the game ends before that even happens. I'd like to think either DLC or a second chapter will be coming at some point.- Heraldry; on the game menu there's an option to choose your banner, but it doesn't really go into detail. I see that it's for the multiplayer called ""Factions"" but I see no way to access that through the game menus. Has to be installed seperately.- Difficulty; not too easy, not too hard. Until the final fight, where it's like ""Well I'm putting this on easy, hell with that..."". Aside from that, perfect difficulty until the end (so this is a mixed point), may even try it on hard.So to sum up... play it. I don't know why you're still reading this. Go on, hit play!			"

												From what I have played of The Banner Saga it is truly fantastic the fact that King.com have filed a lawsuit to patent the word saga is truly disgusting. If that lawsuit was to stop this game from getting a sequel, ♥♥♥♥s me off to very high lengths for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ candy crush saga game. The game is exquisite to look at the game's animation is just fantastic it looks like something straight out of a painting. The gameplay is turn based combat and it has a few mechanics to it that make you have to plan your moves and pick your enemies carefully as defeat can happen incredibly quickly. There are also choices you make throughout the game game and don't think you can decide you want to be a hero or villain as there tends not to be a fine line for each you have to decide for yourself what you want whatever that makes you. I'm 4 hours or so into this game and I can see myself playing a lot more, please support Stoic by getting this and if you do play Candy Crush just remember that the company behind them is trying to patent the word saga, how ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous is that.

												Oh God, this game is so cool.First of all: the battles are just awesome and the battle system is pretty cleverly designed.The story is not bad at all, it mostly feeds a big hunger for the next episode but you really find yourself being depressed for losing some members of your crew.The artworks are beautiful even if i would have liked to have some actually animated cutscenes in certain parts of the story.I don't think i have many bad comments to share. All the other users' complains about the lack of supplies are nonsense: you're conducting a pilgrimage across a desolated land chased by monsters. You're SUPPOSED to be hungry.Really, this game is awesome. Kinda replayable but a few more hours of gameplay wouldn't have hurted.p.s. SCREW KING			"

												This game was amazing for me, quite clearly something that needs to be in line with your personal tastes, but for what I wanted out of the game my only real complaint is like anything good I want even more. With a sequel on the way I'll get my  wish eventually though.This game is pretty story driven, it would have made a fantastic free roam rogue-like (or rogue-lite, honestly the original term has expanded it's scope just like rpg has over the years, get over it) but I'll take a story driven game when the story at least for me was this good. I've seen some criticism about the choices you make not mattering. I can't say for certain yet, I've just now played through once on hard forbidding myself from reloading to change my choices. As such I can't comment on how much the choices actually mattered HOWEVER, the 'illusion' of choice presented here at least made it feel like so much could have gone differently, my bad choices seemed to kind of snowball on me towards the end ramping up the difficulty quite a bit. It made me ache for the version of this game that could have been like FTL but better.Bottom line:+The art is great, I absolutely love games that go so far to present a unique visual style such as this.+The combat seems super simple at first, but has surprising depth, appealing to the part of me that grew up playing final fantasy tactics. (No real character customization with classes or anything like that though.)+The oregon trail inspired travel from place to place is not only so much better and more immersive than how similar games simply move your little dot along the lines on a map, it lends itself toward making the world and the things in it feel massive. You will probably feel tiny by the end of this.+The story struck a chord with me at least, I got very attached to some of the characters and seemingly through my own mistakes lost a few of them. I found myself spending time reading about the locations I might be headed to on the map when I got the chance. I feel it was very good.-They use the same character shots on different backgrounds while flashing between them during dialogue portions of the game. It oddly works pretty well and isn't too jarring, but full animation or cutscenes would have been very welcome. I fully understand why they couldn't or didn't, but I kinda wanted to see the character's body language a bit, and see some of the scenes described actually shown.-I almost would rather they released a series of expansions to the game rather than a sequel. It really feels like even more could be done with what's here.			"

												I havn't played much of the game but I felt that there are two areas that I can discuss with authority.  The first is that the graphics are impressive and stand out amongst the derivitave art style of other games. The combat is interesting and fun, though it is difficult when playing on the harder difficulty level. Staying alive becomes a real task. I have also enjoyed the dialogue so far. If any of these things change 'pon further play then I will revise my review. As it stands, the game is a joy to play and look at.			"

												Both painfully short and heart-breaking, The Banner Saga is something you will come to for the story, and stay for the fun and strategic turn-based combat that takes up a good chunk of the game. I would have loved to learn about the world, but at the same time I feel like the lack of knowledge helped contribute to the overall despair of the caravan and their own lack of knowledge throughout the game. I look forward to playing the sequel when I get the chance!			"

												The Banner Saga pulls you in immediately with its perfect illustrations, then plunges you into a world of heavy responsibility and grey melancholy. But this is a good thing - it pushes the story along and keeps you wanting to make things work out for the poor Norsemen in your caravan. To top things off, The Banner Saga has one of the best strategic combat systems I've ever played with. Combat keeps you on your toes, as there is not a single round to waste. Every decision you make is crucial in this game, both in combat and out of it.The soundtrack is also riveting. It is so earthy and yet so grandiose, and to add to the Norse flavor of the game, the lyrics are in Icelandic. Buy it. It is one of the few games ever made that is a unique experience rather than just another color of the same thing that's been done a million times. It's definitely worth your money.			"

												If you are in storytelling and turn-based combat this game is just perfect for you. At the beginning I was a bit sceptical because of the few animations during conversations and the very slow soundtrack at the first hour... but later I was so much into the story and the soundtrack changed that i did not care. The art in this game is drawn with love. But the thing that impressed me most was the handling of saving in the game... you cant choose where to save or just reload the game when you made a desicion and you did not like it's outcome. You just go on with that bad feeling that you lost one of your favorite. You have to handle the results. Even if you lose a battle, the is no rewind button. You have to live with it and it's results, which infulence your caravan, your supplies and the life or death of your clanmen and heroes!The story unfolds with time and you reveal the secrets of your partymember with some time (if they survive). The story waits with some unexpected changes and outcomes.			"

												Only about 7 hours in, but I jokingly call this game ""The Boner Saga"" for a reason...IT IS AMAZING. The artwork in the game is absolutely perfect. I fell in love with Final Fantasy Tactics way back on PSOne and have since had a tender spot for turn-based strategy games. I still have more to play but I feel safe to say that 10 years from now, I'll still speak fondly of the Banner Saga. I absolutely love the combat and the Oregan Trail-like travel is surprisingly appealing. I really like how the dialogue options actually have real consequences on the game and characters. The game is top notch from top to bottom and I'm not even going to add a ""if there is one thing I could change"" comment because I wouldn't change a thing. I hope this team continues to make games like this and they should feel proud because I have a feeling they've churned out a masterpiece here. Bravo and thanks for making it. I paid money for this game but still feel like it's a privilage to play it. I'm gonna stop now because this review is starting to feel like masturbation. If you're a strategy fan, play this or get down on your knees and reach for the shorter katana...			"

												For ya'll tearing your hair out on the final boss. The instructions are not clear. Also the silver arrow is not in the attack menu but in the specials menu. I think there needs to be a clear line of sight to the boss (because he needs to kill the archer). The armour must be 0 or 1.Good game. Negatives, there are no way to view hidden tiles. If the game had a camera rotate option, it would help a lot. If enemies are behind your units, it's incredibly difficult to see them, the damage they'd take when you do fire on them, and their armour and health is often obscured from view. I can't emphasise how frustrating this is at times.			"

This game succeeds as an experience greater than the sum of its parts.The combat is fun, but there's better. The caravan Oregan-trail gameplay is enjoyable, but there's better. What makes The Banner Saga worth playing is that everything works together to create an immersive experience, more like binge-watching a TV show than working through a strategy game. Sure, the game's linear, but it allows them to make a tighter narrative experience.Impressive things to look out for:- Outstanding artwork- Outstanding narrative- Expansive soundtrack- Beautiful combat animations- Wonderfully characterized worldNot so impressive things you'll encounter:- Underdeveloped RPG elements- Underdeveloped caravan gameplay- Absence of voice acting, even for important parts- Main villain missing some pizazz. He looks like a boss creep from Warcraft III.I have not played the second one yet, but I'd recommend starting with this one, as so much of the world is established. Can't wait to get the next one!

												This is without a doubt the best game I have played in some time. Equal parts chose your own adventure, tactical combat and Oregon Trail it is very much it's own game. The art style I found amazing. Think western animation before it was influenced by Japan with Vikings and you are close. It was beautiful and cohesive in all parts of the game and this is a rare thing to find. I played the game on normal and it has been some time since a game on normal challenged me. This one did and it was that much more rewarding when I finished it. I will be playing this again more times to explore other choices and I am looking forward to the next parts they will be releasing.The game drops you in the middle of a story but that did not bother me and by the end I was very much invested in it. Looking forward to more! (Edit- Picked up the 2nd one)			"

												Banner Saga is basically a mix of Oregon Trail, Final Fantasy Tactics, with a game of thrones story line thrown in the mix and this is what you get.  That was basically the first impression I got.   I would recommend the game, I DID love it, but there are alot of things I would change about it.The pros+ The artwork is beautiful, it's what attracted me to the game in the first place+ The combat system is really well done I really like the little additions and exertion stats that add more depth to the combat+ The dark and gritty atmosphere of the story really makes you feel like you're struggling to survive, you have to decide whether to buy supplies, items, or upgrade your chars.  It really does feel like the world is coming to an end.+  Getting attached to the characters - a little too attachedThe cons-  The choices during the events, Alot of the times I feel like they are ALL bad choices and there are no good choices.  I feel that the game should motivate the player to pick between several good choices (or some bad choices).  I feel like my choices are just minimizing how much i suffer in the game, which isn't really that fun.  I know it's a end of the world thing but..-  The choices are fast and permanent.  At least give us a LITTLE warning if someone is going to leave the party if we make this choice.  If I say ""Hey you can go help them if you want"".  And the guy should say ""If you let me to go, then I go for GOOD""  THEN I know he's going to leave permanently.  At least give me a final option of having him come back.  It shouldn't be one click and then I lose a character I leveled up so hard permanently.   Don't just kill off my characters without giving me a chance to keep them alive.  If I get someone killed, i want it to be by my choice that I know it happened because I put the work into leveling that char because i wanted to KEEP THEM.-  There's alot of reading and not alot of cutscenes so most of the story is told through you reading it like it is a book.  While I don't mind because I read really fast, I don't know if I could recommend a game like this to my friends. "

												It's Oregon Trail + Final Fantasy Tactics lite. The combat seems pretty simple on the surface, but they way they use Armor and Strength is neat. A unit's Strength is effectively their HP, and the damage a unit can do is Strength - Armor.  If a unit's Strength < opponent's Armor, they have a (Armor - Strength)*10% chance to miss completely.  If you ignore armor and go for strength attacks, you run the risk of missing with your weaker characters, but if you only focus on armor, they can do more damage to you on their turn.Between fights, you're on an oregon trail style adventure after the invasion of your village by Dredge, a race of heavily armored people from the north. They're the main antagonists of the game, forcing the main characters to flee from city to city looking for refuge. The number of supplies you have determine how many days you can travel before your clansmen and warriors begin to die. In addition, the longer you travel, the worse your clan's morale gets, meaning you have to balance supplies with camping and resting. Various dialog and story events play a part in the number of clansmen you lose or gain if they decide to join your caravan.The story mainly revolves around a hunter named Rook, who falls into the leadership role in a caravan of refugees. You and the other characters are attempting to find refuge between two separate apocalyptic events and a horde of invading warriors. Similar to Game of Thrones, the story is barely ever not dark, but it fits the tone of the world. You're not on a quest to save the planet, you're just trying to get your people to safety.Only downside is that it lacks closure on some of the bigger story elements. Looking forward to the sequel.

												I never leave game reviews but thought of leaving one since I bought this game on a whim after a Steam sale. This is a gem of a game that combines a story guided by your decisions with turn-based strategical combat (think XCOM/Advance Wars/Fire Emblem/etc.) The story-telling is awesome, with good animations and voice acting making the world pretty immervise. It's relatively short (~10 hours of gameplay) but has good replayability since you can choose other actions in a second play-through.

												"" Brotherhood of the Bannermen""+ Unique and beautiful hand drawn style art+ Decent story+ Story driven decisions adds a touch of anxiety and urgency in a good way+ Vikings Rule- Stale combat- More battle mechanicsThe Banner Saga was a joy to play and experience all together. The beautiful hand drawn art style really gives this game its luster. The story works and helps bring the player much closer to the characters involved and the decisions you make throughout the game can bring forth a sense of engagement. The battle mechanics could use a bit more vareity but it is understandable for the devs to seek a more simple approach. Prolong battles do suffer from a lack of immersion.All in all, the Banner Saga is a game that deserves a place in your library.4/5			"

												Skilful blend of Northern Mythology and Game of Throne vibe.Reminded me the good old time turn by turn games with quite a modern twist to it.Soundtrack is really good, choices you make do in fact influence the whole story and there's some real challenge in normal and hard difficulties.Oh and beware when you start liking/disliking some of the characters : they might die, if not worse than that.Seriously, if it's on sale, or not, buy it :](One of the) best indie game I've played, looking forward the next episode.Because seriously, I need answers.

												Good Story and the world is beautiful. The game mechanics are really frustrating however. The idea to have health and strengh be the same is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid as it makes pretty much every person who takes damage at any point utterly useless. XP only counts towards kills which means that all the hits your tank has been taking amount to nothing if someone else gets the kill, meaning as time goes on your strongest guys will just get stronger and your weaker guys will become obsolete.

I think spent more time thinking about what couldve happened than i spent on making the decisions that led to the bad outcomes.Overall, probably one of the best games ive ever played,with a story comparable to Telltale's Walking Dead.

												Highly recommended! This game has amazing artwork, an immersive soundtrack and terric story. The atmospheric quality sets it apart from so many games. When I just saw the artwork, it immediately reminded me of the old '70's cartoon adaptations of ""The Hobbit"" and ""Lord of the Rings"". Albeit, the Banner Saga art is much more polished and beautiful.I've seen some reviewers complain, saying ""boring"". I think rgis criticism is more about a gamer mismatched with this game. Banner Saga isn't for everyone. It uses tactical, turn-based combat with specialized units. It's very reminiscent of ""Gladius"" from the old X-Box. If first-person shooters and fast action is your preferred style, go for it. I enjory a mindless shoot 'em up from time to time. I just respectfully disagree that Banner Saga is in any way boring. The combat is thoughtful, and with the right difficulty adjustments, pretty challenging. But it's the story that drives this game! No spoilers here.My one criticism - I cried out with frustration when I reached the end of the game. There is still so much of the tale to be told. I was left wanting a sequel (or two) immediately.

												The gods are dead, the sun stood still and the world, inhabited by humans and giants, is on the brink of destruction - these are the first words of the Banner Saga introduction. The game was created by Stoic Studio, was founded by people from the famous BioWare Studio, gave the world such great role-playing games like Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect and Dragon Age.World of Banner Saga is gloomy, harsh and designed to the last detail. Inspired by Scandinavian mythology and stories about the vikings. Before the player unfolds a fascinating story, will be given the opportunity to observe developments from the point of view of several different main characters. Hunter Rook with his daughter Alette are saved from their village, which was attacked by dredges, dark warriors, whose armies are threatening to destroy all life in this world. Giant Hakon leads an army together with the human prince Ludin to help Grofheim, besieged the capital of the Kingdom.Banner Saga is role-playing game (RPG) with turn-based battles. During the 8-9 hours of the game player will have to make the hard decisions and none of the proposed options will be not definitely good, you always have to face the consequences of your decisions. The player will lead to the final goal not only the main characters, the number of which is constantly changing - someone will come, someone will leave, and someone will die. Also player will be responsible for the people, who walking in the caravan with him: refugees fleeing from dredges, who destroyed their home. Especially I want to tell about plot and dialogues. All dialogues in the game are presented in the form of large amounts of text. The text is extremely high quality, it is like you situate in an interactive book where you decide what and how will happen next.Music plays a huge role in creating the atmosphere of the approaching end of the world. Scandinavian themes  plays on the background of colorful snowy scenery and it is just incredible. Under calm music caravan covers the distance from one village to another, under the anxious music soldiers and giants go to the last battle against horrible dredges to protect their families. Under such musical compositions I would like to sincerely empathize with the characters.For this game I would waste my free day, wrapped in a blanket with a cup of warm cocoa. The music and visual style of  Banner Saga make the game like complete artwork, which I will replay several times, to get new impressions.10 brave vikings out of 10. Excellent.			"

												The Banner Saga... Where to begin? I've made many choices,lived and survived to regret it...yet....it had to be done... The game has such a great story and great atmosphere. Decisions you make in the game are crucial and may haunt you or bite you in the back later. I was playing the good guy.... Accepted or helped as many people as I could along the way. I let people join my caravan, assisted those who stayed behind. Until.... Someone turned traitor after a long while. Perhaps it was due to the low morale from our dwindling food supplies... or was it my leadership? I was accused of letting anybody from the road join the caravan. There was mistrust and there was alot of squabbling amongst the clansmen.My logic was this: The common enemy was the dredge. No point fighting amongst ourselves.And that was how i rolled throughout the whole game. Pretty much like Game of Throne's Nights Watch style. I'd willingly accept anyone whose willing to join and help those that decide to stay, despite their lost cause. I've made a few good friends that way, lost a few too.The ending...I think I made the right choice. Though sad, but I felt that whatever that had happened, the great journey, was all just to get that 1 character to the end. Bittersweet indeed.TLDR:  I felt like Ned Stark in Game of Thrones. Sometimes the best decisions aren't always the morally righteous ones. The game really shines in this part as well. The fighting is similar to XCOM styled games....its decent. You really have to decide your hero placements tactically and their moves too. One wrong move could cost the whole battle.			"

												Breathtakingly gorgeous game. The art is wonderful to look at and vibrantly colourful, allowing characters to stand out against the often snowy backdrops.The story and soundtrack are both exceptional, and do an amazing job of drawing the player into the frigid environments of the game, and the desperate struggle for survival. The world map contains a great amount of lore on every location, even those which are nowhere near the events of the game. This makes the world feel like it has history, helping fit the game's narrative into a larger tapestry. Characters are well-written, but could have used even more dialogue to flesh them out even further. Combat is tense, and the battle system has a few unique quirks. First, strength is based on a unit's health. Second, turn order alternates between allied and enemy units in a set order. The combat classes are well-balanced and there are interesting synergies when using special skills in tandem. Battles are tense, especially when outnumbered and surrounded. Units level up based on how many kills they get, which can cause a snowball effect and leave many of your units underleveled. Out of combat, there is light resource management in the form of supplies for your caravan. There are also many decisions to be made, some more difficult than others. Also, your party members can die permanently based on your decisions in these events. On one hand, this feels a bit cheap, since these deaths are unpreventable. On the other hand, this ensures that decisions feel weighty and meaningful, and does not allow choices to be made without care.Unit upgrades and purchasing supplies and items are handled with the same currency: ""renown"". This is earned by killing enemies, winning battles, and sometimes through other choices. This resource can get very tight, leading to even more tough decisions. Overall, an outstanding game that I would recommend to anyone who likes strategy.			"

												The Banner Saga is an adventure game featuring basic RPG elements and a Norse/Viking theme, where the player leads a caravan of civilians and warriors across a wilderness while trying to escape constant attacks by a race of metallic creatures called Dredge.There's an enjoyable turn based combat system that has some tactical depth. Battles take place on a square grid, and the player has a party of up to 6 warriors. You'll often start the fight outnumbered, but the movement order is similar to chess where the player moves one unit, then the AI moves one unit, and so on, which means having less units isn't necessarily a disadvantage.Each warrior has two main characteristics - strength and armour. Strength represents both the amount of damage inflicted by a successful attack, and the health of the warrior. When strength reaches zero the warrior is knocked out of the fight, but it also means a warrior who is close to death will do less damage. Armour indicates how difficult it is to successfully damage a unit's strength - if their armour is higher than your strength, you probably won't hit, so sometimes you need to weaken the enemy's armour first before you can actually hurt them.Positioning is also important. Varl (giants) take up 4 grid spaces instead of 1 and can easily block the movement of both friendly and enemy warriors. Archers have weaker armour so its a good idea to keep them behind melee units. My one complaint about the combat is the lack of variety. Pretty much every unit for both your side and the Dredge, is either melee or archer. There's hardly any offensive magic, and no healing, so most fights play out the same way from a tactical point of view.Outside of combat you'll have choices to make when certain events happen. Most choices have consequences, which could be good or bad. For example you might encounter another group of people on the road who want to join you, and you can accept or refuse. If you accept, you might gain warriors, or they might steal some of your food. If you refuse, they might leave peacefully or they might just attack you.The story is okay. It starts slow but gets better after a couple of hours. I never really cared about any of the Varl characters, their personalities didn't develop beyond ""I'm a warrior and want to kill stuff"", but I did like the main two Humans, Rook and Alette. Their father/daughter relationship at least gave me a reason to care about keeping them alive.However, the game loses points for presentation. There are lots of nicely animated cutscenes of people walking in a straight line through the snow, but unfortunately as soon as any action happens, its either described by a wall of text, or through dialogue scenes between motionless character portraits - the majority of which has no voice acting.Overall The Banner Saga is a decent game, but I wouldn't class it as a ""must play"". If you enjoy turn based combat it should entertain you for the 10 hours needed to finish the campaign, but you might want to wait for a sale.			"

												This is a game that actively makes wants the player to believe that it is a dynamic story where your conversation choices (and oh are there so many of them.) matter. This game hinges on this, with passable and often ill defined combat mechanics, yet has unchangeable plot points. There's one junction in the game where no matter what you say, you do the same thing. It's blatantly to move the story and hinges on this stupid idea that someone's CONTROLLING YOUR THOUGHTS (Cue conspiracy theorist's music.) and forcing you to do this. This is compounded by the fact that the point at which this happens, you're thrust into a situation where you can't better your position. You're stuck with wounded party members and with low morale. You are not allowed to change this, even though the game has previously always allowed you to do what you want. It seems as though this game was rushed towards the end. There even begin to appear characters who are identical, but wear different coloured tunics. All of this would be acceptable if they didn't force you into fights you can't possibly win without either re-loading an earlier save (and I don't mean 5 minutes before the problem, I mean two to three hours.) or lowering the difficulty. A beautiful game with a nice combat system and, for the most part a brilliant story, is ruined by a forced plot progression that seems neither reasonable nor feasible.			"

												What a wonderful game!The beautiful music and art style aid in telling The Banner Saga's fantastic story. Tough decisions are frequent and have significant consequences on the course of the game. I would definitely recommend it to any turn-based strategy fans.Some considerations:-There is minimal voice acting - most of the story is told in text. This sounds much worse than it actually is though - the story remains very gripping!-The gameplay has its flaws, and can get repetitive. The hard difficulty offers a great challenge!-The story is rather short and with a disappointing ending, though easily replayable. Thankfully the story will be continued in Banner Saga 2, with multiple characters reappearing. The sequel will allow the importing of save states giving even greater importance to the decisions you made throughout.Experience: 9/10, Gameplay: 8/10			"

												As many have already mentioned: Utterly fantastic art, especially in landscapes. Beautiful, high-res, hand-drawn. It's just gorgeous to look at. The in-game map is beautiful, too. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the soundtrack here, which is excellent and fits the world and the story incredibly well. The lore is pretty deep. A lot of work went into the world-building, and it shows.As far as tactical gameplay, health and strength occupying the same function is brilliant, and the way armor and strength affect damage dealt is ingenious. Willpower and exertion are further interwoven, creating depth. It's fantastic and it works to provide the best tactical aspect of the game.However, combat design overall often feels a too raw and underdeveloped at higher levels. For example, why can't I check out my characters' stats while deciding who to use for the battle? Isn't that sort of important? Why isn't there a range attribute? Am I just missing it? I understand that shieldbangers move more slowly and have less range than other units due to their heft, but it'd be awfully handy if I could tell just how far they'd be able to move when placing them. Same with enemy units. There's just too much missing here. The basic premise involving strength, armor, exertion, and willpower is solid and incredibly innovative to the genre, but some major fleshing out needs to happen in order to get me more invested into the tactical combat being presented here. I often feel like I'm floundering, like I don't I have enough information to even begin to approach a battle tactically. It takes me out of the experience and I just tend to float through battles rather than plan and execute an actual strategy. And that's a very, very bad thing for a tactical RPG.I also question the system of having each side alternating moves, rather than assigning characters a speed attribute and having that govern when turns are taken and by whom. There's a huge missed opportunity here that would greatly affect the Man vs. Varl unit selection and it would help to balance the two units. Instead it seems they tried to balance them by making the Varl bigger and less maneuverable, but I don't think this works nearly as well. I ended up selecting mostly Varl units in each battle simply because they were the hardiest and I often didn't feel the desire to try and play tactically. Just roll the Varl out there with an archer or two and have them smash heads while the archers wear away the opposing units armor. A speed attribute would have added a great deal of depth: Do you opt for speed and maneuverability and quickly bring the fight to the opponent? Or do you go with a solid front line, advance slowly, and wear the enemy down while tanking through whatever damage they deliver? It would have added a ton of tactical depth that this game is missing.The interface has some issues. You'd better be 100% on-point with your mouse clicks, otherwise you'll have to try and figure out where you went wrong, select the same unit again, and start from scratch with whatever you were trying to get him to do. It's way too easy to click the wrong thing, and just not intuitive enough to prevent regular frustration from occuring when you're trying to get your units to do what you want. There are similar issues with selecting units and placing them prior to a battle. This is a minor gripe, but by the end of the game it was incredibly frustrating to miss a click on a willpower star by a fraction of an inch, and have to select the character and tell him what I wanted him to do from scratch.Though the art is very well-done, I felt some of the character designs were too generic and too difficult to tell from one-another. There are a few Varl units who are basically just palette swaps from one another with very minor differences in facial features. Due to this, and not being able to view any details about a unit prior to selecting them in battle, I had a lot of trouble keeping the characters straight and often made mistakes during deployment that could have easily been avoided had I been allowed to view more details about which units I was actually selecting for battle. I mean, it doesn't even tell you which class a unit is on the pre-battle screen -- Just their name, level, and a picture of their face. No class, no stats, nothing. Weak characterization makes the problem even worse. I often confused Griss and Bersi, and by Chapter 5 I had no idea which one was which and often made mistakes in deploying them. I found it hard to get invested in any of the characters. None of them show any depth, and the only one written with any panache at all was Ludin. Poor dialogue exacerbates the characterization issues. Decisions are too frequently unclear about what you're actually selecting. I don't mind having things blow up in my face, but I need to be adequately informed on what it is I'm choosing to do. For example, you arrive at a fortress and enter, only to have enemies immediately attack it. You are given a choice as to whether to rest in the fortress, or immediately attack and attempt to break out. This choice is followed by another, in which you choose the actual tactics of your breakout. So you've got two choices to make at the same time, but you have to choose whether or not to rest before you're able to see what your options will be during the actual attack. Jeez, this is getting complicated... Still with me? Basically, you're forced to make an initial choice (whether or not to rest first) without adequate information to make the decision. If I had known that I'd have liked to charge the enemy and attempt to eradicate them all, I'd definitely have rested first. If I was going to try and distract them and get away, I'd have chosen to attack immediately to prevent more from arriving. The character I'm playing would have had all of this knowledge in his mind while making the initial decision as to whether or not to rest -- Why don't I? This kind of thing is present too frequently, and it leads to way too much frustration. It cheapens the decisions you're making.Losing characters to decisions made through the game, rather than in battle, is something that keeps the intensity up, but overall I don't think it works nearly as well as Fire Emblems system of permadeath within combat. It puts too much of the onus on the story sequences and takes away from the importance of the battles. If you're in this for the story, that's fine, but it lessens the importance of the tactical game and makes it too easy simply to trudge through battles without really caring what happens. Halfway through the game I began to just autopilot my way through battles. I lost my sense of investment in my units and my tactics and started to get bored of the entire actual game. I bought this for the tactical gameplay, not the story, and so I came away very disappointed.Summary: The landscapes are beautifully rendered, the lore is surprisingly well-written, and though the characters are pretty weak, the story is engaging. Unfortunately, the tactical combat as a whole leaves a lot to be desired. It's solidly constructed at its base and its key gimmick (strength and health occupying the same stat, and weaving armor into the mix) is incredibly innovative, but too often I felt there wasn't enough detail or I didn't have enough key information to dig in and play tactically, which lead to me becoming utterly disinterested in the actual tactical gameplay about halfway through. I ended up switching it down to easy and blasted through the game just to see the story.If you're looking for an engaging story framed in a beautifully constructed world, then you'll probably enjoy your time with The Banner Saga. As a tactical RPG, though, it's seriously flawed. The systems in place are intriguing but ultimately too raw and undeveloped for me to really endorse. So as a longtime fan of the genre, it's hard for me to recommend this game.			"

												It is amazing what story you can tell in such a relativly small production.This game takes you on a real adventure, which lets you experience so much and lets you feel various emotions from anger and sadness to joy and a feeling of success. All incited through a gripping main story, which unfolds beatifully, and the small decisions you can make along the your adventure. They really have an impact, at least it gives you the feeling they have. To be honest I have not expected this gmae to be this good. Things get really grim when you run out of supplies and oyur fighters start dying, your numbers dwindle and the enemy is at your heels. Very intense and well done!The setting is so cool, I would like to know more about the lands, vikins, varls and dredge and also what nordic mythology was frame for them, havent found much yet though.Game mechanics are also very exciting. It takes some time to figure out how the battle system works but it is very well thought through and one really needs some good tactics to prevail. Battles can be hard but they are also very rewarding.The only that comes to mind when thinking about problems, is that departing characters take the items you gave them with them. Thats a bit frustrating because some items are pretty expensive.All in all this game is easily a 10/10 points due to it being so surprisingly good!			"

												STOP! Yeah, for those of you like me that go straight to the negative reviews, I would like to state something very important.THIS GAME IS THE FIRST PART OF A TRILOGYThat's why you may read in some of the reviews that ""the end boss has nothing to do with it"" or ""the story is meant to be epic but it doesn't deliver"". Those reviewers didn't know (because the game was not properly labeled - looking at you Stoic) that this is Banner Saga 1, and Banner Saga 2 is coming in 2015. Believe me, play this, enjoy, focus yourself on the story, imagine this as a very cool sort of Bernard Cornwell Saxon Chronics book in wich you get to PLAY the battles and act as the main character, then you will finish the game, replay some different choices to see how they affect the game, then you gonna be like RELEASE THE NEXT ONE ALREADY!Thanks.

												There's absolutely no certainty to be had in The Banner Saga; there's exactly no right choices that lead to a happy ending, and this runs throughout every decision and choice you make in your journey. Every time you're called on choosing how much food to purchase, which path to travel, when to fight and when to flee -- it's haunting. The game does away with manual saves, check-pointing your journeys at set points so, if a wrong decision is made, you need to reload a file sometimes several hours back. But you will. I went right back to the start; I thought I could save them all. I couldn't.Full review - http://www.honestgamers.com/12181/pc/the-banner-saga/review.html "

												As many have already mentioned: Utterly fantastic art, especially in landscapes. Beautiful, high-res, hand-drawn. It's just gorgeous to look at. The in-game map is beautiful, too. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the soundtrack here, which is excellent and fits the world and the story incredibly well. The lore is pretty deep. A lot of work went into the world-building, and it shows.As far as tactical gameplay, health and strength occupying the same function is brilliant, and the way armor and strength affect damage dealt is ingenious. Willpower and exertion are further interwoven, creating depth. It's fantastic and it works to provide the best tactical aspect of the game.However, combat design overall often feels a too raw and underdeveloped at higher levels. For example, why can't I check out my characters' stats while deciding who to use for the battle? Isn't that sort of important? Why isn't there a range attribute? Am I just missing it? I understand that shieldbangers move more slowly and have less range than other units due to their heft, but it'd be awfully handy if I could tell just how far they'd be able to move when placing them. Same with enemy units. There's just too much missing here. The basic premise involving strength, armor, exertion, and willpower is solid and incredibly innovative to the genre, but some major fleshing out needs to happen in order to get me more invested into the tactical combat being presented here. I often feel like I'm floundering, like I don't I have enough information to even begin to approach a battle tactically. It takes me out of the experience and I just tend to float through battles rather than plan and execute an actual strategy. And that's a very, very bad thing for a tactical RPG.I also question the system of having each side alternating moves, rather than assigning characters a speed attribute and having that govern when turns are taken and by whom. There's a huge missed opportunity here that would greatly affect the Man vs. Varl unit selection and it would help to balance the two units. Instead it seems they tried to balance them by making the Varl bigger and less maneuverable, but I don't think this works nearly as well. I ended up selecting mostly Varl units in each battle simply because they were the hardiest and I often didn't feel the desire to try and play tactically. Just roll the Varl out there with an archer or two and have them smash heads while the archers wear away the opposing units armor. A speed attribute would have added a great deal of depth: Do you opt for speed and maneuverability and quickly bring the fight to the opponent? Or do you go with a solid front line, advance slowly, and wear the enemy down while tanking through whatever damage they deliver? It would have added a ton of tactical depth that this game is missing.The interface has some issues. You'd better be 100% on-point with your mouse clicks, otherwise you'll have to try and figure out where you went wrong, select the same unit again, and start from scratch with whatever you were trying to get him to do. It's way too easy to click the wrong thing, and just not intuitive enough to prevent regular frustration from occuring when you're trying to get your units to do what you want. There are similar issues with selecting units and placing them prior to a battle. This is a minor gripe, but by the end of the game it was incredibly frustrating to miss a click on a willpower star by a fraction of an inch, and have to select the character and tell him what I wanted him to do from scratch.Though the art is very well-done, I felt some of the character designs were too generic and too difficult to tell from one-another. There are a few Varl units who are basically just palette swaps from one another with very minor differences in facial features. Due to this, and not being able to view any details about a unit prior to selecting them in battle, I had a lot of trouble keeping the characters straight and often made mistakes during deployment that could have easily been avoided had I been allowed to view more details about which units I was actually selecting for battle. I mean, it doesn't even tell you which class a unit is on the pre-battle screen -- Just their name, level, and a picture of their face. No class, no stats, nothing. Weak characterization makes the problem even worse. I often confused Griss and Bersi, and by Chapter 5 I had no idea which one was which and often made mistakes in deploying them. I found it hard to get invested in any of the characters. None of them show any depth, and the only one written with any panache at all was Ludin. Poor dialogue exacerbates the characterization issues. Decisions are too frequently unclear about what you're actually selecting. I don't mind having things blow up in my face, but I need to be adequately informed on what it is I'm choosing to do. For example, you arrive at a fortress and enter, only to have enemies immediately attack it. You are given a choice as to whether to rest in the fortress, or immediately attack and attempt to break out. This choice is followed by another, in which you choose the actual tactics of your breakout. So you've got two choices to make at the same time, but you have to choose whether or not to rest before you're able to see what your options will be during the actual attack. Jeez, this is getting complicated... Still with me? Basically, you're forced to make an initial choice (whether or not to rest first) without adequate information to make the decision. If I had known that I'd have liked to charge the enemy and attempt to eradicate them all, I'd definitely have rested first.

												If you love Strategy RPG games like Final Fantasy Tactics you will enjoy this game. The music and artwork are phenomenal. The Mythos is inspired by Norse mythology and Viking Culture. In the beginning, some of the fights will be quite difficult. Later on, units will increase in HP/Armor slightly and it will be the numbers which can overwhelm you. Unit position is key and it can mean the difference between victory or a party wipe.I highly recommend this game.			"

												This game was a huge letdown. The combat is bizarre because a single enemy and a single member of your team will alternate. This means that when the enemy has lower numbers, they get more turns. It lets them get in and beat on your weaker people several times and you may not even have a chance to react. Since losing a character in combat means that you have to rest and that he or she will be weaker in additional fights, it is sort of annoying when there are two enemies left and they both get to move over and over again to take out your weakened guys.The maps are all flat. There is no terrain at all.Between battles, there are story portions that play out like a really well illustrated choose your own adventure book. A situation will arise, you choose between two or three options, and then you get a result. There is no indication whatsoever of how the choice might play out, so you might as well just pick the choices at random. There is one currency in the game and you have to spend it to level guys up. Of course, you never know when one of these random story instances is going to kill someone that you spent that currency on.It's really not a good game. If you buy it, buy it for the art, which is quite good.			"

												Oh the hype train for this game. I put off buying the Banner Saga for a while due to some sceptical comments i read about the game. I had heard it was fairly lengthy and the story was relatively good so in the end that was enough for me. The positives really are in the way this game looks its very much like playing an old disney fantasy esc film. Its stricking in its colour scheme, that much is sure however during ""cutscenes""  if you can call the coversations of text, cutscenes the still characters portraits dont respond physically to anything going on around them and this can create a disconnect between their expressions and whats actually happening.  The game is broken up into three parts the camping which is where the covos/levelling take place, the trekking, which is basically just you watching your little ant party move left or right.  And the combat which is about deciding whether to damage health or armour. Attacking armour first means more damage can be inflicted to the health while attacking health first will mean the enemy wont do as much damage with less health. Simple.Turn based strategy how i love it! most of the time. This game quickly becomes dull, the enemies are the mostly the same and the action doesn’t leave much to the strategic eye compared with say, X-com or Civ. You will quickly find the best strategy and the many unused characters in your party will soon become useless because why would you use anyone thats woefully underleveled and under powered. While there’s something relaxing about the trek across the frozen tundra there is also a tedium to it. Sure random events pop up but they do little to effect the course of the game. Alot of big decisions are actually arbitrary and change little in the narrative. This game feels less like an RPG and more like a adventure game with RPG elements tacked on.Final thoughts, I don’t get the hype I really don’t this is an average game it really is, to me at least. The lore in the background of the story seems awesome , the map is huge! But neither are utilised to there potential, you just get carried through the story down a linear path and don’t really influence it in any great way. The art is lovely but beyond that what is there here to become engrossed in? By the end I really couldn’t be bothered It took me 7 hours and it was a slog for the last 3 the combat just didn’t go anywhere beyond its simple mechanics. The story was interesting to begin with but soon became flat at the half way point, no questions I had were answered, and at times it became rather predictable ( think game of thrones). When I have to force myself to finish something I cant recommend it, its as simple as that.			"

Every time i had to make a decision i took like 5 minutes, because i felt that every decision was really decisive in the end and in some way it is!.Since the start i felt a really deep connection with each character, regreting some decisions that i make down the road. The music also suits the game ambient pretty well, i enjoyed this game so much and i hope that everyone that reads this review does the same, this is a really awesome an emotional ride for everyone that enjoys really good turn based games with a good story and a vast variety of characters to choose from.

												The game has wonderful artwork and music, a decent premise for its plot and the combat is passable for a turn-based game. However, the story is presented almost entirely through text and the dialog is often flat. You also spend maybe half of the game just watching a rolling background. Furthermore, some of the choices you make in the game have random outcomes; practically none of them are predictable. So it makes for a frustrating experience when you repeatedly draw a bad hand.I really hope Stoic's next effort is improved. Voiced dialog would have done much for the game, as well as abbreviated travel and more focus on stories as they occur in the villages and cities. I realize constantly being on the run was supposed to be a part of the plot, but Stoic needed to show more compelling ineractions between the members of the caravan to support that. I'm of the opinion they should have just faded to black, otherwise. Because I'm really not that interested in coming across random bandits that have no impact on the major story arc. Filler is not the way to go.			"

												Note that I only put an hour and a half into this game....An hour and a half into the game, I got through 3 or so battles, so, I could tell that this is trying to be a story based game. However, the problem comes in their presentation. There is no voice over, so you are reading everything and almost all the text is dialogue. So, you don't get much of a sense of the world or the characters while going through the story. The visuals during the dialogue will just show one or two characters on the screen. This creates the problem where you don't really know who is talking, or if you are talking, or who you are supposed to be right now (since you play as many different characters).What I am trying to get to... is an hour and a half into a game, most of trying to develope the story, left me uninterested in any of the characters and uninterested with the combat. It feels like it has potential to get better, but it falls short at the start of the game.			"

												A few words/short novel on the Banner Saga, one of my favourite games of the year, now that it's on sale.Bought it on sale and heard some good things about it, but definitely liked it more than I expected to.The game plays in turnbased combat system and conversations and cutscenes and it's a slow game. Not slow in a bad way (for me, anyway), as you sit and for small portion of the game just sit and watch as your group travels slowly through the snow while you listen to the music and admire the landscape.The game is set in a Viking-setting, though in a different world where the gods are dead and the sun is stuck in the sky. In the game you play named commanders of one-two caravans, travelling in snowy landscapes to lead your people to safety from war as they are attacked by a race called the Grudge. Your caravan will be affected by supplies(starvation and morale that you must take into consideration while playing.The combat is turnbased and your characters can choose to hit the strength/hp or the armour of targets,each class/characters has a special ability and otherwise have standard melee and/or ranged attacks. The ""currency"" Willpower is used to make characters move further/hit harder and is gained through levelling up characters and defeating enemies in combat. Now the progress. The game only saves in the beginning of chapters and then has fixed savepoints in the chapters so if you fcked somethig up, you might have to reload from a good while back. Importantly; some characters die because of your choices in text events. In my first playthrough I let things happen as they did and personally enjoyed being responsible and having a few ""war sucks"" moments and having to make tough/wrong choices and getting a more personal feeling of the game.The currency Reknown is used to level up characters and buy items and supplies. It is gained through winning combat. It's hard to juggle the spending on all those things, so I ended up buying exactly no items, few supplies and spending it all on levelling. (Adding gold (or something) as an additional currency to use on buying things and adding it to loot and lowering the reknown gains from battle would be nice, please).Difficulty; it's possible (at least on easy mode) to leave your entire caravan to die (your fighters will not) to starvation and poor morale. In the higher difficulties the morale will count towards your fighters strenght and hp in battle. The game is however deep you want it to be; the map (thought sadly useless) is incredibly detailed with the entire map having names and stories for every forest/lake/mountain. You can also choose to talk to characters and how thorough you want to do the conversations. Therefore it's possible to rush the game or go fully into the story. A normal playthrough is 10 hours, all conversations included. I played through the game twice, once for making my own personal choices and story and once for more achievements.Buy for the story and for the atmosphere. Don't expect explosions and action all game as it definitely has its slower times. If you want a game with depth and a good feeling to it and can handle the slower bits; definitely buy. The games leaves you with that sad-good-feeling you'd get from surviving a war and having gone through some sht, but also been through an adventure.Tip; always click the flag sin the corner when combat starts as it will show you the hp/armour of enemies at all times and not just on hover-over.Extra points to Nordic players as the language used at some points gives a few chuckles.

												I'll start off by getting the obvious out of the way: this game is lovely. The art style and animations were very enjoyable for me. You can pan around in combat, with the isometric view, and there will be little tree limbs and stuff close to the screen, which are blurred since they're supposed to be out of focus. Yes, technically, there is no floating person or camera in the sky, but it wasn't invasive or distracting, and was a nice touch. So yeah, graphically, kudos to the development team, and I cannot complain at all here.The music seemed nice while I listened to it. Eventually I stopped listening, but that was more a case of the rest of the game leaving me too disinterested or annoyed to care that much about anything else in the game.The gameplay consists of reading dialog, watching people walk in one direction without input from the player, moving slowly, until something happens, making random decisions that impact you sometimes without any way to know or have a fair guess at the outcome or what's the ""safe"" option, etc. It's like FTL in that respect, except that in FTL, here's typically a no-risk option that's very obvious. The combat is strange. Your damage decreases every time you take health damage. Is it realistic? Sure. Realism does not automatically mean it's good, though. If my HP drops to 1, I want it to be intense, with me expecting myself to die but still thinking I could win. However, in this game, you're already guaranteed to lose, so continuing to play through the fight is just a waste of time, because your chances of survival dwindle more by the turn, and it's less interesting every turn because it's not a fair fight with a sight disadvantage any more, but rather, a curb-stomping of your party.Also, if a character dies in a battle, the character is straight up dead. It did not give me the ability to revive, and it was not a scripted death. I looked online and sometimes there are scripted deaths, apparently, but this was not supposed to happen at this time. Oh! And the game had just leveled that character up for me and gave me a big wink and a nudge that I ought to spend my points I'd earned on that character. So in a challenging game with random stuff that can negatively impact you out of battle in an instant, and they're adding character death in a game that's longer than a couple of hours, in which a full roster of characters in battle is kinda important to have.I found nothing I liked, whatsoever, about the gameplay in The Banner Saga. Not one thing. If I hadn't played Shadowrun: Dragonfall, I may have simply thought that I hated the entire genre of squad turn-based strategy gams, but that's not true. I loved Shadowrun: Dragonfall, and despite me being awful at it, I persevered and the combat was very intuitive with a lot of nice strategies involved. In The Banner Saga, however, the dwindling damage every time each party member is hit, the single action per turn when not moving, the inability to hit enemies with a bow and arrow unless you are within walking distance of the enemy so the enemy still hits me, thus negating the intention of ranged weapons vs melee enemies. I even had one time I had two archers who were together, and the system wouldn't let me fire at an enemy because the other archer was in front of me. Realistic? Yeah, but throw me a dang bone! The gameplay simply annoyed me from start to finish, in all ways.I can't remember the story, and I played for several hours today. I like Game of Thrones, so it's not like political medieval/fantasy stuff doesn't appeal to me, and like I said, the art during the story was great. That said, although a great story and make a game with ""meh"" gameplay pretty cool, this game's story just didn't stimulate me enough to get interested in it or want to keep playing the game. This could have been a cool 1980s-style animated film with focus solely on plot and real events, rather than random text events and interruptions of poor combat. Since I didn't care about the story, I can find screenshots and trailers online to showcase the art style and music of the game in a bite-sized and sufficient pakage, and the game was not fun for me to play, there is absolutely no reason for me to continue playing this game, and I cannot in good faith recommend it.

												A great game where your choices matter and have disturbingly huge impact at times. The replay-value is really high because of the choices, which makes up for the games length, which is around 10h on normal difficulty. The story is not something outstandingly uniqute, but it's well executed and the characters are quite likeable (or unlikeable), which is a definite plus.The combat can be frustratingly hard at times, although once you get used it, it gets a lot easer and more strategic. Still, the abilities could've been fleshed out a little more. Nonetheless, the combat is challenging and fun.I played through the game 3x times now, and there are still some things I want to try out.Go buy it, especially now that it's on sale!			"

												My first experience watching my caravan slowly move accross the screen in The Banner Saga:Wow, this game is so gorgeous. I can't believe it's hand-drawn. And I  NEED this soundtrack.*watches for a minute, then clicks the mouse to skip the travelling animation**waits, watching the caravan**clicks furiously, trying to skip the caravan**Gives up and allows the slow, tiny figures lull me into existential despair* Basically, this game would be a thumbs up if it were a time-killing $5 cellphone game. As it is, the battles are fun if you like strategy RPGs, but they are few and far between, so you never have enough Renown, which you need to level up and buy supplies and items. The story and characters are not at all compelling. You're constantly having to make some low-stakes choose-your-own-adventure decision. I think you're supposed to try and save the refugees travelling with me, but I was happy when they starved--fewer mouths to feed.  Plus, this game is really short with very little actual gameplay. Don't pay $20 for this. "

												Good:1. Art style2. Story is pretty interesting3. Core concept is refreshing and intriguingBad:1. Game ruined by dumb choice system. Most of dilemmas are extremely vague and outcome is impossible to predict, Which leave you totally out of control. The most of the ""choices"" you are asked to do looks like this:    ""You have some free time at your hands, what should you do:          - Take a stroll to the forest          - Sleep          - Help around caravan""     Hmm, dunno lets help?     ""You tried to help farmers to milk cows, unfortunately you scare poor cattle off and they run away stomping your fighters""    -50 supply; -50 fighters, one of your best heroes is dead, haha.The game is forcing you to play Russian roulette and one random choice will cost you a good party member (and resources you spent on him will be lost forever). It has nothing to do with harsh challenges or survivor simulation, its plainly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.And of course there are no saves (only auto save), no fun allowed. I am totally ok to lose heroes or resources if it was my fault as player - bad decision making or whatever but this is just frustrating. 2. The game has no text backtracking or some sort of journal to keep all names and lore peace together. And overall introduction to the world is done badly.3. Caravan management is part of the game but you have no tools to predict how much food you need  and how long it will take to travel to the next city.4. Combat is a bit repetitive and has few major flaws in mechanic.5. No real freedom, the only things you can do is to save few your party members that's all. Game is story line driven.While I was not severely disappointing with this game I can't recommend it, especially if you don't like rogue-like games.But with good walk-trough in hands could be fine.

												I have to painfully give this game a No. The art style is nice, and the thematics of the game as a result are cool...but that ends any pros.This game is tedious to a large degree. There is little to no strategy in the fights, and even less balancing. Its short as far as playthroughs go, but even then it DRAGS out those hours to a painful degree.The story, seems interesting at first...but thats it. There is no real story played out, no real answers provided, not even any world building or minor lore. You are thrown into this, and given so much flavor text to maps and items...but no real connection or detail to them. Why should i care about a forest with a cool name on a map...when the game never visits it, nor mentions it. The story places you in a world with pretty details from a distance, but no substance when you examine it. Perhaps it is a manner to focus on the ""characters"", hence multiple POVs being used back and forth...but the characters are barely developed, and nothing more than colorful art pieces. The whole gameplay feels mostly like it revolved around the artist wanting to show how beautiful he could make the world, and thus you are forced into Scenery Porn the game for 10-12 hours.This game is full of promise and too many good intentions. So many interesting mechanics, ideas and thoughts...that it just falls squarely flat on its face. Many systems seem pointless, others seem broken, and some just poorly thought out. I really wanted to like this game, and the numerous positive reviews seem to have glossed over so many of its flaws that i felt i needed to be a voice on the other side of this. So you can make your own decision. Dont blindly go into this off the glowing reviews alone, think about what you expected from this game and plan accordingly.Chances are, it will not live up to much of what you want from it, unless what you want is some pretty art to look at.I sincerely hope the second game improves on EVERY aspect of the game here, as it has a interesting foundation and one hopes that could lead to a good game(eventually).

												How this game ever received such positive reviews is utterly beyond me. I really really wanted to like this game but was doomed to disappointment. After 12 hours of gameplay I decided this game deserved no more of my time. PROs:- The artwork is wonderful.- Music matches the atmophere.- It's nice that they tried something new (a viking saga intead of traditional orcs & elves).- The combat can be somewhat addictive if you're a person who gets addicted easily.And thats about it. We can next move to how this game tries to destroy everything that makes a game enjoyable:CONs:- The actual storyline is pretty generic. - The game is as linear as a railroad.- Characters have no depth or personality whatsoever. Dialogue with them is limited to few sentences. You really have no reason to care about who lives and who dies.- You're constantly lacking renown (a resource used for basically everything in the game) which makes you unable to level your characters even though they have enough kills to do so.- You're constantly lacking renown to buy any items (which you really can't get by looting either because you only receive items rarely or after extra-prolonged battles)- You're constantly lacking renown to buy supplies to your caravan which leads to them starving to death.- But your caravan starving has absolutely no importance whatsoever.- You can't make any significant decisions. The only somewhat meaningful results your decisions have is some of your characters dying but since they have no personality to begin with it doesn't really matter either way.- Every character has basically one active and one passive skill that get a little bit stronger with leveling up. No skill tree or any actual character developement.- 4 or 5 different types of enemies and repetitive combat.I'd give this game 5/10. If you've got way too much time in your hands feel free to use it on Banner Saga. If you're like me and don't have the luxury of hours and hours of free time each day play something worthwhile instead.			"

												The Banner Saga is a turn-based...fantasy battle game? I'm not sure how exactly I'd label it. But the art is beautiful. Do you remember Dragon's Lair? One of the video games animated by Don Bluth? Or how about some of the movies he did: The Secret of NIMH, An American Tail, The Land Before Time, All Dogs Go to Heaven, Anastasia? This game's art reminds me of him and his work. And I mean the entire game looks like this, not just title cards or animations. It's amazing that they even made the battle sprites look like this.As a whole, the game is a bit of a weird Oregon Trail meets high fantasy, with trying to keep your caravan alive between plot points. There are events along the way that you have to make choices on, either to you benefit or your detriment. I thought these were randomized but it turns out they're not so I'm a little disappointed in that regard.On the battle side of things, I don't think The Banner Saga will win awards for innovation. However, it's simple and it works. I only wish there were some way to train characters since the number of battles you have in a game seems to be capped at a certain number. By this I mean battles only arise out of event opportunities, so there isn't any real way to grind and whatnot to reach higher levels. Regardless, I think characters are hard capped at level 5 anyway.The story seems interesting and I am looking forward to what's in store for the future.			"

												The Banner Saga is a really really enjoyable Game.You´re in charge of managing a Caravan of Refugees in a World where the gods are dead and hope is hard to be found.While trying to survive you are constantly faced with choices of which neither seem to be a ""right"" or ""good"" one, and the story develops depending on how you choose.Speaking of the Story, it is well told and keeps you engaged until the end, but I don´t want to spoil anything more than I already have, it is an experience you have to make for yourself.On your travels you often have to fight, which is presented in an turn based RTS Manner. It reminded me of the ""Fire Emblem"" Series on the first glance, but it actually works quite different, but after some getting used to I found myself enjoying the Combat.Overall I highly recommend this game to everyone that enjoys good Stories in Games and/or likes Turnbased Strategy games.

												Great game indeed, very immersive and the artworks are very pleasant.As the leader of  your people, you will have to take many (difficult) decisions throughout the course of the story: some of them might lead to the death of your brothers in arms, or you might lose some precious supplies and starve to death.The only thing I don't like about TBS is the longevity...if feels like the story had soooo much more to tell, but...that's it, credits...the end...This is also a problem if you like to develop your pary members and try some different tactics, because there's simply not enough time to do so...Either way, this is not that bad because the game definitely deserves a couple of runs.

												Tactical RPGs are some of my favorite games and this one did not disappoint. It had some unique battle mechanics such as the ability to break the opponent's armor, and the unit's strength serving as both HP and damage (so units who are hurt will deal less damage). Also turns always alternate between you and the enemy even if you have more troops than him and visa versa. This called for some unconventional strategies such as leaving certain opponents crippled rather than dead.There is an economic element to the game where you have to spend renown (experience) to develop your characters, buy stats-increasing items and buy supplies for your caravan. Balancing between those three actions was quite challenging and interesting to do.The story is reminiscent of the old Viking sagas (even the word Saga comes from the old Viking heroic tales) with tales of great heroism among a bleak and severe environment. It's you and your small party against an unforgiving world and bad things happen to you. Yet, there is great beauty and nobility in the actions of the characters who remain hopeful and honorable despite great adversity.The graphics are gorgeous and the soundtrack complements the feel of the game quite nicely.Overall this is a very solid, entertaining and engaging title. Looking forward to part 2!			"

Posted: May 11, 2015
												First take notice of the amount of hours I have played. Realize that some portion of those hours actually was from me banging my head on the keyboad trying to beat the last boss battle during my first playthrough, which was on the hard difficult setting where I limped my way to the ending in the final chapter due to a few ""bad"" choices along with a flawed supplies mechanic that is still manageable for the most part. The battle was so difficult that subsequently in an update through various aspects the bellower was nerfed a bit primarily on lower than hard difficulty, but also characters brought into the final boss battle are no longer injured beforehand. Given this realize that I definitely am aware about the flaws of this game and that this review is based on the updated version having done multiple playthroughs. In short here are the positivies and negatives about the game:Positives: 1. In many ways an ehanced Oregon trail type of game. 2. Interesting world environment, plot, characters, and ambiance from music selection3. Combat can be challenging and fun (look up combat gameplay before hand though as this opinion could vary)Negatives: 1. Poor resource mechanic where renown earned from choices and battle is used for both upgrading characters and purchasing supplies to prevent starvation (managable largely except special care should be taken in chapter 2 to avoid buying supplies as much as possible until chapter 4.)2. Oversights such as supplies in Frostvier during chapter 4 automatically being about 3 days worth regardless of what supplies were in chapter 2. Also renown spent and items can be wasted if characters die or leave... you can load though.3. Hard difficulty is unforgiving especially given negative # 1 and certain poor choices so avoid until after first normal playthrough (trust me). Normal difficulty should still be fine for most people and easy should be... well easy.4. This one is not that negative, but can be annoying. You can not save manually it saves automatically over time. There are plenty of places to load though, which I know from... first hand experience.False Top Review Complaints: 1. Choices don't matter/impact the game. 2. The story goes nowhere1. Your choices have a direct consequence on the size of your forces, the difficulty of combat, certain limited character dialogue, what events occur, and whether characters live or die. Obviously as in any RPG choices only matter as much as you asign them. If you don't care about your caravan or the characters in your party then of course they don't matter, but to claim they don't impact the game (or in a way you would like) is ridiculous. There is a difference between choices impacting the game and not being satisfied with what one expects or wants out of a choice's impact. I would agree choice impact regarding camp dialogue is limited and not as deveoped as I like, but it's not game breaking.2. This first banner saga game is soley about surviving the dredge threat. The varl perspective portion of the playthrough, which involves completing a certain objective despite the dredge threat is actually no different. If you make certain dialogue options you realize your actions are actually helping/attempting to end dredge threat albiet indirectly. To complain that the game is about running from the dredge then making a final stand is similar to complaining that the reapers were not eliminated as a threat in Mass Effect 1 or that Oregon trail is about surviving until reaching a certain city. The first game of any trilogy is about setting up the environment and getting gamers to know and bond with characters and the story. It is about concluding a portion of the story, while leaving enough open for there to be more. The bellower isn't some random boss. It is some sort of champion of the dredge that is primarliy a large part of how the dredge are able to win against (almost) any threat. I really don't want to spoil certain story elements about the dredge or the reasons behind what is going on. Just know that there is a lot more than get to point a and fight some boss.    Recommendation: Buy this game at a price you find acceptable. If you are used to paying $60 for a game then the $20 price should be fine. For everyone else used to steam prices I am sure this game will be on sale at some point as it was in the past especially during steam summer sale. If the price is $10 anyone should buy it, while $15 or $20 is probably more for RPG fans looking for a good story, with some mechanical game flaws as mentioned, that will only be even better in the sequel.

												This game is a remarkable creation. If any of you has played Icewind Dale when it came out: it evokes the same cold, hostile, stoic world, with giants, heroes and indomitable foes. I remember playing Icewind Dale as a kid, in wonder and I am thankful for The Banner Saga and its mythos. It portrays a rich new world beautifully. Can't wait for the next one.			"

												The Banner Saga has a tedious, crappy combat system that counterintuitively punishes you for killing enemies, incredibly scarce currency that makes it hard to level your units adequately while never telling you how many supplies you'll need for your current journey and a King of Dragon Pass style CYOA, which doesn't really work because you can lose the few units you've actually managed to upgrade out of the blue. I wish this game was better than it is.			"

												Music is really good, art and story is nice. But.. that's pretty much it. The gameplay is repetitive, combat is simple and not very interesting. Dialogue options mostly don't matter, and there's no way to predict what any of them will do, anyway. You kind of hope something like asking more information doesn't flat out kill one of your heroes.I'd kind of want to see the storyline to the end, but the game itself is so bad that's not really an option. This would've been way better as an animation, graphic novel or.. anything.			"

												Amazing, how simple graphics and a simple interface coupled with an interesting story and straight forward but still challenging strategical combat system can surprise you and create such a beautiful game. I had been reminded of some of the animated movies seen,  what seems now so long ago. The graphical concept and musical score go well together too. The combat is turn by turn basis with enough options to chose from to either achieve great victory or royally mess up. The storyline gives you some options and playground which do have an effect on how the story progesses.This is one of the few games that I don't regret buying. I loved it, recommend it and hope to have a lot of more fun with.			"

												The Banner Saga is a turn-based...fantasy battle game? I'm not sure how exactly I'd label it. But the art is beautiful. Do you remember Dragon's Lair? One of the video games animated by Don Bluth? Or how about some of the movies he did: The Secret of NIMH, An American Tail, The Land Before Time, All Dogs Go to Heaven, Anastasia? This game's art reminds me of him and his work. And I mean the entire game looks like this, not just title cards or animations. It's amazing that they even made the battle sprites look like this.As a whole, the game is a bit of a weird Oregon Trail meets high fantasy, with trying to keep your caravan alive between plot points. There are events along the way that you have to make choices on, either to you benefit or your detriment. I thought these were randomized but it turns out they're not so I'm a little disappointed in that regard.On the battle side of things, I don't think The Banner Saga will win awards for innovation. However, it's simple and it works. I only wish there were some way to train characters since the number of battles you have in a game seems to be capped at a certain number. By this I mean battles only arise out of event opportunities, so there isn't any real way to grind and whatnot to reach higher levels. Regardless, I think characters are hard capped at level 5 anyway.The story seems interesting and I am looking forward to what's in store for the future.			"

												Spoilers!!!!I just finished the game, and it blew me away. I haven't looked around online so I don't know if the game always ends the way it ended for me, or if other choices will have a more positive ending but let me tell you what I loved - The story and the characters tore me up. I cried multiple times while playing and in the ending  [Redacted for the review, don't want to spoil it] and then cried as the game ended. In a beautiful way though, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The sorrow of the story, a world that (may) be dying. A race that may be going extinct, the struggle to survive, I loved it.It played like an old choose your own adventure, or maybe one of those old text based exploring games (Zork?) but I was completely gripped. The music and the artwork were beautiful, the combat fun to play, the game was amazing.I love it and want to show it to all of my friends. Thanks for such a wonderful game. I'm still blown away.			"

												Utterly fantastic. Somewhat like X-Com: Enemy Unknown, it's a challenging strategy game that derives its difficulty from lean resources and hard hitting enemies instead of requiring the player to memorize fifteen billion different unit types, build orders and button shortcuts. Thumbs down for bloated design. Unlike X-Com though, all of your units are proper character who are part of the story, instead of some dude you just sort of name and color; here's hoping X-Com 2 steals that aspect.The art speaks for itself, the music is from Austin Wintory (the ""Journey"" guy), and the narrative expertly balances lore building and character attachment. My only real problem with the game is that they make the design mistake of having the last battle split into two easy and really hard phases, with the big dramatic finale in between them *without a checkpoint*, so when you have to try that last bit again a few times, the impact of the big finale is really lessened through repetition.Despite that, this is one my favorite games. A must for those of you like me wondering why on earth Square Enix hasn't gotten their heads out of their asses and made a proper Final Fantasy Tactics 2 already. But hey, now it doesn't matter, because this is better than that game probably would have been anyway.			"

It has some other strange combat mechanics like your best fighter who is not damaged does 1HP. There is no penalty for letting your caravan people starve and die off.

												Definitely worth a play, if you enjoy tactical RPG style games.The travelling part of the game is sort of like a choose your own adventure book, where your dialogue choices all have unique consequences and outcomes. That part of the game is uniquely interesting.The combat is above average difficulty. Some of your characters will die. It's a lot of fun to try out fifferent strategies, and find the playstyle that works for you.The character customization is very limited, but you do have a choice in how your party progresses in levels. There are basic stat distributions, and you have to really monitor your resources if you want your party to funcition optimally.Short and sweet version of the review; if you don't like tactical RPGs, then it's not for you. If you enjoy a compelling story and some solid tactical elements, then try it out.			"

												Yet another game that has been sitting in my Steam library for a while, and coming off the tactics/strategy of XCOM, I thought now would be a great time to dive in. It's always said when people talk about this game, but it bears repeating that the artistic design of this game is just superb. The OST by Austin Wintory is just absolutely fantastic, and definitely among some of his best work that I've heard. The visual style is truly gorgeous, particularly the caravan scenes which do such a superb job conveying the sense of scale of the journey. The setting itself is pretty darn great, as many games do a ""post-apocalyptic"" or ""end of the world"" setting, but very few manage to convey the sense of finality and hopelessness that The Banner Saga manages to. Even the way the game presents choices for you to make as you lead your caravan was pretty well done. The kudos aside, I did have some gripes about the gameplay. I understood what the game was trying to do with battle spacing, armor/strength gauges and the back-and-forth turn system it used, but I don't know that it ever really succeeded. Overall though, it's an experience worth having, especially if you love Norse themes as much as I do.			"

												On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give this game a 6. Would be 8 or 9 if not for all the bugs.Pros: Unique visual style, cool animations. Tactical combat is fun and challenging. Compelling story with interesting characters. Price is reasonable.Cons: Very short; you can finish in a few hours. Lots of minor but annoying bugs. One almost game-breaking bug in the final boss fight. The game has been patched many times since release and the bugs have not been fixed. This is unfinished software, so if you buy it you are paying for the privilege of being a Beta tester.Nevertheless, the game is good fun, so I am recomending it... barely. Just be aware of both the Pros and the Cons. Make an informed choice.			"

												One of the most engrossing Tac/Strat Rpg's ever!  Think Orgeon Trail meets XCOM (or FF tactics) The Banner Saga features an interesting new twist on Tac/Strat, with tough decision making and unique army/resource management.  You never know when something around the corner will challenge your ragtag party of warriors and misfits.  The story takes many twists and turns, characters die, and heroes will fall.  Careful planning is required before each challenging battle.  The AI is smart, and will challenge you.  Troop manamgement is fun and balanced, and each upgrade feels important into keeping your band of heroes alive.  A stunning and gorgeous score from Austin Wintory (Journey, Monaco) accompanies your excellent and challenging adventure throughout this Norse inspired story.  The art direction is abosultey fantastic; a heavy fantasy feel is combined with a unqiue storybook vibe along with Disney style animation.  The Banner Saga is truly engrossing.  Hours fly by as you try and last one more day on the road, battles keep you on your toes and the story is very well told and features tough decision after tough decision.  I can't recommend it enough!			"

												The Banner Saga combines a rich and original mythology with an immersive soundtrack and some stunningly animated vistas to create an engaging and heartfelt story of travel across a vast and desolate landscape. The Banner Saga throw mny decisions your way and it s hard to gauge what effect they will have, it can cost the lives of key characters or prove to crush the morale of the people that follow you. The writers have done a wonderful job of ensuring that you care enough about the long-list of characters that you will labour and sweat on key decisions. It is all backed up by a servicable, if not overly complex turn-based combat sytem that throw plenty of different unit types, with different abilities at you that will enable you to face combat situations in whichever way you feel comfortable. I'm looking forward to seeing what they do next with the sequal.			"

												Easily one of the best RPGs I've played in a very long time. This game is actually somewhat reminiscent of that epic and groundbreaking game Oregon Trail on MS DOS, which alone is worth the experience. It also clearly draws inspiration from heavily story driven tactics games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Vandal Hearts. The faux-Nordic world and history is actually pretty consistent with the story of Ragnarok, while keeping things fresh and unpredictable. Even if you hope to see something more genuine in Nordic mythology, you will not in the least be disappointed. If anything, this world is totally align with yet another re-imagining of the Poetic Edda. I would expect nothing less from former BioWare developers. Congratulations, and keep this series going!

												The story is really thrilling, I read a LOT and i play a lot of video games which include rpgs amongst other genres and i really feel this is a compelling story if it wasnt you can bet your ♥♥♥ i would skip through it! The combat is tough because if a guy goes down then he is out for a few days and days cost resources which are finite until you can buy more WHICH you want to avoid buying any in the first place because renown is used for much more precious things like artifacts and of course upgrades which i am sure are going to become expensive as you rank up. Again about the combat another thing is that there is some serious stratagy going on here with pre battle placement, consideration of battle order on your side of things and of course how you want to approach each enemy, do i want to get that armor or hp down? the combat is great and engagageing and i love it and i am often aproaching it like a game of chess. Ive only played about 2-3 hours now but so far i am in love with the game and look forward to spending FAR more time with it.			"

												Great story, great art, great combat. Banner Saga succeeds in delivering an immersive experience, by tying every element of the game into the story. YOu are constantly taking part in the outcome of the story, in a variety of ways, and all of them allow you take your own approach. The many choices, each often leading to a series of other choices each with long-standing repurcussions throughout the game, are interesting and often difficult to choose between. There are no ""do the right thing/do the wrong thing"" decisions to make. Each choice is justified in its own way and you must choose based on how you think a hero or leader should behave; compassionate, cutthroat, logical, sympathetic, analytic, or anything inbetween. Even the combat sequences tie heavily into the story, as each battle may be approached differently, producing different outcomes, and even the way you finish a battle may result in a special event. You can develop each character in a variety of ways, and you must build an efficient and cohesive team in order to get through each treacherous battle. As you jump between different parts of the story, you get a chance to fight with several different teams, each with different styles of fighters that you must quickly learn to use or else suffer immense losses. Banner Saga is a compelling game, showing you that war is exciting and yet miserable, and that while you may be an excellent fighter, you can't always save everyone. There is no perfect ending, no way to complete the story unscathed, you must mitigate your losses and make tough decisions for the betterment of the entire planet. You must engage in difficult battles, using a vast array of unique characters that you must keep alive by rationing your scarce resources carefully. While Banner Saga may sound like more of a chore than an exciting game, its steady pacing and enthralling story will make it very difficult to put down, while its gorgeous art will keep your eyes glued to the screen. I reccomend this to anyone interested in (semi) realistic high-fantasy, challening RTS games, or just a great story. The Difficulty is changeable at any moment throughout the game, so this is accessible for players of all skill levels			"

A Paladin’s Steam Review: The Banner Saga. Great Visuals Crippled By A Poor Combat System.Genre: Tactical RPG Turn Based Grid Combat & Survival Game.Developed & Published by: Stoic & Versus EvilPlatform: Windows, Mac and Linux.Business Model: Single PurchaseCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]PreambleThese are my thoughts of The Banner Saga after four hours of play. If that amount of time is unacceptable to you, I suggest that you quit reading this review. So, why am I doing the Banner Saga after such a short amount of play? Well, I’ve had a lot of time to think on it. To analyze why this game failed to pull me with its story, mechanics and overall presentation. It’s pretty rare that I’ll keep thinking about a game I quit early on for as long as I have. So when that happens, I write a review. So, let’s dig into The Banner Saga and talk about the issues I had with it.Overall Gameplay ThoughtsThe Banner Saga is a combination of turn-based grid combat and Oregon Trail mechanics tied into a narratively driven campaign. This campaign follows the journey of two clans as they struggle against an unrelenting foe called the Dredge. The player is tasked with keeping these clans alive as best they can, manage their limited resources and survive. The game is split into three phases: conversing, traveling and combat. Conversations happen when the caravan has stopped at a town or some other special event happens. The player reads the lines and decides what to do next. The conversation system is ok. You do get up to four options to how you respond to decisions or particular situations and sometimes that fourth option isn’t always being silent. When traveling, your caravan in the center of the screen travels slowly to their destination consuming the supplies it has. There’s also a morale indicator to show whether everyone is in high spirits or not. This is affected by your decisions and how you fare in battle. Though I never found out if having low morale was bad but I’m assuming it is. The combat has two phases. The war phase that’s only triggered when fighting large amounts of Dredge and let’s you decide whether to be aggressive, retreat or something in-between. It’s very simple and is pretty much decided by numbers and how you fare in the turn based area. Otherwise, it’s the turn based combat that you’ll spend most of your time. It's held on large grids where your heroes battle it out against often outnumbering foes. There’s a bunch of stats that affect each hero and how they’ll perform but explaining them seems a little pointless when the game tells you straight out. I have a lot of issues with how the combat system in this game works so let’s examine it for a bit.Turn-Based Combat ExaminationThere’s a lot about the combat system that I do not understand from a design point. I don’t understand why there’s both a health and armor system for all characters. I don’t get why health is tied to power. Why are most of the enemies ranged while most of your heroes are melee? Why do they get so many turns to hit you while you get very few yourself? Why do those same archers have armor as well? Why on earth do AOE attacks also hurt your own guys if they’re in range? I had a lot of these questions while I was playing TBS and I’m pretty sure I forgot some of them. This game seems to be encouraging you to level all of your heroes but then it limits them with both a point system that you have to spend between all of them and requiring each hero to land a certain amount of killing blows. So even if they got the required amount of kills they need to level up, they still might not be able to level up because you had to spend all the points on another more important hero. So, some characters are forever doomed to stay low level and be utterly useless for the rest of the game.It doesn’t help that heroes will come in and out of the story (or get killed) leaving you without their capabilities. Additionally, there’s an obvious lack of synergy between the heroes. So, they become extremely interchangeable and uninteresting as a result. I found that the longer I played, the more the game just mostly devolves into giant (geddit?) attrition grinds where I watch my heroes get shot again and again and again by so many archers while they slowly move across the grid. With me hoping and praying they’ll survive just a little bit longer. Up until they don’t and the whole battle is completely over because they knocked out your two most powerful heroes. That’s pretty much the entire reason I quit.While I was playing, I had this constant sense of “is this all that this combat system is? Am I really not missing anything?”. I figured out after four hours that I wasn’t missing anything. It’s just a poor combat system with an uninteresting traveling system. But what about the story? Well, that’s where my personal preference is going to take over for a bit.  Narrative DiscussionThe game starts the player out joining a group of Varl, a race of giants, at the end of their journey collecting taxes or gifts for some king. However, the place they’re arrived at is under siege by some enemy force. Who you quickly kill and then move on. Then there’s another plot with a Human father and daughter that discover that an evil force is invading their lands on the other side of the continent. This evil force of “Dredge” is now invading the country in full force. Who I’m supposed to be worried about, I think, except that I keep destroying them into the ground every time I meet up with them. Of course, a lot of their fear is implied through the story but they’re given very little build up so I found myself unable to care about them as a threat. Really, I thought this game would be fine just surviving the wilderness. Adding what appear to be magical zombies isn’t that interesting. So, these two parties flee from the Dredge in a desperate bid to find shelter further inland and the player must use their wits to help them survive.The pacing of this title is all over the place. You’re introduced to new characters with very little fanfare or explanation about them. And just as soon as I got even a little bit attached to them, they’d get killed off. Or we’d switch gears to the other group of people on the other side of the world. Final ThoughtsThe Banner Saga feels like a game that doesn’t push it’s mechanics far enough or tries to be something different when it really should have stuck with established norms. It’s a game that was clearly created with a universe and visuals in mind but the rest of it feels incomplete or rushed. Both the combat and the traveling are shallow experiences desperately trying to tie themselves together but almost at odds with each other. The combat is perhaps the biggest sticking point for me. There’s conflicting design which leads to an overall really boring and tiring experience. The artistry of the animated graphics is certainly top notch. It invokes the classic animated style of yesteryear exceptionally well while remaining modern. But that’s clearly where all the effort went. The rest of this game feels like a giant step backwards for its genre. Add on a universe and cast of characters that I didn’t really respond with and I find myself unable to recommend The Banner Saga.Read the full review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												I got the game because i'm a big fan of tactical RPG and missed good one on PC, and i was disapointed.While the game have nice music a looks nice it started to feel frustrating after some time and the frustration kept growing. It may be a good game for some but not if you are interested in the tactical aspect.The things i didn't like:-The story jumps at a point and you have to play with an entirely different team before getting back to the first team.-You gain and loose characters based on story not because you played poorly and lost them. It's hard to build a team composition and then loose a key member without a warning.-The supply mechanic is irritating, at the end of the game i started to sacrifice lv ups and items to get more supplies only to get them stolen and have my peaple starve anyway.I felt more like watching a movie that keps asking me to click the play button. Yes you make decisions but you dont have any control. Everytime i invested items and renown to build a charcter I felt more fear tha he will soon leave the team due to some story stuff than satisfaction from empowering my team.			"

												A very good RPG with an interesting plot and good gameplay. Tactics are a must have in this. There are a few glitches, but nothing really major to deal with. The game is full of hard choices, which is something that many RPGs shy away from. Overall, I highly reccomend this game, even if I have not played the multiplayer at all.			"

												This game is very poor. It is a linear procession of tactical turn based battles which have very little variety. There are very few choices to be made throughout the game and the consequences are trivial. The game moves very slowly through animations of caravan crawling through the landscape. There is hardly any management for the caravan except buying supplies and there are lengthy, unvoiced, character dialogues.I cannot believe the reviews this game has received and the £18.99 i spent on it was a total waste. The game is over in less than 24 hours and ends most unsatifactorily. It is a very poor game of little content and I have to describe it as an utter rip-off.			"

												Utterly fantastic. Somewhat like X-Com: Enemy Unknown, it's a challenging strategy game that derives its difficulty from lean resources and hard hitting enemies instead of requiring the player to memorize fifteen billion different unit types, build orders and button shortcuts. Thumbs down for bloated design. Unlike X-Com though, all of your units are proper character who are part of the story, instead of some dude you just sort of name and color; here's hoping X-Com 2 steals that aspect.The art speaks for itself, the music is from Austin Wintory (the ""Journey"" guy), and the narrative expertly balances lore building and character attachment. My only real problem with the game is that they make the design mistake of having the last battle split into two easy and really hard phases, with the big dramatic finale in between them *without a checkpoint*, so when you have to try that last bit again a few times, the impact of the big finale is really lessened through repetition.Despite that, this is one my favorite games. A must for those of you like me wondering why on earth Square Enix hasn't gotten their heads out of their asses and made a proper Final Fantasy Tactics 2 already. But hey, now it doesn't matter, because this is better than that game probably would have been anyway.			"

												Well written with stunningly beautiful art direction, The Banner Saga is a very tightly made and challenging turn based strategy game filled with memorable characters, a great story, and an equally great sound track.  I never thought a game that borrows from Oregon Trail, Lord of the Rings, and Game of Thrones could be this good.  Then again, I never thought anyone would make a fantasy sword and board game where you have to travel from one end of the map to the other without your whole party dying of dysentery and/or holes from swords.

												Definitely worth a play, if you enjoy tactical RPG style games.The travelling part of the game is sort of like a choose your own adventure book, where your dialogue choices all have unique consequences and outcomes. That part of the game is uniquely interesting.The combat is above average difficulty. Some of your characters will die. It's a lot of fun to try out fifferent strategies, and find the playstyle that works for you.The character customization is very limited, but you do have a choice in how your party progresses in levels. There are basic stat distributions, and you have to really monitor your resources if you want your party to funcition optimally.Short and sweet version of the review; if you don't like tactical RPGs, then it's not for you. If you enjoy a compelling story and some solid tactical elements, then try it out.			"

												One of the most engrossing Tac/Strat Rpg's ever!  Think Orgeon Trail meets XCOM (or FF tactics) The Banner Saga features an interesting new twist on Tac/Strat, with tough decision making and unique army/resource management.  You never know when something around the corner will challenge your ragtag party of warriors and misfits.  The story takes many twists and turns, characters die, and heroes will fall.  Careful planning is required before each challenging battle.  The AI is smart, and will challenge you.  Troop manamgement is fun and balanced, and each upgrade feels important into keeping your band of heroes alive.  A stunning and gorgeous score from Austin Wintory (Journey, Monaco) accompanies your excellent and challenging adventure throughout this Norse inspired story.  The art direction is abosultey fantastic; a heavy fantasy feel is combined with a unqiue storybook vibe along with Disney style animation.  The Banner Saga is truly engrossing.  Hours fly by as you try and last one more day on the road, battles keep you on your toes and the story is very well told and features tough decision after tough decision.  I can't recommend it enough!			"

												On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give this game a 6. Would be 8 or 9 if not for all the bugs.Pros: Unique visual style, cool animations. Tactical combat is fun and challenging. Compelling story with interesting characters. Price is reasonable.Cons: Very short; you can finish in a few hours. Lots of minor but annoying bugs. One almost game-breaking bug in the final boss fight. The game has been patched many times since release and the bugs have not been fixed. This is unfinished software, so if you buy it you are paying for the privilege of being a Beta tester.Nevertheless, the game is good fun, so I am recomending it... barely. Just be aware of both the Pros and the Cons. Make an informed choice.			"

												It really is like oregon trail mixed with fire emblem with a viking aesthetic. If you don't like any of that, then this game isn't for you. Plain and simple. On your journey, you will encounter various scripted events and battles. Your moral judgment will be tested. Depending on how you answer events, the course of the story is slightly altered; but I'd imagine the majority of the game remains the same.There are some flaws here. The game feels rigid and half baked at points. You'll fight two major types of enemies, in two variations; ranged and melee. This bothered me a little throughout my time playing. You'd travel the world, but you'd fight the same enemies. As the game progresses, you get to fight slightly stronger versions of these enemies. Sometimes they might be palette swapped, but honestly if you've fought one raider you've fought them all.The story is one of the strongest parts of this game. I don't think I would've finished the game if the plot didn't suck me in like it did. I cared about these characters; especially after you got to investing so much into them to make them effective fighters. It makes the plot that much more interesting. On top of that, the gameplay is pretty solid. You're given an assortment of tools, and its up to you to make it work. It's all a matter of taste. If what I've described sounds interesting, then this game is more or less worth a buy. There's definite room for improvement, and I have some minor gripes with the game; but overall I'm pleased.			"

												This game is far from perfect. But its a work of art, seriously if you would argue for video games being used as an art form this game could be one of your strongest examples. The fighting system is fun but needs some work. The animations are beautiful but would be better with a bigger budget. The survial system with your clan could be tweaked but works for makeing you feel stressed during a stressful points of the games story. Your desicions make the story diffrent, trusting people hurts but so does not trusting people. You end up doing things you may of never thought you were capable of. people die in connection to your disicions.

												Beautifully built, with gorgeous artwork and soundtrack. Intriguing mechanics, challenging and compelling. Interesting story and setting, evoking the Viking motif but blending it seamlessly with fantasy elements. Everything good you hear about this game is true. I wouldn't give it a perfect score, though, due to a slight lack of polish in some aspects. The battles are somewhat repetitive after a while, and toward the end it feels rushed beyond what is to be inferred by the way the story develops. Also, the way it ends, one has to look forward to the coming up installments, and it is frustrating when the wait doesn't pay out for one reason or another.			"

												This is a tactical game about minimizing damage by looking at the turn order and weakening the strength bars of whatever will be attacking soon and keeping out of attack range of whatever you can't weaken as much as possible. Even if one side has 15 units and the other has 5, each side alternates moving 1 unit at a time, so you'll find yourself weakening enemies down to very low strength and ignoring them until your finale, because killing them would mean their unweakened units get to attack more frequently. This is strange and even stupid, but the game would be incredibly simple without this extra layer of management.It's a lot more mathematical than similar tactical games such as Advance Wars, Fire Emblem, and King's Bounty. You can often find your turns being mostly wastes because you didn't look forward enough or you overspent your willpower. Most tactical games become puzzle games once you boil away enough intuition. It takes very little boiling for this game to reach puzzle status. The story and choices and dialogue are quite alright but are almost entirely flavor and affect gameplay marginally. It starts out with an ""evil swarming monster apocalypse"" trope, fortunately developing into something much less simple towards the end. The ending brings zero conclusion and sets up the sequel in no different way than any other arc in the game.I can't say this game is on par with any games from the aforementioned franchises. It is okay. I will likely play the sequel for the story someday when it is very cheap and I have enough alcohol to tolerate the gameplay.			"

												The Banner Saga combines a rich and original mythology with an immersive soundtrack and some stunningly animated vistas to create an engaging and heartfelt story of travel across a vast and desolate landscape. The Banner Saga throw mny decisions your way and it s hard to gauge what effect they will have, it can cost the lives of key characters or prove to crush the morale of the people that follow you. The writers have done a wonderful job of ensuring that you care enough about the long-list of characters that you will labour and sweat on key decisions. It is all backed up by a servicable, if not overly complex turn-based combat sytem that throw plenty of different unit types, with different abilities at you that will enable you to face combat situations in whichever way you feel comfortable. I'm looking forward to seeing what they do next with the sequal.			"

Bravo. - The music is amazing, too. - The combat is super fun. Tactical turn-based RPG. Awww yeah. - The story was very enjoyable. It really captured the feeling of fighting a losing war and having to make difficult choices. I especially enjoyed the choice and consequences. - The random events are very fun. They range from simple story/exposition to ambushes to anything in between. CONS: - Not enough animation. Perhaps it was a side effect from the amazing art, but I would've loved to see more art for the characters, vary character portraits to convey emotion and more animation for the combat like diagonal attack animations and the like.

												Great story, great art, great combat. Banner Saga succeeds in delivering an immersive experience, by tying every element of the game into the story. YOu are constantly taking part in the outcome of the story, in a variety of ways, and all of them allow you take your own approach. The many choices, each often leading to a series of other choices each with long-standing repurcussions throughout the game, are interesting and often difficult to choose between. There are no ""do the right thing/do the wrong thing"" decisions to make. Each choice is justified in its own way and you must choose based on how you think a hero or leader should behave; compassionate, cutthroat, logical, sympathetic, analytic, or anything inbetween. Even the combat sequences tie heavily into the story, as each battle may be approached differently, producing different outcomes, and even the way you finish a battle may result in a special event. You can develop each character in a variety of ways, and you must build an efficient and cohesive team in order to get through each treacherous battle. As you jump between different parts of the story, you get a chance to fight with several different teams, each with different styles of fighters that you must quickly learn to use or else suffer immense losses. Banner Saga is a compelling game, showing you that war is exciting and yet miserable, and that while you may be an excellent fighter, you can't always save everyone. There is no perfect ending, no way to complete the story unscathed, you must mitigate your losses and make tough decisions for the betterment of the entire planet. You must engage in difficult battles, using a vast array of unique characters that you must keep alive by rationing your scarce resources carefully. While Banner Saga may sound like more of a chore than an exciting game, its steady pacing and enthralling story will make it very difficult to put down, while its gorgeous art will keep your eyes glued to the screen. I reccomend this to anyone interested in (semi) realistic high-fantasy, challening RTS games, or just a great story. The Difficulty is changeable at any moment throughout the game, so this is accessible for players of all skill levels			"

A Paladin’s Steam Review: The Banner Saga. Great Visuals Crippled By A Poor Combat System.Genre: Tactical RPG Turn Based Grid Combat & Survival Game.Developed & Published by: Stoic & Versus EvilPlatform: Windows, Mac and Linux.Business Model: Single PurchaseCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]PreambleThese are my thoughts of The Banner Saga after four hours of play. If that amount of time is unacceptable to you, I suggest that you quit reading this review. So, why am I doing the Banner Saga after such a short amount of play? Well, I’ve had a lot of time to think on it. To analyze why this game failed to pull me with its story, mechanics and overall presentation. It’s pretty rare that I’ll keep thinking about a game I quit early on for as long as I have. So when that happens, I write a review. So, let’s dig into The Banner Saga and talk about the issues I had with it.Overall Gameplay ThoughtsThe Banner Saga is a combination of turn-based grid combat and Oregon Trail mechanics tied into a narratively driven campaign. This campaign follows the journey of two clans as they struggle against an unrelenting foe called the Dredge. The player is tasked with keeping these clans alive as best they can, manage their limited resources and survive. The game is split into three phases: conversing, traveling and combat. Conversations happen when the caravan has stopped at a town or some other special event happens. The player reads the lines and decides what to do next. The conversation system is ok. You do get up to four options to how you respond to decisions or particular situations and sometimes that fourth option isn’t always being silent. When traveling, your caravan in the center of the screen travels slowly to their destination consuming the supplies it has. There’s also a morale indicator to show whether everyone is in high spirits or not. This is affected by your decisions and how you fare in battle. Though I never found out if having low morale was bad but I’m assuming it is. The combat has two phases. The war phase that’s only triggered when fighting large amounts of Dredge and let’s you decide whether to be aggressive, retreat or something in-between. It’s very simple and is pretty much decided by numbers and how you fare in the turn based area. Otherwise, it’s the turn based combat that you’ll spend most of your time. It's held on large grids where your heroes battle it out against often outnumbering foes. There’s a bunch of stats that affect each hero and how they’ll perform but explaining them seems a little pointless when the game tells you straight out. I have a lot of issues with how the combat system in this game works so let’s examine it for a bit.Turn-Based Combat ExaminationThere’s a lot about the combat system that I do not understand from a design point. I don’t understand why there’s both a health and armor system for all characters. I don’t get why health is tied to power. Why are most of the enemies ranged while most of your heroes are melee? Why do they get so many turns to hit you while you get very few yourself? Why do those same archers have armor as well? Why on earth do AOE attacks also hurt your own guys if they’re in range? I had a lot of these questions while I was playing TBS and I’m pretty sure I forgot some of them. This game seems to be encouraging you to level all of your heroes but then it limits them with both a point system that you have to spend between all of them and requiring each hero to land a certain amount of killing blows. So even if they got the required amount of kills they need to level up, they still might not be able to level up because you had to spend all the points on another more important hero. So, some characters are forever doomed to stay low level and be utterly useless for the rest of the game.It doesn’t help that heroes will come in and out of the story (or get killed) leaving you without their capabilities. Additionally, there’s an obvious lack of synergy between the heroes. So, they become extremely interchangeable and uninteresting as a result. I found that the longer I played, the more the game just mostly devolves into giant (geddit?) attrition grinds where I watch my heroes get shot again and again and again by so many archers while they slowly move across the grid. With me hoping and praying they’ll survive just a little bit longer. Up until they don’t and the whole battle is completely over because they knocked out your two most powerful heroes. That’s pretty much the entire reason I quit.While I was playing, I had this constant sense of “is this all that this combat system is? Am I really not missing anything?”. I figured out after four hours that I wasn’t missing anything. It’s just a poor combat system with an uninteresting traveling system. But what about the story? Well, that’s where my personal preference is going to take over for a bit.  Narrative DiscussionThe game starts the player out joining a group of Varl, a race of giants, at the end of their journey collecting taxes or gifts for some king. However, the place they’re arrived at is under siege by some enemy force. Who you quickly kill and then move on. Then there’s another plot with a Human father and daughter that discover that an evil force is invading their lands on the other side of the continent. This evil force of “Dredge” is now invading the country in full force. Who I’m supposed to be worried about, I think, except that I keep destroying them into the ground every time I meet up with them. Of course, a lot of their fear is implied through the story but they’re given very little build up so I found myself unable to care about them as a threat. Really, I thought this game would be fine just surviving the wilderness. Adding what appear to be magical zombies isn’t that interesting. So, these two parties flee from the Dredge in a desperate bid to find shelter further inland and the player must use their wits to help them survive.The pacing of this title is all over the place. You’re introduced to new characters with very little fanfare or explanation about them. And just as soon as I got even a little bit attached to them, they’d get killed off. Or we’d switch gears to the other group of people on the other side of the world. Final ThoughtsThe Banner Saga feels like a game that doesn’t push it’s mechanics far enough or tries to be something different when it really should have stuck with established norms. It’s a game that was clearly created with a universe and visuals in mind but the rest of it feels incomplete or rushed. Both the combat and the traveling are shallow experiences desperately trying to tie themselves together but almost at odds with each other. The combat is perhaps the biggest sticking point for me. There’s conflicting design which leads to an overall really boring and tiring experience. The artistry of the animated graphics is certainly top notch. It invokes the classic animated style of yesteryear exceptionally well while remaining modern. But that’s clearly where all the effort went. The rest of this game feels like a giant step backwards for its genre. Add on a universe and cast of characters that I didn’t really respond with and I find myself unable to recommend The Banner Saga.Read the full review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												Easily one of the best RPGs I've played in a very long time. This game is actually somewhat reminiscent of that epic and groundbreaking game Oregon Trail on MS DOS, which alone is worth the experience. It also clearly draws inspiration from heavily story driven tactics games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Vandal Hearts. The faux-Nordic world and history is actually pretty consistent with the story of Ragnarok, while keeping things fresh and unpredictable. Even if you hope to see something more genuine in Nordic mythology, you will not in the least be disappointed. If anything, this world is totally align with yet another re-imagining of the Poetic Edda. I would expect nothing less from former BioWare developers. Congratulations, and keep this series going!

												The story is really thrilling, I read a LOT and i play a lot of video games which include rpgs amongst other genres and i really feel this is a compelling story if it wasnt you can bet your ♥♥♥ i would skip through it! The combat is tough because if a guy goes down then he is out for a few days and days cost resources which are finite until you can buy more WHICH you want to avoid buying any in the first place because renown is used for much more precious things like artifacts and of course upgrades which i am sure are going to become expensive as you rank up. Again about the combat another thing is that there is some serious stratagy going on here with pre battle placement, consideration of battle order on your side of things and of course how you want to approach each enemy, do i want to get that armor or hp down? the combat is great and engagageing and i love it and i am often aproaching it like a game of chess. Ive only played about 2-3 hours now but so far i am in love with the game and look forward to spending FAR more time with it.			"

Story - 91%Graphics - 86%Gameplay - 68%Sound - 88%Replay Value - 52%TL; DW?The Banner Saga has an abundant lore, a very detailed story, a n awesome soundtrack and top-notch narration, a very atmospheric ambient, and a very nice graphics. But what went wrong? The simplistic and boring gameplay drags this game down, it’s way too basic and way underutilized. The battle system was average, and may even annoy you because how the turns are set to alternate. The random events are so scarce, it made the game painfully linear, the choices you make don’t matter at all and it’s more of a guessing game. Lack of a way to get food and renown, it’s just too boring and too predictable once you’ve played it once. Fret not though, this game is only the chapter 1 of a trilogy and hopefully the developers will make a better game and better gameplay mechanics. "

												Okay, Short and sweet.The visuals in this game are pretty amazing, As you can see in the screen shots, the game has a unique and very appealing look.The Music is very well done as well. Nothing to write home about, but it is very well done.The battle system is AMAZING. This is the most impressed I've been with an RPG battle system in roughly 10-15 years? Where this game seems to lack is story. The story just seems so bland. I think they tried to spice this up by letting you make your own decisions, end the end I feel like they should have just animated the story bits. I mean come on, it's 2014 and I have to read lines like ""He cheeks turned bright red"". JUST ANIMATE THAT! I find you spend like 50% of this game in those stupid dialogue windows. Just thursting to get into a battle, because the battles really are THAT fun.I would HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone that loves SRPGs, You will get your fill from the combat, guaranteed. I would NOT recommend this game if you are looking for an EPIC story. To be fair, I've only got about 5 hours on the game right now, but it just doesn't seem like I'm ever going to care for any of the characters.			"

												This is a great game, with annoying mechanics. The story and design is fantastic, but the rules of the turned based combat is...unfair. You and the enemy team alternate, no matter how many units are on the field. If you got 10 units and the enemy got 3, its still every second turn. This leads to some units becoming very vulnerable on account of not being able to move, since the enemy can pummel them with few units.I can imagine this will balance it out later if you yourself have a smaller army, but it makes me feel like the tactic of the game is constantly screwed up by chaotic turns, that gets bumped around as units die and enemies gets more moves than you. This is absolutely devastating if the enemy has a couple of big units. A bit more polish on the tactic side of the game, making it more balanced would be better. The whole point about strategic combat is that strategy should pay off. It doesnt always in this one. I will still recommend it though since it is an interesting world that is sparesly but well presented.			"

Posted: February 5, 2014
												I really tried to like this game, but after its short lifespan (takes like a day to finish) I can't help being dissappointed. Things I enjoyed: Pretty much everything there is to see or hear. The graphics, music, the few parts of spoken dialogue. Story was also - if not great - at least good enough to be enjoyable.Now to cover the bad stuff: In a sad way this game represents one of the aspects that annoy me the most in modern day games. Games are investing heavily in cinematic storytelling, forcefeeding cutscenes and keeping the player in a tight leash from one scripted event to the next. After all of this is peeled off the actual gameplay is really shallow.So what kind of gaming content did the Banner Saga have? The game consists of two elements. Screens with text in them and turn based combat. As a method of driving the story the text worked well enough for me, however every now and then there's the occasional decision making. The decisions themselves are intresting and fine but every single time you're left to pick your choice based on gut instinct alone. If there's background information its one or two lines of text with little information value.  You can't see anyones facial expressions when they talk, you can't observe them outside of your encounter or anything. All you have is a short descrption like ""this guy looks at you funny and has a red shirt"", then you have to decide if he is to be trusted or not, or the game telling you ""situation is bad"", but you can't make your own judgement how bad exactly, like, say, in an rts game. So the first of the two elements of the game is just picking a choice pretty much randomly.The other element, combat wasn't enjoyable for me either. You have two different attacks and the game has but a handful of special abilities. The initiative system that forces you to weaken enemies evenly before wiping them out instead of quickly eliminating enemy combatants and reducing their numbers feels really counter intuitive and ""wrong"". Some people argued that this keeps the battle exciting longer instead of snowballing to your or the enemys advantage after good or bad first few turns. For me this initiative system really didn't change anything in this regard. Excitement comes from uncertainty of outcome and outcome is just as clear after first few rounds with this system as with a regular one where you aim to burst down individual fighters quickly. If I want turn based fantasy combat on a square grid I'll pick Heroes 6 over this game any day.So to sum it up: Nice art and story with a really poor gameplay core. I have enjoyed some of these ""playable novel"" -types of games that get by with the sheer quality of their art and storytelling alone while having boring gameplay beneath. Prime example would perhaps be Planescape torment and compared to that masterpiece this game is way out of league. In hindsight I would've considered this game worth 5-10 euros so wait till it comes out at discount price.			"

												A well crafted and very interesting game.First things first, the art and music is top notch. The presentation is great, and the game is beautiful. The world and lore are interesting, and the whole thing feels like it was made with a lot of love.The combat is a well made and fun turn based system. I like the implementaion of armor and strength, and how most of it does not rely on a random ""dice roll"" to determine success. Much of the combat rewards actual planning and tactical choices, rather than hoping your 80% hit is actually a hit. I haven't played the multiplayer component, but I believe the combat is very much the same, so if you want to try it out before playing the single player you could experience it there.This isn't so much a traditional RPG that some people may be used to... the story itself has a very linear progression, but the choices you make change the twists and turns of the narrative. It's almost more like a choose your own adventure book / text adventure than it is a classic CRPG game. Your caravan progresses and you have to deal with problems that arise, making decisions along the way and choosing who to let in your party.Overall, the game is great. I enjoyed my time with it quite a bit and would recommend it. It's short-ish (~10 hours), and could easily be part of a larger saga. Hopefully they make more.			"

												Stepping into The Banner Saga was a journey well worth the effort. I was captivated by the story from the very beginning, and as it progressed and descisions became more difficult it gave a sense of great satisfaction. The game is swift to punish you for being overly trusting and kind, and after your first play through you cant help but have a ""trust no one"" mentallity. I would have liked to see a less linear campaign as playing it through more then once is kinda the same as reading a book more then once. If you could choose where your saga took you and your band of scallywags It would add a dimension to the game that it is currently lacking. The turn based combat system makes for a chess style straegy game, and again it's quick to punish you for moving into a bad position, I really enjoyed it overall. - 8/10			"

												The Banner Saga is, quite frankly, a tour-de-force in storytelling. It uses a very simplistic style and point of view for cutscenes, but that is in no way a knock against it. The game manages to bring life to still images, by simply adding a little animation to them, such as the wind blowing on a character's hair and beard or someone's eye twitching.Even with 2D graphics, the techniques mentioned up add more depths and character to the setting. In addition, the impressive landscapes and the immeasurable scale of all the vestiges of an old civilzation where Gods walked the earth, makes the world simply breathtaking to look at. Combined with the outstanding soundtrack by Austin Wintory, you'll almost feel like the snow is falling on your head, that your feet are soaked from walking in the forest, and sometimes you'll even feel, much like the characters, that all hope is lost. The game has a pervasive sense of dread to it, as you are just a ragtag crew of norsemen and women, trying to beat seemingly insurmountable odds. Even on Easy, I found the game quite difficult, but it could be just me making bad tactical decisions. The game is very punishing and the AI, a lot of times will take advantage of errors in your tactics. While it can be a little frustrating, I found this dynamic to be quite enjoyable and it kept me coming back for more.			"

The Banner Saga is a Viking-themed epic fantasy RPG featuring tactical, turn-based combat, where each of the many (many) decisions that the player makes throughout the course of the game directly affects the unfolding of the story.Based on that description, this game could have been custom-crafted for me personally. I should have loved this game. I really, really wanted to. Unfortunately, the implementation just doesn't do the concept justice.Let's begin with the good: the art and music are far and away the best things about The Banner Saga - they're beautiful, immersive, and thematically styled. The graphics have a great hand-drawn feel, and the scenes nicely impart the vastness and desolation of the pseudoNorse landscape.Technically, the game functioned decently on Ubuntu 15.10 (at least on the ""linux fixes"" beta branch - the main build didn't run at all).The narrative, despite the fact that the game continually bombards the player with choices and their consequences, felt very linear and driven.The writers failed to motivate me to care about any of the characters, their plights, or their fates, which made managing them even more of a drudge - I didn't care which ones lived and which ones died, beyond their limited differences in utility, but I was still forced to go through the motions of doing so. All characters have the same handful of statistics, and leveling up just involves spending reputation to increase one or two of them. There's essentially zero potential for exploration: towns and camps are each represented by a handful of clickable icons that spawn conversations or shops, and the areas between are linear, Oregon Trail-esque sequences of traveling intermittently interrupted by seemingly random events. I have no doubt that if I had continued longer, someone in my party would eventually have died of dysentery.Finally, I found the combat dull and uninspired. There's not much variety in how the characters behave during battle, there's little opportunity for tactical creativity, and the whole mess devolves into a slog to keep one or two characters alive so that you can get the party back to camp and rest up for the next combat.There are plenty of great RPGs on Steam - I recommend choosing one of them instead of embarking on The Banner Saga.

												The story and lore are all there, and its very cool. Theres some plot hooks they raised and never used but i guess there is supposed to be more games in the series(?) so i can't say thats a bad thing. The visuals, despite being rather simple in their animations, are beautiful for the most part. The story does have the problems that rise from serial(?) games, such as story points that dont really go anywhere this game and leave you wanting more, ie romance subplot (if you can call it that. Not really in depth, but admittedly cute) and just standard problems like despite little choices, the game is still very much on rails. The choices are mostly quite small, only effecting how many soldiers you have, and how much you have to supply them with. It also does something i don't like in multiple choice games where there is no sequence of events that can keep bad things from ever happening. I like to have a path, however hard to achieve, that will result in bright sunshine land everything is ok, but again this isnt a mark down just a warning. Also the final moment is a little too predictable, but still beautiful and kind of emotional. Combat is good, quite simple. They have health, they have armour. Armour protects health, take it out to do more health damage. Simple, good. I wish there was some form of Zone of Control that would stop people walking through 5 of your ammassed crew to hit the squishy in the back but the giants are OP enough so it doesnt particularly matter. The ""war"" aspect of the game is Rush them, Play defense, or run pretty much and you can fight to save casualties. I was rarely out of the advantage though cause i picked up every village, though this meant i used my renown on supplies rather than good items or levelling Fun game, buy it on sale and watch out for possible new ones.

I haven't played the multiplayer component, but I believe the combat is very much the same, so if you want to try it out before playing the single player you could experience it there.This isn't so much a traditional RPG that some people may be used to... the story itself has a very linear progression, but the choices you make change the twists and turns of the narrative. It's almost more like a choose your own adventure book / text adventure than it is a classic CRPG game. Your caravan progresses and you have to deal with problems that arise, making decisions along the way and choosing who to let in your party.Overall, the game is great. I enjoyed my time with it quite a bit and would recommend it. It's short-ish (~10 hours), and could easily be part of a larger saga. Hopefully they make more.			"

												And on the day I got it, I finished Banner Saga (Part 1). It is a pretty game; an enjoyable game; but not really a game of choices. Instead, Banner Saga is a game of deceits designed to stimulate self-narrative, immersion, and investment... and in that, it does its job exceptionally well through its visuals, story, and (Austin Wintory) music. It is a game I am glad to have backed on Kickstarter. I heartily recommend it to all of you.			"

												A beautifully crafted turn based strategy game. This game has an innovative and fresh turn based mechanic where injuring many enemy units is more important than destroying one unit. This creates a tense and unique combat pattern which stands out from the likes of XCom. Accompanied by masterful story telling that expands upon themes of leadership and sacrifice, hand-drawn sprites and artwork, and a historical Scandinavian inspired aesthetic theme and soundtrack, this is a turn based rpg that, above all, feels complete. Highly reccomended if you enjoyed the squad tactics elements of XCom, or are looking for a good story that makes you feel involved.			"

												Stepping into The Banner Saga was a journey well worth the effort. I was captivated by the story from the very beginning, and as it progressed and descisions became more difficult it gave a sense of great satisfaction. The game is swift to punish you for being overly trusting and kind, and after your first play through you cant help but have a ""trust no one"" mentallity. I would have liked to see a less linear campaign as playing it through more then once is kinda the same as reading a book more then once. If you could choose where your saga took you and your band of scallywags It would add a dimension to the game that it is currently lacking. The turn based combat system makes for a chess style straegy game, and again it's quick to punish you for moving into a bad position, I really enjoyed it overall. - 8/10			"

Story - 91%Graphics - 86%Gameplay - 68%Sound - 88%Replay Value - 52%TL; DW?The Banner Saga has an abundant lore, a very detailed story, a n awesome soundtrack and top-notch narration, a very atmospheric ambient, and a very nice graphics. But what went wrong? The simplistic and boring gameplay drags this game down, it’s way too basic and way underutilized. The battle system was average, and may even annoy you because how the turns are set to alternate. The random events are so scarce, it made the game painfully linear, the choices you make don’t matter at all and it’s more of a guessing game. Lack of a way to get food and renown, it’s just too boring and too predictable once you’ve played it once. Fret not though, this game is only the chapter 1 of a trilogy and hopefully the developers will make a better game and better gameplay mechanics. "

The Banner Saga is a Viking-themed epic fantasy RPG featuring tactical, turn-based combat, where each of the many (many) decisions that the player makes throughout the course of the game directly affects the unfolding of the story.Based on that description, this game could have been custom-crafted for me personally. I should have loved this game. I really, really wanted to. Unfortunately, the implementation just doesn't do the concept justice.Let's begin with the good: the art and music are far and away the best things about The Banner Saga - they're beautiful, immersive, and thematically styled. The graphics have a great hand-drawn feel, and the scenes nicely impart the vastness and desolation of the pseudoNorse landscape.Technically, the game functioned decently on Ubuntu 15.10 (at least on the ""linux fixes"" beta branch - the main build didn't run at all).The narrative, despite the fact that the game continually bombards the player with choices and their consequences, felt very linear and driven.The writers failed to motivate me to care about any of the characters, their plights, or their fates, which made managing them even more of a drudge - I didn't care which ones lived and which ones died, beyond their limited differences in utility, but I was still forced to go through the motions of doing so. All characters have the same handful of statistics, and leveling up just involves spending reputation to increase one or two of them. There's essentially zero potential for exploration: towns and camps are each represented by a handful of clickable icons that spawn conversations or shops, and the areas between are linear, Oregon Trail-esque sequences of traveling intermittently interrupted by seemingly random events. I have no doubt that if I had continued longer, someone in my party would eventually have died of dysentery.Finally, I found the combat dull and uninspired. There's not much variety in how the characters behave during battle, there's little opportunity for tactical creativity, and the whole mess devolves into a slog to keep one or two characters alive so that you can get the party back to camp and rest up for the next combat.There are plenty of great RPGs on Steam - I recommend choosing one of them instead of embarking on The Banner Saga.

												The Banner Saga is, quite frankly, a tour-de-force in storytelling. It uses a very simplistic style and point of view for cutscenes, but that is in no way a knock against it. The game manages to bring life to still images, by simply adding a little animation to them, such as the wind blowing on a character's hair and beard or someone's eye twitching.Even with 2D graphics, the techniques mentioned up add more depths and character to the setting. In addition, the impressive landscapes and the immeasurable scale of all the vestiges of an old civilzation where Gods walked the earth, makes the world simply breathtaking to look at. Combined with the outstanding soundtrack by Austin Wintory, you'll almost feel like the snow is falling on your head, that your feet are soaked from walking in the forest, and sometimes you'll even feel, much like the characters, that all hope is lost. The game has a pervasive sense of dread to it, as you are just a ragtag crew of norsemen and women, trying to beat seemingly insurmountable odds. Even on Easy, I found the game quite difficult, but it could be just me making bad tactical decisions. The game is very punishing and the AI, a lot of times will take advantage of errors in your tactics. While it can be a little frustrating, I found this dynamic to be quite enjoyable and it kept me coming back for more.			"

												The story and lore are all there, and its very cool. Theres some plot hooks they raised and never used but i guess there is supposed to be more games in the series(?) so i can't say thats a bad thing. The visuals, despite being rather simple in their animations, are beautiful for the most part. The story does have the problems that rise from serial(?) games, such as story points that dont really go anywhere this game and leave you wanting more, ie romance subplot (if you can call it that. Not really in depth, but admittedly cute) and just standard problems like despite little choices, the game is still very much on rails. The choices are mostly quite small, only effecting how many soldiers you have, and how much you have to supply them with. It also does something i don't like in multiple choice games where there is no sequence of events that can keep bad things from ever happening. I like to have a path, however hard to achieve, that will result in bright sunshine land everything is ok, but again this isnt a mark down just a warning. Also the final moment is a little too predictable, but still beautiful and kind of emotional. Combat is good, quite simple. They have health, they have armour. Armour protects health, take it out to do more health damage. Simple, good. I wish there was some form of Zone of Control that would stop people walking through 5 of your ammassed crew to hit the squishy in the back but the giants are OP enough so it doesnt particularly matter. The ""war"" aspect of the game is Rush them, Play defense, or run pretty much and you can fight to save casualties. I was rarely out of the advantage though cause i picked up every village, though this meant i used my renown on supplies rather than good items or levelling Fun game, buy it on sale and watch out for possible new ones.

												5/10Pros - Great 2d artCons - Some core design flaws: Scripted events may be ridiculously punishing; Gameplay is very generic with poor progression management; Story is paradoxically not too involving; Characters feel distant; Overall very restrictive.The art, particularly the background art, is really inspiring. I would almost recommend the game on that basis alone.Unfortunately, the game suffers from some major flaws as far as design is concerned. Fundamentally, it's essentially a sort of Choose your Own Adventure type of experience intersected with (frequent) turn-based fights.The problem is that the scripted events that play out during the campaign can be extremely directive and make you feel like you are more a spectator than a player. You may lose characters without warning, or make decisions at an early point that will screw you deeply way further down the road, and then you'll have no way out.Combat itself is hardly that interesting. It's a rather standard turn-based system. Meaning that after you've gone through half a dozen fights, any novelty, excitement or discovery is lost and it becomes a formality. The way combat handles progression isn't so good, as it's one of those antiquated systems that only rewards kills, meaning that a character who goes through 20 fights and scores 2 kills will be weaker than a character who goes through 4 fights and scores 5 kills. Even then, you get little say in terms of actual character build or development.Back to the story, the whole thing feels quite a bit cold and removed. The writing is very standard, everything feels somewhat uninvolved, as if you were a witness more than a driving force in the plot. Lots of characters who seem as though they know one another quite well, but not really much given to the player in terms of space to come in and connect.Buy it if it's on a sale and don't go in expecting much at all and you might have a good time. Buy it if you want to look at pretty artwork. Buy it if you aren't demanding in terms of traditional rpg components: story & characters; choice; exploration and stats/build/strategy development.Otherwise, skip.			"

												The Banner Saga is a gorgeous looking game, with fantastic universe. Looking at the majestic landscape while running for your life will create all kinds of weird feelings in you. When you combine it with truly beautiful soundtrack, interesting story full of hard choices and unforeseen events (which will break your heart more than your caravan) you'll get remarkable experience which you wont forget.From the gameplay point of view it's not that great. The item progression is really weak, at the beginning you have nothing (duh) for a long time, and at some point you just have truckload of stuff, more often than not with high level requirements, so most of your characters can't wear them.The learning curve is kinda weird, because it takes time to find out what it's all about. And by the time when you do understand the game, it's too late and most of your characters have bad stats.Combat system tries to by original. You have strength, armor and willpower attributes and in most cases you have to bring armor down to inflict more strength damage. The most important thing is to group enemies together so you can inflict AoE damage. Although this system is original, I don't find it particularly enjoyable. It's extremely repetitive and to me, it doesn't make much sense. Difficulty levels are all over the place, which can get frustrating really fast. I finished the game and I still don't understand how could they inflict such a huge damage to my Varls.Maybe it's just that I'm stupid and every other gamer out there understood it right away, but when I look at the forums it certainly doesn't look like it.All things consider, I really thing that it's a game worth playing because of the story and atmosphere. But the game mechanics could be a lot better.			"

												Ultimately this is a game with a ton of potential but falls short on many of its core aspects. So first I will start with the best a greatest part of the game and the sole purpose it gets a thumbs-up. The visual asthetic of the game is beatiful and is one of the best in recent memory. From the music, the animation (hand drawn), the backgrounds, and just the overall theme of the game is wonderful. Full marks. It pulls of the Norse/Viking  theme amazingly, which is pretty under represented in games it seems. The world it creates is one I would love to see fleshed out so I can learn more about it. The music is so good that it is worth listing to on its own outside of the game and it only enchances every aspect of the game itself. Soo good.However, this is just barely makes up for what the game lacks. Genuinely compelling gameplay. From the combat, to the player choices, and to the overall story, the game is a bit lacking that makes the experience more tedious then enjoyable. So I will go through each of these aspects and detail why I think so.Combat: The combat is a tunr-based, strategic affair that has become all the rage in many games lately. While the base mechanics are solid in The Banner Saga they are just that. Basic. And after the first few battles they quickly all become the same sludge of tired mechanics over and over with little complexity and even fewer variations. I found that many of the character abilities were irrelevant most of the time and that archers are all but useless. Purhaps the most frusterating partr of the combat is that in one of the core mechanics it is very counter-intuitive. This is that your characters and monsters get weaker the lower life they have. So this means that it is more beneficial to leave enemies alive in a very weak state then it is to kill them. If you kill them right away the stronger enemies get mulitple turns in as the tuirn order is always one PC, then one enemy, one PC, one enemy. If there are fewer enemies left on the board the remaining ones go more often. So if you leave a few strong enemies on the board they go more often and often wreck you own characters who are weakned by fighting the other enemies. The last gripe I have with this scenario is that the 1st hit in combat is by far the most important as it will significantly weaken the opponent. So much of combat is simply jockying for position so you can hit the enemy first. Otherwise they get in the first hit and you are that much weaker staight away for it. This makes tanks much less usefull then it  might seem.Player Choice: The Banner Saga is advertised as a player choice driven game. However, the outcomes seem almost random as there is no outside information for the consequences of them. These choices can range from small boons, small annoyances, or permamnently loosing main characters. This is a real problem as this can saverely cripple your party for the rest of the game, and with no input into the decisions this is beyond frusterating. However, after more then one gameplay you realize that these choices are  not random, all (or at least most) of them are hard coded and linear for when and how they occur. This only leads to more frusteration and leads to save scumming to find the proper decisions, which only trial and error or guides can solve. Worst of all the game auto-saves at certain points and you cannot save independantly. Meaning if you do have to reload due to losing a character you spent much of your resources leveling and also losing you best items, you have to replay a large section of the game over when reloading at the last save point. Lastly, since the choices and options are all linear, replay of the game is very limited and not really worth the time to go through again.Story: The story overall is actually pretty good, and for the most part I was drawn in. The game does an admirable job of creating a suspenceful and compelling story. As your resources dwindle you must choose between getting food for followers, leveling them up, or pushing farther in your travels. Seeing your fellow clansmen die of starvation is a pity. The problem is that once you learn the mechanics of the game, you quickly realize that there is no reason not to have people starve and save you resources for leveling your heroes. The heroes are independant of the other non-warrior people, who for all purposes seem to have no purpose in the game. Once this mechanic, or lack there-of, is figured out the game becomes less compelling and more tedious as you are simply left with a basic and boring resource management game, that only has one resource and the choices you make for those resources is largely random. Also since the game is very linear either learning or looking up guides for the right choice is the fastest way and in someways make the game more enjoyable as you can then focus on the better parts of the game.So over all The Banner Saga is a game of almosts. With a bit more time in the cooker and a little more design it could have been Grade A all the way around. Instead we are left with a game that we wish made the grade as it is so beatiful and the love that went into it is very apparent. So in my humble opioon I say while it is worth spending the 10ish hours to play it, save your money for a sale and your time for when you just wanna light non-commitment game. I give it 60/100 where 50 is average.  If possbile I would give it more of a side-thumbs but that unfortunately is not an option.			"

												The gods are dead. The sun never leaves the horizon, shining on boundless wastes of tundra. The land is torn between men, giants known as varl and armored creatures known as dredge, neither carry any reason to trust each other. A new day dawns, and the world is at the brink of turmoil, weary of old wars, always anticipating new wars; nearly void of hope. In such a time, you take the role of leading a caravan across frozen wastes to its destiny.You play the parts of many characters, make their choices and endure the consequences while discovering the beautifully weaved tale of the realm. Each and every character that you lead tell a story of their own in this Nordic, war-thorn saga. Each choice that you make affects your chances of survival, and makes you approach one step closer to your destination. The setting is incredibly rich, expected from any proper RPG game. Every road, landmark, settlement, mountain or forest; every region depicted on the map contains its own local history. The lore is complete and refreshing.To begin with, the game contains a diverse gameplay, bringing together elements of adventure, role-playing and strategy games. The adventure elements are directly affecting the story, and the outcome of your choices twist and turn to present you alternative destinies. Combats are turn-based in isometric maps, and gameplay is fairly easy to grasp. Yet 'fairly easy to grasp' quickly turns into 'hard to master'. You are able to level up your characters with renown, a kind of currency that you may gain through heroism either in adventure choices or by slaying your adversaries in battle field. Alongside leveling, you are capable of gathering minor and major items to enhance your heroes furthermore.The Banner Saga presents a direct example for my reason to become a gamer: a story to be told. The game satisfied all my expectations thoroughly. I do not wish to present any spoilers, but it is safe to declare that the story of the realm is not finished in this game. Good news is that The Banner Saga 2 is in development. Cheers! "

												Ultimately this is a game with a ton of potential but falls short on many of its core aspects. So first I will start with the best a greatest part of the game and the sole purpose it gets a thumbs-up. The visual asthetic of the game is beatiful and is one of the best in recent memory. From the music, the animation (hand drawn), the backgrounds, and just the overall theme of the game is wonderful. Full marks. It pulls of the Norse/Viking  theme amazingly, which is pretty under represented in games it seems. The world it creates is one I would love to see fleshed out so I can learn more about it. The music is so good that it is worth listing to on its own outside of the game and it only enchances every aspect of the game itself. Soo good.However, this is just barely makes up for what the game lacks. Genuinely compelling gameplay. From the combat, to the player choices, and to the overall story, the game is a bit lacking that makes the experience more tedious then enjoyable. So I will go through each of these aspects and detail why I think so.Combat: The combat is a tunr-based, strategic affair that has become all the rage in many games lately. While the base mechanics are solid in The Banner Saga they are just that. Basic. And after the first few battles they quickly all become the same sludge of tired mechanics over and over with little complexity and even fewer variations. I found that many of the character abilities were irrelevant most of the time and that archers are all but useless. Purhaps the most frusterating partr of the combat is that in one of the core mechanics it is very counter-intuitive. This is that your characters and monsters get weaker the lower life they have. So this means that it is more beneficial to leave enemies alive in a very weak state then it is to kill them. If you kill them right away the stronger enemies get mulitple turns in as the tuirn order is always one PC, then one enemy, one PC, one enemy. If there are fewer enemies left on the board the remaining ones go more often. So if you leave a few strong enemies on the board they go more often and often wreck you own characters who are weakned by fighting the other enemies. The last gripe I have with this scenario is that the 1st hit in combat is by far the most important as it will significantly weaken the opponent. So much of combat is simply jockying for position so you can hit the enemy first. Otherwise they get in the first hit and you are that much weaker staight away for it. This makes tanks much less usefull then it  might seem.Player Choice: The Banner Saga is advertised as a player choice driven game. However, the outcomes seem almost random as there is no outside information for the consequences of them. These choices can range from small boons, small annoyances, or permamnently loosing main characters. This is a real problem as this can saverely cripple your party for the rest of the game, and with no input into the decisions this is beyond frusterating. However, after more then one gameplay you realize that these choices are  not random, all (or at least most) of them are hard coded and linear for when and how they occur. This only leads to more frusteration and leads to save scumming to find the proper decisions, which only trial and error or guides can solve. Worst of all the game auto-saves at certain points and you cannot save independantly. Meaning if you do have to reload due to losing a character you spent much of your resources leveling and also losing you best items, you have to replay a large section of the game over when reloading at the last save point. Lastly, since the choices and options are all linear, replay of the game is very limited and not really worth the time to go through again.Story: The story overall is actually pretty good, and for the most part I was drawn in. The game does an admirable job of creating a suspenceful and compelling story. As your resources dwindle you must choose between getting food for followers, leveling them up, or pushing farther in your travels. Seeing your fellow clansmen die of starvation is a pity. The problem is that once you learn the mechanics of the game, you quickly realize that there is no reason not to have people starve and save you resources for leveling your heroes. The heroes are independant of the other non-warrior people, who for all purposes seem to have no purpose in the game. Once this mechanic, or lack there-of, is figured out the game becomes less compelling and more tedious as you are simply left with a basic and boring resource management game, that only has one resource and the choices you make for those resources is largely random. Also since the game is very linear either learning or looking up guides for the right choice is the fastest way and in someways make the game more enjoyable as you can then focus on the better parts of the game.So over all The Banner Saga is a game of almosts. With a bit more time in the cooker and a little more design it could have been Grade A all the way around. Instead we are left with a game that we wish made the grade as it is so beatiful and the love that went into it is very apparent. So in my humble opioon I say while it is worth spending the 10ish hours to play it, save your money for a sale and your time for when you just wanna light non-commitment game. I give it 60/100 where 50 is average.  If possbile I would give it more of a side-thumbs but that unfortunately is not an option.			"

												The gods are dead. The sun never leaves the horizon, shining on boundless wastes of tundra. The land is torn between men, giants known as varl and armored creatures known as dredge, neither carry any reason to trust each other. A new day dawns, and the world is at the brink of turmoil, weary of old wars, always anticipating new wars; nearly void of hope. In such a time, you take the role of leading a caravan across frozen wastes to its destiny.You play the parts of many characters, make their choices and endure the consequences while discovering the beautifully weaved tale of the realm. Each and every character that you lead tell a story of their own in this Nordic, war-thorn saga. Each choice that you make affects your chances of survival, and makes you approach one step closer to your destination. The setting is incredibly rich, expected from any proper RPG game. Every road, landmark, settlement, mountain or forest; every region depicted on the map contains its own local history. The lore is complete and refreshing.To begin with, the game contains a diverse gameplay, bringing together elements of adventure, role-playing and strategy games. The adventure elements are directly affecting the story, and the outcome of your choices twist and turn to present you alternative destinies. Combats are turn-based in isometric maps, and gameplay is fairly easy to grasp. Yet 'fairly easy to grasp' quickly turns into 'hard to master'. You are able to level up your characters with renown, a kind of currency that you may gain through heroism either in adventure choices or by slaying your adversaries in battle field. Alongside leveling, you are capable of gathering minor and major items to enhance your heroes furthermore.The Banner Saga presents a direct example for my reason to become a gamer: a story to be told. The game satisfied all my expectations thoroughly. I do not wish to present any spoilers, but it is safe to declare that the story of the realm is not finished in this game. Good news is that The Banner Saga 2 is in development. Cheers! "

												Good points: great visuals, rich in details; good history, well explained, makes you entertain; good music and sounds, makes you relax and get into the viking scenario; choices matter, and sometimes you really regreat them, so you have to choose wisely; the whole estrategy based on a battle group, including no combatents, so you have to think about resting, food, how well do you spend your ""money"". Bad points: a battle where you have no numerical advantage at all, because you and the enemy always alternate turns; you can't attack and move after; too many characters makes you forget which one does what. So if you think about a game just to enjoy the design, music and the camp experience, go for it. If the battle part matters, run always. The RPG part is very important to me, so I'm giving a negative review. 5/10			"

												The Banner Saga is, quite frankly, a tour-de-force in storytelling. It uses a very simplistic style and point of view for cutscenes, but that is in no way a knock against it. The game manages to bring life to still images, by simply adding a little animation to them, such as the wind blowing on a character's hair and beard or someone's eye twitching.Even with 2D graphics, the techniques mentioned up add more depths and character to the setting. In addition, the impressive landscapes and the immeasurable scale of all the vestiges of an old civilzation where Gods walked the earth, makes the world simply breathtaking to look at. Combined with the outstanding soundtrack by Austin Wintory, you'll almost feel like the snow is falling on your head, that your feet are soaked from walking in the forest, and sometimes you'll even feel, much like the characters, that all hope is lost. The game has a pervasive sense of dread to it, as you are just a ragtag crew of norsemen and women, trying to beat seemingly insurmountable odds. Even on Easy, I found the game quite difficult, but it could be just me making bad tactical decisions. The game is very punishing and the AI, a lot of times will take advantage of errors in your tactics. While it can be a little frustrating, I found this dynamic to be quite enjoyable and it kept me coming back for more.			"

The Banner Saga is a Viking-themed epic fantasy RPG featuring tactical, turn-based combat, where each of the many (many) decisions that the player makes throughout the course of the game directly affects the unfolding of the story.Based on that description, this game could have been custom-crafted for me personally. I should have loved this game. I really, really wanted to. Unfortunately, the implementation just doesn't do the concept justice.Let's begin with the good: the art and music are far and away the best things about The Banner Saga - they're beautiful, immersive, and thematically styled. The graphics have a great hand-drawn feel, and the scenes nicely impart the vastness and desolation of the pseudoNorse landscape.Technically, the game functioned decently on Ubuntu 15.10 (at least on the ""linux fixes"" beta branch - the main build didn't run at all).The narrative, despite the fact that the game continually bombards the player with choices and their consequences, felt very linear and driven.The writers failed to motivate me to care about any of the characters, their plights, or their fates, which made managing them even more of a drudge - I didn't care which ones lived and which ones died, beyond their limited differences in utility, but I was still forced to go through the motions of doing so. All characters have the same handful of statistics, and leveling up just involves spending reputation to increase one or two of them. There's essentially zero potential for exploration: towns and camps are each represented by a handful of clickable icons that spawn conversations or shops, and the areas between are linear, Oregon Trail-esque sequences of traveling intermittently interrupted by seemingly random events. I have no doubt that if I had continued longer, someone in my party would eventually have died of dysentery.Finally, I found the combat dull and uninspired. There's not much variety in how the characters behave during battle, there's little opportunity for tactical creativity, and the whole mess devolves into a slog to keep one or two characters alive so that you can get the party back to camp and rest up for the next combat.There are plenty of great RPGs on Steam - I recommend choosing one of them instead of embarking on The Banner Saga.

												Well. To be fair the battle system is new and fresh and a real challenge at first. I really like the idea behind it. BUT oh boy do those battles get boring after a while. There is just no variety. Always the same enemies. Always the same attacks (most skills of your warriors are completely useless). No side goals to give the battles individuallity, even your own fighters have nothing really special about them. Walls and walls and walls of text. I usually enjoy if there are fun or interesting conversations, but seriously, so much mumbo jumbo about EVERYTHING in this game. Most of the time I just stopped reading what there talking about, only focusing when there is something to decide.Why the actual f*** can't you save normaly in this game? Checkpoint saves that make no sense to me and won't let me skip back the right amount of time if I made a bad desicion. SO ANNOYING.And you DO make mistakes quite easily. Not mistakes in fighting (because every fight is the same, haha), inside the damn walls of text. Now I think there are no good decisions at all. EVERYTHING steals your supplies, your units, your vargs, this game threats you like its personal bi*ch.You COULD upgrade your units into mighty warriors and buy cool items, but you will never have enough points to spend on it. No no no, you will just buy food and more food and more food and you will still starve, because those little sh*ts want to rest all the time to keep the mood up and every second day some crap happens so that you will loose supplies, or people, or warriors (taking your few items you spend so much on with them). Oh what fun.They advertise that everything changes the story. OK might be true. But you still go the same route I guess, you basically just decide which people are with you. (And those you like will most likely die) Damn, I dont know If I can force myself to play this game through. I want to see if the story makes sense in the end.Edit: I did play it to the end! Guess what, not even the endboss is something special!			"

And Banner Saga is one of them. This is hard to explain, but every battle is like a chess match, so it can last up to 20 minutes each. Although it is incredibly intense.To sum up, I am proud to have this game in my library, play it and enjoy it.			"

												It's an interesting concept for a strategy game, but it isn't actually fun to play.Alternating turn order makes killing people frequently undesirable, turning combat into a slog.Pumping sparse resource (there's only one) into characters only to have them die for story reasons is poor design.Ultimately I was simply not having fun, so I stopped.

												I've spent quite a few hours playing this game and can safely say that it's good. Although I was apprehensive at first, mainly since it is a turn-based game and I've had bad experiences with these (namely Final Fantasy, which grew boring after some hours), the characters' different moves and optional dialogue choices interested me greatly. Ludin and Hakon became my favourite characters quickly, and I adore the fantasy aspect of creating the varl people within the Viking legends.I played the game throughout on normal, and the only tough battle I came to was the end, as I couldn't work out that you only had to take down it's defences before then shooting it with a special attack. But I attained the 'normal' achievement eventually :) Another problem I spotted is that there are mistakes in the dialogue. I took screenshots, and, although this game has fighting elemets, it is essentially a dialogue-choice game, which made the discovery of the sentences that lacked proper endings all the more irritating. Further, unlike a visual novel game, you can't skip any text you've already read. Once you've completed this game, you will have to go through all the text again to replay it, which takes extra time.But in any case, if you're looking for a Viking game with endings that differ depending on the choices you make, then you've made an all right choice. Despite that you can't skip already read text, the sentence mistakes in dialogue, and it being a turn-based game, interesting doesn't even begin to decribe the game. You travel across a wintry wasteland, deciding whom you should attack whilst paying attention to your party and resources, and your decisions can ultimately cost people their lives!			"

												The Banner Saga has a very entertaining and interesting story.  The graphics suit the game well and also allow it to run on older low spec systems.  The audio and soundtrack are very good and atmospheric.  Some of the tunes are awesome.The armour and strength as damage and also HP is an odd combat system, but is ok to manage once you work out the tricks.  The combat sections are very good but can get repetitive.The interactive story and its choices/impacts was very good and the frustration I felt at having made a bad choice leaves me wanting another playthrough.  I found I never realy got a character to a high enough level to use most of the items I found.  Infact all 3 characters that I fed kills to in order to progress all ended up dead due to scrpted events, and the choices I made.  One of which was not all that obvious.At  10 hours to complete my first playthrough it was perhaps not great value for money, but I am left wanting more and will play again so maybe it was.			"

   My Playthrough   Youtube Video   The Review This is a very fun game that has an interesting lore. The characters are diverse and fun to play as. But by far the best thing about this game is the beautiful drawn art. the orchestra music also help give the game more life. But this game is far from perfect as their are some things that this game is lacking in. This game could have really benefited from more voice actors as I feel all the dialogue should have been voiced. Theirs no point in having a lot of Clansmen as all they do is drain resources and only affect a few events. The game does not give you the ability to travel anywhere that you want as the game is very linear. But even with these flaws the game is still enjoyable and I hope most of these issues will be fixed in the sequel.  "

												If I'd ever rate a game positively it would be Banner Sage, a clear 9/10 in my opinion.Banner Saga is a mix of interactive story telling, a bit of micro management and turn based strategic combat.A large portion of the game you will be following your caravan around as it tries to escape from the faceless evil named Dredge. These enemies are really unsettling in a way, but to tell you more would be a spoiler for the game. While trying to survive you're going from town to town and will experience events on a regular basis. These sometimes change depending on your previous decisions, but for the most part they are isolated and scripted cases, meaning you will pretty much always encounter the same events in every playthrough, but the decisions you make can and will change the story. You will have to watch for supplies and morale while on the road as well as your actual people. Supplies can be bought for renown, which is earned in events and battles. When your supplies run out, morale is dropping and your people are starving. Morale itself determines how strong your heroes are in battle (stat boost willpower). And if your people keep dying, well I never found out, but maybe there IS a game over? In any case, losing too many fighters to starvation will mean you will lose even more in the big battles in which your ""army"" has to fight. To be honest though at least on easy and normal difficulty this doesn't really matter all that much. I wish there was a greater emphasis on managing morale and your army.The other half of the game is spent in tactical, turn based battles, in which you control up to 6 heroes. You can choose who to take into battle and who to leave behind. If one of your heroes falls, he gets injured, which may knock him out for the coming battle, but none of your guys or girls can actually ""die"" in combat, only through events, which is a good thing, since you can't save in Banner Saga. What happens is there to stay.Your units have 2 main combat stats: armor and strength. If armor is a lot higher than strength, strength attacks can be deflected. Strength on the other hand represents the direct damage your units can do, so you need to strike a balance between armor and strength attacks. Usually it is best to start with a str. attack to stop the enemy from damaging you too greatly, but depending on the enemy you may need to then wittle down his armor. However, your heroes can only destroy a maximum of 3 armor (if you've skilled it) per turn. If you did not invest in armor break you're screwed in the later stages of the game. You can use another stat, will power, to increase any damage (or movement) you made. What is annoying is that you can only move your hero ONCE, even if he has movement points remaining. Especially with special attacks (each hero has a unique special and passive ability) you don't always know the exact range.Generally speaking I would say that combat is perhaps a bit unbalanced or I'm just not very good at it. You have your basic human melee fighters who just get destroyed by big Dredge enemies, your human archers who need to get almost in melee range to shoot the enemy, opening them up to counter attacks in the next rounds, which can easily spell their doom, and the big Varl, bearded giants, who take 4 squares of space and can get in each other's way easily, but pack a real punch. The only human I found REALLY helpful on the battlefield was my main guy, Rook. Everyone else was obnoxious to use, but you just can't take 5 Varl with you, even if you have enough to fill your ranks. That just makes no sense. So you are stuck with fragile humans who can die in 1 or 2 hits to the stronger enemies. Since it's also a bit hard to tell which enemy moves when (you have to click the portrait to find out, because most look the same), this can lead to a battle quickly going south.After winning a battle you get renown and depending on WHO killed your enemies you can level up that hero. Herein lie THREE more problems:1. Only the heroes who actually finish an opponent off get the kill credit, so you always have to check who you want to level up and how many kills they need to do so. This can lead to you actively gimping your battles, because your stronger heroes do way more damage. They have better stats and can wear better items due to their higher level (max 5). In the worst case your weaker heroes who would need the level up wouldn't get them and since all your heroes start at level 1 this can become a problem, especially for a newer player.2. Renown is the shared resource to buy supplies, new items AND level ups, which get progressively more expensive. This means you can severely hurt yourself by levelling up a hero only to realize 10 days later that you didn't get enough supplies, because of negative events or because the journy is far longer than anticipated. Since only 2 of my heroes reached level 5 in the end on easy I think there might be not enough renown around. I only bought a few items at the start and even had to suffer starvation in between and it was still not enough.3. There can be points in the game in which you simply lose a hero. If that hero was high level, well ♥♥♥♥ you. Tough luck. Have fun with replacing him or her with a significantly weaker one. It is a bit irritating if you have no control over such events. Yes, of course, this is something that can happen in real life. In reality though you don't have a bunch of inexperienced losers that are only in the reserve, but only battle hardened veterans, since they are constantly fighting. This is especially annoying when the game FORCES you to use a hero, even if you told said hero you didn't want him involved! So in the last mission I was stuck with using a useless level 1 archer, who didn't survive 2 rounds and did virtually no damage...Those are my main gripes with the game out of the way. The story is beautiful and brutal, the graphics are pleasing to look at and the sound is haunting and epic. Now that BS 2 is out the end of BS 1 is also more forgivable ;)You should not skip this game!			"

												Brilliant. A refreshing dose of 'choices matter' in an age of gaming that offers everything but, even if it says so on the box.You're not a legend or a hero. You the sun has been stuck in the sky for days on end, without explanation. You lead your small village away on a quest for safety, chased by an inhuman foe that can not or will not be reasoned with. You wonder whether what few resources you have should go towards: Equipment, upgrades, food, all seem equally important and each more scarce with each passing day. Who do you trust? Safety in numbers is well and good, until one of those numbers decides your skull would look better with an axe through the back. And even those you can trust will always squabble amongst themselves, complaints and greivances becomming more common than sand on the beach. Then the ambush happens. All the while you try to keep your caravan together, hoping that behind each turn will be salvation, answers, or at least a brief respite from the harshness of the end of the world.This game is as much about the story as it is the gameplay, and it does deliver on that with the help of a beautiful art style and soundtrack. Though the gameplay is still there, and every bit as unforgiving as the tale it's tied to. Taking fairly simple isometric turn-based strategy and adding a system of armor/armor damaging, and willpower which units can spend in combat on more damage/movement/abilities. The turn system is a little odd and might take some adjusting, but by the 3rd chapter I managed to settle in to it. I believe there is a free game called Banner Saga Factions that one can check out to get a feel for the combat.The only real disappointment I had was how abruptly the game ended. There were also two points in the game where I was shoe-horned into making a certain decision in order to progress, but in truth there is only one point in the game where you are presented with the illusion of choice. The final fight is also insanely difficult if you aren't prepared or don't have characters with certain capabilities ready to kick♥♥♥♥♥ The final boss is a right♥♥♥♥♥♥ but considering what he is he should be anyway. Be prepared to fight him about ten times before reluctantly turning the difficulty down to easy and kick him in the nuts.In closing I will say that this is the only game that has presented me with a choice and forced me to get up and do something else while thinking it through. If you're the type that likes to get attached to characters and immerse yourself in the story of a game and love(or at least can put up with) a somewhat difficult bunch of battles this is definitely for you.

												I was super-excited for this game.  It's basically Oregon Trail with turn-based battles interspersed, plus a good storyline.  That would be a great idea, if it were well executed.  Unfortunately, some incredibly poor design choices early on ruined what would otherwise be a great game.The big problem is that most of the battles are very easy, but winning even the easiest of battles without losing heroes is nigh-impossible.  Most people, myself included, would assume that means the game is incredibly well-balanced.  Unfortunately, it's actually because of two game-mechanics which do not work well together AT ALL.The first game mechanic is that a unit's attack power is equal to its health.  This means as a unit takes damage, it becomes weaker and less useful.The second game mechanic is that turns alternate by side, rather than by unit.  In other words, if I have 4 units and the enemy has 2 units, each of the enemy's units gets to move/attack twice for each one of mine.Stop and think about what these mechanics mean together.  The weakest unit on the enemy team is always the one with the lowest health.  If you kill him, his turns don't get removed, they get replaced by a stronger unit.  That means every time you kill an enemy-unit, the opponent-team gets stronger.  EVERY TIME!This has three consequences.  The first is that you're basically guaranteed to lose some heroes in every battle.  Every time you kill an enemy-unit, their team gets stronger.  Once they're down to two units, they'll be attacking one of your units 3-4 times for every one time it attacks back.  Couple this with the fact that the AI seems to always target a single unit with all of its units, and it's basically impossible to survive without losses, even when you massively overpower the enemy.  That's not fun.The second is that most battles are very easy to win.  Every time you lose a unit, your team gets stronger also; so after losing a few units, the battle becomes much easier.  That's not fun.The third consequence is that the best strategy for almost every battle is to get all the enemy units down to 1-2 HP before killing any of them.  It's a very boring strategy, which leads to a boring game.  That's not fun!The game does have other issues (such as seemingly benign choices resulting in the deaths of your heroes outside of battle), but none anywhere near as frustrating as the broken battle mechanics.  If the devs would fix the broken battle mechanics, I would give the game a thumbs-up; but for now, I can't recommend this game for any price, even free.  It's simply not fun.			"

												This game has decent art and semi interesting story but is mired by annoying gameplay mechanics. It wants to be an RPG and a strategy game and also a clan manager at the same time. Basically the XP you gain in battles is called renown and you're supposed to spend it to increase your characters levels but there isn't enough to level everyone and most of the time you can't because you have to use it to buy food which costs ridiculous amounts and you're always running out and you have to rest to bring morale back up which in turns costs more food and its a never ending cycle.I have no problems winning battles but they should've just kept that food and morale crap out of the game.Plus the story is always split between different characters in different places and you switch back and forth which is also annoying.Also there's plenty of conversations in which you make choices but 90% of them don't actually do anything and the ones that do are basically 3-4 different approaches to a probleme, usualy only 1 of which has a beneficial outcome all the other ones make things worse making you lose food or morale or having a character die, none of them change anything in the story so basically every choice in the game can be classified as either :GoodBadIrrelevantSeems they struggled with a lot of different concepts and game styles and tried to put them together in the same game and it doesn't really work IMO, they should've focused on fewer aspects and made them fun instead of trying to fit in too many concepts that end up being just annoying.

												Great turn-based strategy RPG game from former Bioware employees. With games like this you start to value games from Kickstarter.The game has really original battle system, where character's HP = strength - the lesser HP you have, the weaker your punches to enemy. Morale system can significantly boost your warriors in places when you need to hit first or run away from enemy's reinforcements.But most of all, I've enjoed the main plot. It's a legend! You have 2 parallel main stories, one with main protagonist and another with secondary protagonist. In every game event you can choose from several choices and each choice has different consequences for main hero and caravan.You have several heroes under your command: warriors, archers, mages, spearmans and other, so choose your party wisely.Cartoon graphics and soundtrack are also a masterpiece, I loved those ethnic songs from northern legends.The game is so damn hard even on Normal difficulty, lack of food, rest, equipment and army make you to think harder on every decicion - to fight those bandits, search for gold or try to find food for your caravan?Waiting impatiently for the second part of the story!+ Great epic plot (try not to cry in end of first part)+ Stylish cartoon graphics and soundtrack+ Original fresh battle system and skills.+ Wide variety of decisions+ Fair base price (only 5$ with 75% discount)+ Stunning game difficulty (if you tired from casual easy games)+ First caravan game I've ever played- Poor game budget (it was made by 3 developers)- Short first part of the story (~10-20 hours)- I wish if the game had more battles- Lack of food9/10 stars to Kickstarter blockbuster!

No choice you make is right, no choice you make will be good, no choice you do will not end with you getting kicked in the sack. The combat is frustrating to say the least as well. Why they went with a you go then they go, style WITHOUT being able to pick which of your dudes go is beyond me. It makes it where putting the enemy down is, often, a BAD idea as they will start being able to have one guy go two or three times before your roster goes through, making it impossible to pull people back.Its a damn shame as the game was fun for a few hours, but the need to just constanly kick the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you just kills it for me along with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat.

												Steam really needs a ""meh"" option, but since there isn't one, I'll have to go with 'not recommended'.The story is interesting, and I really did want to know what happened... but the gameplay just killed it for me. I liked the characters, but the differents skills and enemies just weren't enough to make it interesting. The balance in skills on the grid was lacking. It felt grindy as hell, like you never had a decent answer to what was thrown at you. I never felt like I aced a battle. This could of course be deliberate, just giving you that feeling of a struggle... but that's not what I play games for.The story is nice so far, though. The decisions you get to make mostly have an effect on how strong your enemy is or the status of your supplies. It's not a bad game at all, it's just not for everybody, I guess.			"

												Well, in my opinion this game is grossly overrated.Combat wise it lags heavily behind the best ones in the genre of the turn-based combat games. I'll mention few of them - King's bounty the Legend, Disciples 2, Fantasy General and Heroes of Might and Magic 1-3. Compared to these, its gameplay is practically non-existent.Having to keep enemies on low strength on the battlefield (which compared to other games doesn't have any terrain obstacles you can use to your advantage, etc.) just to make computer to waste it's turns might seem brilliant idea - but to me it's just plain silly.Many people said that the map is just a cosmetic and it's probably something which was abandoned at the early stages of development gameplay wise.This game as such is 5/10 at best. Get it for 5 bucks if you can, else don't bother. God damn mobile games!			"

												So far the best I've gotten is chapter 6. I'm really not sure if I'm going to tough it out and finish this game, because there are just so many glaring problems with it.The combat is fun, don't get me wrong. It's easily the best part of the game, but the problems come in outside of the combat. Most games like this, for example, Fire Emblem, have you gain characters that can die in battle. In Banner Saga however, your units only get injured in battle and need to rest. This means that they instead die (or leave your party some other way) from scripted events outside of the combat. That is just so wrong. It completely prevents you from crafting the team you really want, not to mention any items equipped to a unit that dies or leaves the party is lost forever. This could be saved if these didn't happen often, but they happen TOO often. Hell, there's an achievement for keeping one character alive that has at least 4 scripted events in which he can die throughout the story.This gets worse because of one event in chapter 6 that essentially sums up to ""Rocks fall, everyone dies."" An unavoidable (by that point) scripted event that makes you lose 3 characters, just like that. From what I can tell, it starts in chapter 2-3, and based on very minute decisions you make then, 3 chapters later your characters will just die no matter what. That is seriously not okay.I want to like this game, I really do. But I am just being constantly frustrated by the complete lack of personal team building. It's really hard to get attached to your characters when you have no stable way of keeping them in your party.			"

												The game is mostly very good up until the end, really great choices to make, the potential for important characters to die early on, balancing the mix of your caravan and the combat is fun and engaging. The only real let down for the majority of the game is the vicous spiral of defeat you can fall into, if you lose fights, you need to spend supplies to recover strength or you continue to be at a disadvantage. However, the currency for supplies (reknown) is also the currency for leveling your characters, so resting to recover strength = lower levels, which means you lose more fights, which... etc etc. To compund this, if you run out of supplies your moral drops, this affects your combat performance significantly... which means you lose more fights, so you get less reknown, so you can afford less supplies... etc etc AGAIN.All of this would still not be enough to make the game drop too much in review, however right at the end you have a blatantly unsubtle ""pick who dies"" moment that is shoved in your face and are then forced to take specific characters you may not have leveled to the the final fight, which is... ridiculously tough. It is clearly meant to be tough battle and I would expect no less, but instead of being maybe 50% tougher than previous battles it is 150% tougher. Many people have ended up dropping the difficulty to easy, which is instead a 50% *drop* from the normal difficulty and ends up giving them a frustratingly pointless win. I persevered and beat it on 'normal' (which is, bizarrely, perfectly balanced the *entire* rest of the game to be challenging but winnable with tactics and forethought).I'd almost suggest simply stopping at the last city once you meet 'Juno' as the game after that point appears to have been designed and written by different people who haven't played any of the rest of it, but that would end up probably being just as frustrating as the end is anyways, which abruptly stops after the fight and a short cutscene and gives you absolutely no closure to any of the major plot points or characters except one (who's dead)... ultimately, I can't recommend anyone buy this (even on sale) as it will leave a sour taste in your mouth at the end and ruin the excellent gameplay that came before imo.

												This game's combat has been compared to that of Final Fantasy Tactics. This combat system is no more like final fantasy tactics than checkers is to chess. Very dull with no real choices when upgrading a character. The combat system punishes you for killing off opponents expecting you to take most units down to low health before anyone is killed off. I notice a slight delay on mouseover on most menus, keeping in mind I can play most AAA titles on my rig with around 60 fps on high settings. While I kept hearing how good the story is and how varied it feels I find it to be linear and dull so far. I have serious doubts if I will give it another chance, and regret getting it even at summer sale prices. I think I will go play Final Fantasy Tactics again to get a satisfactory Strategy RPG experience. I really wanted to like this one.			"

												Maybe I imagined something wrong when I bought this game. The combat system itself is fun and seems also balanced from as far as I got. The story however is impossibly hard to keep track off. You are bombed with 6+ character names at the start + several town names and you get not much of an explanation of who every character is. They seem to talk about unimportant stuff or stuff you have no idea of instead of actually giving important information. Now I get it, it's fine if the characters already know each other, but dont expect us as player to immediently know the entire cast. Trying to get something valuable out of the long dialogues I just stopped to actually read the story somewhere in the middle of chapter 2. Shouldnt happen in a storybased game.			"

												After careful consideration, ""pretentious"" is a good word here. While I enjoyed the time I spent with the game, there are things that drag it down. Pros:+Solid combat+Interesting world+ArtCons:-While the 'spin' (read: defense mechanic) on the classic tactics RPG formula isn't bad, it isn't enough to reinvent the wheel, and it's certainly not enough for the game to stand on alone-Character customization is sorely lacking-Extremely linear (literally: your warband moves in a straight line)-Typos and grammatical errors rife in the dialogue-Not overly original in terms of either plot or gameplayI have yet to play Banner Saga 2 and I fear that my interest will only continue to wane with time. If you really dig the art style, or are a huge fan of the genre, pick it up. If you're looking for a ""game made by ex-Bioware employees"" then go elsewhere. Hesitantly recommended.			"

												This game is very pretty, and has lots of dialogue options. It has the makings of a fantastic Visual Novel.But then they shoved in gameplay. Gameplay that is absolutely atrocious. Do you like strategy? Then this isn't a good game. Do you like using a variety of units cohesively to take on challenges? Then this isn't a good game for you.I would give this game an overall 2/10 score, because while the story, art, and music are fantastic, the main purpose of a video game is gameplay, the main purpose of an RPG is decision making, and the main purpose of turn based game is strategy. There's no strategy, the gameplay is awful, and the decision making is filled with nonsensical negative consequences, as well as the player being given multiple choices with the same outcome. In addition, while the story is interesting, pacing does not exist, and the transferance between characters is random.Gameplay: 2/10To put it simply, there is no depth to the combat, the AI is easy to manipulate, and if you attempt any strategy except one, you will lose units for no reason. The biggest problem is that there's no engagement mechanic. That enemy that just needs one hit to die? walks away freely and attacks you from range. That archer hiding behind a literal giant? The enemy can walk around the giant with impunity and one shot your archer. Oh, and if your archer lives? They can't do any damage(because your health is your damage number), so your best strategical move is to use them as bait and get them killed.Story interaction: 1/10 Do you like losing a character in a conversation with no context? How about being given a false sense of choice?Basically, while the story is cool and interesting, every single scripted event can have characters die for nonsensical reasons, which then makes the already terrible combat worse, because you just lost your level 5 hero because half the options don't actually do what they say. There's a certain scene with an Ox cart that is the perfect example. A giant tries to hold it and prevent it from falling off a cliff. You get 3 options. All 3 result in the cart falling, and two result in the giant dying. So why the ♥♥♥♥ is this an option and not just a cinematic? So the devs can pretend they gave the player choice.			"

												An epic story driven by your choices set in a Viking world with strategic RPG gameplay. What's not to like about this premise? I bought it. Well, there comes the truth...Good things:+ The art is truly beautiful. Sprites, backgrounds, everything is hand-drawn and of high quality.+ The world is interesting. I wanted to know more about the lore and the world, what's happening, why it is happening.The disappointments with this game:- Choosing is hard i n the beginning. Not because both options are equally good or bad, but because I have no idea what is resulting from them. No matter how hard I try to understand the logic behind the options, the result always seems random and disconnected from what I chose. So after the initial choices I stopped caring and just chose whatever.- Those choices do not matter. Yeah, you gain or lose some resources, someone dies, you get an extra items. But the story is unchanged. You visit the same places and get the same happenings and dialogs no matter what you chose before.- Combat is annoying and boring. The system simply won't work. Not being able to choose who character acts at each time made me pass turns, waiting for the right character to get his turn. Having a bigger, weaker army is not an option, the one with less, stronger units will win. The final boss battle is much harder than the rest of the game. Yes, it is the final boss battle, it is supposed to be harder, but it's at least two levels harder and brings limitations to how you can win.- The story's ending sucks. After all the presentation, all the teasing about epic things in an epic world, the story ends without explaining anything in an infuriating way. I know this is the first chapter of a trilogy, but even then you have to close your chapter with something. Telltale's games usually have five chapters and each one ends leaving the player in a ""I WANT MORE!"" status. Banner Saga's ending just brings a ""wait, is that it? Where are all the things you teased me with? BARELY ANYTHING HAPPENED"". Wait for the second chapter of the trilogy to come out and, if it is good, buy both. Currently it is not worth buying the first chapter alone.			"

												I've tried to like this game. Really, really tried. But the millionth time I hade to reload and rewatch the same cutscenes I couldn't take it anymore. Something that usually appeals to me in tactical games is the ability to perfect each encounter, but in this game replaying an encounter is not made easy and enemy placement and turn order is randomized.It's way too slow and frustrating. If manual saves were a feature maybe some of the tedium could be circumvented at least.It's pretty to look at though.			"

												The story is very short and particularly linear, its random/influence events are minimal and usually dialogue-based, and has no side-path 'missions/objectives' that are really optionable. Additionally, the scenes/set/setting don't give any in-depth context or background narrative - at times I was left struggling to remember odd names from the other side of the divergent story and trying to figure out what was generally going on, most of which was unanswered even upon completion of the game and a semi-finished quick re-run.Lastly, I found that most of the resource mechanics are simply just trivial and pointless. The combat system is even more odd. It basically entails that if you enter combat with less heros you have an early-mid game advantage, among other issues, like 'tactically' keeping the enemy units alive on 1hp - which means the enemy has a useless unit (who cannot deal damage) taking a movement/attack que before their other units every cycle. I enjoyed aspects of this game which were refreshing and somewhat reminiscent of various browser-based Flash games, but I think the game essentially doesn't live up to what it attempts to be. All that said, I think if the development was more focused on incorporating more Roguelike mechanics, which were persistent *entirely* throughout the story and in all facets of game-play, and the campaign story was broadened a bit, this would title would go down as an undeniable cult classic. Realistically, the only re-playability this game has is just to gain a few new/different characters, perhaps some different dialogue-based decisions and some different cut-scenes or alternate endings.

												Pros: Very engaging and well written story. Good job establishing an emotional link to certain characters and a good amount of hard hitting twists that throw you for a bit of a loop. The world is very fleshed out, with a very clear attention to detail. Gameplay is challenging at the higher difficulty setting and in the later chapters it feels very desperate from the overworld/management perspective (which I mark as a good thing).Cons: Said overworld/management perspective is actually completely worthless and has little to no effect on gameplay, save for the highest difficulty setting. While the story suggests that decisions drastically alter the direction the narritive takes, its not necessarily anything huge, though to its credit it makes it seem like it. Combat can get repetitive towards the end. The purchasing of items through the in game currency is possible but the game is short enough where it feels that it could have been better spent on character upgrades. Which gives evidence to the unavoidable Major Flaw of this game.Important Major Flaws: This is not a full game. This is the first part of a series (presumably a triology), but it clearly did not have to be. You won't see it advertised anywhere, but this game is merely an episode of a larger overarching story that you are introduced to. While the story is very well done, the ending feels contrived, as if they forcibly stopped themselves from going further. This game will take between 8 to 12 hours to complete, but overall the time feels light considering its 30$ price tag off sale. All of that being said, I'll more than likely moan and grumble my way to buying whatever sequel follows it up, considering the great story and world that they had going, but then again, I got it on sale. I really, really want to press the 'recommend' button for this one, but I'm afraid I can't, as it steps a bit too far into the line of 'overpriced' as well as 'falsely advertised'. Still, a solid 7/10 all things considered.			"

												Plays like Oregon Trail meets Final Fantasy Tactics: Watch the wagons roll until a dialog box pops-up with a random event OR a cutscene and Turn Based Combat combat scenario. Really dislike the ""Eat or Level Up"" game mechanic. The currency for this is earned by selecting the right dialog/actions option during a random encounter (worth 5 pts) or by winning combat (10 points). The rewards for combat are really underwhelming. Characters only get ""experience"" if they land a killing blow. All other actions are valueless in terms of character progression. Game also appears written with the intention of penalizing positive moral choices as they mostly result in the protagonist  coming off as a naive fool.			"

I did want to enjoy this game which is why I am personally disappointed.Pros - Great visuals - Original Setting - Very well written dialogue - interesting choics to make that can effect game laterCons - Voice Acting phoned in - Very unforgiving learning difficulty when the combat feels overly simple - you will see most of what the game offers in the first 2 hours of play.

												The dialogues are the worst part of the game. There are only names next to the dialogue text, so you better remember all those norse sounding names or you will get lost in the dialogue. You also ""play"" as several characters, which can make matters even more confusing. Some of the dialogue makes absolutely no sense to me at times, I find some of the decisions to have unclear consequences. For example you find a necklace and you can chose to return it or keep it. It doesn't inform you what stats the necklace has, even though you are holding it.TL;DR:The dialogues aren't voiced over.  Heaps of text written in awkward English between several parties who can be identified only through their weird names often makes it confusing just to identify who is talking to who. These conversations are followed up by choices that have completely unforseeable consequences.			"

												It'd be an awesome game when judging the graphics, the gameplay, the soundtrack, the story, the characters or anything else except for the game's stability.Yet, The Banner Saga is (currently) so horribly unstable, it doesn't make any fun playing it. The worst problems one can avoid by installing the beta version, but still it's just not acceptable that the game locks up regularly. Not that it'd crash or freeze completely, it just hangs and doesn't continue. For instance in battle often an enemy should end its turn, but never does. So, you have an NPC character that's out of possible actions blocking the initiative round. The UI is perfectly responsive, but your only option in that case is to exit the game, as you will never get control of any character on the battlefield.Or in dialogues. Sometimes two dialogue options pop up simultaneously, and the game doesn't continue, no matter what you do. Same for information messages.Ah, and there's a memory leak somewhere. The longer one plays, the more the animations stutter. Restarting the game helps.All this brings me to the next point of critique: It's not possible to save manually. So, whenever one of the aforementioned bugs strikes (quite often), one has to reload the last autosave which might be half an hour old, or even older...To summarize, I'd recommend this game, if it weren't so extremely buggy that playing it simply isn't fun.

												The Banner Saga would've been an AWESOME movie.  The writing is great, the characters are memorable, and the visuals are unique and interesting.Unfortunately, it's not a movie, it's a game.  And as a game, it's bad -- embarrassingly so, as if the developers are unaware of the progress and evolution in game design in the past 20 years.  The fights in Banner Saga are boring, repetitive, and frustratingly limited in options.  The overland travel (strategic level choices) are opaque and capricious to the point of randomness. By the end, I was so annoyed with how ham-fisted the gameplay was, that I wasn't even enjoying the wonderful writing and visuals anymore.  Which is a real shame, because they're the only things justifying playing it at all.Buy this only at deep discount, and keep your expecations very low.			"

It's one of those rare games that I kept thinking about when not playing it. A truly epic start to what looks like to be one of the most evocative RPG experiences this year, as Stoic want's to do a trilogy of The Banner Saga			"

												A regrettable purchase. Decent story, but weighed down by terrible combat gameplay that makes you want to eat your hat. And then on top of that, this is the first part of a trilogy (because of course it is), so you're going to be investing even more money into this franchise.			"

												Banner Saga is absolutely gorgeous and the storytelling is fantastic. The text-based events during your journey give you a great sense of who you're travelling with and what you're trying to achieve for them. That said, here's why you should stay away from it:- The difficulty curve. After killing the same 2 or 3 types of enemies over and over, there is a completely pointless difficulty spike at the end of the game. The big bad is literally invulnerable. Beefing up your heroes to deal with him is impossible because...- Resource management. Supplying your followers and upgrading your heroes uses the same resource. Despite the narrative going on about leading your people to a brighter future, your best course of action is to let the buggers starve. Your heroes will still be able to survive without food and fight off entire armies by themselves. The woman who doesn't want to kill people on the battlefield because she's oh so pure and compassionate will watch her entire village starve to death without second thoughts.Two objectively minor annoyances that really detracted from the game overall for me are how tedious the fights are and how badly represented Viking society is. The text tells me one thing (the thrill of the fight! protect your people! this is actual, real Viking society!) and the design and mechanics tell me the complete opposite (the fights are boring, letting your people die is common sense, and shouldn't there be a lot more POC and women with swords in actual, real Viking society?). Overall Banner Saga was a good idea fantastically badly executed. As it stands, it makes a decent visual novel and a boring, pointless, but really pretty game.			"

												Pros:Good art designMemorable charactersInteresting original storyTurnbased combat system is goodCons:It's incredible short - 4 hours and your done. The decisions you make don't really affect the game at all. The overall affect of the game wears off towards the end. It feels like a rush job.I bought it when it was at full price which is probably why I am going to not recommend it. If it's on sale for less that $10 I'd say give it a try.			"

												Good idea, but I don't like how they did the turns. Instead of doing it by units, your enemy gets a turn for every one of yours. So lets say you have 8 units and they have one. Until you kill it, that unit will move for every one of your moves. It can just murder one of your characters if its attacking someone that isn't due up for awhile. If you kill enemy units your making the ones remaining move faster, which is stupid. It did have some good things though. The art style was very unique, there is good story, but it was just ruined for me by that stupid way their turn based system works.			"

												I'd been waiting since this game came out to buy it on a good sale. I paid five bucks during the holiday sale. I spent about an hour playing it and was ready to fall asleep. This game sucks hard. The trailers and the pictures gave me a false impression of the game. There are no cool cutscenes. No voice acting. No animations during dialogue. This game is just a huge disappointment. I suggest you go and watch a gameplay video before buying this. It looks like chocolate, but tastes like....well...um....you know. I don't even think I got my money's worth for five bucks.			"

												Short and minimally interactive. Very poorly written and dumb things happen in the storyline. I beat it without even trying after 9 hours of play.

												I bought this game due to the rave reviews it got and the fact that I love T-RPG's, however I was pretty disappointed with the game.I beat the game in ~7 hours, which is fairly short, even for a $20 MSRP RPG. At one point, I was given the illusion of choice where characters were killed no matter what I did (I ALT+F4'd out 3 times in an attempt to save the characters, the same thing happened no matter what choices I made). The end of the game feels more like a half way point more than an actual ending; nothing is resolved or finished, if this was a big budget game I'd expect DLC to pick up where the game left off.You control two separate parties, one of which feels really balanced, the other is so underpowered you'll practically lose every fight unless your RNG is VERY lucky. At first I really liked the Telltale style conversations mixed with the Oregon Trail style traveling, but both of which are implemented poorly, so your decisions don't effect much and you're constantly struggling to have enough supplies, which prevents you from leveling up your units.Upon finishing the game there's no New Game+ or anything, resuming your game simply takes you to the final cutscene and then the credit roll. So many names are dropped and places talked about during the game that you end up fairly confused unless you take notes, the game has a fairly large world map but you don't ever go to 90% of the places on it. The game feels highly polished but rushed, like there was much more content planned but they didn't have time to finish it.I got the game for $5 during a sale, and at that price it's a decent deal, but at full price I can't recommend the game as it feels incomplete and imbalanced.

												First off, I like others had high hopes for this game. I adore turn-based tactical RPGs. Ogre Tactics, Final Fantasy Tactics, I eat 'em up. This game looked interesting so I gave it a go.First part it was great. Beautiful gameplay, detailed world, interesting plot, etc. The real issue however? The combat. Oh, the combat. First off, the tutorial is very lacking and sporadic. For example, I didn't realize I could change initiative order into much further in the game which can really make or break combat.The lack of stats and distinct ""classes"" made the game really cringe worthy too. Both health and attack power are the same stat. So, as you lose health you start hitting like a wet noodle. I disliked this from the get-go but worked with it as best as I could. It made combat so tedious.It feels like they tried to streamline the gameplay as much as possible but it just made the combat terrible.Another big decision flaw: the fact that your only resource (Renown) was used to level characters, buy supplies, and buy items. And let me tell you, there's not enough to go around. It's basically a ""you're screwed"" kind of scenario no matter what.The fact that you could lose your max geared characters on a random decision outside of combat hurt too. Oh no! I choose the random option B and lost my awesome hero! Let me just reload my last save and-wait, why's my last save from three combats ago? What...Yup. The game auto-saves for you and doesn't let you have any say in the matter. This really, REALLY bugged me. Part of being a single-player game is the ability to save whenever you could (with limitations of course). Not having this ability really sucked since you pretty much got stuck with whatever bad decision you may have inadvertantly made.All in all, this game felt like it was doing nothing but screwing over the player which is apparently part of its goal but there comes a point too when the game needs to be fun and engaging. It's not engaging when I lose my best heroes because I chose to eat turnips instead of carrots. It's not fun when the last boss gets to act 6 times a round simply because he's the last one standing (and regenerate each time he gets a turn!). So if the equivalent of getting smacked in the face with a fish for 9 hours doesn't appeal to you, I'd recommend not getting this game or waiting until it's much cheaper. As is, it's not worth it's current price. "

												Picked it up on sale because I like the viking history stuff and strategy elements. Turns out that's all I really like about this game. The combat itself is challenging and very strategic, thankfully there is no permadeath from combat.Outside of combat, however, is where the game fails. There is a lot of...waiting. The game is very intent on telling a story, and it will shove the huge scale of your passage in your face for what feels like hours whether you like it or not.The game starts out with a pretty basic story. Escape your home because it's under attack, travel to find safety elsewhere. Unfortunately, the game asks you to make decisions between fights. You're trying to keep your people safe, so naturally you would want to pick the safest option, right? Haha, nope. If you're not trying to Rambo guns blazing 25/8 then a character is probably going to get killed. Because you hit ""2"" instead of ""1"". Not for tactical combat reasons, what the game bills itself as, but because trying to stop a cart from falling off a cliff. All in text, too, so it's very unfulfilling.I can see why people like the game, because the combat IS fun, and the story IS cool, but the parts inbetween are severely lacking.			"

Just normal, I can't say it's a good game, here is what i thought after playing 7 hours1. Graphics 9, this game has its own style, pretty good.2. Game play 7, not that interesting, no skill tree, you can't do anything when your charactor level up. Battle is getting bored after encounter 5 waves of enemy.3. Plot 7, the story is not very interesting. And you can not save before you make choice in dialogs, then you've to play from last auto save to see what's other options go to...4. Music 8，Good.			"

												I gave this a negative review for only one reason; the 89% score represented by the whole of steam reviews is not a true reflection of the games quality. I think the nuance of this game is skewing the true score that this game should be rated as. This is a 6.5 to 7 out of 10 game; I still recommend playing it and buying it for a cheap price less than $10.Story:  6/10 (the thing that weighs on the story is that it’s very clear they are going to milk this game, very little gets revealed in this firs installment of the Saga, it is captivating,  but doesn’t reveal or progress anything.Music/Sound: 7.5 (Music is appropriate to the setting and art style, sound fx in battle are nothing special)Gameplay: 7.5 (The concept of having this caravan with limited resources and going on a trek in choose your adventure type of gameplay is a nice touch, and works well in this games environment. Combat: Strategy wise it’s decent and AI is fairly well done, although the actions, and special abilities leaves something to be desired.Writing/Dialog/Voice Acting: 4/10 ( Writing of dialog is bad, I can live with spelling mistakes, but there are grammatical mistakes that shouldn’t have passed QC especially since this is a story driven game. Sometimes the quality of writing dialog is putrid, its worthy of a high school student writing a short story. There is limited voice acting in the game, but when it does play you wonder to yourself why did they even bother…yes the dialog writing is bad in the game, but voice acting they have is even worse and it added nothing to the game.

												This is one of the worst games I have ever played.  The entire thing was a miserable, punishing, counter-intuitive disaster from beginning to end.  The story was thoroughly confusing and unexplained.  The combat system was actively backwards, designed in the most maddeningly anti-strategic way imaginable.  The final boss fight was an unending slog of frustrating attempts that were much, much more difficult than my 'easy' setting should have been.  Choices were unintuitive and possessed seemingly random outcomes only designed to punish the player endlessly.  There's a rich, well developed world map that you don't get to explore at all.  The game is completely linear.The art style is great, but the the game had me begging for it to just be over by the end.  A truly depressing experience, and I'm sorry to have wasted my time playing this game.  There's no satisfaction to be had in this game.			"

												I've just given this game a 2nd chance after failling running it on Linux a couple of weeks ago.I might not have played it much, but I don't feel like playing it more for the moment.The Banner Saga is certainly very beautiful, but I find the gameplay rather confusing: the number of characters is a bit overwhelming, and they all feel somewhat hollow; when you finally get to know the main characters and the caravan the focus changes to yet other characters in a different place with different needs; it's very unclear to me why characters live or (permanently?) die after a battle - is it random? there is no way to save your game to test different strategies or correct mistakes; battles lack strategy: there are very few options and you can't even choose which character to use. Characters all have the same few possible actions (except for 1 special ability if any); when upgrading a character some icons make sense (like strength, armour or willpower) but the others are unknown to me (chains??) and don't seem to be explained anywhere - kinda frustrating, given that ressources are limited and you can't go back since there is no save; the game seems very linear and yet seems to lack strong story elements: nothing more than collecting taxes and fighting random battles on the way for the moment.I consider The Banner Saga as an interactive story with turn-by-turn strategy elements - a genre I can enjoy, but IMHO it simply doesn't stand the comparison with other recent games (like Transistor or Shadowrun: Dragonfall) which have a solid gameplay, a more immersive storyline, strong characters, and great music & visuals as well - all this from the very beginning of the game.I must add that the Linux version of the game lags so much it's unplayable - yet the game runs fine on the same computer with Windows.I bought it on sale and yet have regrets. I don't think it's a bad game, but it's definitely not the game I was expecting.			"

												I can't come up with any other term that fits better than ""Gamer Blue Balls"".  The artwork was beautiful and unique, greatly reminding me of the best of 70's and 80's era line-art epics like Lord of The Rings or The Hobbit. They did an amazing job of creating a deep and interesting universe, from history to cultue and artwork. They have well-developed characters with mostly believeable behavior. The gameplay is challenging, especially in evoking the grim feeling of scarce resources and harsh choices.  You can build your characters up for combat, or you can try to keep your people alive, or you can do both poorly. There will never be enough currency (Renoun) to manage both. They managed to keep me interested in the civilians and the story enough to actually care about the choices I made, and agonize over the risk of starving them all to death in the cold. They built up an epic plot with several layers that were just coming to maturity when, out of nowhere, and with no warning at all, the credits start rolling. You finish a boss fight, that one of the characters even comes out and says won't actually kill the big bad guy, just put him down for a while. Enemy army - still rampaging through the world. Big world crisis - still utterly untouched and in full swing. Personal story - also still in the middle of everything. They created this grim, georgous, hugely challenging world that I absolutely loved, and just suddenly shoved a ""The End"" in your face at one random chapter about 1/3rd of the way in. If they had either finished the rest of the game, or made it clear from the beginning that this was only Part 1 of several, I would have been so happy with it. Instead, I'm left dissorientated, unfulfilled, and rather irritated. Maybe they were more upfront about it with their backers, but I missed this Kickstarter, and all I know of the game is what was listed in Steam. Sorry, but unless they patch this with the rest of the game that they left out, I can't recommend this to anyone. Such a shame to waste so very much potential.			"

Basically, it's like an interactive, 2-D matte painting - a beautiful (no, I mean BEAUTIFUL) - matte painting and your characters scuttle across at at the same viewing angle, but only when they fight. Otherwise, there's no movement. No life. The dialogue is stilted, not very well-written. When oh when are these tech nerds going to hire some English majors to do their writing for them? When? The interface is easy enough, given that all you can do is slash or defend or use some kind of special power.The story or what I saw in that admittedly brief experience was really meh. And the whole concept of the ""dredge"" as the evil guys (really?) is pretty silly. That said, I would watch an animated feature of the artists' work. I would play a 3-D (or 2-D of the quality of Baldur's Gate) rpg with this artist's input. The ART IS THAT GOOD. But this game, in it's current form is pretty bad. "

												It's a glorified Oregon Trail with about 8ish hours of gameplay. Some replayability, but after first playthrough it left a sour taste in my mouth. It didn't have much variety in terms of battles, and it's not a very good story. Also, you're left with a complete disregard for what's actually happening to the world. It feels like an incomplete game that's going to be split up into two or more games for the purpose of cashing in on strategy enthusiasts. Honestly, it wasn't terrible, but had I not gotten it on sale I'd be extremely upset with my purchase. I would avoid this unless you really just want a basic strategy simulator with two flavors: weak and armored. You spend a majority of the game watching a caravan travel whilst making ""seemingly"" important decisions that really don't matter enough to have any effect overall on the endgame. In hindsight, I would've waited for the price should come down to $10, and then waited for a sale.			"

												Very little variety in enemies to fight and the in-game ""choices"" feel random and only encourages replayability in the sense that you would want to go back and pick the choices to avoid punishment rather than to try different paths for variety. Choices you make only effect how easy or difficult it will be once you're on the battlefield, so there is a great incentive to memorize what the effects a choice will yield, which just makes the game linear and defeats the purpose of giving choice in the first place. Although I knew when I bought this that two more would be coming to continue the storyline, the developers claimed that the game stands on its own, which is a weird thing to say considering that after completing the game, I had more questions than answers.It's not a terrible game, but I can't recommend it.

												The most important aspect of a game is the combat for me (if it has combat), it makes or breaks the game. Combat mechanics are not very good in the banner saga, mostly the armor damage calculations. For example my character has 8/9 stats which is attacking an enemy with 10/11 stats. That 9 damage of my character is decreased to 1 when attacking either the enemy's armor or strength. Surely I’m going to lose the fight. Also the damage done to armor does not seem straight forward as I have not figured out the calculation. The wiki says it’s just damage - armor = damage done, but that is not the case in most instances, as other hidden factors are affecting it. The game starts you off in situations like this and outnumbered in the ones I played, making it pretty frustrating when you are new and learning the mechanics and tactics. When I lose a fight it seems like nothing really happened. The story keeps going. I wonder if I could go through the whole game speed clicking on dialog and lose every fight without any divergence to the game or loss state.			"

Also, there is something so captivating about watching tiny people marching through the frozen mountainous land.+ The soundtrack: Emotionally and eargasm material, the music contributes a great deal to the atmosphere of the game.+ The characters: Most of the characters in the game are fascinating with compelling background story. Too bad the story is short and some characters don’t stick around long enough for you to know them better.+ The lore and setting: The developers has established massive and in-depth lore which you can read about or discover as the game proceed. I find the Viking setting of the game quite unique and remarkable. + That ♥♥♥♥ing boat scene.The so-so+/- Gameplay: The Banner Saga uses a combat system resembles some classic SRPG games with a twist. You use a party of maximum 6 heroes to fight in a gridded, chess-like field. Each characters has 2 main stats: Strenght and Armor. Strength determine an unit’s health and attack, meanwhile armor determines your defense. The more strength an unit has, the harder he hits and vice versa. The more armor you has, the less damage you will take and you can ward off an attack completely if your armor is significantly higher than the attacking unit’s strength. Doing armor damage does not reduce health but it does reduce the enemies’ defenses, thus makes them more vulnerable. In addition of strength and armor, each heroes also has willpower. Willpower can be spent to make an unit move farther, deal more damage or using special ability. You and your opponent take turn to move and take action until there is one last person standing of either side. The less people you has in play, the more actions 1 character can take, so you can use 1 or 2 powerful characters over and over again before the enemy can react. Imho, the turn order is the biggest exploitable flaw in the combat system.The caravan section demands you to balance between your supply, renown and morale of your clan during your journey. Supply sustain your clanmen and army, the larger your caravan, the more supply is consumed each day. If your supply reaches 0, the number of people in your caravan and your morale will diminish harshly with each day passes. Renown is the only currency in the game, which can be used to upgrade your heroes, buy equipment or buy more supply. Morale determines how well your heroes perform in combat, high morale give you booste in willpower during combat and vice versa. Your morale will slowly recede as your caravan travel but it can be boosted by halt your march and rest (consumes however many days worth of supplies you spend resting). The resources in the game are extremely scarce and play brutally important role on how your game progresses.+/- Difficulty: The game is hard and unforgiving, even in the beginning. +/- Story and narrative progression: The campaign is line near, but as the story processes, you will be given various choices, some are petty and insignificant, some are morally difficult and make huge impacts on your journey later on. The game is short and seems a little bit rushed, but the replay value is huge with the variety outcomes of the array of decisions given throughout the game.+/- No permadeath: You may still lose your heroes outside of combats as a result of a wrong decision.The bad: - There are some minor bugs that may occur during combat, which can be irritating at times.The Banner Saga is one of the best strategy game I have played in recent years. It is an extraordinary visual-audio experience but it could use some improvement in the combat system.Strongly recommended and looking forward to the sequel "

												7/10，普普通通吧，玩了大概7个多小时，虽然没通关，但说说感想1. 画面9分，有自己独特的风格；2. 游戏性7分，没有技能树，角色升级基本没有东西可以选择。战斗也挺无聊的，后面重复度挺高的，基本打完5场后面就不想再打了。。3. 剧情给7分吧，目前没啥出彩的地方。。还有对话选择不能sl，你想看另外一个对话的影响得重新打。。4. 音乐8分，还可以。-----------------7/10.  Just normal, I can't say it's a good game, here is what i thought after playing 7 hours1. Graphics 9, this game has its own style, pretty good.2. Game play 7, not that interesting, no skill tree, you can't do anything when your charactor level up. Battle is getting bored after encounter 5 waves of enemy.3. Plot 7, the story is not very interesting. And you can not save before you make choice in dialogs, then you've to play from last auto save to see what's other options go to...4. Music 8，Good.			"

												Let me start by saying this: The Banner Saga is not a bad game, but merely a decent one and I do not think it's worth the full asking price.The Good:+The soundtrack by Austin Wintory is amazingly atmospheric.+The story, world and characters are quite good, especially since norse mythology is underused in general.+The combat draws from other games like Heroes of Might and Magic and Fire Emblem.+Great animations both during travel and while in combat.The Bad:-Sound effects repeat way too often and I'm pretty sure Varl, Humans and even Dredge have the same pained emotes.-The story is not finished, which means that you more or less have to buy the next game to get a proper ending.-A lot of characters repeat but with a few other details and just a swap of color.-The map is confusing to read and it can be almost impossible to decipher where you're going and how much you should provision.-Random events are scarce and too random, seriously just find a guide, especially for the ones where your characters die.-Renown doesn't make any sense as a concept in the game. Slaying enemies, making good choices and reaching milestones grants renown points. These points can then be used to level up characters when they have enough kills, buy items and buy provisions. But how exactly does your renown pay for food? And why do I lose renown when my heroes level up? Adding further to this is the fact that the game is one long escape from the apocalypse, but due to how renown is gained, you have to fight in as many battles as possible to level up the most and buy more provisions.-The combat UI is clunky.-Furthermore, combat feels off in many ways. See your HP is also your damage, I quite like this mechanic, however this leads to situations where it's actually better to let enemies live rather than killing them. The reason is because the initiative system always switches sides until only the last enemy remains.Bottom Line:The Banner Saga is a decent game that can be fun at times, but lots of small nagging design flaws will be trying your patience throughout, if you must play it, buy it during a sale.

												Simply put: ""Morale and clansmen don't matter, level up or you'll have to start over.""As a turn based RPG, The Banner Saga does a competent job, if somewhat shallow, with character leveling and strategy. The art style is good and the story is epic in proportion, however, as a game, it has some minor-major issues that hold the game back from a enjoyable experience for me:- There virtually no aggro control for the majority of the game, rendering tanks useless and the only strategy becomes pretty much free for all.- Although the art style is good, the game spends a considerable and unjustifyable ammount of time in loading screens, regardless of your PC specs.- The game saves automatically, which makes a short chain of defeats the first step in a dimishingly enjoyable sequence of battles. By what I take to be the middle of the game, I could not win a battle without losing at least half a party. And it just got progressively worse from then on.- By the time you hit one of the main bosses, you may not be strong enough to beat him regardless of your lineup and strategy. This leaves you with two choices: a) start the game over, which may take a dozen more hours to get to the same point or b) choose an easier difficulty setting. Both options represent a pretty evident flaw for the game design for me, and I find myself unwilling to choose any.I wanted to like this game a lot, and enjoyed part of it thoroughly, however, it simply refused to let me like it without wasting a lot of my time. If you're thinking of buying it, I'd recommend reading a guide before starting a game (one other option that I would not have chosen).Time to uninstall.			"

												Let me start by saying the game has some great features (It's pretty, great music, decent story). However you should on play this game if you enjoy S&M.This game takes 90% of the usual control one would have in a RPG and throws it in the trash. Half of the conversations give you options that do not matter because the story goes the same no matter what. Not to mention how many times you loose characters you have worked to lvl up not based on your skill in the game just based off of sory line, but don't you worry your AI opponents keep getting harder even if you loose half your group to a storyline event. So eventually you are forced to turn the difficulty down, and the game becomes tired, dull and frustrating.			"

												I felt the game came up short in aspects to what I was expecting.  There is a beautiful map overview and when I first saw it I thought I would be plotting different courses to take; reaping the rewards or suffering the consequences.  Instead the game did it for me via script and I charted the same path and plowed through the same encounters (mostly).  Considering most of the game is artwork (beautiful artwort) with script I really did figure I would be given more options within game but other than watching my caravan plod along or fight the chess style battles I felt let down very quickly.  If this price includes the next 2 segments of the game then it may not be a bad buy, at the time I bought it for $25-$30 and felt ripped off for 8 hours of first time playthrough.			"

												The story was pretty generic, the relationships were underdeveloped or pointless, and there was hardly any music or voice acting. This all might've been forgiven if not for how bad the gameplay was. You basically watch a caravan of people moving to the left or right for 10 hours. There is hardly any animation (although I did like the art style). The monotony is broken up by occasional ""events"" (a text box with ~3 potential choices for you to make) and a few turn-based fights. The former feel ultimately pointless (the story doesn't ever alter enough for this to be meaningful) while the latter is plagued by the fact that it is a relatively short game (if you try and have some variety you will be obliterated later in the game).Just not my type of game I guess. If you still feel inclined to buy it, at least wait for it to go on sale. It is way too expensive at the present time.			"

												Neat story and cool world, but it's not very deep gameplay-wise. Battles don't reward you for killing opponents, you are rewarded by keeping enemies alive with minimal strength...which is weird. Shouldn't killing an enemy on the battlefield be a big boost to your team? Less enemies to fight? Not in this game... in this game you just want to weaken them all equally before wiping them out.Scared of losing your characters? Don't worry, you don't lose them forever if they die, they just have a small decrease in str for a few days...which doesn't really affect the gameplay too much. I got to the final fight and was like...finally the game is going to open up and let me customize more....nope that was it. For 5 bucks i'm not angry, but if I had spent more on it, I would be dissappointed. Can't recommend it unless you get a wicked good sale on it. 50,000,000/100,000,000			"

												Absolutely boring, if you are looking for a good rpg with a good story, don't let this game foul you. The narrative is really boring, you end up pretty soon reading walls of text describing the events, yes you read well, because apart of descriptions you aren't going to see anything else for the majority of the time, the ""actors"" stay still and the text rolls, nothing else, the voice acting is also missing. If you can relate with characters in this way, good for you, to me this was a huge obstacle for the immersion. You have been warned.			"

												Bought this because it looked pretty and I like tactical games.2 hours in, really bored. So much plot, so little game.Do I recommend this game...um....I feel horrible saying no to such a beautiful, well presented game, it's a fault of steam's binary system that I've only got yes or no. I'm pretty much on the line.It's a game for a specific kind of person. The emphasis here is on plot and art, plot, and more plot, not on tactical combat. I really enjoyed Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall, and this gameplay is almost entirely the same with tactical combat + read a lot of story + dialog choices. Banner Saga's got more plot:game, and much less detailed gameplay, than those Shadowrun games.It's REALLY pretty. I'm impressed by the art, it's quite a feat, hand drawn combat animations, but I think it's coming at the cost of gameplay depth. I think I'll be finishing it at least, though I might have to force myself.At least they found a way to do dynamic tactical combat without relying heavily on aim% RNG. That's refreshing, in itself.

												The best word I could use to describe The Banner Saga would be, Bleak. I enjoyed my time playing it, but it is like The Road of turn based tactical games. This is much more true the further into the story you get. Times are hard, and that is the point of the game. You have to press on through situations that leave you feeling as if you are just barely hanging on. Pushing through the hardships of traveling to outrun the oncoming scourge that is leaving cities destroyed and people slain in its path.The tactics system was put together very well and I loved the art direction. In battle you have the Varl who are larger and take up more tiles on the board, your archers, your spearsman,  and menders which are like a mage. Each person has a different skill set with different powers and you are able to schedule their turns accordingly. Keeping the big bulky fighters out front to protect the archers and menders. Their is also a shield mechanic that causes less damage to be done the higher the number is. When attacking you can choose to attack the shield or the HP. There are also some special attacks that allow you to damage both. This was an interesting direction to take and I thought it worked really well with the rest of the system.The story has many different routes that can be taken. Some options will lead to more desolate routes while others can keep your caravan full of mead and enjoying themselves on the road. Some choices can kill members of your crew off for good, so be sure to choose wisely if there are characters you highly value. I enjoyed this element of the game very much and loved reading through the dialogue. You jump between different stories following Rook, the cover character, & Hakon the Varl. It gives you a good look into the lives of the different types of characters in this world that you are traveling through.While heading out onto the road you have to ensure that your caravan is packed with supplies and well rested. You can make camp at any point while on the road and rest your soldiers, train, or level up your heroes using renown. You can do all of these things when in town as well, and only in town can you restock your supplies. That is, unless you are lucky in your journey and run into one of many different opportunities to refill your wagons by honest or dishonest means. You need to stay on top of things in order to keep up the morale of the caravan, and trust me that gets harder and harder on this long and arduous journey. Resting, winning, & having supplies should do the trick, but at times that's easier said than done. If you do run out of supplies, be prepared to start losing clansmen & fighters by the day.So although times get dark and the losses get heavy, The Banner Saga shines through with a triumphant story and terrific gameplay. It is all tied together with a very powerful ending aided by some amazing storytelling that I found to be very creative. I played on PC but it is available on all types of platforms. Xbox One, PS4, & mobile to name a few. So there you have it! There is no excuse to not check out The Banner Saga at some point in time, you can even play it on the bus, at jury duty, or while drunkenly perching on top of your roof while the neighbors call the police.For more video game news & reviews be sure to follow the blog Http://SublimeGameReviews.wordpress.com& follow on instagram & twitter @SublimeReviews			"

The characters are amazing and losing someone just literally makes you want to restart the whole game.  Roughly 10 hours in and I am wishing I had sick days to call off of work and just play this game.  A+++ game will play through again!			"

												Simply put, one of THE BEST games I've ever played. Pros:EVERYTHING, including:- Music. The score is beautiful and memorable. Beyond anything I've ever heard in a video game.- Writing. Subtle yet brilliant. The plot is simple, but it serves as a background for a multitude of themes. The pacing is also well organized, building up to an epic conclusion.- World building. The lore is well grounded and mature, yet still enchanting and engaging. Especially if you're into the cold, gloomy Norse stuff.- Characters. Well written and memorable. - Art style and visuals. Just look at the screenshots, it's beyond beautiful.- Gameplay. The tactical combat is deep and well thought-out. The random encounters are interesting. I never thought that watching an animated caravan rolling through the screen (for hours on end) would make for such an enjoyable and thrilling gaming experience. It does.- The general atmosphere of the setting. - The ending and the final scene. Cons:- None.- Yep, not a single thing.This game is nothing short of perfect. This is the Silmaril of video games - a flawless gem, plain and simple in shape, refined in proportions, but filled with radiance and light of its own. Verdict: 11/10			"

												The Banner Saga is an epic fantasy tactics RPG with a fair helping of strategy in a style similar to Oregon Trail. The game's art is superb, as well as it's sound and music. Thematically, it leans heavily towards Norse/Viking lore and styles however it possesses it's own distinct and unique world. The game switches perspectives on occasion not disimilar to the style of Game of Thrones, and a concurrent storyline carries throughout the game. Gameplay primarily revolves around overseeing a caravan on it's perilous journey through an ever-darkening world. Without the option, (save in rare scenarios) to choose your own path, the game is fairly linear, but each playthrough can take on a unique life of it's own depending on your choices.The battle mechanics are unique and often unforgiving. It will make you relearn and redefine conventional tactics as you know them (for veterans of the genre) and it will take time to master strategy on the battlefield. Unlike tactics games such as Shining Force and Fire Emblem, having your characters defeated in battle does not translate to their certain death, but losing or underperforming in a battle carries with it it's own tragic penalties. This game is not easy and often an unfortunate chain of events can find your caravan spiraling into waste and ruin. I ended up starting over several times after some unfortunate events and bad choices lead my caravan to near certain doom and perennial misery. The game has a dark tone that intensifies as you get deeper into it and though you are offered a commendable number of potential ""party members"" for use in the game's tactics-style battles a loss here or a poor decision there can easily result in losing one of your favoured characters, and the game mercilessly proceeds at it's own pace while you are forced to mourn the dead quickly and keep your wits sharp for the fate of the rest of your caravan.I found myself often trying to be the ""good guy"" or ""hero"", doing my best to help those I came across in need and treat all I encountered justly, and the game tries to reward you for this when possible, but there were other times where being the good guy ended up feeling like a thankless job, wrought with unseen potential dangers and more of a burden than I could afford to expend. At a certain point in the game I was forced to turn down a group of villagers-trying-to-go-refugee with an enemy force bearing down on us, knowing quite certainly there fate was incoming but barely having enough supplies to keep my own group alive and well for the unknown journey ahead. At another time in my saga, my caravan encountered a group of bandits waylaying another group of travelers and when the bandits offered to bribe us with off with some of their victims supplies, I actually found myself relieved at the way it turned out,... then realized just how far I had fallen.10/10, it made a heartless monster out of me			"

The gameplay is nicely paced, with travel able to be either the most relaxing or most tense moments of the game. The combat is done so simply that I picked it up instantly, but still now have trouble with some of the tougher fights. The only downside is that it is short, about 10 hours if you play it at a fairly standard pace. If you are even considering buying this game, just buy it and you wont regret your decision.			"

												Well I got this on sale and even though it has some issues in terms of mechanics it's pretty awesome overall.  Well worth the sale price and probably full price for most folks into this sort of thing. The good stuff- the art work is insane.  Love the characters and the landscapes are phenomenal.  The battle system gets a little repetitive but in other ways it's very cool and chess like. As beautiful as the landscapes are the caravan Oregon Trail choose your own adventure stuff gets a little old.   Especially when there is Renown riding on some of it  and this is what you use to level up your characters.  The Renown thing gets pretty old.   Also when characters just leave or die maybe possibly based on said paperback choose your own adventure style ""decision"" and then the resources you spent leveling them up go with them.  But you can't argue with how beautiful the game is.  The animation is gorgeous.  The Varl are cool and it is really a pretty relaxing experience to strategize and soak in the visuals.			"

												If you want a beautiful RPG experience that harkens to BioWare's early PC games, you won't be let down by this game.  Add one part Song of Fire and Ice (game of thrones), one part Vikings, and one part Ogre Battle and you have this game. About 75% of the game is spent in combat - turn-based strategy that is fairly interesting but don't expect anything as good as Final Fantasy tactics.  The other 25% is spent in the metagame of managing your troops via interactions, across the snowy north.  By that I mean making important D&D style decisions that have a very meaningful impact.Example: You have 700 troops and the enemy number over 1000 in the tree line.  You will soon be surrounded.  What do you do?1 Rush for the next town and try to lose them. (risk losing troops and supplies)2 Charge the enemy head on (engage in turn-based battle) to create a diversion and save some troops.3 Instruct your fire archer to set the forest ablaze to create a getaway. (dice roll, I permanently lost my only archer this way)4 Lead the enemy further into the forest and then light in on fire. 5 Order your troops to make a defensive formation.There are also animated interactions on the field and in town, wherein choices you make will have a direct impact on how much money, troop count, or loyalty you will lose/gain.  The game forces you to make tough decisions and there is -NO- returning to a save point, you must live with each crippling lost battle, or bad decision you make.  The art is fantastic, as is the storyline.  It's a beautiful RPG in every sense of the word.  At $25 it was really expensive but I wanted to support this dev.  It's easily worth $10 on a steam sale.			"

												A really good game. Has a beautiful art style, a good story, with lots of hard choices that actually impact the outcome of the game to some extent, and a good tactical combat system. The story has several ""main"" characters and grows on you as you play it. The combat (on normal) is hard enough to make it fun and challenging and to affect the decisions in the rest of the game.Love the art style, especially the landscapes, and the viking theme. The soundtrack and voice acting are good too, even though I wish there was voice acting for more parts of the game. The story could be longer too, but that's ok since it will have a sequel soon.			"

												To put it simply, The Banner Saga is a beautiful game from start to finish.  The story, art, and music all come together to create an experience that is unlike any other in video games.  Yes, the actual gameplay is fairly simplistic, but everyother aspect of this game is so well crafted, that I barely noticed to relative lack of gameplay depth.  When discussion arise over whether or not some video games count as art, this game deserves to be right in that argument, as it is, as I said before, beautiful.			"

												Esses eventos aleatórios que matam seus personagens são RIDÍCULOS. Você perde personagens que você investiu um monte de renome porque não queria jogar fora um carro de comida, por exemplo. Ah, mas é só dar reload né? NÃO, PORQUE ESSE LIXO DE AUTOSAVE NÃO TE DEIXA SALVAR E SE QUISER RECOMEÇAR, TEM QUE SER DESDE O INÍCIO DO CAPÍTULO. Os combates são todos iguais e quase sempre contra os mesmos inimigos. Simplesmente não tem cutscenes, apenas muralhas de texto dizendo o que acontece, o que tira toda a emoção, parece uma visual novel às vezes. O game te joga pra fazer decisões importantes e você não entende nem que caralhos tá acontecendo, que diabos são os dredges, o que eles fazem, quem você é, pra onde e por que você tá indo, é tudo muito mal explicado. Jogo HORRÍVEL, não recomendo a ninguém. Ah, e a tradução pra português é uma bosta, tive que jogar em inglês de tão lixo que é. These random events that kill your characters are RIDICULOUS. You lose characters that you invested a lot of renown because you tried to help them pick a food cart, for example. But it's okay, just reload, right?  NO, BECAUSE THIS STUPID AUTOSAVE CRAP DOESN'T LET YOU SAVE, IF YOU WANT TO RESTART, GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAPTER! Combats are all the same and almost always against the same enemies. The game doesn't have any cutscenes, just wall texts telling you what's going on, no emotion at all, seems like a visual novel sometimes. It also throws you into important decisions without you understanding what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on, who the hell are these dredges, what do they do, who you are, where and why are you going, nothing well explained. TERRIBLE game, I don't recommend it to anyone. Oh, and the translation to portuguese is crap, I had to play it in english.			"

												As much as I wanted to like this game, it does fall short and hits its head on the side of the table.Where to start, even? Graphics! I'm not sure why there is a zoom option. It only makes the sprites, which are fixed in resolution, shoddy looking and blurred. The GUI is terribad, really really god awful. Many times, sprites and their HP/SHIELD icons overlap, and you cannot tell who has how much health. Also, I felt that, during marching scenes and the bridge-battle, too many sprites were reused, which created a cheap Habbo Hotel feel to the whole scene. God is in the details, developers!Bugs here and there. Made one of the archer characters completely unusable, as her ability to create an arrow trap locks up the game, and all you can do is to kill the process and start again from the last save point. While on this, the developers are struggling with bringing the game to Linux as a platform to the point that they have decided to drop support in the sequel. Speaks volumes if you ask me. Performance was bad, and memory leaks forced me to kill the game after 40 minutes of gameplay, in the middle of combat, and restart it just to avoid an inevitable spiral to 1 FPS land.I didn't like the resource management in the game. Most of your resources come from the Giants fighting plenty good fights. Then, those resources are spent on food for the villagers, so that your teeny-tiny people do not starve to death. Maybe I should have just let them starve to death and spend the Renown on upgrading my units? I'm not sure there are consequences to letting your villagers die, really, as the whole game seems to lack consequences to decisions, besides in what shape and form you start your battle and whether someone dies instantly/disappears or not. Most choices felt completely bipolar and without much effect on the world or even our own situation. Sometimes you get ♥♥♥♥ed over, but that's about it.Story-wise, I like what they did with the characters. The Norse-myth inspired world they painted does bring warmth to my Norse-mythology tinkering heart. The MAP alone is worth an article on lore and love that pours through it. However, what you get for your money is half a game, a prequel to the end of the world. As it turns out, the developers really liked the basic plot device of Game of Thrones, and the Northern barbarians/obsidian people are being pushed into your people by the possibly terrible, unknown force. All in all, the game feels like a great concept done in mediocre fashion.			"

												I was a bit in doubt if I should give this game a thumbs up or down to be honest. As the overall score was very positive I decided to go with down as the game is not that good. I was fooled a bit by the positive reviews and a screenshot with a lot of characters (turns out that is only for the endboss). I did like the art though and if you are into that kind of thing it is worth buying on a nice discount.In my opinion the problem with the game is that it can't decide what it wants to be and is therefor a bit light on all fronts. First of all it is far from an RPG. For a story driven game the story is not very impressive. I am still amazed by how many people were impressed, but hey, maybe that's because I read books. None of the characters grabbed my attention, maybe with the exception of Iver. The enemies are lackluster as well and there are only three models for both bandits and dredge (no I'm not counting the stonesinger, shoo). A bit more variety would have been nice.The game can be quite unforgiving, but in a bad way. Pretty much all ""tactical"" dialogue options bit me in the♥♥♥♥♥ I'm tempted to use ""literally"" here, but I won't. Anyway you are a viking, so buck up and charge the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (no seriously, that is usually the best option). Paired with the fact your favorite classes will be spread over two parties and some are randomly taken away (or die painfully because of a dialogue choice) doesn't give you the feeling you are in control. I was half expecting that the two parties would meet and you would be able to create your preferred party. To spread doom and such. But alas *spoiler* that never happens. Well lets say I stopped caring halfway through the game (poor, poor starving clansman). Luckily what I though was a miniboss turned out to be the endboss. To top things off: I love level 1 characters being forced into the group for the end battle even if you tell her to sod off (which was very vikingly of me!). But everyone loves level 1 characters, their fluffy nature might distract and confuse the enemy, at least for one turn...Elmo the Grumpy Lootmaster signing off			"

												Medium recommendation.  Not the greatest game, but worth a look, especially on sale.  VERY linear rpg with turn based battles.  The mood, art style, and subect matter/story are fantastic.  It is an obvious mobile port, as by the one large next button on every screen.  While there are choices that affect the game immensly, it still is on rails.  Very old school.  You move without control through the background, and then popups give you text based choices.  All dialogue is with (beautiful) stills (well, they are slightly animated..blowing hair, blinking eyes etc...)  The static gets annoying to me, like one character is a historian/scribe, and every shot of him he is holding a quill as if getting ready to write, regardless of where and when.  My gripes of the game come mostly from frustration.  I wanted this game to be so much more.  The management aspect of keeping your caravan going could have had much more depth than the little it did.  The items and upgrades to characters are few.  Basically, to win this game on hard, you need to solve the puzzle.  It is not a matter of sound strategy, but anticipating how the game is programmed to work.  The a.i. is ok, but very robotic.  Also, I am not as big a fan of how they handle turns.  It alternates regardless, unless there is only one enemy left.  if you remove the next enemy to act, it gets replaced by another.  You'd think it was to add difficulty, but you can exploit it as well.  Either leave your eneimies with one or two strength so they take up turns with weak attacks, or go into the battle with 1 unit and move them around avoiding the next enemy mob to act like a puzzle and get all free shots in as they chase you around the checkerboard.  All in all, the game has flaws.  I got it for $10, and the art style and narrative is worth a look for that price.  It's not horrible,  but when a game has that much potential to be the greatest game with a deep engrossing story, and they just push out a ""storified"" version of their F2P (but P2W) TBS multiplayer game with over simplified mechanics, it is annoying.   I rally wanted more, especially since I beat the game in under 13 hrs with multiple starts.  Really 8 to 10 hours of gameplay, mostly watching your caravan as days and supplies tick by.  Devs, PLEASE do this game justice in the followup.  It needs to be more fleshed out.  More to do.  You fight the same enemies the entire game.  That is fine if there was more to it than watching a cartoon that you need to click thru between identical battles.  Still, I do recommend it because the story and art is really that good.  If it wasn't, I'd give it a thumbs down and 1 paragraph review.  And I wouldn't have beaten it..			"

												Compelling, heart-wrenching, moving, bleak, and scope are a few words that come to mind when I think of this game. From the get go you are treated to the stunning visual art style, and the epic musical score. The game's story is right and compelling; the lore of the world is vast and intrigueing. The gameplay feels like a cross between Final Fantasy Tactics, The Walking Dead, and a horrific reimagining of Oregon Trail that happens to take place in hell.The choices you make are both extremely personal to your playthrough, and extremely severe in their consequences. As atmosphere goes, it's hard not to get sucked in to this one. The music, the dialogue, the ever increasing odds against you, the ever worsening consequences to your actions, and the dramatic landscape all seek to suck you in like some black hole; sapping you of all resolve. By the end of the game I was truly sure that I had reached rock bottom, and that there was no hope I would finish the story. I had lost fight after fight, made bad decision after bad decision...and yet I did not ever consider restarting. This was my saga. Now go pick up your banner, and start your long gruelling journey.

												The Banner Saga is a step in the right direction for strategy games, with a very deep system revolving around just a few equally important stats. With each stat and each class feeding into one another, no stat or class is without its merit and there is no wrong way to build your team, though there are certainly plenty of opportunities to use them incorrectly. The game is so finely tuned that any misstep can send you inexorably down the wrong path during battle. If you are looking for a well-polished, challenging, strategy game with beautiful art and animations, this is the game for you!			"

												If you're looking for a turn-based, beautifully animated strategy game, then The Banner Saga is highly recommended. There are some issues. Although the game tells you that your choices will have an effect on gameplay, it seems as though scripted encounters and predetermined twists sap the 'choice' from the player. Also, the story leaves a bit to be desired. But all in all, this is a very good game.			"

I find most games make it easy to choose the ""right"" choice but this had me and my compainions hanging on for dear life the entire game!

												Good game, but could've been better but not for the bs ""consequences of your action"" that killed off some of your heroes if you're not creaful.I was looking for how to kill the final boss and I found some salty people saying that it was too hard to beat him, it's true and it lessens the good impression about the game for some people, not me cause I got lucky after being salty and went online searching for how to beat the boss, lol.Too many heroes and types of hero, if you're the one who choose to avoid combat then at the end of the game, you probably would have experienced all types of hero, not even a full team of your favorite heroes at lvl5, therefore it makes the final boss hard to kill, but it doesn't mean that a full team of lvl 5 heroes will make it any easier.No fast forward when the caravan is moving, make it more immersive for me but sometimes annoying because I wanted the caravan to move faster, especially when I'm out of suply and keep losing my people and I didn't want to see that.7/10, waiting for a sale to try out The Banner Saga 2, got this game from a bundle, heard it was good so I kept it and it was the right choice, you should try it out too, it's a good game.

												The Banner Saga is something special. The music, writing, and art all come together to make an experience that feels genuine, beautiful, and engaging. The story is very interesting, and it had me baying for more even after the end. This alone was enough to make me enjoy the experience.In terms of gameplay, a lot of the game comes down to managing supplies and making decisions on your journey, punctuated by turn-based tactical combat. There are a lot of interesting decisions to be made, and the travel aspect feels like a much prettier, much more interesting version of The Oregon Trail. Worry about who's been stealing supplies, keeping morale up, whether you should save the people of a village considering it means more mouths to feed, decide if the fighters on the road are actually who they say they are... all with a looming threat trailing too close behind and no guarantee of safety. I found myself getting stressed about how far we had to go to get to the next town, as my supplies were running low and people started to die of starvation.The Banner Saga, as an overall experience, is very much worthwhile. It is a story worth telling, paired with the music and art necessary to tell it effectively, and gameplay to make you feel like a part of that story. It is not a game you want to miss out on.			"

												Short version: mediocre at best, I highly recommend to not buy it.Explenation:It basically is an turn based strategy game with an okay-ish Fight system and a small amount of lvling.. Not too much there.The game is about making decisions in game that truly affect nothing but a few numbers, it is almost impossible to lose this game.. It switches you around to different perspectives at seemingly no reason at all and makes you really not attached to the characters at all whom you have no control of where they go or what they do.. Suddenly you end up doing a battle with people you never even leved up and it messes up your whole strategy.I really dont think it is worth that much money, I dont really like the music (Sounds like some Viking folk cover without the good parts) and the story is pretty much: Stone people attack us that flee from darkness and now attack humans and giants.. Nothing is explained really well and the game ends suddenly leaving you wondering what the ♥♥♥♥ you spent your money on.I played through it in ~10h, didnt enjoy much of it.. The decisions you make really dont change anything..  "

												This game is a bug fest.  Bought it because it looks cool and they added it on to Linux.  Thing is, it is only half-butt added on.  It seems the whole games technical side is like that.  I mean the game itself is nice if you can it to work for you.  Check the bugs thread and see what you think.My little bug makes all the text blocks of color.  The only solutions I've seen is the did you update your video driver crap.  No I just use video drivers from 10 years ago.  Reminds me of the Windows 95 days.  Yeah I was gaming then too.  Every time you bought a game you got to pay 50 bucks to see if it would even work.  When you contacted technical support all they could ever tell you is update your drivers and good luck, but back then only half the games worked anyway. Standards were all over the place and still evolving. Today most games work no problem.  Like most of the 100+ games for Linux I own that are fine.  In other words is my system really the problem or is it maybe something else?  I think this is just one of those games that is too buggy overall for the developers to catch up with and fix it all.  Therefore, not recomended.  I will reinstall in a year and see what they have managed to do.			"

												Didn't work for me. I can't quite put my finger on what bothered me.The combat is fine, and the art style is quite pleasing. But the travelling, character development and general (non-combat) interface felt strangely unengaging. I couldn't be bothered with reading the conversations either and I'm not generally reading averse (I mean I hugely enjoyed pillars of eternity for heavens sake).			"

												I had this game on my watch list for some time, but never actually committed to buying it because, although the reviews were quite good, it just seemed too much of an odd-ball game to commit to. Boy was I wrong. Just goes to show you that you don't need graphics card choking high-end visuals and state of the art 3D to make a stellar game. The folks at Stoic have proven that a good epic story, combined with decision making that gives you very unexpected outcomes, and an Archon chess like combat system, (Google it!) can actually be uncannily entertaining. The graphics, although 2D in nature are put to exceptional and very creative use, to give a visually rich playing environment. Music is excellent and ties in well with the mood of the game, although a little more voice acting would have been a nice touch. Play it on normal and you are sure to be challenged, and at times just a bit frustrated, but in a good way. I was able to start playing it on my high end Windows PC, and then finish it on my 4 year old MacBook Air, with no change in look or even performance. Steam’s Cloud synchronization even gave me the ability to just continue playing where I left off. A true gaming outlier that will not disappoint. Enjoy.			"

												It's nothing you haven't heard before: the art style is captivating, the writing is not totally unbearable, and the characters are generally likable. Gameplay is super simple and only has the appearance of depth. Most stats boil down to having high health and being in a position to deal the most damange to armor first. I don't feel like my choices had the gravitas as was promised but with the time I put into the game I thought it worth 2 playthroughs to see where some things may go. Ultimately your decisions do not matter in the slightest as far as branching gameplay narrative. I think most qualms with the ending were how it left so many things unfinished. It would have been beneficial to have a Fire Emblem style ending with each surviving party member getting a short glimpse of where their path led after the finale. If you must have closure in a game and a tightly wound story arc, stear clear; the pacing in this game is left wanting. However, this turn-based strategy is worth a romp or two, but only at special sale price.			"

												Imagine playing Dark Souls, but instead of testing your fighting skills, the game randomly decides if you live or die. And instead of respawning at the Bonfire, you get sent all the way back to the begginning of the game. This is what this game feels like.There's no way to recover an earlier save. made a decision that devs randomly decides they don't like and your characters died. I want them back and I can't reload. Did the devs seriously expect me to go back and play THE ENTIRE GAME all over again to get the perfect ending?Hell by then I might not even remember what happened. I might end up making the same mistakes again. There's no logic either. Nothing is explained to you. Everything fees like just a roll of dice. How was I supposed to know helping a Varl with his cart will get him killed? Or listening to the Witch's advice will get her burned alive? Am I supposed to just remember every decision by heart? Is this what this game is? A storybook adventure that forces you to restart at the beginning everytime you lose a wrong, random roll of dice?This game is awful. This is the 2010's. Why do we still have this kind of draconian design?I was preparing for the sequel, which I pre-ordered. And now I remember how much I hated this game when I bought it a few years back for disempowering me at every possible turn. Pretty sure I rage quit the first time around when I realized I couldn't reload to save my guys. I don't pay to get punished. Gaming is meant to be fun.I want to support indie game developers, But why do you feel the need to punish players like this?			"

Positives: - Interesting art style- Cool storyNegatives:- Fairly mindless combat. Don't expect a FF Tactics or deep strategy- Pointless, long cut scenes of the caravan walking- Most decisions don't seem to make much of an impact. Most of them are annoying- The battles are either all too easy or too hard- There isn't a good balance when it comes to resources. Everything is purchased with the same resource			"

												It is a great piece, but the combat becomes a little repetitive afterwards. The art style, atmosphere, and the universe are unique and worth investigating into.Though, the progress is very linear. There are several decisions that may lead to consequences, but they mostly feel unnecessary and irritating. The execution should have been done in a better way when it comes to the journey. If the title were to follow the conventional RPG-style, it should have considered how not to make the journey non-linear and find a way to develop more interactions with characters.It is a great piece nontheless in terms of art, but I cannot simply recommend to general audience			"

												The Banner Saga is a game that has 2 things. And interesting take on turn based combat, and a well written story. It also has feels. Depending on how you play, you might not end up with many feels, but you should be warden. They are there, and there bad.I should also point out that the game has more story choice than combat. I think there are maybe 10-15 times you fight, more deepening on your own choices. That’s the nice thing about this game. Its an RPG at its core. Not a RPG in the normal since, but one in terms of story. You roleplay how you want your whole game to play out simply from your choices.  You make a choice early on in the game, and it might come back to bite you or benefit you latter on, so choices DO matter, even if you think it wont, it dose. TL;DNT:DEM FEELS. 11/10 IGN "

												It's a beautiful, gloomy thing is this. The world is ending. You never seem to have quite enough food (and when you do, someone tries to steal it from you), you're under constant attack from angry Aztec stone people and the plot has a rather wonderful habit of killing off your favourite characters.The turn-based fightin' is solid, if a little repetitive due to there being, what feels like at least, only 3 or 4 types of unit for each of the games three races. Each one splits into 3 or so more subtypes, but one annoying slinger unit is much like another. My only real problem with it is that heroes have to get the killing blow in order to be eligable for levelling up, which puts you off using support classes or characters acquired late in the game. Alright, I have 2 other problems: the ""continue fighting"" mechanic in some battles gives no impression what you're going to be up against next, sometimes sending multiple hulking brutes out to meet your already bloodied party, othertimes just a couple of bits of trash and there's an ability gained a good ways in that is really good for accidentally damaging your own team with -it'd be good if the game was a bit better at saving me from my own stupidity there.Somewhat inevitably, when forced to choose between your (somewhat invisible and faceless) fighters/refugees and the needs of your heroes who you actually play as. it's pretty easy to shrug off the starving peasants and take the loot and level-ups. This doesn't mean the game doesn't through plenty of hard decisions at you (it seems to favour pragmatism with a dash of unsentimental hopefulness). The writing is good enough that most of the time things actually feel like your fault, rather than the script/RNG trying to make you feel bad.I'm rather looking forward to the rest of this, since the story ends in a nice place, but with plenty of questions still unanswered.

The soundtrack is both haunting and relaxing but manages to build tension in the right moments.  If I didn't know better I would say this was a game made from a film by a A level studio.  If you like turn based or Viking style mythos or games that play rough with you as a player then spring for this one because it does all of those exeptionally well.  There is just enough different about the combat mechanic to keep it interesting for old timers in the genre as well.  Buy it!			"

												Imagine playing Dark Souls, but instead of testing your fighting skills, the game randomly decides if you live or die. And instead of respawning at the Bonfire, you get sent all the way back to the begginning of the game. This is what this game feels like.There's no way to recover an earlier save. made a decision that devs randomly decides they don't like and your characters died. I want them back and I can't reload. Did the devs seriously expect me to go back and play THE ENTIRE GAME all over again to get the perfect ending?Hell by then I might not even remember what happened. I might end up making the same mistakes again. There's no logic either. Nothing is explained to you. Everything fees like just a roll of dice. How was I supposed to know helping a Varl with his cart will get him killed? Or listening to the Witch's advice will get her burned alive? Am I supposed to just remember every decision by heart? Is this what this game is? A storybook adventure that forces you to restart at the beginning everytime you lose a wrong, random roll of dice?This game is awful. This is the 2010's. Why do we still have this kind of draconian design?I was preparing for the sequel, which I pre-ordered. And now I remember how much I hated this game when I bought it a few years back for disempowering me at every possible turn. Pretty sure I rage quit the first time around when I realized I couldn't reload to save my guys. I don't pay to get punished. Gaming is meant to be fun.I want to support indie game developers, But why do you feel the need to punish players like this?			"

												I had this game on my watch list for some time, but never actually committed to buying it because, although the reviews were quite good, it just seemed too much of an odd-ball game to commit to. Boy was I wrong. Just goes to show you that you don't need graphics card choking high-end visuals and state of the art 3D to make a stellar game. The folks at Stoic have proven that a good epic story, combined with decision making that gives you very unexpected outcomes, and an Archon chess like combat system, (Google it!) can actually be uncannily entertaining. The graphics, although 2D in nature are put to exceptional and very creative use, to give a visually rich playing environment. Music is excellent and ties in well with the mood of the game, although a little more voice acting would have been a nice touch. Play it on normal and you are sure to be challenged, and at times just a bit frustrated, but in a good way. I was able to start playing it on my high end Windows PC, and then finish it on my 4 year old MacBook Air, with no change in look or even performance. Steam’s Cloud synchronization even gave me the ability to just continue playing where I left off. A true gaming outlier that will not disappoint. Enjoy.			"

												Unfortunately, I can't recommend The Banner Saga. I had high hopes though, and maybe my expectations were too high. Positives: - Interesting art style- Cool storyNegatives:- Fairly mindless combat. Don't expect a FF Tactics or deep strategy- Pointless, long cut scenes of the caravan walking- Most decisions don't seem to make much of an impact. Most of them are annoying- The battles are either all too easy or too hard- There isn't a good balance when it comes to resources. Everything is purchased with the same resource			"

												The Banner Saga is a step in the right direction for strategy games, with a very deep system revolving around just a few equally important stats. With each stat and each class feeding into one another, no stat or class is without its merit and there is no wrong way to build your team, though there are certainly plenty of opportunities to use them incorrectly. The game is so finely tuned that any misstep can send you inexorably down the wrong path during battle. If you are looking for a well-polished, challenging, strategy game with beautiful art and animations, this is the game for you!			"

												Good game, but could've been better but not for the bs ""consequences of your action"" that killed off some of your heroes if you're not creaful.I was looking for how to kill the final boss and I found some salty people saying that it was too hard to beat him, it's true and it lessens the good impression about the game for some people, not me cause I got lucky after being salty and went online searching for how to beat the boss, lol.Too many heroes and types of hero, if you're the one who choose to avoid combat then at the end of the game, you probably would have experienced all types of hero, not even a full team of your favorite heroes at lvl5, therefore it makes the final boss hard to kill, but it doesn't mean that a full team of lvl 5 heroes will make it any easier.No fast forward when the caravan is moving, make it more immersive for me but sometimes annoying because I wanted the caravan to move faster, especially when I'm out of suply and keep losing my people and I didn't want to see that.7/10, waiting for a sale to try out The Banner Saga 2, got this game from a bundle, heard it was good so I kept it and it was the right choice, you should try it out too, it's a good game.

												The Banner Saga is something special. The music, writing, and art all come together to make an experience that feels genuine, beautiful, and engaging. The story is very interesting, and it had me baying for more even after the end. This alone was enough to make me enjoy the experience.In terms of gameplay, a lot of the game comes down to managing supplies and making decisions on your journey, punctuated by turn-based tactical combat. There are a lot of interesting decisions to be made, and the travel aspect feels like a much prettier, much more interesting version of The Oregon Trail. Worry about who's been stealing supplies, keeping morale up, whether you should save the people of a village considering it means more mouths to feed, decide if the fighters on the road are actually who they say they are... all with a looming threat trailing too close behind and no guarantee of safety. I found myself getting stressed about how far we had to go to get to the next town, as my supplies were running low and people started to die of starvation.The Banner Saga, as an overall experience, is very much worthwhile. It is a story worth telling, paired with the music and art necessary to tell it effectively, and gameplay to make you feel like a part of that story. It is not a game you want to miss out on.			"

												This game would be very short, if you didnt spend 6 hours watching lazily animated guys walk by large rocks slowly.I was very excited by the combat mechanics, which are fun and great.  The Combat is a great concept, with a simple but interesting take on the do less damage when injured concept.  The choices in the game are all set, so there is no replayability, but these choices do not make you feel like you are even in the group, since the outcomes are often unrelated or problems that should have been avoided.  Then there is a badly designed boss battle, and choosing one of two characters to sacrifice. The game ends.  there is no resolution, it is just setting up for a sequel to a game that was not long enough, and not compelling enough.  Pros+great art in battle+cool world setting+Fun battle system+varied classes+multiple winning strategiesCons-Choices are not fulfilling in any way (no reward for most choices)-Reused walking animations playing for hours-End battle mechanic is stupid, just attack the boss and no other enemy can move.-Ends abruptly when it was priced as a full game not the first part of a 3 part miniTLDRWhile the battles redeem it somewhat, the other mistakes made in making this game bring it down pretty bad.

												It's a beautiful, gloomy thing is this. The world is ending. You never seem to have quite enough food (and when you do, someone tries to steal it from you), you're under constant attack from angry Aztec stone people and the plot has a rather wonderful habit of killing off your favourite characters.The turn-based fightin' is solid, if a little repetitive due to there being, what feels like at least, only 3 or 4 types of unit for each of the games three races. Each one splits into 3 or so more subtypes, but one annoying slinger unit is much like another. My only real problem with it is that heroes have to get the killing blow in order to be eligable for levelling up, which puts you off using support classes or characters acquired late in the game. Alright, I have 2 other problems: the ""continue fighting"" mechanic in some battles gives no impression what you're going to be up against next, sometimes sending multiple hulking brutes out to meet your already bloodied party, othertimes just a couple of bits of trash and there's an ability gained a good ways in that is really good for accidentally damaging your own team with -it'd be good if the game was a bit better at saving me from my own stupidity there.Somewhat inevitably, when forced to choose between your (somewhat invisible and faceless) fighters/refugees and the needs of your heroes who you actually play as. it's pretty easy to shrug off the starving peasants and take the loot and level-ups. This doesn't mean the game doesn't through plenty of hard decisions at you (it seems to favour pragmatism with a dash of unsentimental hopefulness). The writing is good enough that most of the time things actually feel like your fault, rather than the script/RNG trying to make you feel bad.I'm rather looking forward to the rest of this, since the story ends in a nice place, but with plenty of questions still unanswered.

The soundtrack is both haunting and relaxing but manages to build tension in the right moments.  If I didn't know better I would say this was a game made from a film by a A level studio.  If you like turn based or Viking style mythos or games that play rough with you as a player then spring for this one because it does all of those exeptionally well.

												As I started playing this game I had extremely high hopes.However, as I started progressing through the game alot of aspests arised, especially being a huge fan of strategical turn based RPGs.Pros:1) Interesting art, beautiful visual aspects that reminsce of old folk tales and Nordic history. 2) Average soundtrack which varies throughout the game. Cons:1) Your thrown into a story line with no explanation of whats going on, with names thrown around like you have read a 10000 page novel knowing whos who.2) Extremely repetitive play style with taking obscure decisions that randomly vary the outcome.3) Very mediocre fighting system, and outbalanced play style.4) No strategical aspect to fighting system. 5) No depth to characters which also seem to betray or leave your party with no premade decisions that effect the game.6) Extremely boring.7) Worse turn based fighting style I have experienced, which reflect on the number of players on the map. All in all I thought the game was a big disappointment.			"

												This game is a bug fest.  Bought it because it looks cool and they added it on to Linux.  Thing is, it is only half-butt added on.  It seems the whole games technical side is like that.  I mean the game itself is nice if you can it to work for you.  Check the bugs thread and see what you think.My little bug makes all the text blocks of color.  The only solutions I've seen is the did you update your video driver crap.  No I just use video drivers from 10 years ago.  Reminds me of the Windows 95 days.  Yeah I was gaming then too.  Every time you bought a game you got to pay 50 bucks to see if it would even work.  When you contacted technical support all they could ever tell you is update your drivers and good luck, but back then only half the games worked anyway. Standards were all over the place and still evolving. Today most games work no problem.  Like most of the 100+ games for Linux I own that are fine.  In other words is my system really the problem or is it maybe something else?  I think this is just one of those games that is too buggy overall for the developers to catch up with and fix it all.  Therefore, not recomended.  I will reinstall in a year and see what they have managed to do.			"

												One the best games I played in the last years, TBS took me on an emotional roller coaster. When there were sudden plot developments I gasped in shock, I got goosebumps when the plot tensed up and at the end I felt like crying.Anyone that's not a 12 year old COD kiddo and can still enjoy games with no realistic ( not saying its not great, but it's obviously drawn ) high-end graphics and actions over action ( assuming it needs lots of explosions and gunfire, crashing helicopters and car races to be consideres action ) I dearly recommend you to buy this game. Peace.			"

												The battles are few, the beautiful cutscense few, you will spend more time watching your wagon travel from left to right or right to left with some choices that doesn't affect the game overall. If you like Fire Emblem, Disgea, Front Mission 4 and hope to play similiar games, avoid this one. You will play it once or twice and not give a damn later.			"

												Short version: mediocre at best, I highly recommend to not buy it.Explenation:It basically is an turn based strategy game with an okay-ish Fight system and a small amount of lvling.. Not too much there.The game is about making decisions in game that truly affect nothing but a few numbers, it is almost impossible to lose this game.. It switches you around to different perspectives at seemingly no reason at all and makes you really not attached to the characters at all whom you have no control of where they go or what they do.. Suddenly you end up doing a battle with people you never even leved up and it messes up your whole strategy.I really dont think it is worth that much money, I dont really like the music (Sounds like some Viking folk cover without the good parts) and the story is pretty much: Stone people attack us that flee from darkness and now attack humans and giants.. Nothing is explained really well and the game ends suddenly leaving you wondering what the ♥♥♥♥ you spent your money on.I played through it in ~10h, didnt enjoy much of it.. The decisions you make really dont change anything..  "

												I like to play RPG's, dont get me wrong. i bought this game a long time ago, and booted it up, and ive only played it once or twice. each time i play it, i try and tell myself ""Maybe it gets better"" or ""Maybe ill like t this time"", but each time i end up bored, uninterested, and unimpressed. There was way too much hype for this game from the community. This game is more like a story book then it is a game. Infact, its so text driven that you could probablly catagorize it as a text based adventure game and no body would notice the difference. its extremely boring, and it has an equally uninteresting storyline and gameplay. it actually annoys me that i even spent money on this game in the first place.

												Personally, I think it's severely overrated.  Great artwork, sure.  But as a choice-based story... you're seldom given enough background info to understand your options, which is just as well because the consequences of your choices are often unclear AFTER you make them.   Important points on which the plot hinges, like the deaths of certain characters, may happen no matter what choices you make to prevent them.  Combat was also severly frustrating.  Power isn't effectively balanced between party members or against enemies.  Skills are downright wimpy.  Characters are capable of dealing less damage as the battle continues, so things can crawl to a standstill,  like when only two kings are left on a chessboard.Anyway, lots of people like this game, so don't let my review get you down.  But if you're on the fence, I would at least wait for a sale.			"

												I have not yet completed this game, so bugger off if you're one of those people who want reviews from the start to finish. Once you finish this sentence it is assumed you're okay with slightly less than a complete picture.The Banner Saga is a neat little game with a lot of interesting ideas. I won't go too much into the story because at least half of it seems to be about name-dropping fifty thousand royal family members and feudal lords, a thing that always makes my eyes glaze over. The gameplay itself is fairly engaging if slow-paced at times -- once you've acclimated to the game's charming art style and am no longer impressed by its visual wonders, you will be wishing for a fast-forward button. A big chunk of the game is spent worrying about certain logistical problems that rarely come up in other games that involve armies, like keeping the men fed and watered and not♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at you. This is what it means to be a leader! It feels a little bit Oregon Trail-like, but Oregon Trail was fun and this game has four-plus decades on it and a tactical battle system to boot. What can go wrong?Well...Whatever positive traits The Banner Saga may have are overshadowed by the looming spectre of its♥♥♥♥♥backwards turn-based tactics mode wherein the losing side becomes more and more powerful the worse it does. Since this is a single player game and therefore the player is required to always be winning in order to progress, this means you will always be at a major disadvantage. How it works is each side in a battle alternates turns moving a single unit designated by the game. This sounds reasonable until you realize that if you outnumber an enemy six-to-two, those two enemy units will be able to act three times for every one action your own units can take. Starting enemy positions always seem deliberately designed to force you to split your forces, which means most of your turns will be spent moving units into attack range while the AI leisurely picks off the units you'd like to attack with but the game has arbitrarily decided must wait until they have finished their mid-battle meal or whatever. The result is a cruel manifestation of the Law of Conservation of Ninjitsu that will regularly punish you until you learn to work with it.Once you've adapted to the battle system's particular brand of moon logic you'll be gaming the system like a champ, devising strange new strategies no competent tactical game would ever require. I still cannot recommend The Banner Saga. Violating logic and common sense in your employ of tactics is all well and good but when a game otherwise takes itself so seriously it feels strange to have such an obviously video game-y element sitting in the middle taking up half the sofa. I will probably finish the game at some point but I feel uncomfortable having to put all my clothes on inside out before being invited into The Banner Saga's treehouse.			"

												Vikings in an tactical, turn-based RPG? WINI was expecting a solid and enjoyable game when I heard that a few former Bioware employees turned their backs on EA to provide us RPG fans with an experience we won't forget too soon. As it turned out, this is my favourite game of this year so far.Even though I enjoyed every aspect of the game, I am well aware that it won't appeal to everybody by its' text driven storytelling and scarce, yet quite beautiful, animations. For someone who lacks the imagination or has a hard time of following the story only by text rather than fancy cutscenes it might be the wrong product. I too had some problems with diving into it at the beginning, but once I got used to it it felt like a virtual adventure book enriched by a beautiful scenery, interesting, yet sometimes stereotypical, characters and an incredible soundtrack which sets the mood for every scene and intensifies the games' atmosphere in an astounding way. The game itself consists of two game aspects which complement one another quite well. The first one is the tactical turn based combat and is provided with a good variety of different characters/classes and, in my opinion, good balanced and fleshed out mechanics. Each and every unit on the battlefield has five attributes which bring important utility to the fight. The most important are  strength and  armor. Armor mitigates the received damage by the amount of armour your unit had and strength determines the amount of damage your character can dish out. But there is a catch, your points in strength are also your hit points which means if a character gets hurt, his damage diminishes for the same amount. The same rules count for your enemies as well. The third attribute is break and defines how much armor you are able to crush with an armor breaking attack. To explain this, there are three types of offensive actions, a standard attack which attacks the strenght of your opponent, a crushing attack which focuses your targets' armour and a special ability, each class has its own, which provide a special effect. And the last two attributes are willpower and exertion, the first one provides a pool of points which can be spent on your attacks to deal more damage or on one of your abilities. The latter defines how much willpower can be spend per turn. A big, but only, downside of the tactical combat is the lack of obstacles on the battlefields.The second part of the game is the strategic layer and forces you to manage your caravan and warriors. On your journey you will be confronted with various moral choices which could endanger the safety of your people. The most important part is to keep the moral of your fellowship raised, your food supply steady and your warriors healthy, but often those goals will be very conflicting and it is your job to find a good balance.All in all it is one damn fine polished ""indie"" experienced and only the first of three chapters of this saga, with the second part already on its way.

												This game would be very short, if you didnt spend 6 hours watching lazily animated guys walk by large rocks slowly.I was very excited by the combat mechanics, which are fun and great.  The Combat is a great concept, with a simple but interesting take on the do less damage when injured concept.  The choices in the game are all set, so there is no replayability, but these choices do not make you feel like you are even in the group, since the outcomes are often unrelated or problems that should have been avoided.  Then there is a badly designed boss battle, and choosing one of two characters to sacrifice. The game ends.  there is no resolution, it is just setting up for a sequel to a game that was not long enough, and not compelling enough.  Pros+great art in battle+cool world setting+Fun battle system+varied classes+multiple winning strategiesCons-Choices are not fulfilling in any way (no reward for most choices)-Reused walking animations playing for hours-End battle mechanic is stupid, just attack the boss and no other enemy can move.-Ends abruptly when it was priced as a full game not the first part of a 3 part miniTLDRWhile the battles redeem it somewhat, the other mistakes made in making this game bring it down pretty bad.

												The Banner Saga is a game that has 2 things. And interesting take on turn based combat, and a well written story. It also has feels. Depending on how you play, you might not end up with many feels, but you should be warden. They are there, and there bad.I should also point out that the game has more story choice than combat. I think there are maybe 10-15 times you fight, more deepening on your own choices. That’s the nice thing about this game. Its an RPG at its core. Not a RPG in the normal since, but one in terms of story. You roleplay how you want your whole game to play out simply from your choices.  You make a choice early on in the game, and it might come back to bite you or benefit you latter on, so choices DO matter, even if you think it wont, it dose. TL;DNT:DEM FEELS. 11/10 IGN "

												I liked the story and the characters and found the combat to be engauging. What holds back the game is entirely the final boss, up until then i was thinking ""i might even play a second playthrough"", only to have that crushed at the end. The final bosses ability to 1 shot units and regenerating health and armor are flawed in that he regens them when its his turn to move, so the more units you kill the harder he is to kill and the more likely he is to kill your units. What makes him even more frustrating is the story element to the last fight so you cant kill the boss outright and deal with his minions later. The final boss is incredibly frustrating and forced me to reduce the difficulty to easy to stop him from 1 shotting people. Everything said and done theres definentally more story coming and so far ive liked it.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. The settings, art style and music are all great......but then we come to combat - not fun, clunky, not to mention the supplies + upgrade mechanic is tedious and completely destroys the fun factor. I actually love 'difficult' games, but this game is trying to be difficult and fun at the same time, but it's mostly frustrating and that is why I simply cannot recommend it.			"

Overall, this is a good game if you enjoy the artistry of a game and an interesting plot albeit you do not control your destiny for the most part.  Combat system, good.  Length, bad.  Magic and non-realism, bad.  Realism, good.  Interesting plot, good.  Replayability, average.  Price for what you get, slightly below average.  5.9 / 10.			"

												Well, the game has beautiful art style. The game mechanics is simple, but interesting, and tactical part is good enough for passing the game three times. The most part of story is good, except some very strange dialogs. May be russian localization problem, there is not sense between sentences in some of them.The main characters are well written. Gunnulf is the best! Or stop, he isn't main. Don't matter, Gunnulf is the best!So, some of other characters is pretty good too.The game has a lot of events and ""moral choices"". Thanks universe, all of it affect gameplay or I just want to believe in it.So yes, I recomend this game.But the game has one significant fail. I mean the latest choice. And It is absolutely implausible.	Of course, every loving father wants see how his daughter dies. No doubts.This choice ruins everything: the character, the logic (I had another two archers at this moment,  one of them was the best in this story ) and evolution theory. It is so ""Bioware"" style.			"

												(Didn't complete game)Things I liked- GraphicsThings I didn't like- The story did nothing for me- I felt nothing for the characters- Conversations between characters was dull- Combat was basically me walking over to the enemy and clicking basic attack until they died. I was never outnumbered or came close to dying. Tactics were unnecessary, as were characters' unique abilities- Difficulty was way too easyI was looking forward to playing this game but was unable to get into it due to slow battles. I persevered but there just came a time when I was dreading launching the game as I knew I was in for an hour of tedious boredom. "

Get it if you have a good rig and know how to troubleshoot, otherwise check it out on another platform.			"

												Prior to its release I had already logged a fair number hours in Banner Saga: Factions and I was pretty excited for Banner Saga to drop. There was so much that Stoic had done right with Factions: The artwork was beautiful, the setting and thematic design was origanal and refreshing, the combat engine was decent and the rudementary leveling system showed promise of creating a wide range of tactical options.But the key here is that I enjoyed Factions because it did a good job of challenging me to think creatively about solving strategic and tactical problems. As I acquired new assets I got to play around with new and different approaches to certain classes of problems and as my opponents matured I had to constantly adapt to every new challenge they threw at me. Every time I logged in it was dynamic, it was fresh and it was fun.I wish that this review didn't have to be a simple thumbs up/thumbs down. There is still so much good stuff that Stoic has brought to the table with this release. The world that they create is captivating and the artwork is exceptional. When it comes down to it though I just can't say that this game is the game I had hoped it would be... It just isn't fun.There are too many constraints. The developers have over emphasized the story in this release and there just isn't any reason to pick this game up again after you've beaten it. Too often, when they stop to try to give you the illusion you have a choice there really is no choice: certain actions just don't pay off and too often there is always a right answer. In reality this isn't so much a game as it is a storybook.I sincerely hope that the developers get back to what they had done right with Factions and develope that further. As far as I'm concerned I'm not interested in pursuing this series any further.			"

												Stratey turn-based games is my thing, I mean I'm a Street Fighter kind of guy at heart, but I also play Hearthstone. Whatever that means, this indie game is worthy of my criti-c/que, and I wouldn't even bother writing this for a waste of time game. This is a masterpiece playable form of art, that grows with you each combat, pillage after pillage. Obviously like most games nowadays, you can level, upgrade, gain experience quicker if you choose to enhance via the payment route. However, I'm okay with purchasing the legit copy of The Banner Saga, due to this funding, it's possible for indie developers like them, Stoic, to continue to provide us with their remarkable talent, with this magic that makes me want to go out chaunting my underdog warchant cry battle after battle, sometimes I get hammered, but I learn from each opponent face to face experience.The ""Soundtrack"" is mesmerizing. A must for the genre!Christopher Doryan			"

Everything else is very sub-par like combat, characters, gameplay generally. Filled with artificial hindrances, ""hardcore features"" and not much variation. Story ends up being pretty much go here, oh snap its destroyed, go there instead, oh look a big worm and babby bad guy. Fails to deliver for me at least. Appeared so beautiful and interesting in the first place. After playing, it was just bad. Took ages to finish because it just wasn't that good.			"

It is part 1 in a trilogy so the ending is a big cliff hanger.It has a similarity to Orgen trail, with war on the side. Battles are fought in a tactics style, all parties are viable when used correctly, Unlike most games that claim your actions will affect the story this one actually does.Solid recommendation as the first awesome game of 2014.

												Well I picked up this game for 25 dollars (which is the price of the proffesional specialized killstreak wrench I found) and the main reason why I got it was because I enjoyed FTL (which is a cute little spaceship similator roguelike) and this game looked quite like FTL. Which was not the case at all. Anyways, on with the review.Story and Character interaction:The first thing I noticed was how pretty the art was and how nice the travelling sequences looked, and that it seemed to have quite a focus on story and character development, however, there werent many cutscenes and alot of the story was played out though japan style visual novel thingys BUT (gasp) with pannable background!!!!!Similar to FTL, text based events, when traveling from a city to another city, seem to not have that big of an impact except on resources and caravan size (youre usually traveling with 500+ people unless they all die of starvation) and when youre going to fight and how youre going to fight (which might give you the advantage in combat or make the fight easier)The thing I like though is how the narrative started out with two different perspectives and finally showed them meeting each other at the end (which I knew was going to happen from the start -_-)Combat:The next thing that I noticed, was that when you lose guys in combat, they dont actually die and only go unconcious for a couple days before you can use them at their full strength again. SO HOW DO YOU LOSE CHARACTERS THAT YOU LIKE AND ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT!!?!??!? WELL UM THEY DIE IN TEXT BASE EVENTS WOOOOThe combat system is really crappy too, so let me explain it, its like the other turn base combat systems where you move and then the enemy moves, however, during your move, you can only move one guy at once!!! wooooSo if they have one ultra strong guy you cant gang up on him and he kills all your semi strong heros at once!!! YEEEE luckily this game avoids this (except in the last boss fight) where if there is one guy left you enter ""pillage"" mode, where all your guys move at once before the enemy can move (the enemy also can enter pillage mode if you only have one guy left)So whats the problem? oh yeah if the enemy has two guys left, like a high armor high health person and an archer then you cant gang up on them with your 6 guys at half health because in this game health = attack power which doesnt make sense, attack power should stay constant and maybe if they wanted to similate your guys being tired after being wounded just drop the attack power drastically after a certain threshold of health or something and that guy with the high armor and the archer kills everyone left.This actually makes it so you shouldnt kill the 1 health archer because he cant damage your high armor characters but sometimes you need to kill them in order to gain willpower for your heros (which allows them to do special moves) to kill the big guys.One positive of the combat was how each ""class"" of hero (you can only do combat with your heros while your 800 archers go do something else) was very diverse and playing around with them was niceConclusion:The end of the game is really bad, and unresolved, but pretty emotional ;_____;Luckily this game is going to be released in three parts (which you dont have to pay extra for [hopefully >:(]) so the creators will always have time to redeem themself and fix the crappy combat systemTL:DR, buy it only after the next two parts come out			"

												Banner Saga sports a animation and color vibrancy that reminds me of Bahski's Lord of the Rings. The art style is a very strong draw in a time where camo, greys and washed out colors are the standard.Along with the great art style it has a fairly decent story riding along with it, there are a few ""Oregon Trail"" like decisions you have to make along the course of the story and people you can lose but all this adds to what draws you into the game. Combat is grid style like your XCOM, Ogre Tactics etc it plays rather nicely as units each have capabilities which combined can decimate you enemy in a matter of minutes or if used poorly have the same high powered team defeated or leave the field barely intact.Specifc artstyle, gameplay and musical score which you never really notice while all three are in motion but sounds pretty epic on it's own.4 out of 5 Chiliwigs			"

												Fun and challenging, but with simple enough mechanics that anyone could play it. Easily one of my favourite games I've ever played. Love the characters, love the stories, legitimately felt  worried with some of the choices I had to make and how they'd affect my favourites. Would recommend this game to anyone. The only criticism I have is pretty light but they could have voice acted all the dialogue scenes since none of the names are customizable and everything in the game happens within the perview of what's been written by the team but I understand it's easier and much cheaper to just do text so I get it.Honestly one of my favourite games.

												This is the first game in 10 years that envoked any real feeling of ""nerves"" in me. Somehow, the longer I fought and the more intense the story got, I began to really fear the dredge. I was worried about my caravan and it's members, and really got to the point of ""holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm actually really nervous and invested in this game"". I have no idea how a 2D game has immersed me more than anything else I've ever played, but it did it for me.			"

												This game is Amazing. Graphics are nice and artistic, decisions will cost or help you, and the fights are can be challenging. This is everything I want in an immersive RPG that's turn based. Plot is interesting, character dynamics are well done, and long playstyle only adds to the mounting intensity. This is a must have for any RPG players looking for a challenging but rewarding game. The game also offers Cross Platform support including Linux (not many do) and its very easy to pick up and quit if you have other priorities. On top of that the Designers and Developers are funding this game and you'll know you're helping support them and future games to come instead of a large company like EA or Ubisoft (Not that their games are bad). Definitely good game and I support the Developers!			"

												Would recommend this game to anyone who likes roleplaying games and anyone who likes dragon age and skyrim. it is a very lore rich game with really good music and the hand drawn art style is immaculate. the random encounters are good because it's never obvious which is the right answer and one wrong move can leave you on very low morale and no supplies and you have to crawl a long for a few days until you hit a town then spend most of your renown on food rather than levelling up your heroes which are all  very diverse and interesting. Combat is easy to get to grips with though can get a bit unfair towards the end. (written before testing the balance update.)			"

												I don't understand what's wrong. But the game keep making error at many battles. As example when Vognir died and Ludin had to face dredge brute, the brute didn't finish Ludin in one shot (as it happened in my first game) and then the battle just stay still like for hours. Just now at the day 16 after leaving (sorry I forget the village name) I decided to hunt several dredge going to Strand, I felled all of the dredge, but the battle didn't proceed. The battle simply didn't ended and my characters can only move around and do nothing. Is the problem occured only to me? I really love playing this game, but these experiences kinda bugging me to keep playing it. :(			"

The combat is thoughtful and interesting, the upgrade system is in-depth with plenty of options to build your choice of party.Well worth picking up both games for full price. The art style and some of the caravan scenes are just outright beautiful with your warband passing over some amazing landscapes and set pieces. Play this then transfer your save (and all decisions/items/upgrades) to Banner Saga 2. I can't wait for the third game and I'd gladly donate money to the devs to make it as great an ending to a fabulous series as possible.			"

												The Banner Saga is masterful cross between Oregon Trail and XCOM, with emphasis on the former.  It was developed by former BioWare developers that were funded via Kickstarter, and both these features show.Right away, the level and quality of the animation is top-notch.  Combined with the music and sound design, I half-wish that the developers had just opted to make a long movie or multi-part series instead of a game.  I feel comfortable saying this because while the world is one I want to explore, there's no exposition.  Most characters give their entire story upon meeting them, and only one or two really reveal anything new by the end.  The dialogue they have and the friction between some heroes causes a story, but it's all leudo-narrative that eventually amounts to nothing.There are three ways in which gameplay exists.  The trail, via decisions, dialogue at places you visit, and in battle.  The first two occupy the same vein perhaps, or one is the vein and the other the artery - both serving the same funciton in different way - but they require different mindsets.  The battles are fine, but the system they have is flimsy.  I fully expect a rework of the battle mechanics in their sequel which has been announced.  All units have health and armor.  Taking a hit to your health reduces your damage, and damage is calculated by first considering armor, then the difference in health.  Units have special abilities that you never fully utilize.  The game is over before you can take advantage of everyone, and you might end up leveling across the board instead of specific characters.  However, each battle was exhilerating from the onset, and I did get better at predicting things over time.  There's just no way to anticipate each battle before hand, as there are too many random factors.  You have to decide which troops you're using before you see the placement of the battlefield or even what you're facing.  That's fine for a game like XCOM where this is negated by varying battlefields and cover, but The Banner Saga doesn't have this.I'm very interested in playing the sequel to this game.  I feel it'll be done much, much better than the first.  All things considered, if you're a fan of strategy games akin to XCOM and enjoy a game where you decisions have a direct impact on the gameplay, but not the story, this is right up your alley.			"

												I am on the border of not recommending this game for one reason: the story/choice portions are incredibly arbitrary.  They present a scenario which you must make a choice about.  The choice you make often has nothing to do with the outcome of the scenario, and most of them don't make sense.  Members of your party just randomly die.  If the choices made some sense, and the writing was improved, it might not be as frustrating.  Unfortunately, the writing is purposefully tricky and mean.  The scenarios do not serve to improve the story or deepen the characters.  It is like playing Dungeons and Dragons with a DM that wants to make tense or moving scenes, but just comes off as mean and awkward when they kill your character.Other than that, the game is a good bit of fun.  The art is gorgeous.  The scenarios are interesting.  The world is intriguing; I want to know more.			"

The visuals and soundtrack alone are worth the purchase, but this game also delivers on its skill-tree and battle system. Also, I've made some bad decisions in Hard mode, and I'm definitely feeling the consequences, so be warned!It's refreshing to see this kind of caliber come out of an ""Indie"" game studio, and it couldn't have come at a better time.

												A really wonderful game with pretty graphics, wonderful music and an ACTUAL PLOT/STORY!!!The gamplay is a mix of Oregon Trail and Blood Bowl.  You actually care about the characters, try to make morale choices while keeping your peeps alive and the choices in battle will make or break you.One minor complaint -- While the story is great, it's a Viking lore.  It's a little hard to take on at first because it's like BeoWulf on meth, but once you stop trying to pronounce certain names, you'll be good.			"

												I highly recommend buying this, especially if you are on the edge while it's on sale.This is a fun, well-polished strategy game, has an interesting story, and looks gorgeous. I have almost no gripes about it, truly enjoyed playing through it a couple times with different character decisions.			"

												The Banner Saga's biggest missed opportunity, in my opinion, is with the combat system. It's a very bare-bones system that adds nothing significant to the genre, and begins to feel quite repititive as you progress through the game and often repeat battles due to the game's high difficulty.                  It's functional and all, but overall just feels competent at best, and ultimately disappoints, as a stronger combat system could really have propelled The Banner Saga into the realms of the greats. But overall, it's a solid debut effort from Stoic, and if you're a fan of this genre, is worth checking out once the price drops a bit.The Nitty GrittyVisuals You've seen my videos, right? If not, I invite you to scroll to the bottom and lavish in all that hand-drawn magnificence. The Banner Saga is, hands down, one of the prettiest I've seen in recent history. You'd think that Stoic would take every opportunity to showcase precisely how masterful their art team might be but they don't. The jaw-dropping graphics, which are evocative of 60s' Disney animations, are deployed with the precision of a brain surgeon. There's an attention to detail that makes me want to sit and drink in every frame. Embroideries are never just squiggles on the cloth, they're meticulously written into the fabric. Rings are obviously but understatedly ornate, horns embossed with the passage of a varl's years. (Bonus points: Stoic Studios didn't go for the low-hanging fruit by adding buxom Viking barmaids. The women? Happily realistic-looking. Kudos, fellas.)Music and Sound A fun fact: I ordinarily play with games muted. I don't know why. I just do. Call it habit. I used to own a laptop with a busted sound card for the longest time. Yet, The Banner Saga's soundtrack had me so smitten I kept the game on for background music even when I wasn't actively playing it. What's most fascinating about it is the simple fact that there is so little of it to speak of. Long periods of silence, broken only by the clang of metal or the howl of the blizzard, alternate with the swell of wind instruments. Like the graphics, the fully orchestral score, heavy with intent, is gorgeous but not overwrought.InterfaceThere's not really much to be said here outside of the fact that The Banner Saga plays out pretty much exactly you'd think something like this would: with the mouse functioning as your bridge to the world. Almost all of the sparse interface will be instantly familiar to anyone who has spent any amount of time with a video game. The only exception is the sometimes infuriating inability to change camera angles during battle.Pros> Rich and alluring lore> Mechanisms battle though simplistic, operate> Charming design and wonderful music> Those who lament the books-games will be delighted with the gameCons> Poor content and cuts to interpretation and interactivity with the game> Minimal character development> Imbalance in battle but also the evolution of the game> Preface Although reminiscent tutorial «normal» game.Worth the buy ? Yes, in my opinion it is for what you get.You can see my play through here :http:// bit.ly / TheYoutubeBannerEpisode 1 -

												Before even considering buying this game, I will give you a warning: If you got really interested in how the tactical battles were designed, you WILL be let down by the end of this game.While I can't blame the developers for the cliffhanger on the huge TEASE that was Banner's Saga 1, since they announced from the beginning that this game would be a trilogy. I can still complain about the way they handled tactical battles because that's one of my main grips about this game. Up until the end of the first game, almost every battle introduced a new mechanic, or some new tactic to use in battle. When I reached what I later found out to be the ending, I thought the tutorial was finally over, and the real interesting battles would begin, and that's what happened... for about 3 fights... then it ended... Come on.And ending like that felt like a huge♥♥♥♥♥♥block, and it ended looking like the entirety of Banner's Saga 1 was just a big tutorial for a new, better game. With that kind of approach, you have 2 options for a sequel, you can either:a) Begin a whole new tutorial for Banner's Saga 2, because maybe you added new features, maybe you have to take into account new players or people who waited several months to play the sequel and need to learn again. Alright, now we get another huge tutorial, that will probably end just as the game ends again, just like the first game, making people like me feel unsatisfied, orb) Start the game assuming people played the first game and know everyting about the tactics and gameplay. Alright, now your first game is just a huge unnanounced tutorial, diminishing all the value of the progress made in the first game. ""It was just a tutorial, stupid.""Both are not good ways to make the player feel satisfied with your gameplay. And that's sincerely what happened to me. I was completely let down by that in the first game, and can't bring myself to play the sequel, since they are probably using solution (a) or (b), and that's just bad. You have t make the gameplay of your game self-contained between games, while also giving the player a chance to really apply them, not give 2 tutorials, or make the entirety of the first game a huge tutorial.They may have had the best of intentions while developing the first game, but it still feels really crappy to do that, and I am amazed no one ever mentioned how the final battles felt really lackluster during the game's development.Oh, and if my play time didn't clue you in yet, this game is too shot for a tactical game. And since this is an episodical release, you have almost no reason to being a new game, unless you want to override your previous choices.			"

												Pretty disappointing. This game has a great premise and an interesting art style. However, the clumsy mechanics really ruin the experience. Combat is really bizarre - your group and the enemy group take turns, and neither you or your enemy get to choose which character to use. Damaged characters are less powerful. This leads to the best strategy in every situation being extremely counterintuitive and immersion-breaking: damage all enemies a little bit but don't kill them, and if you have a badly wounded unit you should do everything you can to get him killed ASAP so he doesn't waste your turns. Huh?			"

												Like their mulitplayer game, ""Banner Saga: Factions"", this single-player game was LOADED with potential to be awesome.  Unfortunately, it's not.Pros:+cool world/setting+gorgeous artistic/visual style+nice soundtrack+the plot/story seems interesting, but...Cons:- (the plot/story seems interesting, but...)...it's INCOMPLETE.  Gee, I sure wish I had known that ahead of time.  I mean, I wish I had known I was paying $25 for what seems like only half of a game.  The game just ends abruptly -- no closure, no cliffhangers, no build-up to a ""Part 2"", nothing...you're just playing the game, and then, BAM! the credits are rolling.  I remember thinking to myself ""Wait...WHAT?  Is this game glitching out here?  Why am I seeing the credits when I'm only halfway done with the game?  Shouldn't credits come at the end? This can't POSSIBLY be the end!""  To add insult to injury, the game's description fails to mention to the customer that they are only buying half a game; Likewise, I couldn't find anything on the game's website that mentions this either.  I guess the studio just conventiently ""forgot"" to tell us that.  Anyway, being charged $25 for an incomplete game left me feeling burned.  So don't buy this game unless it's AT LEAST 50% off since you are only getting 50% (or less?) of the game.-Although the premise of the story/plot seems really interesting, it is poorly executed.  The game is EXTREMELY linear...to the point where, as a player, I usually felt I was being totally railroaded.  Sure, there are plenty of choices to make along the way, but it often seems as if these have only a minor (if any) impact on the overall gameplay or story arc.  For example, ""Do you choose A or B? If you chooose A, one of your characters dies.  If you choose B, another one of your characters dies.  Basically, no matter what you choose, we are killing ONE of your characters right now!  Ready?""  Anyway, as you can imagine, that gets old pretty quickly.-Overall, the dialogue is poorly written.  In fact, it's laughably bad, at times...like something from a low-budget B-movie.-the combat system is pretty good, but not perfect.  It has a few obvious flaws, in my opinion, and it takes a bit of getting used to.  It can still be fun once you get the hang of it.So, in short, this game has tons of potential but the cons outweigh the pros.  I can't honestly recommend it, which is a shame because, like ""Banner Saga: Factions"", I really WANTED to like this game.  :(			"

												This is by far one of the most disappointing games I have ever played. This game should be 5 dollars instead of the current price tag. I couldn't even call this casual or indie because its even less than that. As a strategy game it lacks depth. It plays out a lot like oregon trail. You stop at the same looking repeated template towns a couple times and inbetween have lackluster fights with the same 4-6 people using the same moves. Food is almost meaningless aside from morale boost. Morale will give you more dmg and action points. The items are absolutely worthless. The story is terrible and extremely short. The only good thing I can say about this game is the art, and even that isn't that impressive. Do yourselves a favor and stay away from this title. You will only be disappointed. The story is maybe only 6-8 hours of gameplay and you are stuck at the end wondering, uhhhh was that it? Which has never before happened to me.			"

												I usually do not give a **** sharing negative reviews for bad games. this time is different.I really really would like to appreciate banner saga, there is a tangible effort by developers and artist behind this title.And when i got it i was full of hype and happiness.The game starts and i say ""wow what an epic game"".Then the first battle.Then the second and the third... well the fourth fifth and so on....Ok people, is a pain for me to say that but this game is simply BORING. Battle are slooooowwww, repetitive, and balanced in a bad way, some are a piece of cake, some others nearly impossible to win. Apart of the battle you may manage you caravan (good idea) and do some text-based RPG. stop.Art and sound are very good, atmospherical, the story seems (seems) deep and epic, and there is a well constructed sense of loneliless and despair that goes throught the entire game.But the game, is simple not funny to play, i found myself too many times saying ""oh no please please no not another encounter"" and inevitably closed it frustrated because if you play, you want to pass funny times i guess :)And simply the banner saga didn't give me that.Avoid it? No, certainly, you may like it for sure but do not expect too much, be prepared to play a slow, long title, that may offer you some good moments trapped, sadly, in a vast sea of boredom.			"

The claim of ""choices that affect your journey"" are limited to a small set of consequences that overall have very little impact on the game.  Picking a different choice may lose/gain some men or supplies but I've never once been in danger of losing the game.

But at less than 3 frames per minute it's simply unplayable and unbearable.  The lag is horrendous.DO NOT BUY IF YOU PLAN ON RUNNING LINUX VERSION - UNPLAYABLE DUE TO LAG.Not recommended.			"

												The game is well done, and mostly well written.  However, in my short 1 hour of play time, I encountered a major flaw.While in the second battle, the main character, Ubin, died.  When the battle ended, he shows up in the narration.  I don't know if the creators ever expected that to happen, but it sure broke the game for me.  The main character dies but shows up again as the story continues?Just for this one reason alone I cannot recommend this game.			"

												Wow, what a completely lame excuse for a game. 12 hours to play it through?!? Yeah, and a sizeable chunk of that time was watching ridiculous 2D animations of a caravan in a side-scrolling landscape - which, I might add served no real purpose other than to waste my time.The battles were interesting, from a turn-by-turn strategy sense, but there were far too few of them and they were not very challenging. They storyline was interesting, but without voice actors, it is just reading and I have much better books to read.All in all, I would not recommend this game to anyone - unless of course you enjoy short games that are tedious and not much fun.

												I hate to do this, but I have to say thumbs down. After experiencing the fantastic gameplay in the free multiplayer version, I was really looking forward to the single-player campaign. What a huge disappointment!The combat is still great, but everything else is mediocre to bad. You find yourself struggling against a game that gives you too little information, and you are constantly being arbitrarily punished for decisions whose ramifications often make very little sense. For example, apparently when you tell people they can join your caravan, it also means they have free access to your food supply and all the guards you posted earlier in the game get the night off for some reason.Even worse, it seems you are supposed to try to get to wherever the hell you're going (and you're given very little reason to care where that is, as you have ZERO agency in any of this, despite a bunch of silly choose-your-own-adventure questions) without losing too many clansmen, I guess?  But once again, it's really hard to care about saving these people since they are mostly just a number that starts to tick down when a fight goes badly or you run out of food.The writing itself could have used a firmly wielded editor's pen, both in the basic English and in the weak attempts at what I will call ""epic fantasy-speak."" You can tell what effect they were going for, but it all comes off looking shabby and lame because in the end it's just too obvious that it was all written by gamers, not professional writers.So I guess if you are willing to ignore all of the actual campaign bits that are supposed to hold together the campaign, maybe go ahead and get it for the interesting combat. But I'd definitely wait for a deep discount -- no sense paying for the bad parts you are better off ignoring.			"

												I genuinely expected to like this game based on strong reviews, beautiful art, RPG elements, and strategy combat elements. Sadly I just didn't enjoy it. The gameplay is sort of like Oregon Trail. Follow a predetermined path click through dialogue and click on options. If you can click on stuff and read, you are set for 80% of the game. It is overwhelmingly expository just telling you things rather than showing you.  The strategy combat is the best part of the game play, but that's not all that good either. Other than the incredible detailed artwork and a good bit of fairly well though out world building this feels like a free flash game, or something you'd play on your phone.			"

												*After finishing the first playthrough of the game, I have to say I was pretty moved. For such a short experience, it was quite emotional. I would have liked to have seen even more in combat, but for what it is, this is ABSOLUTELY worth adding to your collection if you're a Turn-Based Strategy fan or at least enjoy a well-written drama. There isn't much voice-over work, but I started a love for fantasy with novels or RPGs that barely had any sound, so I may have some bias.The art is wonderful and the animations, for being so simple, are just... I can't do it justice, it's like a graphic novel that comes off the pages.If this is still on sale and you're looking for a good piece of art to delve into for a while, don't miss your chance to pick this one up.

This game is for players whom: - Likes a good Story. - Are patient.- Knows how to appreciate atmosphere. - Likes the turn-based combatstyle and strategic decision making. - Likes fiction.Personally I loved this game and will without the slightest of doubt finish BS2 as well. What I am hoping for in the sequel is: - Less pointless Cavalry. - More dire consequences whenever you make decisions.  - Also I would love it if the Training gave you something more. It is simply boring and unnecessary as is.- Tiers in terms of improving items.- The addition of devastating battle moves that can make you kill even really tough enemies in one blow.- More Bosses, and mini-bosses.

												Your decisions have consequences. We see this a lot in video games. While many games bring this to life through its story (so that you get multiple different endings), Banner Saga does most of this *minor spoiler alert* through your party (people you invested resources and time to grow are going to die, and it's going to kill you - either emotionally or gameplay wise).Graphics: I enjoy the art style and visuals in the Banner Saga. Even without amazing high definition graphics or epic 3D models, it does well to convey how frightening and bleak the world can be, or how beautiful the world could be in nature. You find your jaw dropping at beautiful designs of God Stones and other amazing backdrops. Like Transistor, the style is timeless and would not need any HD remake in the future - even if you pick this up in 2020.Combat: I'm no pro at turn-based combat games, so I won't comment much. Thankfully, there's all sorts of difficulty settings and would allow someone like me to enjoy the story without bashing my head over gameplay blockers. The story: While it may be a fantasy world, the story is about love, honor, justice, war, and invokes philosophical questions regarding doing good and doing evil, right and wrong. It is beautifully woven - ha ha pun intended - through the story of Rook and Iver (two different tales that eventually meet). It will surprise you, it will anger you (in the good way because you care about these characters), and it will make you cry (or sad, at least).After finishing this game, I immediately bought its sequel The Banner Saga 2. Honestly, even if you don't intend to play its sequel, The Banner Saga (1) is worth playing through just on its own merit.			"

The art style is creative and I love it, the characters have personality and feel real, I also love how it is partly taken from the nordic ""ragnorock"" mythology with the sun never setting and demons walking the earth; I am a big fan.I recommend turning it to the easiest difficulty (not because it's too hard which it has a decent amount of difficulty) so you can really enjoy the story, it won't suffer combat though. I might add this is my first Turn based strategy game too.But even for a genre noob like me I think it's worth every single penny and you should get it right now!			"

												of all the games I've played that tried to offer the player meaningful choices about how the sotry unfolds, this game delivers better than any other.  The story is epic, amazing, and you have so many points of choice, with immediate and far ranging consequences.  Even with all the branches to the story, it still mnages to be a truly moving work of fiction (or at least the parts I saw)as for the combat, the screenshots in the store don't lie.  it's a turn-based battle-grid rpg.  characters can attack in 2 different ways, and have a special ability, so there aren't a plethora of options, but that just lets you focus on the little tactical decisions.  one square of movement can mean the difference between victory and defeat, as can the use of a limited resource called willpower.  As a lover of games like Final Fantasy Tactics and X-com: enemy unknown, this game's combat never got stale for me.This game is fantastic, and comes highly reccomended to anyone who enjoys turn-based tactical gameplay			"

												An absolutely amazing adventure with a one of a kind style and turn-based combat. The story is amazing and the hand-drawn artwork of the game/map/landscape creates one of the best atmospheres I have ever seen in a game. The soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard. The minimalistic animation is made up for in the art and constant snow falling. You make hard choices along the way that affect the world and the people you meet. This game can be very unforgiving at times and frustrating, but never past the point of the reality of the harsh life your heroes experience. You will be immersed in the World and become attached to the heroes. Definately a great game to relax to and immerse yourself in. (basically an interactive graphic novel) 9/10. Just wish it was longer.... Can't wait till the second installment to this beautiful trilogy!			"

												I dont know, this game could have just not been for me.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Banner Saga Review~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Here is what i THOUGHT this game was about. I thought i would be playing the role as a viking tribe that was raiding England. WRONG I did NO research and this game is really about a fictional role where you play as fictional people on a fictional map with fictional things.Pros:Great combat system. +Big map. +Neutrals:If you like to read this game is for you! I think you read more in this game ten you would in some Mark Twain books! This is a video game not a book! =Fictional. And again this is just not my taste, this just ruined it for me, if you like fictional stuff that TRIES in way to be non-fiction buy this game. =Cons:Barely any voice acting. -Overpriced in my opinion -Neutrals are cons for me so my personal rating is a 4/10Now all the big review sites give this game 9s and 8.5s but i got a headache playing this game, wait scratch that, reading a book and clicking things.For guys/girls who really like to read, get immersed in a story and think about tactics buy this game! If you are a RTS fan who loves Starcraft, Command and Conquer and the Total war games. Dont buy this game.If you are a guy/girl who LOVES the Viking/Middle Ages times and played Mount and Blade until the cows came home. Dont buy this game.Finally, if your a HUGE RPG fan who gets into story's fast and just wants a breath of fresh air. Buy this game.I am number 2 and 3. So i did not really like this game. "

												Beware! It is not turn-based rpg, please do not believe to description. It is stupid turn-side system where team with 2 x 10/10 units stronger than team with 2 x 10/10 and 3 x 1/1 units. If you a fan of turn-based RPGs, do not buy that trash.			"

												Pretty game that is very short, boring, and unbalanced.The good: looks nice and has choices that matter.The bad:  few enemy types, plain terrain, cannot get enough points to upgrade all your units, cannot afford to buy items, the only way to get experience is by killing enemies which is hard for defensive and support units.

												It was a nice story, but overall it has little longevity, the sequal apparantly has a survival mode outside of the campaign which would be a great addition to this game (mod makers get on that). It's a good game, but unless you're really devoted to the series or this style of game I'd recomend waiting for a sale or when the price is a tad lower (it's proboboly worth 10-15 US dollars) . Still this game is a good 7 out of 10 maybe an 8 after I try some alternative paths.Comabt wise there is little explanation or help on the tactics, I'd recomend practicing a bit and perhaps watching a youtube video or two to get a proper understanding of the numbers and modifiers. Experienced gamers should be able to figure it out with a little trial and error on their own though.The art in the game is a large part of what drew me and I must say it is worth it, great sceneries and hand drawn animations!

												I REALLY wanted to like it...its a nicely produced little game with an interessting setup and intruiging at start. But way too much loading between near to nothing happening apart from some rather random seeming dialogues and tbh there isnt really much to do apart from klick, read, klick, load, read, klick read, klick, load, read, klick, arrange a few troops, klick, random encounter with some enemies randomly placed, kill, klick, read, klick read, klick, fight random fight...and so on. I always wondered where the ""strategy"" part was in the fights. Its rather random and its boring. especially if the enemies just spawn around you, and you can do next to nothing to change that. No Terrain, no setup, no tactics to influence battle field. Its so empty and hollow what could have been nice and challenging is basically just a click fest with too much too read and not enough to do.			"

												I was actually impressed by this game. Impressed by how developers did not understood the word ""balance"". The game could have an unfairly good graphics and story (soundtrack is good but a lot of times you fell lacking of it, especially since its rly slow paced game.) Yet nothing above matter when you dont understand the game. You could have one your party wasting ""dredges"" just everyday yet when you switch to another one you just hoping wind wont blow you. I am not complaining about ground of weakness of second party my issue is more general. There is no possible way in the game to find out everything you need about mechanics. Why the mighty Varl dealing 1 point of damage to human (with the sword mostly as big as the human) while some ranger can squeze with arrow up to 4? Why excatly sometimes dealing back damage improoves our damage output but sometimes not? Yet enemis also does not have constant damage because at one turn they deal 2 but in three thay can deal 8? Rly,game? If i had somewhere to read about this ingame this review wouldnt currently existed since i would be playing atm, but after 2 losses in a row to ""humans"" i just cant continue for today.

												Enjoyed it , Definetly worth getting in a sale. The story was good and a bit different from most RPG's , the choice's and conversations sucked me into the world and there were plenty of characters to meet. Loved the artwork and presentation , very polished game. The combat was the weakest part but at least it also was different than the norm , it definetly takes some getting used to . The worst thing about the combat is how turns and rounds work , each unit doesnt take a turn every round  as you would expect , instead each side always has the same amount of moves , so you can end up with the ridiculous situation of the side with lower numbers being better of as each unit gets to move multiple times. Also the fact you are better wounding units than killing them is stupid as well. You get used to this and play around it but it is for me a silly combat system that never feels right.			"

												I've been looking forward to playing an oldschool strategy game, but sadly The Banner Saga turned out to be an utter disappointment. I truly wanted to like the game, with its lovable art design and its interesting setting.Unfortunately, the game clearly shows that it was designed not for PC but as an app for mobile devices: the controls are cumbersome, and many features are overly simplistic. It also must be mentioned that the game is rather short, in particular when factoring in that about 50% of your gaming experience consist of reading conversations between characters with the occasional making of choices, and watching your clan of tiny pixels wander through pretty landscapes without any real means of interaction.The other 50% is combat, and this is where The Banner Saga fails rather hard.For starters, the enemies you encounter throughout the game are incredibly repetitive. Most of the time, you will be fighting ""dredge"", dark-armored giants which lay waste to the lands. Sadly, most of them look identical to a point that fighting them gets boring very quickly - even the final boss is just a recolored version of common enemies (!).Another thing that utterly annoyed me are the basic combat dynamics. In The Banner Saga, your characters' HP is also their Strength, which equals how much damage they deal in combat; an injured character is therefore of little use, as he loses his ability to inflict damage.What looks like a fresh and interesting idea at first turns out to be complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the context of the fact that in The Banner Saga your characters and enemies will always move in turns - meaning that if you kill an enemy, its turn will not be ""lost"", but instead the next foe will just take its place. This is beyond stupid for a number of reasons - for starters, it means that killing enemies actually makes a battle harder. An enemy force of two combatants in good condition may easily wreck your six injured warriors, as they are no longer able to inflict significant damage - and each enemy will gain three turns for one of your allies' turns. This means that you have to try and NOT kill enemies in order to win, but instead leave them on the battlefield as weak as possible. In addition, you are basically punished for saving your own characters - if you pull back an injured ally, it means that you will waste turns on a useless character, as Strength cannot be regenerated.All in all, Stoic has created a combat system that is very counter-intuitive, and quite frankly, stupid.Another issue I have is that the battles are not only repetitive because of the enemies, but also because of the battlefield itself. The game will exchange the backgrounds, but for the most part, you will be fighting in a square of some sort; I can remember only one map which had some kind of natural obstacles. The only variety the game offers is the positions of your enemies and allies, and as a result, battles become boring very fast.Perhaps the most ridiculous missing feature of The Banner Saga is the lack of a saving function (!)  - the game only creates automatic savestates, manual saving simply doesn't exist. As a result, you will often have to rewatch tedious cutscenes/dialogues in order to redo a battle, and even then you will sometimes not be able to go back to its beginning (and will instead have to redo the one before it, as no savestate was created in between). What the developers had in mind here was clearly to prevent players from changing the outcome of the decisions you make throughout the journey (which is often harsh - characters dying, for example), as the game *always* saves after having made such a decision. However, why the game does not just simply saves before battles as well is beyond me, as the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ battle system will definitely have you playing some battles more than once. In particular ""second battles"" - oftentimes the game will allow you to take an additional battle after you have won one. Problem: your characters' strength will not be replenished, making the second one usually much more difficult, and making it much more likely that you will want to try again - have fun doing the first battle again, as of course the game last saved half an hour ago.The Banner Saga has a ton of other flaws, such as being unable to correct a false command in battle (accidentally moving one tile short of being able to attack your enemy - too bad, you can't go back to the ""move""-command, even though the tile easily is within your character's movement radius), a lack of information (the game allows you to chose the position of your characters on the battlefield - however, it neither tells you which foe will move first, nor can you assess your enemies' movement radius) or that the music is sometimes outright annoying (in particular during battles).On the plus side, the animations and the general art design are really nice, and the story is interesting enough to keep you playing (although in the end there are many loose strings, and The Banner Saga feels like but a setup for its successor).In conclusion, I would still not recommend buying the game unless you are really, really craving a turn-based fantasy adventure. If you do, The Banner Saga might be worth buying at the current price of 75% off - but you better be prepared to be disappointed.			"

												First Impressions, review may change after more game time.... First off, I generally really like turn based tactical RPGS/Strategy games like Fire Emblem, XCOM, Expeditions Conquistador, Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy Tactics etc.  Having recently visited Denmark, and watched the ""Vikings"" TV show, the Viking style theme really interested me.  I've been looking forward to this, but didn't back the Kickstarter.  I have to say I'm rather disappointed so far.  Liked:1. Love the artwork. Reminds me of feature length cartoons from the late 70s and early 80s. Very nicely done.Mixed Feelings:1. The Viking theme.  A turn based tactical RPG about Vikings sounded awesome to me. But then I realize it has giants, and robotic looking things in it. What, were vikings just not nerdy enough? I guess I was hoping for something a bit more like real-world vikings. Seriously, that would have been cool enough.2. The turn based combat.  First, I'm eternally grateful for the combat being turn based. However I keep finding the battles to be kind of tedious and dull, especially against the dredge.  So I have to whittle away their armor first, then whittle away their hit points?  ZZZZZ.  Might as well have just doubled the hit points.  Then the enemies getting to move more often, the fewer of them remaining is a bit ""different"" for lack of a better word. Not quite sure what to think of that mechanic yet.Dislike:1. The story and dialog so far.  It's dull. The first hour of the game has not hooked me at all.  I have no interest in the characters or what is happening to them so far.  I can't keep my find focused on the game long enough to play more than 20-30 minutes of it at a time. 2. The village and map interfaces.  It feels like something from a Facebook or browser game, for the villages.  World map is very cluttered and hard to read at a glance. Hoping it gets better as it goes, but it just isn't inspiring me to keep playing it. Disappointed.			"

												A fantastic game.  It does not have the budget of a big studio, but manages to leave a much better impact with their beautiful art style then 95% of triple A games that emphasize on graphics.  You maintain a caravan constantly being attacked by a unique enemy trying not just to pillage but obliterate every life and make decisions to fight through putting your command unit at risk in the front lines  to reduce casulties and save lives or to just run away from encounters completely.  It leaves a true sense of addictive desperation considering the gameplay is very strategic aka final fantasy tactics like but much more brutal.I highly suggest this game, and I suggest buying it if you are the least bit interested in the artwork of the trailer to reward this developer for his hard work and better yet motivate others to make more games like this.

What I liked: The art style is amazing The combat and story does have some choices The music is SO GOOD that I bought the album, made by the great Austin Wintory(Journey)What You Need to Know: You can skip the dialogue if you want to, which is good at times There is no voice acting, so there is ALOT of reading, voice acting would make this game more alive Sadly the combat didn't feel very deep or challenging , and feels more like an ipad game, which is available for, which maked since I might give another go, if the later ones improve upon my complaints and make it betterMy Score:CPrice:$6.50Main reason for dislike: Since gameplay was weak, story was the main draw, but couldn't get into itGames similar that are better:  Walking Dead Telltale Game South Park Stick of Truth "

												Overall, a decent game. The artistic direction is stunning, and the music is beautiful. Combat was basic but effective.However... and it's a big however... Given that this is a 'Saga', an epic tale, I thought the story was the biggest let down here. Plotholes abound, questions left unanswered (not deliberately, they were just forgotten about), and the written dialogue was terrible... Very simplistic and often nonsensical, I actually thought that the game had been translated from another language, until I saw that the developers were in the US. The ending will leave you scratching your head and thinking, ""Well, I guess this is where they ran out of crowd funding...""If you want a visually, aurally stunning game and don't care that it's set to a story seemingly written by a 12 year old, this is the game for you.

												Since STEAM only allows yes and no and not a more complex system of user rating, I'm forced to vote a no where I would normally rate it as average.The combat system is not very fun, and it's the core of this game.The game is unforgiving and punishing, which is fine, but in certain places and situations, making a wrong choice can force a complete restart from the middle or even end of the game. In some games it would be fine (NEO Scavenger for example), but in this, very much a story-led game, it is not.I didn't like it much. Wasn't real fun.			"

												Let me to start off by stating what's obvious for anyone who played this game for more than a minute: Claiming that this game has anything to do with vikings, the historical viking era, Norse mythology or even anything remotely related to the misconceptions and myths regarding vikings and their religion, is complete BS.It's like saying that the tv series of True Blood is based on the historical accounts of Vlad Tepes, Bram Stoker's book Dracula or the historical myths about vampires that originated in the Slavic region of the world.True, The Banner Saga has humanoids depicted with horns, which may be interpreted by some to be Viking helmets. It also has area names that bear some resemblence to Scandinavian regions that existed in the viking era or in the mythological tales, but that's about it. If you expect characters like Odin, the Fenrir wolf, Thor or any events as depicted in Norse mythology or the tales of Snorri Sturluson, prepare to be deeply disappointed as this game's story is a mockery of everything viking.If you have no interest nor knowledge of the vikings or their mythology, The Banner Saga might be far more enjoyable than it was for me. I like the game mechanics, the graphics, the different characters and how you get to play ""both sides"" of the story.I really try to enjoy the game, and I am sure it'd be easier for me to do if the game creators would leave out their horrendous attempt to make it ""viking-themed"". Unfortunately, it spoils the entire experience for me. "

												First of all I need to mention i'm a huge tactical RPGs fan.This game, however, despite being labeled as such is an abomination, a travesty of tactical RPG. The turn system is the worst I've ever encountered in any games I've ever played. Who got this ""fantastic"" idea that even when the teams are outnumbered enemy and allies are moving in turns, enemy turn, ally turn, enemy turn, ally turn. There is 2 enemies left? Bad news, they still gonna wreck you.Not a fan of those visuals and graphics, but it's just an opinion so it has no impact on my score.Finally, I don't mind reading in games that have good story and characters with depth. In this game however it's all fantasy cliche and you just don't care about the characters, therefore if I wanted to read I would grab a book, not this game.Overall 3/10 and since on this account I can still refund im going to do this. This game MIGHT be good for casual players that never before played good tactical games or story-rich games, the others should avoid the hype.			"

												This game looks wonderful, and its art creates a fantastical world that feels super good to spend time in. The story feels epic, but the characters are still engaging. But, the mechanical weight of the game sometimes doesn't live up to the art and narrative that is created. Battles, though initially well constructed, begin to become repetative due to lack of variety and orthogonality in enemies and staging.8 / 10			"

												I knew nothing about this game until its Steam release. The intro art made me think this was a game about the Male and Female on the intro, seems interesting I thought. Maybe an RPG spin on The Last of Us or something.What did I get, Giants... wait what? Who are they and why do I care? Instant turn off. Ok, Ill play along surely this is just a temporary thing. The screen at the start said the game might switch between characters, but surely It will get to the ones I can relate to soon... nope!Ok now I am looking at the city from the outside, and... waiting. Is this a loading screen? Oh look moving the mouse makes the screen move left and right. So this is a bug or something, wait nope I just highlighted a building...Ok so now I have to point and click on some buildings, and then talk to some guys inside. Done, now what?Oh click on another building and fight some people.Seriously this is not what I signed up for, when do I get off the rail road?This game to me is not an RPG, it is an interactive story book with Turn based combat in between to make you feel like you are having some input.Despite all the positive comments about the combat, I really disliked it. The whole I am going to stand here while you hit me thing never went over well with me, but this take seems to make it worse. The special moves, make it just plain awful.See Southpark Stick of truth for how it should be done.What I liked about the game.- Great artWhat I disliked about the game.- Intro that tells me I have no choice over which characters I play. So not an RPG then?- Long, uninteresting intro sequence... Why do these guys have horns?- Incoherent intro sequence, who what... where? I am chasing some guys because some guy told me too? Ummm ok.- Characters I don't care about, when do I get to the character creation screen? This is an RPG right? RIGHT?- Where are the girl and man from intro they look interesting?- Music to make you sleep.- Unbelievable (in the bad sense) combat.- Advertised as an RPG/Strategy when it is a point and click story driven adventure. Seriously, RPG is Role Playing Game, not Fantasy Game. And Strategy, any game where the player has input in the combat should be classified as a strategy if this game is any indication.Very Disappointed.			"

												Boring, linear campaign with seemingly arbitrary choices and no real depth, barely any management required.  You'd have to try to fail.Battles are almost always carried out on the same bland grid square with no landmarks or variation.  Battles are not very strategic with very little reason to approach any given scenario differently.  Lack of defensive options in battle.  Classes differ very little, all only having one special ability.Story and world have some potential but has poor presentation due to lack of voice acting and cutscenes.Art is beautiful and easily the best part of the game, but it can't carry it.Overall pretty disappointed, hoping the sequels can improve.

												ill skip to the pros and cons since am sure most of you have read several detailed impressions of other players but ill tell you why i have downloeded the game and what did i expect from the game.Pros:(Why i bought this game?) Challenging Questions that makes me want to play the game again and see what would might happen if i picked another answer. ( you can still load to earlier savegame and change your answer )Epic Storyline and graphics. for those who like (Mulan and Sleeping beauty the developers are for sure inspired by those 2 Disney Cartoons)Gameplay: Yes its enjoyable, challenging and think hard before you make the wrong move. but ill mention some minar flaws in the cons section.Cons: (why i wanted to buy this game? )MUSIC!!! i have read over million of times about the composer and that he won so many awards and yet its really boring and i have muted the music several times because i feel the music in this game tasteless and a Abysml.Game length: Short you can end the game in 10 hours.Gameplay: (why i wanted to buy this game?) No fast forwarding during story & combat. No ( Zooming ) which i would have found it very useful sometimes if it existed.the animation when you're in combat is meh.. the archer is pointing totally in a different direction you would love to see some great action with their animation and abilities they have the animated cartoonic style yet they didn't do anything about it to put a variety of a fighting styles and techniques. Just imagine animated Masterpiece Portrait thats all. Don't expect the portrait to produce another visual effects. Map : why there is map in this game ? are you kidding me ? conclusion : does it worth  24$ well i bought the game when it was on sale. no its not worth 24$ but you will not regret buying it. so basically why did i buy this game? what have i expected? unfortunatly the cons were more important to me than the pros. No Music << they fooled me with this one. No animated game fight in combat i thought i could see more animation during combat that makes me say yeah BABY!! DIE!!If those two things weren't important to you , then Go ahead and buy it u'll enjoy the game.			"

												TLDR: I work >60 hours every week and want a relaxing game that doesn't feel annoying. I think I'm not going to find that in the Banner Saga.Pro:--Graphic design is pleasing.Neither pro or con but you might want to know:--Story based on Norse mythology, which I personally consider a cliche but that is purely personal experience.Numeric system is simple without much room for tweaks.Con:--Unforgiving towards mistakes. Does not provide save at anytime - only autosave, which makes mistakes even more unforgiving, as to remedy one mistake you need to put up with extra long lead-up time as autosaves are not done at beginning of combat, or load an autosave several battles earlier and redo all the chores. The game seem to be following a ""force player to accept mistakes they made"" philosophy, which I consider sadly mistaken.Does not provide audio for most conversations, which forces gamer to read subtitles, which is taxing for someone who uses eye for work.

												Ok, the art is beautiful. I love stylized work like this - Charles Vess, et al. And the music is wonderful as well. What limited story is there is well written. This game however is supremely frustrating by the lack of a save game mechanic. If you screw up in a fight - and you will - then you'll have to go back a good ways - often scroll through tons of dialogue and animation just to get back to the fight. This is game design 101 folks. You don't do that. Never. Ever. But because decisions affect how a fight starts then you'd need two saves - with the latter being at the beginning of the actual fight itself so you don't have to go back  through all the extraneous stuff simply to reload the fight.That and there are some other little niggling issues like only being able to move once as opposed to having move points - which is hella more strategic. So if you screw up and move to the wrong spot you're screwed. And it sucks that you have to count squares before moving your archers to figure out if they'll be in range or not after they move. No interrupts, no saving move points to adjust position, etc. means it's all pretty bare bones strategy that gets boring and frustrating fast. A million other games have done this a million times better so it boggles the mind that the designer wouldn't have learned that by now. Maybe it was the budget limitations, I don't know, but it's a royal pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and a disservice to an otherwise beauttiful game.Don't forgoe it completely however, just jump in at the $5 mark and that's fair enough.

												This game has some great aspects; the Oregon trail feel of the caravan is nice, the beautiful art and cut scenes and the characters are all real nice.The problem comes when battle starts. On one hand playing as the main character who is the Archer (forget his name) can wreck the enemy but when it comes to melee fighters as with the other main character it comes down to a slug fest where you will take massive amounts of unnecessary damage. The lack of strategy in battles just kills the gameplay.The other huge issue (and downright lie) comes in the form of making choices for the caravan that ultimately do not matter in the long run as most choices end up having the same outcome but that is a minor problem at best compared to the horrible combat. If the combat offered had more strategy and didn't end up just as a slug fest this game would be way better.			"

												Interesting story completely undermined by weak characters and lack of meaningful choices. Character development non-existent. Enemy variation non-existent. Ranged classes worthless as they have the same range as enemy melee classes. Leveling completely unbalanced with regards to enemy strength. Creating a balanced party is impossible and newly introduced characters are unleveled and not worth investing in. Godstones do nothing and add nothing to the game lore-wise, except for the last one, and even then it only benefits one character.Every choice leads to a disappointing conclusion. There is no choice where you will feel satisfied with the outcome, and usually choices result in the same consequence. Often you are asked to make the same choice multiple times throughout the game, leading to a repetitive experience.Really disappointed for a game I had high hopes for.			"

												This game is boring. For what was sold as the best of the Bioware writers, the game is a slapped-together mess. I've read better writing with more emotional nuance in flash games. The dialogue is boring and uninspired with an over-reliance on poorly-written ""cut scenes"" that overlay an equally boring and uninspired background.The characters are dull with no real incentive to care about them or their story given the deadliness of the game and the inability to replay scenes. The game forces you onto a single path with no concern for your enjoyment of the story. Choices are pointless and arbitrary with no meaningful effect on the overall story.Ogres exist but apparently women can only be archers. The same tired sexism you always see, with the absolute ridiculous expectation that the audience find mythical creatures more realistic than a woman who can hold a sword.I was expecting better from developers who broke from EA.

												This game is really really really beautiful with amazing animation, richly detailed background landscapes, and an impressive soundtrack. That is pretty much the good points of this game in a nutshell. I want to like this game so much but it falls so flat. A lot of it stems from the game's garbled mess of a story with no character development and no clear plot direction. It is hard to become invested in characters that do not seem to matter. The game's mechanics are dubious as well with no real consequences for elements such as low morale in your party, lost battles, and even the choices you make on the road simply do not matter. The dialog trees are incredibly dull, barely move the plot along, and offers no insight into character motivations, which is inherently the entire point of having dialog trees in the first place.The turn based battles are mildly engaging but are hampered by leveling system where each individual character only gains experience based on the number of kills. This system favors the already strong characters but leaves the weaker characters who are lucky if they even get one kill, let alone survive a battle, as weak characters who never level up.I was initially excited about this game but after watching the game's characters wander around aimlessly for several hours with no advancement in the storyline I lost interest and could not bring myself to finish the game. Consequently I cannot reccomend this game.			"

												A mix between a Bioware game, a Turn Based Strategy and... Oregon Trail. The Banner saga tells the story of a world on the brink of destruction through amazing artwork, amazing audio, a phenomenal soundtrack by Journey's Austin Wintroy and great gameplay mechanics. the game is around 12 hours long and ends on a high note opening up the way to the sequel.The game takes place in a fantasy Viking world, and is told from different points of views and different characters. your choices dictate how the story progresses and can have huge immediate or delayed effect on the outcome of the story. a highly recommended experience. do not get too attached to your characters, you will never know when you will be losing oneEnglish Video review here:

												With a relatively poor story, the aesthetic design, music and general feel of the game keep it together. The combat's not exactly thrilling, and the very few lines of dialogue spoken by actual voice actors is far between, somehow the game still makes a name for itself. The world is interesting and so are the characters, keeping a Game of Thrones-esque storytelling technique that works well in its favour.But how do dredge have babies?			"

												The game looks great. The animations are great. I like the subtle animations on the screen. I like the battle animations. The story so far is okay (I'm only 4 hours into it at this point). I will admit that when I saw the first line ""The gods are dead"" I rolled my eyes and thought great, it's a cliche in the first line of the game.The combat is different. Having armor and strength, having to make a decision as to which attack to make -- break armor to reduce the armor and allow subsequent attacks to do more damage or attack strength which in turn lowers the amount of damage they can do on their strength attack. Break armor attacks however are unaffected by strength, so those almost dead enemies can still pose a risk. There's a disadvantage in eliminating low health enemies while there are strong enemies still on the board.The willpower attribute is interesting in that you have a limited amount of points that can be used in strengthening attacks or moving further. Characters are limited in how much willpower they can expend, which also can be raised. This pool is limited but willpower can be gained when an enemy is killed and there are some characters that can add willpower to other characters through abilities. Here's what I don't like... the slow moving caravan moves slowly. The world looks great, but I really don't like waiting minutes for the caravan to crawl across the screen to the next destination. I get it, it's probably for effect or immersiveness, but please... can I just fast forward please? The caravan leaves... moving slowly... moving... then an event pops up. Read through it, resolve, hopefully a battle, then back to the slowly... moving... caravan. *sigh*After 4 hours I got up from playing the game and went to look at the time, thinking surely it was hours later than it was. I was surprised it was only 4 hours. It felt much longer. If this was non-stop action, that would be a good thing.  For this, not so much.With that said, I like the game so far. I don't regret the pre-order, but I'd be hardpressed to recommend it to someone at $25 unless I was really sure they'd like it. My recommendation is to find the free to play multiplayer ""Banner Saga: Factions"" and give it a shot. If you're okay with the combat system, then maybe consider the singleplayer version.			"

												I grabbed this game during a sale and, honestly, didn't expect too much from it. I was just bored and wanted to try something new, and while I love games with multiple choices, I had never played a turn-based RPG before. This kind of combat always scared me away for some reason - dungeon crawlers with awful graphics, annoying camera ancles and a constant bird's-eye view came to mind, in short, games from the last century which can only be valued by nostalgics. I am sure more people out there have such prejudices, and I highly encourage them to try out this game. This whole ""chessboard"" combat turned out to be incredibly fun. The art style and graphics are great, the story is interesting and the music is very beautiful. Most of the dialogues aren't voiced, but I even welcomed that. Some say the combat is unfairly hard, but there are 3 difficulty levels which you can change at any point in the game. Of course, there are some downsides, too. Mostly the short duration of the game (finished it in 7-8 hours), and watching your caravan travel in snail pace can become a bit boring at times. As always, the decisions made in-game don't really have such a big impact in the end, but that's the case with all choice-based games, from Fallout to Telltale Games to Life is Strange. But it surely has replayability, and the greatest feature is, that the game doesn't end, when you fail in combat. It just carries on with your failure and you'll have to live with the consequences. (Of course, you can reload if you wish to do so).This game is really interesting and unique, and I think everybody should give it a try.			"

I am thinking it might be more cool for a younger audience or someone that just loves the look of graphic novels.Just don't go in thinking you are going to get a strategy game based on Vikings.			"

Pro: Art style is nice. That's about it...Cons: Combat; There are a plethera of other rpgs that have done this style of combat better, and the story just doesn't really pull you in..That, combined with the $20??? At most this game is worth about 6-7. Wait for a sale if it's a must-have.			"

OMG I can't even spend that renown to level up one person because I have to use 80% of my renown to buy resources? WTF OMG THERE ARE ITEMS TO BUY WITH RENOWN?! WITH WHAT (&^*%%$# RENOWN!?Did that enemy archer just move when I attacked him?Why the hell can't my archers do that?Did that enemy just smash his shield down and do knockback to all of my troops while damaging their armor? Why can't I do that?Is this AI difficulty really just inflated with enemies that can do $#!t that I can't? Seriously? Did those two guys just kill four of my guys because they got to move 2x more than me and the rest of my team was across the map?Who in their right mind thinks this is ""tactical""? Did that spell caster with 3 extra will just seriously do a total of 4 damage?Do my archers seriously have to be within the enemies walking distance before they can attack?Do I have more questions? Yes, but I am spending more time making these questions then I did beating this game...To find more of my reviews (the complete reviews) on games and movies check out my blog found at my Steam profile or by google (search Ashley and Micah English) Thanks.

												Dropped thirty dollars on a game I only could stand two or three hours of.The 'Banner Saga' is a slow, methodical slog through a never-ending cavalcade of death, loss, failure and regret. Worse, the game takes characters from you in what feels very arbitrary text-only cut scenes, leaving you feeling angry and helpless.The fact that there is no load function, as far as I could tell, to go back and get a mulligan on the bad things that happen drives home the games creators wanted you to not only eat s*** but live with it. All you can do is struggle in vain against what feels like a gradual but inevitable, grinding defeat.I wish I had never wasted my money.﻿UPDATE:Tried reinstalling and playing again almost a year later. Nope. Still unplayable trash. This game will be occupying a subcategory of my Steam library called 'Garbage', since apparently I can't delete this tumor from my life.			"

You do not create a character, instead you play the one the game gives you.  This game is like playing a choose you fate novel.  I am very dissappointed.  The writing is good and the voice acting is good, but if I want a good story about Vikings I can watch The 13th warrior or the new show on the History channel.Blah, this game leaves a bad taste in my mouth, I'm never buying from Stoic again.

												I've spent countless hours on a variety of RPGs over the years so I figured I'd give this one a try but I sadly regret doing so...I spent 20 hours trying to like this game, but I just can't get into it.The Banner Saga is a rather unique square grid turn based RPG with good music and sound effects (though lacking a volume slider for some reason), good controls, and it features a very unique art style.That's all that's good in my opinion.This game offers you very little control, as you move along automatically on a linear path, stopping here and there as the story takes you from places of interest and battles. You are constantly asked to answer multiple choice questions that affect various events and cause battles to trigger. When you get in a battle you move a single character, your opponent moves a single character, and this process continues until the end.You will generally be fighting the same enemies and slightly different versions of them throughout at least the first 20 hours of the game.Personally, When I play an RPG I desire the ability to explore the world but this game does not allow this.I don't find it fun to have the gameplay consist of watching a parade move from location to location, answering various multiple choice questions, and fighting robot enemies I've seen a hundred times.The battle system is another problem. Strength and HP are the same basically, and breaking defense before HP results in better hits on HP. All the characters get maybe a single special move which is kind of lacking in my opinion. There are no magic spells or trinkets to use, it's just simple attack and a single special. You can't even defend.Another problem is that you can't grind in this game. There are no opportunities (in the first 20 hours anyway), to replay battles or trigger random battles to help build your team. The characters are all rather weak (especially the humans), so an opportunity to grind would be nice.The currency in this world is called renown, and it's used to rank up your characters (levelling), buy things in the market (!?), and it's also used to buy supplies for your journey. It's overused for everything and it's easy to run out of it as you start collecting a lot of party members and market items.Yes that's another problem, for some reason we have resource management here to feed all those people in your parade. This is not fun. That's a lot of negatives, this game is really underwhelming.There are many better RPGs out there, (let me suggest some great titles such as Grandia 2, the Final Fantasy Series, Shining Force Series, Phantasy Star Series)  and while this game has some unique features and some very nice graphics, the gameplay is simply not fun.Skip this one.

												The Banner Saga is a beautiful story-driven RPG with turn-based combat and I recommend it. The artdesign is nice and although you might consider the drawn characters a little like ""for children"", that's not the case. The story is sad, you will be confronted with wrong decisions (and you will take them) and their consequences, with death in combat, death by starvation, death and betrayal by any other unexpected event. While the game world is very original and inspired by nordic mythology in the best way possible, it reminded me a little of Game of Thrones with its twists. A huge plus!I didn't find any bugs, the German localization was relatively good and as my first playthrough took me about 15 hours with some potential for another run, the game is value for money.However there is also one thing I disliked: The combat system. And as you spend your time mainly with multiple choice dialogues and turn-based combat, that's a notable flaw. While I do like the fact that your strength is connected to your HP, so your characters deal less damage the more they are wounded (same applies for the enemies), the following points caused some frustration:1) You can let your characters walk according to waypoints which you define in a row, but you cannot give them several orders for movement one after another - if you don't use the waypoint system and you don't send your character immediately to the place you want it, you cannot move him anymore and need to wait until the next turn.2) Only spear fighters can strike diagonally.3) Your characters easily block each other.4) You get an overview how much HP damange you could deal to any enemy in range, but not armour damage. 5) the worst point: The order of action. It is always you-enemy-you-enemy until there is only one enemy or character alive and ""pillage"" mode is activated. This makes combat quite weird, because first of all it is not based on initiative (like in Heroes 5 for example, where combat was very well done) and it makes more sense for you not to kill an enemy when you managed to weaken him strongly, because if you kill him, the remaining enemies will have a higher action frequency. If you own the game already you surely know what I mean, but for everybody who still didn't purchase it:Combat between a party of 3 (P1,P2,P3) and 3 emenies (E1,E2,E3). The order is: P1,E1,P2,E2,P3,E3. But when you kill an enemy E1 it changes to: P1,E2,P2,E3,P3,E2. So killing a weakened enemy will give you a disadvantage as you cannot choose freely which character to move (unlike chess). You might win the combat, but as one of your enemies will get another turn faster than your team, you might lose a wounded character. Although this way the combat requires its own tactical thinking and is quite challenging, I'd have preferred a combat system based on initiative. That would be more organic. And diagonal strikes, too. And last but not least: I wanted to play through the game on hard mode but found out that then ""The Banner Saga"" turns into the Dark Souls of turn-based RPGs. If you want to suffer and get absolutely wiped by tons of enemies, well... have fun, but don't be too proud to go back to ""normal"" :P (However I will try it again, now that I understand the game mechanics. This review was written after 16 hours of playing, directly after finishing the first playthrough, so a higher number of hours will indicate that I went again for the challenge.The negative aspects about combat had a quite strong negative impact on how I enjoyed the game when I played it for the first time - I bought it shortly after release, played it, disliked the combat and abandoned it. However as I am trying to play through my whole steam library I returned to the game and must admit that the great story, screenplay and character design compensate for it perfectly.Therefore I recommend The Banner Saga strongly, if you can get along with the combat system. In any case, don't give up after the first hour, it gets much, much better the more you play :)			"

												This is not meant to be a discouraging review.  I would like to begin about pointing out all the things I found to be positively amazing about this game: story-telling, animation style and drawing style really bring this story to life, and I am a fan of the turn-based tactics.Okay, now to the grit.  This is a very monotonous game in terms of gameplay.  You will see there's a ""map"" feature where you can see all these places that you have absolutely no control over whether or not you visit any of them.  You are compelled at every step of the way to follow a pre-determined path.  Much like Oregon Trail, you're given random encounters and chances to make decisions that affect gameplay.  This is good!  However, those decisions are largely minor details.  This is not so good. The game is featured in this robust, rich environment that one can hardly ever interact with.  Achievements are unlocked at almost an equally monotonous pace.  At the end of the game, one is left feeling like the story was never truly told.  You don't get to find out what happens after the final boss is ""slain"".  They really don't even seem to unfold any story about how anything got to be the way it was.  In conclusion, I found this game immensely frustrating.  Because if it straight up sucked - I would have no problem just saying, ""this game was no fun to play.""  The problem is that it has so much potential -- so much so you wished they took the time to do more with it.  Unfortunately, I picked up this game at $25.  Was this game worth $25?  In so many ways yes - but in so many MORE ways (if one were to judge it simply as a game and not for all the artwork and music that they put into it) NO.			"

												Only a few hours into this game, and I am very impressed.  This is a true saga, and more of a RPG than many purported stat min-maxing/item gathering games out there.  With an interesting story, a dismal situation where you really feel like you're fleeing and not just powering up and steamrolling enemies.  Multiple factions and constant ethical dilemnas make this very engrossing.  The mechanics of the game pace it more like a story than rush rush kill gather.  The combat is old-school too, so you can still have min-maxing and the abundance of classes (nearly every character is a distinct class) makes every combat interesting.I hope these people make more stories, and I'm glad I picked this up.

												Ever wondered what would happen if the Oregon Trail, Final Fantasy Tactics, and a bunch of Vikings had a baby?The answer is The Banner Saga, and it is amazing. Make decisions as the leaders of two separate caravans as they try to survive while the world around them grows steadily harsher. Make or lose allies based on your choices, and carefully weigh whether you want to level those allies up, earn them equipment, or buy rations to maintain the health and morale of your group as a whole.The Banner Saga is beautiful, interesting, and challenging. This is one of those games I couldn't help bingeplaying all the way through to the end in one night, because this is a game where the player really does have control of so many aspects of how things wind up.Definitely recommended!

												An absolutely beautiful game inspired by Scandinavian culture and lore from the days of old. The music and art alone are worth giving this game a try. I wholly enjoyed my time playing, watching, and listening to the story unfold. It truly does live up to the word ""Saga"" as it revolves around a long journey full of peril and the struggle to survive an quickly encroaching threat. What is amazing is that this game's universe contains a very fleshed-out map for the players to peruse. It took me 20 minutes to systematically click on and read about the universe I found myself in. It is made very clear that the game you are playing is only scratching the surface of this world.  Hopefully even more of the land will be visited in the sequel!			"

												I can with complete confidence say that this is the most beautiful game that I have ever played. The artwork alone is enough to give this game a try and enjoy the intricate work that has been done. The storyline of the game is also professionally written, very deep and book like, without the unnecessary arcade action everywhere. The absence of a saving option emphasises the importance and weight of your decisions in the game witch at times may seem annoying but in the long run the overall experience is much deeper this way in my opinion. Overall a great peace of work from the entire team. Looking forward to seeing more of there work.			"

												This game is just... a must buy or die game. So must there be anymore information?The music is peaceful yet empowering, it soothes the soul but also raises spirits, the song on it's own is amazing but accompained with the game makes it immensely more fun to play. The little interaction made with the poeple in your parties of why they each have chosen to fight give you more of a reason to defend and look after you caraven. The main story has epic decisions that will greatly impact what you will do and happen to cities, massive populations and more. The battle system in place has you trying to think out your strategies and grealty reward you with renown that can buy supplies for your caravan, promote your character and buy items.The game in all has an excellent story with writing that is made by the gods (that are not dead). Amazing music that makes it worthwhile to also buy the soundtrack. Battles which have you slowly but strategically win with the warriors you have at your disposal. So buy buy buy people and don't look back.			"

												My expectations from this game was very high. I like turn-based games. I like games with good 2d graphics. I like storytelling in games.

Sometimes it happens at the startup loading, sometimes after a battle. But it happens so oftenly. Let's say I had two battles consequtively. Bam, game freezes in the loading screen. OK, replay those two battles. Bam, game freezes again after the battles (this is randomly). I can't play a game like this.Game seems good, sounds good. But what is it for if I can't play it properly? I highly not recommend this game because of the fatal bugs, unless you want to play a gamble with your money.Note: I have tried reinstalling, verifying integrity cache many times. No solutions. "

												I really enjoyed this game. It's incredibly immersive, with everything from a gripping story, well-drawn characters, and a superb fictional world. In terms of gameplay, it mixes RPG and Strategy elements, somewhat like the Final Fantasy Tactics series, and the balance works very well.The only thing I don't like is that it's a bit short - it took me about 9 hours to complete on my first play through - and the story ends quite suddenly. The ending doesn't exactly tie up all the loose ends, but hopefully DLC or a sequel will be brought out to solve that. On the whole though, it's fantastic, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fun single-player game that will keep you interested from start to finish. I bought it for about £11 because of a 40% off deal and I found it great value for money.			"

												I really enjoyed this game up to a point. I found the combat mechanics very challenging. The ability to reduce a unit's damage output by reducing it's strength was new and interesting. I had to alter my long-time turn-based strategy mechanics to fit this new style of gameplay. The graphics are amazing. The game looks great, which adds to the story atmosphere. The ending is strange; I don't know if there are multiple endings, but it felt like there should be more to the story. If you enjoy being kicked in the gut when you're down, you'll like this game. You get to make a lot of decisions and it seems like you can never improve your situation; it's a slow spiral to an uncomfortable endpoint.			"

												An excellent turn-based strategy game.Visually, it is a beautiful game. The art style fits well, and the animations are well done. The ""animated painting""-style backgrounds add lots of subtle detail that really shows the team put a lot of effort and thought into the visuals.What audio there is is excellent. I realize that voiceover work is expensive and time-consuming, and that this was funded through Kickstarter, so it's understandable that it's not there in the final product. Would have been nice if it had been possible.The gameplay doesn't stray particularly far from the traditional turn-based strategy standards. Most gameplay elements are intuitive, though I personally would prefer on-hover tooltips in addition to the help menu system as they have implemented it the game. The game is difficult, and would be especially so for players who aren't as familiar with turn-based strategy games, but not overwhelming, and I never got the sense that I was constantly losing outside of the very early stages of the game. The gameplay itself had a sense of progress in terms of how good I felt at the game.The setting is intriguing, and it shows the developers were planning ahead for further games set in this universe, as there is much left unexplored and unexplained. The story itself usually resists the urges of the usual fantasy tropes--especially when it comes to the portrayal of women, and really comes across as a mature endeavor.Overall, I would recommend this game. Visually, it is a work of art, and gameplay-wise, it is a challenging, but not frustrating. The story is deep and engaging.			"

												This is a beautiful game!Pros- Beautiful Music- Pictureque visuals- Fantastic Story- Fun combat system (at first)Cons- The visuals do become a little repetitive over the course of the game- While the combat system is pretty fun, it is very repetitive and I found myself trying to rush through the battles so I could find out what happens next in the story.If you are a fan of Visual Novels you will probably appreciate this game very much, but its not for everyone. If you do pick this game up, be warned, it is essentially a very pretty book, so put on your reading hat. "

												Horrible and very frustrating experience, the art is nice but gameplay, story and the save game system ruin this gameI found myself skipping dialogue and going through battles as if they ware chores in a list, and if you want to try a different path you have to replay from the last arbitrary check point, not fun, a simple Ironman mode would suffice, I don´t have the time to play the game a dozen times, it`s a lazy way to make choices ""meaningful""It`s not worth it "

												There is something about this game that makes it special, and you can feel that just by looking at the screenshots. First impressions are rarely decietful and The Banner Saga turns out to be a pretty good game.Nevertheless it's not the most exciting game ever, if you are hoping to get a pounding heart and adrenaline rushes from playing this game, you probably will be disapointed. No, The Banner Saga is all about it's story, which means reading it's dialogs and lines. LOTS of reading. HOURS of reading. Hell, sometimes it feels more like reading a book!A very good book, mind you. The battles, the only interactive gameplay part of the game, is interesting but not fantastic. The graphics are nice, even if they do tend to seem a bit... too much vector drawing. The music and sound atmosphere are original and succeed to make a interesting background. Worth trying out.			"

												One of the best games I've played in a while.  The combat system is simple but not boring, and not too easy (plus you can change the difficulty).  The characters you build, what traits you improve, and how you use them, are important in each battle.  You might feel you perfect the battle system after a while but I ended up getting to the end of the game, and unable to win the last battle.  I was not wanting the game to be over so quickly anyway so I just started again.  Every decision you make will have real consequences - sometimes even ending the game.  And as I saw when starting again, the decisions really do make a difference...it's not a cosmetic feature.  Although there's almost no voice acting, the story is good, the animation is great, the music is fitting, and I found myself enjoying the characters and not wanting to stop playing.			"

												For an indie game, from the kickstarter program, this game is amazing.  For games in general, it is great.  It was unique and immersive and ARDUOUS.  Only a kickstarter game could be made to be like this; classic hardcore gamer style RPG, with a focus on story and stressful combat.  You will have to resit the urge to turn down the difficulty in this game more than you ever have before.  I'm ashamed to say i had to dumb it down to easy a couple times, although that may be more the fault of some well reported difficulty spike issues.  In the end, the story is really what makes this game, and all that goes with that (art, music, character's, etc.).  All of this is absolutely top notch, and was more moving for me than just about any game I've played in a good long while.  Not many games have given me those stirring goosebump moments when the right music hits and the right moment (The title screen itself gives you your first glimpse into the inspiring music).  I got about 15 hours out of it, which is not too shabby.  Might want to wait for it to go on sale, which Steam will be sure to do at some point.  However, I would say quite confidently it is well worth the 25 bucks.  I spend more than that in 2 hours at the bar, with no where near the satisfaction.			"

												Wow... this game! I came into it with high expectations and it delivered. It was fairly difficult to get over the first 3 hours or so, the story was a bit tough to get behind, but fight was fun and the characters had quite a bit of depth.After that it was a marathon, sped up through it in something like 2 days. Feels a bit bad for my time management, but had a BUNCH of fun. The game gives you much more than just tactical combat (which kinda fluctuates in difficulty across the game and finds an unnecessary spike in end-game, in my opinion).My favourite part, by far, was deciding on the small calls you have to make throughout your journey and seeing how they play out. I went with the calls that I would make in real life, and it ended up being quite emotional towards the late game. I still think, like I mentioned, that the ending battle was unnecessarily difficult, but hey, if you don't feel like grinding it, just change the difficulty (which I did). Also, quite strangely, it ends with a loose end, which left a question mark in my head, but other than that, just BRILLIANT!			"

All the beat-downs in this game makes it feel special when you catch a break.**The game recommends lowering the difficulty setting from the get-go.Oh did i mention this is really hard?Well Screw You Banner SagaSeriously,Screw. You. Banner. Saga.P.S. Note that I still have Recommended checked, you should probably pick this up and share the misery.**Edit** My 2nd playthrough went much better, still hard as all get-out, but I was able to beat the game on normal without changing the difficulty.As i am a glutton for punishment, I will probably get the next installment on day one.

												Excellent game for a reasonable price. The story is excellent, the music engaging, and the visuals are beautiful. I spent about 9 hours working through the story and the game felt long enough to be worth the lower cost. Kudos to the creators of the game and I hope to see more in the future. If you understand that the game seems to be a linear story, with some decisions you make affecting the small details, then I don't think you'll be disappointed. The world seems larger than what my story included, so I am not sure if there are major deviations in the story you can take. I don't remember big decisions on where to go, soI am not sure about that.Either way, it was an entertaining and compelling story.			"

The combat on the archers' side is pretty simple & funCons: The combats on the vaal's side and the ""war"" mode is frustrating, repetitive, and dull. 1) Vaal's are like giant hulks of slow, very slow meat that can neither attack range or heal, they can hardly get to where they're trying to go most of the time 2) ""War"" requires you to fight twice without healing so you can save more troops, that's work 3) Trying to have enough supplies and keeping morale high but not being able to hunt for food is like Oregon Trail but worseIt's a good game if you're looking for a bit of a challenge.

												My expectations from this game was very high. I like turn-based games. I like games with good 2d graphics. I like storytelling in games. This games gives all of these in a successful manner.So why is my review negative?Well, I can't play the game. Bugs. Or THE bug. My game has a bug that causes to freezing in random loading screens. Sometimes it happens at the startup loading, sometimes after a battle. But it happens so oftenly. Let's say I had two battles consequtively. Bam, game freezes in the loading screen. OK, replay those two battles. Bam, game freezes again after the battles (this is randomly). I can't play a game like this.Game seems good, sounds good. But what is it for if I can't play it properly? I highly not recommend this game because of the fatal bugs, unless you want to play a gamble with your money.Note: I have tried reinstalling, verifying integrity cache many times. No solutions. "

												I really enjoyed this game. It's incredibly immersive, with everything from a gripping story, well-drawn characters, and a superb fictional world. In terms of gameplay, it mixes RPG and Strategy elements, somewhat like the Final Fantasy Tactics series, and the balance works very well.The only thing I don't like is that it's a bit short - it took me about 9 hours to complete on my first play through - and the story ends quite suddenly. The ending doesn't exactly tie up all the loose ends, but hopefully DLC or a sequel will be brought out to solve that. On the whole though, it's fantastic, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fun single-player game that will keep you interested from start to finish. I bought it for about £11 because of a 40% off deal and I found it great value for money.			"

If you find this game on sale, I highly recommend it for fans of turn-based tactical RPGs.The combat system seems complex, but once you figure out the gimmick even the hardest fights become trivial.  Players are faced with numerous leadership decisions that have heavy consequences, which I like.  But after completion, the only driving factor for me to start up another campaign was the achievements I missed, so I wouldn't say that replay value is very high.  This is most likely due to how linear the game is.			"

												Amazing story, characters, art, and soundtrack. I HIGHLY recommend this game.The only possible downside: the combat system is intentionally different than your average tactical RPG. Normally you want to gang up on one opponent, move to the next, and so-forth. Here, you have to spread the damage. The game's initiative order works such that one of your characters gets a turn, then one of the enemies... even if there is one enemy left. So, ganging up on one enemy means that the others will go more often. In addition, the amount of life an opponent has left is tied to the damage he does.			"

												A fantastic story-driven game which, at times, reminds me of A Song of Ice and Fire (because of the way it's structured, jumping from the point of view of one character to another, and also because it's almost as dark and rough as GRR Martin's saga). I find the visuals to be absolutely stunning - bleak as the scenery might be, I think there's no denying it's also gorgeous. I know turn-based strategy games are not for everybody, but if you're looking for a good story and interesting, complex characters, give this one a try.			"

												An interesting find among games for the casual videogame player, ""The Banner Saga"" seems to be a mix of genres that aren’t to common. Part RPG, part turn based tactics, part survival simulator that seems to have nostalgic roots in the Oregon trail series, this game is complex enough for multiple play-throughs yet simple enough for players with an intense daily schedule to pick up, play and run off again on a whim. With a story setting in alignment with harsh Norse legends, the story centers around two perspectives for most of the game. One a war band of ice giants attempting to discover return to their homeland as an old enemy starts spontaneously growing in power and a band or human war refugees trying to outrun the same enemy and find a safe haven. Each group has a bandleader who must make difficult decisions in order to keep their own bands alive and in a feat of excellent imagination, each decision has consequences that can be felt later in ether story perspective or in the efficiency of your fighting strength. It’s very interactive for a game that mostly involves watching over a traveling band of people. The art surrounding this is crisp and beautiful with older hand drawn styled animation television cartoonists would use.The gameplay is divided into three major parts: One is the survival sim. The player watches over their banner caravan as it slowly travels from one destination to the next, encountering obstacles, managing resources to keep people from starving, and setting disputes among your more colorful caravan members. This part has a huge impact on combat when your band must defend itself from an enemy. The second is turn based combat. In chess like fashion, you select certain members of the caravan to defend it by placing each unit on a grid and taking turns to issue them commands. The third part is route customization, choices you make can change the story, therefore battles will change and your fighting units with it.As far as downsides go there was very few; there are a few bugs regarding turn based battles, but nothing anyone with any sort of patience would find hard to ignore and some story decisions seem to get so tangled that it’s possible to miss important plot devices. The ending also seems abrupt and unexplained, your it is hinted that there may be two opposing villainous forces facing off, only to fight a boss that seems unimportant to ether side and the whole game ends…it’s a bit confusing.All in all I recommend “The Banner Saga”.

												Exceptional gameplay and scenery! I really got excited with the concept art and of course with the music! The battle system is as easy as it can get and the story - is really an epic tale!To play the devil's advocate though, I want to say that the only thing that I missed in the whole game is the narration, and I think I would liked it more if the cut scenes were enriched with simple animation. As a non-English I sometimes found trouble in understanding some of the dialogue - therefore the story... Personally I think a narration would make the game even more enjoyable.Nevertheless it is beautiful and truly emotional! I was very glad to hear that a secont installment is on it's way! "

												Its a beautiful game, not so much even in terms of visuals, but in the story.  The game has a poetry and it leads you on an epic storybook-like tale.  You make meaningful decisions along the way, and based on those decisions your people, including playable companions might live or die. I'm writing this before banner saga 2 has been released, but the developers are saying that your actions in the first game will carry over which makes your actions in the first game all the more important.  The combat system is also a lot more interesting than a lot of tactical rpgs, and despite knowing the story, I've played the game all the way through 4 or 5 times now just because of how fun the combat is.I highly recommend this game.

												Medicore strategic combat. Medicore management of caravan supplies/character level progresson.---Fortunately, I play RPGs for the narrative and man this has an AMAZING STORY.Geme of Thrones-esque consquences for bad decisions (main characters die).But there's less than 10 hours of actual story development and it ends on a MASSIVE, TABLEFLIPPING cliffhanger.Those really invested in the story, brace yourself for the credit roll right at the climax of the game. It's akin to getting ♥♥♥♥♥ slapped in the face then being blindsided with a crudgel.For those really, REALLY invested in the story, pray for part 2. Sad part is no release date yet :(			"

												Great game. Just get it. Has a very quirky art style which is amazing. Has a great story that is affected y choices you make. Has very smooth and fun tactical turn based combat system.Would love to see a sequel but that might not happen to soon due to the people at king.com wanting to trademark the word saga. Stoic you have my full support and you should win the battle due to you trying to trademark 'the banner saga' before king tried 'saga', kings reasons are invalid and they've contradicted themselves multiple times for example:""We do not have any concerns that Banner Saga is trying build on our brand or our content.""Compare that with the statement in the company's opposition document:﻿""Applicant's THE BANNER SAGA mark is confusingly and deceptively similar to opposer's previously used SAGA marks.""Just get the game. sorry for the rant. But yeah this game is amazing. My game of the year. "

												One of the first ""Indie Games"" I've ever bought. And I have to say, without having finished it, this has got to be one of the coolest rpg's I've ever played. The gameplay is pretty much divided between three parts: combat, resource management, and dialogue choices. The combat is turn based, but it's not overcomplicated. It's simple, strategic, tough, but really rewarding when you win. Resource management is essentially how you choose to use the universal currency of the game, ""renown,"" to either buy supplies for your caravan, purchase items for your heroes, or upgrade your heroes' abilities. Like I said, this game is tough, but by far the most agonizing part of this game is the diabolical dialogue choices they give. They all have REAL impact. Your heroes will die or betray you, even if you've spent countless points upgrading their stats. There is no mercy. And because of the game's autosave feature, you can't just reload an earlier save. You have to live with the choices you've made. As noted before, I have not finished this game, but so far I've reached chapter four in roughly ten hours and it has been one of the most unique rpg game I've ever played. Definitely recommended.

												I love this game. The Banner Saga is like people always describe women they are in love with, beautiful inside and out. The art animations and overall feel of this game is stunning. I'm not exaggerating when I say that. I just stopped and stared at the main menu for bit when I first loaded the game. The gorgeous art is also put to good use by the caravan marching motif that dominates the gameplay when not in combat. And the music and sound design subtley accent the whole feel of the thing. The combat mechanics are simple yet incredibly deep. Which is the hallmark of great game design.The balance of breaking your enemies armor or trying to punch through it to damage his health, and thus reduce the damage he can do to your people, is the core of the design. It is a brilliant one. And every design decision accents that concept. Combat is almost entirely skill based, and so it feels like chess. It is extremely rewarding when you start to learn how to really play. And the game let's you learn easily, by doing training battles in camp against randomly generated enemies matched to your party's level.However, this game is also incredibly punishing to mistakes. something as simple moving an ally incorrectly so they cannot attack that turn can lose an entire battle. If an ally goes down they will be at reduced power/health until they can rest, costing valuable supplies to feed your caravan. Being aggresive in major battles can save your troops lives but take party members out of action when you need them most. Being defensive makes combat easier for your party but can cost troops. And troops have to eat so the more you have the more supplys you need to keep them going. And the wrong choice in a dialogue can send a maxed out, and extremely useful, party member off on a tanrum that gets him killed. Long story short: Even on medium this game feels like dancing on a razor's edge. And I love that too, maybe most of all.It is not without it's flaws however. The game only has autosave and it does so constantly. Which sucks when you mis-click. I clicked leave about 30 ""days"" in just as I saw there was one of the unique side conversations that I'd missed. I went to load and, of course, it had saved right after I left. So I loaded the save right before that, played the one battle to get to where I could do this elusive conversation, and realized that the incredibly awesome items that I'd bought before were replaced by crappy ones in the store. And no, I couldn't just load the later save and not have the conversation because it overwrote that one. Also, and more important in the grand scheme if less personally frustrating, The items, which are a very key component in advancing your parties power, are all over the place in power and usefulness and thier level is not always commensurate. Sometimes that is because of clever use by the player, giving them to the character that can best exploit it's effects... and sometimes not.In summary, this game is beautiful in both it's art and mechanics. If Viking Turn-Based Tactical RPG sounds like something you could ever enjoy, I strongly recommend this game.			"

												One of the best games I have ever bought on Steam or otherwise. The combat system is an amazing refresh on the traditional tactical war gamer, the art is incredible but what stands out the most to me is the story. The depth of the story and the variety of decisions you can make makes this game not only infinitely replayable, it makes you feel like every decision you make is critical. It is one of the few games of late that has made me reconsider my choices and scramble for a saved state, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.			"

												Haven't been this emotionally invested in a game in a very long time. Banner Saga is the story of leading a band of refugees through the viking wilderness against unbeatable odds at the end of the world. All choices have consequences, and there is never a clear wrong or right answer. Half the time i felt i was playing a viking version of oregon trail, but with the true nature of the characters you quickly forget youre playing a game, and believe these are real people, relying on you keep them alive. No walkthroughs, or reloading here, this is your story. Be warned, however, this is only the first part.			"

												This game is fantastic.  The story is tragic and epic.  The artwork attracted me to the game first with the thought that watching it as I play would be worth it even if the game wasn't so good.  But the story and the gameplay are wonderful, as is the music.  Along with Bastion, this is a game I'm recommending to everyone when the opportunity arises.I didn't realize it was part of a series when I bought it, so was surprised when it ended earlier than I anticipated (as in there is a huge map you can see, and this first part only covers a portion of it), but it's definitely worth it and I'm very excited for the sequel.

												While this game might not be for everyone, and in some ways it's a bit short, I have to say that it's a beautiful, thematic piece.  In addition, there's an almost Oregon Trail-esque feel to it because of the need to manage resources during travel.  Yet, unlike that game, this actually has a plot, and combat, with characters who possess distinct personalities.  It's a choice based game, which is wonderful, and even though many choices don't make a difference in what ultimately happens, they do impact resources, so one has to be careful what one does.  It's sufficient to say that I look forward to trying the sequel if it's half as good as this game.  There is sadness, but that just adds to the beautiful tapestry of this game.  For those who like to play games that aren't just about killing things, I recommend this title.			"

												This game is, wow it is amazing. Beautiful game overall, seriously, beautiful story, art, soundtrack, gameplay and ambience this game is a must play. The gameplay alone is something I can talk about for easily and hour, with an amazing health system this game plays like a PC fire emblem title with an amazing twist in your health and damage systems. Great story following two caravans, 1 which you follow for more of the game follows the story of Rook the leader of a caravan of clansmen fighters and what we would call giants(varl) is trying to save the world with his daughter.And the other one Hakon who actually is Varl leading another caravan doing pretty much the same thing. The story has a brilliant end, which I won't say. There is a lot more to the story than just that but, you should experience it yourself just trust me on that.The art is amazing I can't say much about it though just look at the damn screenshots and you will believe me.Soundtrack is an amazing orchestra composed by Austin Wintory, and it is also with what I can only describe as Norse vocals and such.The soundtrack only adds to the ambience as you travel through beautiful valleys and mountains with snow falling. Seriously this is probably the best looking game (not graphically in an art standpoint) I have ever played, Bastion taking a close 2nd.The only complaint I have of this game is a very personal one, I am not a very heavy or a very good reader, almost everything is read in this, but when voice acting is available, it is brilliant. Another one is that the split caravans kind of annoyed me mainly because Rooks story is much more interesting than that of Hakon's, but that problem is later fixed you will see.This game in a real standpoint has no problems from what I see, I mean it's a bit hard for some people but it is fair, so that isn't a problem. Seriously one of the most underrated games of 2014 I must give this game a 10/10 I love this game to death. One of my favourites. Seriously in my 10 favourite games of all time.Do I recommend it? HELL YES this game could go for $40 and I would still buy it even though it's only about 8-12 hours of gameplay. BUY IT NOW.			"

												The goodThe turn based battle is like chess with armor and HP.Unlike 99% of games, units with less HP do less damage ie HP is their attack valueDilemmas are good, give good immersion. Like in one dilemma, you are asked to wait someone to come but same as your character, you don't know when they will come if they will come at all.The mehAI derpingIgnoring activated abilities, ie Stone WallMove into your range so you can draw first blood.Keen on killing your units thus giving you turn advantage.The badMostly 2 types of battles, either thugs or dredge (stone ppl), and only one fight vs varl (giants). I'm ok with the lack of fight with varl though.Caravan, while being one them of the game (protect your kin), it doesn't impact much on the game. I even tried resting even without food will actually boost your morale, while a dozen people are dying each day you rest.EDIT: Bad morale causes worse events to happen so staving/not resting does have impact.More on The Caravan: Let them starve thread[stoicstudio.com]TIPS: Specialize armor breakers to 3/4 armor breakStay out enemy range and wait them come and draw first blood.

												What is Banner Saga?  Banner Saga is a combination of multiple choice style adventure game, resource management game, and turn based tactical combat game.  The original, Norse-based world is rich and intriguing and the writing, which dominates the non-combat parts of the game, is very well done.The real start of the show is the combat system.  It's very innovative and very different from anything I have ever seen.  A unit's hit points is also it damage, so if your unit takes damage, it won't be doing much of it own and units with a lot of hit points  you should tread very carefully around until you have whittled them down some.  Armor subtracts directly from potential damage, but you can choose to attack the armor instead, which is independant of your hit points.  Choosing when to attack the armor and when to attack the hitpoints is a key part of your strategy.Another different aspect is that you always take a turn with one of your units, followed by the enemy, no matter how many units each have with the exception of the last unit left standing.  This is one thing I've seen throwing a lot of people off.  Turn based games train you to focus on one enemy at a time, whittle him down, then turn on the next.  Trying to do this is not effective.  Instead, you'll want to injure all the enemies so that they can no longer do enough damage to hurt you, then take them all down quickly.  It's a very different approach and one that works quite well.If you're up for a tactical combat game with a deep combat system and a rich fantasy world, then this game is for you.			"

I have to admit that the game looks good but once your initial amazement with looks is over, there's nothing else left to make you want to play this game. Dialogues are very shallow, characters are not so interesting. Yes, there are choices but they don't really seem to impact the game significantly. Battle screen offers nothing new and very repetitive. (It really needs hexagons, squares limit the options)  "

												A fun turn base squad game with some annoyingly text adventure elements in its meta game.The Banner Saga plays like two games in one, first there is the part where you manage your army in the meta game on the world map, and second is the part where you controls units in turn base squad combat.  This format isn't new, and in fact it has been done repeatedly in recent years by games like X-Com and Xenonauts to name two.  While the game's format isn't new, it does a few things differently, which works some times, and doesn't other times.Am not going to go into too much detail about how the game plays, since the format is well known, instead am going to focus on what it does differently (for better or worst). To start off, in the TBS section of the game, your units have a default willpower value that increase as they level up.  They can use their willpower to move further, use an ability, or just do more damage. Willpower is finite resource as your units do not generate it during combat. Instead you get 1 willpower, which you can give to any of your units, for every enemy you defeat.  This extra resource management add a layer to the combat section of the game that it needs. The combat overall is decent, but without this extra element it would be unremarkable in any way.The other two elements that The Banner Saga does differently happen in its meta portion of the game.  First, there is a supply, i.e. rations. During most of the game, you are leading your caravan across the map from point A to B.  And during this time you have to keep your caravan feed, otherwise you'll start to lose troops and your morale will drop. And the bigger your caravan, the more supply you'll need to feed it on a daily bases. So having more troops for war, isn't always a good thing, especially if you don't have the supply to feed them.  This resource management makes sense and actually is kind of fun to deal with. The second thing, however, is rather annoying. Normally text adventure elements are fun. But not in this case, since there are quite a few choices that will results in a unit dying or leaving your group. This wouldn't be so bad, except that for the most part, it seems totally arbitrary. I remember a section of the game where I told one of my units to start a fire, in order to create a distraction, and after it was done, that named character vanished. No real reason was given, and the only thing that was certain, was that they were gone.  And this is nearly game breaking since you spend a large portion of the game leveling up these characters, so to lose one in what feels like random chance is infuriating.Overall, the game is fun. It does a few cools things, and one really annoying thing. But in the end, I would still recommend it to other people.			"

It had a great combat system, plenty of complexity for those who want it, but can be bullied through by those who don't. The characters had depth and the world proved intricate and ancient, artistic and creative elements were never dissapointing. the only thing missing was the other half of the game. If you are treating this as chapter 1 and plan on following it though the series i would reccommend getting this title around 5-10, as this game has limited replayability and could be beaten in a day if you put yourself to it.looking forward to the next installments, will definitely continue my saga.

												I highly recommend this game for those that love story, art, and strategy. The combat system is awesome. It's easy to learn, but a little difficult to master. Once you find that nice new strategy or trick to get through fights more effectivly, you feel a great sense of success and accomplishment. While the combat is great, the story and the art is where it's at. The landscapes are beautifully drawn and there are a ton of little details in the artwork that have stories of their own. The story of the game itself had me thinking of something from The Song of Ice and Fire series. This game gets you attached to characters and if you aren't carefull, or sometimes just to pull a George R.R. Martin, you'll have those characters violently ripped from you in a way that makes you feel guilty for not saving them. The game is full of moments that make you feel happy, depressed, relieved, exited, and afraid. Highest of fives to the developers of this game. They did an amazing job, completely worth the money. And if you want a trial, download their free multiplayer game ""The Banner Saga: Factions"". While it doesn't give you the amazing elements of the story, it lets you try out the combat and get a feel for the game. The Banner Saga is, once again, well worth your money.			"

												From a gripping story, to characters that feel real, The Banner Saga is an enormous feat of brilliance. Masterfully written, an art style filled with heart and soul, and gameplay that will leave you sweating, this game brings “saga” to it’s truest sense in both scale and experience. And what a saga it is.With an opening that states “The Gods are Dead” you can tell that this is a harsh and unforgiving world, and you’ve been thrusted into the middle of it, with your clansmen at your side as you travel from settlement to settlement more often than not just trying to survive.The gameplay is tactical and turn based, similar to XCOM and Shadowrun Returns, so before buying I’d suggest looking into it to be sure it is something you consider fun. If you are unsure I’d suggest letting this be your first! Though, even if the gameplay is not your cup of tea, if you like well told stories with great characters you might want to play it solely for that reason. Aside from a VERY abrupt ending the story and progression is golden. As you journey across the land the game feels very Organ Trail-ish as you watch your banner wave against the wind. Though, dying from dysentery is not a thing, so you can put that fear to rest if the mention of “Organ” gives you flashbacks.Being funded by Kickstarter, the budget for this game did not allow for it to be fully voiced acted aside from a handful of moments where a few main characters will speak, but with the soundtrack by Austin Wintory (Journey) you will hardly mind. The soundtrack alone is worth the price of this game.The experience refuses to leave my mind even days after completion. The Banner Saga has left me breathless and is one of those games that is both amazing and shows the power of what a well crafted game feels and looks like. I cannot suggest this game strongly enough!P.S. This game could also be called, “The Banner Saga, or,♥♥♥♥♥♥Continues to Get Real even when you think the♥♥♥♥♥♥has Reached it’s Realest Levels.”			"

												This is one of the more refreshing RPGs I have played...and in a while too.It's testament that a good game does not need advanced graphics and effects to make the player have a good time. That being said, the artwork is really something at least I could appreciate.The story doesn't fail to engage you and every decision you have to make will certainly leave you wondering. Not to mention there will be times of frustration, the kind you get from watching Game of Thrones.Anyway...I can't really find anything negative to say about The Banner Saga, although at the end I was left wanting for more. It is short in my opinion and it could use some more features, like bigger battles and more RPG elements such as conversations.I for one hope to see more of this in the future!			"

												So far I've only played it a little bit, but It's a novel that you play. THIS GAME IS FANTASTIC! I normally don't play turn-based games like this, the closest I had played before this would be the classic D&D games, but the combat is easier to understand, and its sort of like chess where each piece has a range to move in, its own abilities, and a person you know from the story instead of a wooden pawn! Tutorials are well written, and easy to understand. I feel like I'm going to log some good hours, with multiple playthroughs. The Banner Saga is probably one of the greatest games I have ever played to date. Rich story, history, characters who have old friends and thier own personalities, beautiful artwork and locations, a giant (no pun intended XD) map with information about every treeline, mountain range, pool of water and landmark. 10/10, buy this game.

												I bought ""the Banner Saga"" because I was impressed by the combat mechanics in the earlier multiplayer game under the same name. As expected, the in-game battles were satisfying but what I did not expect was that it turned out to be one of the best RPG games I have played in a long time. It is a short game that can be finished within 6 hours. The graphics were strickly 2D (pretty nonetheless!) and there were no animations apart from some combat moves. There wasn't even much of expression change or voice acting for the characters but somehow you still felt strongly attached when good/bad things happened to them. The atmosphere created strong immersion and the story was short but gripping. The choices you made along the way had real consequences, some were immediate, while others were only revealed much later. Throughout the game, you would be asked to make many hard choices about which you often felt emotional. The journey was exhausting and full of twists and turns. Although I felt that the game ended prematurely (Spoiler: what about the ""darkness""?), the ending was actually quite moving.If I have to use one sentence to sum up my impression of the game it will be: ""the Banner Saga"" doesn't do a whole lot but what it does offer, they were done very well.

All the beat-downs in this game makes it feel special when you catch a break.**The game recommends lowering the difficulty setting from the get-go.Oh did i mention this is really hard?Well Screw You Banner SagaSeriously,Screw.

												Excellent game for a reasonable price. The story is excellent, the music engaging, and the visuals are beautiful. I spent about 9 hours working through the story and the game felt long enough to be worth the lower cost. Kudos to the creators of the game and I hope to see more in the future. If you understand that the game seems to be a linear story, with some decisions you make affecting the small details, then I don't think you'll be disappointed. The world seems larger than what my story included, so I am not sure if there are major deviations in the story you can take. I don't remember big decisions on where to go, soI am not sure about that.Either way, it was an entertaining and compelling story.			"

												I am four hours into the game.Pros: The artwork is beautiful, the story is pretty good, it was on sale, the branching storyline due to what you choose is interesting! The combat on the archers' side is pretty simple & funCons: The combats on the vaal's side and the ""war"" mode is frustrating, repetitive, and dull. 1) Vaal's are like giant hulks of slow, very slow meat that can neither attack range or heal, they can hardly get to where they're trying to go most of the time 2) ""War"" requires you to fight twice without healing so you can save more troops, that's work 3) Trying to have enough supplies and keeping morale high but not being able to hunt for food is like Oregon Trail but worseIt's a good game if you're looking for a bit of a challenge.

												This is an amazing work of art, for starters. To keep it brief as can be, it's Oregon Trail in terms of ""Watch something move across a horizon while waiting for♥♥♥♥♥♥to go wrong that needs your attention"".It isn't as ruthless and esoteric as the problems you would face in Oregon Trail, but it doesn't pull its punches. People will die, it will be your fault, and you will struggle with the guilt and shame to the very end. ""Could I have done better? Could I have saved so many people's lives?"" is a question that lingers with me after completion.That's a good point to say the game is brief. It's part 1 of a trilogy. I had no idea until a google search pulled up that information. In regards to a first act this is quite the package. It ends so abruptly, but it couldn't end on a more painful and lingering note that demands you look forward to sequels.Aside from the scenarioes requesting your tense attention, there are several tactics-RPG style combat episodes. Enough to not feel like the game is void of tactic content, but also scattered enough to feel it does not take the role of being a tactics game first, before good story telling. The tactics depth in this game may not be as diverse as titles like Disgaea in terms of units and customization, however it is a brilliantly done experience. You'll find yourself forced to pace out a battle rather than simply focus-firing down targets in quick succession. Balancing weakening your opponents to prevent more pain dealt to yours, and preparing them for the decisive blow to end them- and most importantly the When.8/10. If this game was delivered as the whole package, it would easily deserve a 10/10 for its remarkable content and storytelling, especially with the agency you have within to feel the guilt and consequences continue to burn down through the course of your adventure. The gameplay, the story, and visual/audio art comes together into an experience that could not have been delivered better, save for the whole deal.			"

												The Banner Saga is a Norse mythos inspired story with mixed elements of Oregon Trail and turn-based strategy.  For much of it you are switching between two groups travelling through lands being overrun with giant monsters called Dredge and you can lead as the type to fight on the front lines or as a tactical advisor with many fights being avoidable. My initial impressions were it was a strong story with interesting travel choices and somewhat weak combat, but the more I played the more I realized there were quite a few layers of strategy to employ well beyond simply trying to beat down your opponents.The story is stupendously engaging, and even knowing one possible outcome I had to go right back in and do it again - with less screw ups! Even though you are constantly strained, on the run, and it is overall rather dour, there are moments which remind you there can be glimmers of light in even the darkest of times. I felt for the characters who were largely a ragtag band doing all they could to survive as their world fell apart around them.Even with its simpler game play, the art and audio fit great, and there's nothing like suddenly noticing the panorama is filled with skulking monsters bearing down on you. The soundtrack was a great addition to my playlist unlike anything I had before.Overall, it's challenging (especially on hard) and I've never been so engaged by a game where I was constantly on the edge of losing and if you remotely enjoy random event games or turn-based strategy then TBS is a must.

												I would have very likely overlooked this game completely if not for its promotion on EpicBattleAxe.com. That is my major bias out there for all to see. But another bias I have is a love for turn-based RPG titles that first bloomed with the original Jagged Alliance. Even after reading reviews, watching videos and listening to a lengthy discussion of the title, I admit to being unsure as to what sort of game to expect. The gorgeous art style and the fact that it is a turn-based RPG are the only two things I really knew before purchasing the title. Nonetheless, I was almost immediately impressed and addicted soon after. The Banner Saga is a minimalistic title that some may more bluntly call simplistic. This would be a fair criticism but the game presented a satisfying challenge throughout and most importantly, encouraged me (the player) to live with the decisions I made. This is where the simplicity ends and the nuanced and often dark morality of the title plays out. There aren't really any good or bad decisions to make and I was careful to police myself in accepting the consequences of my actions. This is something that is encouraged with recording progress being restricted to an autosave feature. Many of the design choices that may superficially seem unsophisticated became sensible after experiencing them. This is true of everything from the combat to the progression system. What was most important to me was that every little choice truly seemed to matter whether immediately or much later in the game. This certainly isn't a title for everyone but fans turn-based games and especially RPGs are certainly in for a unique experience at the very least.I eagerly anticipate the sequel.			"

It has a very functional and fast-paced, turn-based combat system and the choices you're constantly pressed to make really do have an impact on the story that unfolds before you. I've enjoyed every moment of it thus far.So why the thumbs down? Inexcusably, it doesn't work in off-line mode. This really ticks me off. My internet can be shaky and this game has absolutely no on-line component whatsoever. Fix it. Now.			"

												To be honest, I was kind of disappointed with banner saga. The begining looked wonderful, and the art style is beyond my expectations. That being said, you eventually have to play the game. The game is like Oregon trail, where you lose supplies/people because you didn't guess the right prompt.  The story is told though dialog boxes which severely disappointed me considering the opening annimation was awesome. Then the rest was just a guy standing there in a picture with a dialog box; he doesn't move his mouth or motion, just a portriat of him. Then entire game.Combat has.... some..... stratagy to it. Armor and strength. You wittle away armor and try to take away as much strength as you can before the enemy does. In same cases, the AI doesn't play statigically and just hits the closest thing to it. In some cases they focus one target until it is dead. increasing the difficultly only adds more AI with this midset. Of course, you play the same tactic, only to realize each hero can only level up by last hitting the enemy. So yea, some stratagy.Some spoilers beyond this point but was my biggest gripe with the game. The story is cut half way through the game, leaving alot of room for a sequel. Though, trying to justify the price of $25 for a story that is cut just at the good part made me feel more conned then hoping for a sequel. Kind of like Halo 2 ""Sir, to finish this fight"" CREDITS!			"

												This game is very good at what it sets out to do.  It delivers an interesting story and thought provoking setting, encased in beautiful 2D animation.  I've played through it several times and I can stand by the statement that it is a very polished, and enjoyable experience.However, in my opinion there are 2 main faults of the game.  Without spoiling the ending, I will warn anyone reading this who hasn't bought the game that this game is not finished.  It is the first part of a trilogy.  The ending is shockingly sudden and does not resolve anything.  This would not bother me except for the fact that this game's Steam page does not indicate this in any way.  If they wanted to be accurate they should mark it as Banner Saga part 1 or they should say something in the description.  The other complaint that I have is that the ending is an A or B choice.  The choices you make along the way to the end do radically affect your journey, although they could have doubled down on that as well.  However, at the end you have to make a simple decision, and you have no further control over the ending.  I recommend this game to RPG fans, with those two disclaimers in mind.   If you want to know more about the ending before making your choice, there's no shortage of forum discussions on the topic. "

												A beautiful game, with story driving choice, great atmosphere and rich world. Characters are crudely designed which is unfortunate, but the story is good if you have the patience to read as most of the dialogues are not voice acted but just writen. The end arrives too abruptly but I believe this game will be succesful enough that at least one sequel will follow as there are so many loose ends it would be a crying shame to leave it at that. Gameplay is simple but the strategy is challenging, definitely worth 20 (e/$). Un jeu magnifique, avec des choix qui influencent la progression de l'histoire, dans une séduisante atmosphère et un monde riche. Les personnages sont peu développés ce qui est malheureux, mais l'histoire est captivante si l'on possède la patience de lire les dialogues qui ne sont pas doublés. La fin arrive trop subitement, mais je suppose que ce jeu aura assez de succès pour permettre la publication d'au moins une suite, car il y a trop de choses laissées en suspens, ce serait une honte de s'arrêter là. Le système de jeu est simple mais la stratégie est assez intéressante, ce jeu vaux largement 20e.			"

I backed it on Kickstarter, so full disclosure: I might be biased. But really--I haven't seen a game this pretty in years. The tactical combat is also challenging and fun without getting too frustrating. That's not to say you won't find yourself going back to your last save, though--even on normal difficulty.My complaints are nitpicky. The dialogue choices don't affect gameplay in noticeable ways. Also, the grammar stickler in me is driven crazy by the clear lack of proofreading dialogue and description. Also, the ending of the game is a bit lackluster. However, that doesn't mean that the Banner Saga isn't a game worth playing. It's an experience worth having. Play it.			"

												Game wasn't as good as I expected. Story can get very confusing. Gameplay gets boring really fast and there aren't new elements at the begining to keep you motivated.The game is kind of unique though thats why I will recommend it but I would say better wait for it to get cheaper or grab it during some sale. Theme and music are really nice too.			"

												KING CAN SUCK MY-*Ahem*""The Banner Saga"" is what I'd describe as being a ""Low Fantasy-Viking Epic-SRPG-Multiple Choice Exam.""The campaign puts you in control of one of two caravans (each with their own respective units) which are either fleeing or trying to fight back against an invasion of the mysterious, warlike, and seemingly inorganic Dredge. The perspective flips between the two caravans at several points throughout the story which should keep most players engaged should they grow bored with the story of one caravan.The battles are pretty much standard fare. They take place on a square map and make use of a grid upon which units move. The major deviation from the norm that I noticed is that your units have TWO ""health bars:"" Armor and Strength. Armor functions as a mitigator to damage against Strength. Also, Strength and Health are effectively one and the same. As a unit takes damage to its health/strength, they deal lesser amounts of damage and come closer to being knocked out (permadeath for individual characters IS present, but only through choices made in the story.)As your caravan travels, they expend the supplies which are needed to keep your caravan from dying of starvation. You can fairly easily maintain your supply count by spending ""Renown,"" the game's currency which you gain from story choices, winning battles, and killing enemies. However, renown is also used to upgrade units and to purchase equipment. So juggling the effectiveness of your units with the wellbeing of your caravan can be a bit tricky.All in all, I found the ""The Banner Saga"" to be fairly challenging and I would recommend it to any gamers who're fond of RPGs and strategy games.

												The Banner Sage seems like it was meant to be a well done graphic novel or movie, and somewhere along the way they decided to make it into a game. But it falls far short of being engaging or fun. They've certainly built a beautiful and well-populated world with a rich map and lots of back story. But in the end your choices don't seem much to matter and the chess style combat is boring. I was woo'd by the graphics and some of the reviews into buying this game, but it just isn't fun. While the game kicks off with sweeping landscapes and cinematics, it quickly falls flat as you spend the next ten minutes reading text-only dialogue that seems to have been written by a college freshman. And once you hit combat, you quickly realize why this game is a dud. Unlike successful turn-based games like Civilization or XCOM, where you manipulate your armies and make a series of choices in a turn, in Banner Sage you will tediously take turns moving a single soldier and then waiting for the opponent to move one soldier in an ill-defined ""initiative"" order. So you conceivably could move your hero, and then have to wait six or so turns before you can move him again, and the characters lack the well-defined individuality of a Dungeons and Dragons or other RPG instead boasting only armor and strength characteristics, so instead of a stratgeic chess game or an engaging RPG, The Banner Saga ends up as a tedious combination of The Oregon Trail and backgammon.

												I've always loved Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics while growing up, and seeing this game during the steam sale, I decided to give it a shot, as the general layout of the game looked decent, and the story seemed to be solid based on the reviews. It has been amazing this far, and I love the choices available to be made along the way, even if I don't realize the consequences. I enjoy choosing dialogue that matches what I personally feel, and though some of the choices lead to loss (sadly I lost two strong characters in my party), it does force me to be careful with my choices, regarding strategy and character upgrading, lest I stack one character with everything and lose him or her later on. It reminds me of permadeath in Fire Emblem, as I always feel I'm weighing options carefully every time a choice comes up in case I lose one of my party due to a twist in the plot.Battle wise, I'm finally getting used to the armor/strength system, very different from say, maxing out your general in fire emblem and never taking damage with him in the front lines. Every character can be fragile, and I've had several close battles where I've temporaily forgotten the slight intricacies of the Banner Saga that trip me up (allies can't move through allies, choosing armor vs strength dmg).Overall, I highly recommend this game, and I'm definitely moving on to multiplayer once I finish going through the rest of the 1 player story; I can't wait to see what happens next.

												Beautiful game, great gameplay. The combat is fun once you get the hang of it and all the characters feel unique without being overly complicated. That being said, the game feels pretty short, and the storyline, while immersive and engaging, is rather linear. What would be really nice is if there were more side objects and other paths to take, both to add gameplay and make the travelling more varied.			"

												""Saga"", as I think we should call it now, is a breath taking epic. Do not look for twitch gameplay, do not blaze through dialog screens to get down to level grinding.

												Great game. Just get it. Has a very quirky art style which is amazing. Has a great story that is affected y choices you make. Has very smooth and fun tactical turn based combat system.Would love to see a sequel but that might not happen to soon due to the people at king.com wanting to trademark the word saga.

It does a good job of introducing the world's lore throughout the course of the game at a steady pace. The combat is straightforward without much RNG involved, but remains challenging even on normal mode. The decisions you make in the game both inside and out of combat have immediate and reverberating effects throughout the rest of the story.

												95% of this game is beautiful. The writing is great, the art is gorgeous. They do a fantastic job of just letting you play the game. You make a choice, you deal with the consequences. You're totally immersed. Only a few other games (Walking Dead) have made me feel regret for choices I've made. Not in a 'oh I played the game wrong, and I regret that' sort of way. But more like in a 'I wonder if...' sort of way. Looking wistfully back down the road, thinking about the path you didn't take, the person you hurt, the hard choice you had to make, but knowing you have to press on.And then they throw all that beauty out the window on the final battle. Turns out, you should have been min/max'ing the entire time. Turns out you are going to be railroaded into a very specific strategy with very specific characters. Oh you wanted to play the story your way and chose not to use Allette so she's still level 1? That sure does suck for you! Because you MUST use her in the final battle. Through the game, the combat was challenging, I never finished a fight without a few knock-outs on my side. I even lost a few. But choices you made on the battle field affected the story. It felt like a struggle, but one that you were getting through. You never restarted or replayed a battle, you just made due with the consequences of your good or bad decisions. I loved that! Which made the bizarre try-hard 1337zor final battle all the more upsetting. I still can't beat it. Not with the character selection I ended up with, the choices I made in the game set me up *terribly* for the final battle. So...what? Just restart and play it again, this time with the final battle in mind? To me that just completely negates everything that I loved about the game in the first place.I would still recommend the game. It's beautiful. With these two caveats: Level up Rook and Allette, and put all your points in Armor-break.			"

												Going into this game, I wasn't 100 percent sure of what to expect. The trailers seened vague, but the art and turn-based strategy combat lured me in. I did not expect to enjoy this game as much as I did.To describe the game simply, it is like Fire Emblem combined with Oregon Trail. The combat involves switching between you and your opponent everytime either of you move your unit. There are definately some unique factors that you must consider before leveling a certain stat or choosing characters to battle. You also couldn't just do one thing over an over again. You couldn't smack their strength directly every single time, sometimes you had to take out some armor, or use a skill. Probably one of the more frustrating parts of this combat was that once you moved a character, you couldn't cancel it, even if you didn't take an action after that. It led to some unfortunate battles involving one character getting in the way of all of my party, or getting mercilessly slaughtered. Almost all battles made me fear what could happen. The enemies nicely develop at the level of your team, so no battles are entirely a stomp. Overall though, the combat was engaging and fulfilling.The second part of the gameplay was the travelling. You travel with caravans filled with Fighters, Clansmen, Varl, and Supplies. You have to always think out your choices and they often have big effects on what happens to your group. You always have to think out whether or not you should buy more supplies here, or if you should rest and waste a day's worth of supplies, but raise morale for better combat. You are often rewarded by thinking out your choices, but sometimes, just playing the nice guy all the time just won't cut it. You may grow tiresome of having to watch your group move all the time, but the artwork was so beautiful, and those periods of time could give you time to sort out your thoughts on what your next move was.The gameplay isn't the only part of it though. This game has some of the most captivating art of any game I've played. The gorgeous, epic landscapes and style of drawing were just so visually appealing. At the same time, it could remind you of the bleak hopelessness that faced you, and inspire you. The soundtrack was also great. It fit the viking theme just right, but would never be overwhelming.As for the story, it's quite interesting. Although it may seem straightforward at first, the gradual learning of details and character development leads you to truly wonder about your previous predispositions. You really develop some connections with certain characters, but some others remain stale and mysterious. I won't spoil anything, so I'll move on.Now the game isn't without its flaws. There have been times when I just stared at the text on my moniter and just said ""What the ♥♥♥♥."" Certain events just seem to happen with no plot build-up or reason. It was like the writers just suddenly decided something needs to happen. Although it keeps the game interesting, it leaves you angry because it makes it seem like your choices were just meaningless and that they have no impact on the outcomes of the game. I also wish that combat was a little touched up, as some things can be frustrating.Overall, I found the game to be deeply enjoyable, and changed how I view and rate other games. The Banner Saga just implemented so many things that affected the gaming experience. I do agree though, that the game is a little pricy. I managed to grab it on sale for around $15.00, and I don't regret my decision. Take it how you will. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good story, character development, and strategy. 9/10.			"

												Granted, I did not play this for very long. But the battle is clunky, boring, and has very annoying mechanics - you can be diagonally adjacent to an enemy, but not attack. you can move an archery character only once, so if you haven't gauged the distance to be able to attack an enemy correctly, you basically forfeit the attack that turn. Very frustrating, and the pretty scenery is not worth it, especially when you factor in that you really have no context for how to make choices in your dialogues.			"

												Only Kickstarter could have allowed for something this creative.In an age of next gen technology and the a rush to make more games melt your graphics card while trying to achieve surreal effects, The Banner Saga reminds you that at the end of the day, it is all about the experience.Anyone with a love for Norse mythology will see how it has inspired this world, but Stoic has put in enough effort to give it a life of its own. The world is peeled away and revealed a bit at a time, allowing you to learn how to play the game and discover much more interesting developments. It is the end of the world and TBS does not let you forget it. Beautiful, throaty vocals provide a very emotional soundtrack. There is a nostalgic quality to the alien vocals, filled with sadness and rare surges of inspiration in connection with the main story points. The game is filled with stunning backgrounds and still images, which might not inspire some players to dive in, but the story is really brought forth through text and dialogue, fleshing out characters, while leaving enough to the imagination.TBS's main strength lies in its replayability. Different characters might die, and some will have no involvement in the plot at all. And this game is HARD! The decisions you have to make will leave you questioning what is the right course of action for your group, or for you yourself as a player. What do you feel comfortable doing, who you can trust, if you should risk another fight or run while you still have a chance. For such a simplistic interface, TBS poses very deep and interesting questions.The only flaw with this game is the ending. And it is an important flaw. Poor character builds will result in you have a very frustrating end boss fight. My first play through required hours for me to win and I hated it with time. It left such a sour taste in my mouth that I had to wait a while before replaying, and yes, a great experience from the beginning, loved the battles and challenges, until I reached the end again. If you have anger problems stay away from this game, or like me, it might make your blood pump pure rage and wonder if that pain in your head is what happens when neurons decide to implode. I would love for people to buy this, but not on the strength of this game alone, but for what Stoic will accomplish with this trilogy. An beautiful animated cinematic opens the game, and I couldn't help but wish that there had been more moments like that and more voiced characters. The Banner Saga is a very rare treat for the imagination and one where I really can't wait to see what happens next.			"

												You need to play this if you ""can sort of almost like a turn-based game"" cause it is the best game-gasm I've had in years. A compelling story where you influence it and the characters within it - like killing them off with a bad choice. Turn-based strategy where placement and intelligent choices matter. RPG elements that aren't ever in the way of the story but feels like natural development of the characters - just like their story. Beautiful graphics, who doesn't like a style like the good old disney movies? You know what? I could go on, but you get the point.I cannot recommend this enough. MUST buy for anyone not appalled by story-based games and gameplay.			"

												Overall it's a good game. Story is in depth, art is amazing. My onyl complaint is the combat system. It's an alternating turn system, so no matter how many guys are on one side or who is winning each team gets a turn after the other. It really makes the game much more difficult than it needs to be. It feels to me like instead of designing good AI that can give you a challenge it just rigs it to cheat. For example, you start off outnumbered. Kill a few but the computer always gets a turn after you, so what ends up happening is you're winning and they have one unit left but because they always get a turn that one unit the enemy has ends up killing 3 of your guys (which injures them crippling you in future fights) when you realistically should have the advantage and should be able to easily dispatch them. Like how it would be in real life.. In theory it sounds like it would add challenge, and it does, but comes off more like a rigged fight. It becomes really infuriating when this happens when the AI has a ranged unit left, because they hit hard. So they snipe your guys and then run away. I hope they fix this in future games. Otherwise great game. Feels like a fantasy, strategy Oregon trail.			"

												Wow. Just wow. This game blew me away. Almost everything, the story, the artwork, the combat, all except the brevity is absolutely stunning. The story is incredible, especially in its depth, and had me engrossed from minute one. It's a world that feels ancient... With other games, I've usually found the world to be interesting, but it always seems new, not like it has existed for ages. Stoic has done an amazing job creating a world that draws you in and holds you. The one drawback was that the game was too short, leaving me longing for more, and I hope beyond hope that Stoic makes a sequel, or an expansion. If you're looking for an amazing story-driven game, this is it.			"

												The Banner Saga simply blew me away. Everything about this game was an incredible experience, from the animation to the soundtrack (Big love to the artists). The gameplay could use some refining and updating, hopefully in the future sequels.But where the game realy shines is in the story; you really feel like you are living an epic saga, an exodus to save the world, where your actions have reactions and consequences throughout the game. The Banner Saga will give you joy and despair in its amazing storytelling.			"

												Sorry to say that bue The Banner Saga is a disappointment to me. As much as I like tactical turn based combat and the impressive 2d art style, the lack proper voice overs and sparse music breaks the game for me. There are voice overs but there incredibly rare (a line here and a line there, minimal at best) and the music while beeing fine is also used too little. The result is a game that for the most part is dead silent. Sitting there in front of the monitor reading the countless story related diaglogs is very tedious. I have no problem with reading books but reading from monitors is quite tiring for the eyes.I just don't get why a game that was so well funded on kickstartet is not fully voiced. There is no graphics engine to speak of, no 3d-models or textures. It's all hand drawn 2d and that is good. But why did they not take the money and time and have it fully voiced? There are speakers there, just far far to rarely used.Edit: I have to edit my review and have to correct the score from 'no' to 'hell no'. I played through the entire game fairly easily on normal difficulty but the final fight is impossible for me to win. I simply don't have the right characters properly skilled. You can misdevelop your party without even knowing ending up in the final fight you can no longer win. I would need to start the entire game over developing my party just for that final fight. That is such a stupid design that I'm lost for words how such crap could come ex-BioWare-devs. Banner Saga ist my pesonal favorite for disappointment of the yeat.			"

												Although comparable to Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem, both of which are games I enjoy immensely, the Banner Saga surpasses the two by combining realism and fantasy in a way that makes it a completely unique tactical RPG.How the player sees and interacts with the world of the Banner Saga, that's the fantastic aspect of this game.Yes, there are people that can wield lightning. There are also gigantic humanoids with horns. ...and moving statue-things that threaten the world as it is known. The artistic and musical portrayal of these details, the stylistic choices in regards with character design and interface, made the narrative blend seamlessly with gameplay.The Banner Saga's realism shows in the limitations emphasized in the gameplay. Each playable character is unique and has its own predefined capabilities. They can gain levels and improve, but only to a certain point. The player's choice of which characters he uses becomes more crucial because of this. In addition to that, time constraints and logistical pressures add a sense of urgency and weight to the story and the choices made by the player.As fun as FE was because of it, you can't just train your characters until they become completely over-powered. You don't have the time nor the option. In spite of the endless possibilities that FF Tactics provided with its class-system, you can't change a person's job on a whim. Unlike what many optimists may have you believe, individual people aren't pieces of clay to be molded into any shape or form.TL;DR The Banner Saga doesn't leave everything up to the player. This game is clear about what it wants to convey and how it wants to convey it. Did I ever wish I had more control over a situation when I played it? Dear lord, yes. That didn't stop me from enjoying the fact that my decisions mattered. "

												Awesome and punishing at the same time, just keeps you coming back for more! The music and theme of the story complement each other perfectly and make for a very enjoyable experience.I have only two complaints, firstly the combat can be a little too slow, whilst its not an action orientated game it could do with a little polish to make it feel smoother. Second, I felt that the choices you made that affected the army didn't make as much of a difference as you were led to believe; If you mastered the party combat, it didn't matter if you made all the wrong choices and were left with a decimated army. This made me feel like it wasn't important to try and save your army.Those two point aside, its beautifully crafted and the narrative between the characters is compelling and pulls you in, (making you want to know more and explore as much of the history as they will tease you with) permeated with morally grey choices that are explored through the dialog, hugely affecting who stays in the party and the course your journey takes.

												This game is just pure awesome! The story of the game was a lot of fun, getting attached to the characters and then something sudden happens, brings saddness to the whole thing. But having the advantage of changing of how the story goes it awesome. This game brings back memories of the old days of play the orignal 'The Oregon Trail' game with the survival of your caravan and its people of supplies. The orchestrated score of this game fits in so perfectly with this game its just wonderful to just sit there and listen to it. The only bad thing what I really don't like is that I wish you could sell some of the items that you don't want to gain some renown but overall, I highly recommend this game to others, you'll just fall in love with the whole thing. I really hope there is more to come!			"

												This game is superb. it has a lot of things going for it, in a way that make its deficiancies irrelevant. lack of voice acting is overshadowed by good character writing and varying storyline, where choices you make have some immediate consequences, and some that simmer in the backround. beware that the story will end abruptly, seeing as it is only the first part of a larger story. on the combat aspects of the game, it seems to me that full on battles are either hard to lose, easy to avoid, or few and far between. the skirmishes that take up the majority of the game's combat are solid and very nicely animated, and throughout the entire game i found no bugs or moments where the AI pulled bull****. except... possibly... do not trust him. hopefully, who i talk about will become obvious to you.

												Biggest gripes:1. No manual save, which seems at odds with the game's claim of empowering choice to determine the storyline.2. Characters don't die in battle, but they can die from Story dialog choices. If you want to check the other options, you likely have about 30 minutes or so of work to get back to where you were from the previous autosave/s.3. The actual turn-based RTS portion is atrocious. Each side alternates a turn for each unit in order, but if you have 6 people on the field and your opponent has 2, they get to move their characters 3x for every time your individual character moves. If those last 2 units left are heavy hitters then expect to lose at least 1-2 units before you put them down. I was expecting something like X-Com or Fire Emblem and it ended up being Chess without the ability to determine what piece you want to move.It's very pretty, but it's not fun to play.			"

												The game itself plays fine finding a mix of both army managment as well as grid based combat. The story is ok but the game seems very short for a $25 dollar purchace. I'm unsure if they intend to continue the story in future patches if so it could very well be worth the money however at this time i'd suggest waiting for it to go on sale.If you just want to sit down and play the same story anywhere between 3-5 times to see all the different things that can happen with the events then get it.However if your not into Fire Emblem or tabletop DnD style games then avoid this title.also don't expect the game to baby you, you will lose people and you will most likely meet defeat more than once.Pros :Challenging tactical combat with (somewhat) randomized enemy forces Story is intersting for the most part.Art is fantastic during character conversations.Cons: Game feels very short for a $25 dollar investment.Music while fitting the mood of the game does feel repetitive.Replay value is limited at best.

												this game is very atmospheric, has a great story and for the $10 i paid, i enjoyed it.however, this game's combat is trash. i have no problem with the tactical turn based style. the problem is that in order for that style to work you have to create a system where there is ONE set of rules, and everyone must abide by it, friend or foe.this game does not do that. your enemies can straight up cheat. they are not bound by anything even resembling the same rules you are, it turns the combat into a tedious chore to see the next cutscene, at best, and at worst nearly impossible.also, the supply system is more needless faff that adds nothing to the game, but lets it pretend it's SODEEP because your choices can cause you to lose supplies. of course, it's mostly meaningless, as clansmen are worthless and you can just run from battle when you encounter it in the campaign screen. it just feels like needless padding.that said, i still enjoyed the game. in easy mode it's about 6 hours long, and in harder modes it's padded out by fake difficulty as your enemies cheat harder and harder, forcing you to redo the tedious♥♥♥♥♥battles.don't pay more than $10 for this game.

												I loved this game.  Emphasis on the love because of one tiny detail.  The big bad boss near the end of the game.  Because of my bad choices I found it was impossible at my personal skill level and my characters level to beat the game.  I had lost people along my journey, both improtant and not so, but I kept pushing on.  Until I was unable to do so, the game just could not be beat and I refused to turn down the difficulty.  However, it is truly an incredible game filled with an incredible art style and supported by superb animations.  It bestows upon you a captivating story that you don't want to end.  It has given me characters that when they died, literally made me shout ""NOOOO!"" at my screen.  The choices the game gives you could range from catastrophic to harmless, and I found every time I made a choice, even if it was a bad one, that I wouldn't change it, that's how I thought to best handle the situations and if that caused horrible repercussions, so be it.So long as you don't play as I do, you'll have a captivating and fun experience.

												Link to my Let's Play of The Banner Saga: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH76bElZ7XJMc2R6ybE2k3t01ItssJNheBetween The Banner Saga and The Banner Saga: Factions, I've probably put WAY too much time into this game... and I've loved every minute of it. They have taken your classic turn based strategy tactical game and wraped it in a layer of Oregon Trail and topped with a brilliantly told epic saga based around classic viking-esque lore.Total length: Roughly 10 hour or so storyline.The combat differs from a game like XCOM wherein you'd get your turn where you move all of your units and then let the enemy take a turn moving all of their units. In The Banner Saga you trade off on each unit movement. The Order they're moved in is based on how you organize your units prior to batter. This very miniscule difference makes for a pretty spectacular change in how combat is paced. Look at it this way, if you're getting slaughtered and the enemy has 5 units to your 2. You get to move your units 2-3 times before one of their units gets a second turn. It can really help turn the tide IF you're very smart about it but it isnt enough that it feels too powerful. The enemy also gets this advantage while outnumbered and can make setting up traps and cornering/surrounds units a solid strategy to make quick work of them. The Banner Saga is single player only... If you want Multiplayer go download The Banner Saga: Factions here on steam. It's free to play and has miniscule micro transactions for basic stuff like unit color variations or small boosts to the amount of renown (experience) you get in battle. The game does solid work of balancing your opponents as well. So if you're curious about this game but not quite convinced... go download Factions and give the combat a shot at least. Cheers!			"

												The Banner Saga is a journey through treacherous lands over run with a multitude of enemies. Friendly towns dot the landscape under constant threat of being swallowed up and forgotten. You are expected to make hard decisions, ones that can save or kill the people you care about. Little is left and nothing is forgiven in this cold stolid environment yet you strive to keep moving.Final Fantasy Tactics meets viking-esk lore painted with beautiful artwork and memorable characters. I highly recommend this game!			"

												Had a great time playing through this last weekend! Definitely want to do another playthrough,Games like this should definitely be supported, and I think that one should play this game, period.Some may find it too short for $25, but it would be a certain must buy at 50% off or lower.If you're on the fence, I say pick it up when it's on sale. Personally, I'm getting my money's worth out of it.It's definitely not easy, but in a game about vikings dealing with the end of the world, that seems appropriate. With A LOT of effort, I managed to get a caravan of over 500 people to Boersgard without losing them to low morale and starvation, and it actually felt like an achievement. It's the vibrant characters that got me invested and made me try and save the ones I care about, forcing myself into harder situations involving having mostly level 1 characters until the last chapter of the game.The world and art are beautiful and unique in a genre saturated with elves and dwarves, and Austin Wintory's soundtrack gives me chills. The elements of Icelandic culture and storytelling tropes have been woven into the setting and narrative excellently and make the game feel like a saga, an incomplete one though.My one gripe would be that the ending is that it's tone felt much more like the second act than the first, however that tone, while strange was unarguably new and fresh to me. With so much left unresolved in anticipation of a sequel, I feel like Stoic has a lot of responsibility to consumers to ensure the trilogy is concluded, and I hope to see them overcome their legal battle with King over the use of ""saga"" in their title. As long as this is ensured, I think any problems fans might have with the ending will be forgotten in context of the entire trilogy as a whole, and it is a good thing that the ending made me want more in that sense.This hopefully will also resolve what I feel is not enough variation on what is a unique ad interesting combat system, with a lot of depth and potential to develop in the single player campaign. In the sequel I would hope to see scenarios that add more of a twist to the mechanics than placement, as well as more boss battle scenarios. It would be interesting to see battles where you're defending a specific position, or have to escape an immortal Sundr by confining its movement. A good example of this variation would be half life, which introduced mechanics to players early on, and spent the rest of the game putting players in scenarios where the player's current strategies were challenged. Does the player always use a shotgun to kill this enemy type? Put them in a room with explosive barrels. Half life did have the benefit over Banner Saga of a longer campaign Ultimately I feel like games that do what Banner Saga does right are too few and far between, especially because I feel that larger studios are unwilling to take risks anymore. So while the game has areas that it needs to improve on, I want the studio to get the support and opportunities it needs to meet those needs and be a better game, because I thoroughly enjoyed it and want to see it succeed			"

												My one-time playthrough on Normal difficulty (no reloading), took me about 9 hours.Without diving into too much, here's a quick review.Storyline: great. Characters can (and will) die, and you really feel the loss of each character. Personally, I got more enjoyment out of the Banner Saga's storyline when I compared it to reading a book from the Game of Throne series: Main characters may die, but the story goes on. Graphics: The 2d art style is great. Characters are well drawn, and the art style is really fantastic. The character animations in battle were fluid and superbly animated by some really talented artists. The closest parellel i can draw would be if the animators from old-school Disney cartoons (Pocahontas, Hunchback of Notre Dame) were asked to draw something that was nitty gritty and Viking-themed... Only quibble: An in-game cutscene tries to convey the sense of scale on a certain ""Big S"" of gargantuan proportions, but fell flat, and felt like a poorly made sequence made Flash way back in 2005. Gameplay: great. On Normal difficulty, the AI puts up quite a challenge. You'll be outnumbered frequently. You definitely need to learn and use your characters' special skills to get an edge.Music and Sound: Not much in-game voice; the few sparse sentences are sufficient. The music, however, is really great. The Viking (Celtic?) themed music is evocative and haunting.  Overall, the Banner Saga's story was engrossing enought to keep me glued for two marathon gaming sessions lasting almost five hours each, and I'm interested on how the storyline will turn out in the sequels.

												Writing this review I am conflicted, The Banner Saga is a good game but I was not aware of a few things in it that had I known may have changed my choice to buy it.First despite a beautiful opening cutscene they never use that style again all game, the art will be the same style but there will be no other fully animated cutscenes, not even for the climax. instead you get images with maybe two bits here and there that flow in the breeze while text tells you things. that hurt the style and emotional feel immensely.Second is that this is not the whole story, the game ends on what feels like a big chapter but wraps nothing up, it seems like they intend another part to come out but I was not warned at all that the story was incomplete which leaves me in a sour mood since I thought I bought a FULL story not part of one.Third was that the game has many choices which feel good but can kill characters or take them away for no provided reason at anytime and with no way to know it will happen, this is frustrating when paired with the fact that you do not control when the game saves at all so fixing a sudden character death means hours of replaying.Do not get me wrong this is a great game, the style is nice, the story wonderful, the characters fun and engaging and the combat while not for everyone is one of the more unique and fun styles I have seen (Except for the final boss who like in many games just plain changes the rules of combat) but it feels like they cut corners in important places and did not make certain things like the fact the story is not done yet clear enough.

Imagine if you will a mix between Disney, final fantasy tactics and FTL and you are in the right kind of ballpark.The art and story will spell bind you and the combat system will give you a good challenge until you master it. Plenty of interesting decisions to be made in the campaign side of the game, even if some will argue that the decision system might is not “meaningful enough”. Highly, highly recommended.  "

												A game of atmosphere and tone, above all else. The Gods are dead, the sun has stopped in the sky, and now the golem-like dredge are on the warpath, marking the dawn of a Third Great War of which the scale might well mark the end of the world.You play great heroes in this game, but this is not their story: this is a tale of a father and his daughter, caught leading a long train of refugees in desperate flight across the known world. This is the tale of those who would slip into the cracks and be forgotten in such tumultuous times, were it not for the bravery and heroism of a precious handful of normal folks caught far out of their depth.With an excellent soundtrack by Austin Wintory and traditional rotoscoped animation, the game really shines. The somewhat spare gameplay makes the choices you, the player, makes feel all the more important, and the square grid combat reveals a surprising depth of nuance and strategy--but one that isn't too deep to master in a playthrough or two. Some very gripping plot twists and turns keep you invested all the way through this first of (hopefully) many from Stoic Studio.			"

												While this game might not be for everyone, and in some ways it's a bit short, I have to say that it's a beautiful, thematic piece.  In addition, there's an almost Oregon Trail-esque feel to it because of the need to manage resources during travel.  Yet, unlike that game, this actually has a plot, and combat, with characters who possess distinct personalities.  It's a choice based game, which is wonderful, and even though many choices don't make a difference in what ultimately happens, they do impact resources, so one has to be careful what one does.  It's sufficient to say that I look forward to trying the sequel if it's half as good as this game.  There is sadness, but that just adds to the beautiful tapestry of this game.  For those who like to play games that aren't just about killing things, I recommend this title.			"

												This game is amazing! Why is that? So first, you probabily have noticed the GORGEOUS looks. Most part of the game (I don't wanna say everything in it, because not entirely sure) is hand-drawn, and it is beautiful as you can see and it only gets better.Second, you probabily have read about it aswell, choices matter. I finished the game one time only but I'm still pretty sure one specific choice I made would have changed its end dramatically, so you, there's that.Third, the story is very good, I wouldn't say it is mindblowing - because I wasn't - but it's still pretty good and well told.Voices aren't exactly the best around, I mean, I woulnd't point them out as one of the strong points of the game, but I would neither say they are one of its weakest.8/10 because I really felt like it could be longer...maybe if I try it again and take different decisions, who knows (:			"

												This game is, wow it is amazing. Beautiful game overall, seriously, beautiful story, art, soundtrack, gameplay and ambience this game is a must play. The gameplay alone is something I can talk about for easily and hour, with an amazing health system this game plays like a PC fire emblem title with an amazing twist in your health and damage systems. Great story following two caravans, 1 which you follow for more of the game follows the story of Rook the leader of a caravan of clansmen fighters and what we would call giants(varl) is trying to save the world with his daughter.And the other one Hakon who actually is Varl leading another caravan doing pretty much the same thing. The story has a brilliant end, which I won't say. There is a lot more to the story than just that but, you should experience it yourself just trust me on that.The art is amazing I can't say much about it though just look at the damn screenshots and you will believe me.Soundtrack is an amazing orchestra composed by Austin Wintory, and it is also with what I can only describe as Norse vocals and such.The soundtrack only adds to the ambience as you travel through beautiful valleys and mountains with snow falling. Seriously this is probably the best looking game (not graphically in an art standpoint) I have ever played, Bastion taking a close 2nd.The only complaint I have of this game is a very personal one, I am not a very heavy or a very good reader, almost everything is read in this, but when voice acting is available, it is brilliant. Another one is that the split caravans kind of annoyed me mainly because Rooks story is much more interesting than that of Hakon's, but that problem is later fixed you will see.This game in a real standpoint has no problems from what I see, I mean it's a bit hard for some people but it is fair, so that isn't a problem. Seriously one of the most underrated games of 2014 I must give this game a 10/10 I love this game to death. One of my favourites. Seriously in my 10 favourite games of all time.Do I recommend it? HELL YES this game could go for $40 and I would still buy it even though it's only about 8-12 hours of gameplay. BUY IT NOW.			"

												This kickstarter game is the first chapter of a trilogy, and is quite fantastic.Set in a Norse inspired world, you follow two groups of humans and giant-like vargs as they try to reach safety from the swarming monsters. Part of the game you are fighting in a grid-based tactical roleplaying game, the other is watching your caravan travel past beautiful scenery while being forced to make decisions that could be good or bad, but generally have a long term affect that could either aid you or bite you in the rear.It's beautiful, the combat is decent, the writing is superb (though most of the dialog in-game is text only), and the choices are interesting and makes me wonder what would have happened if I went a different route. All in all a good buy, though it isn't the longest of game. Buy, especially when on sale, as it is a bit too pricey at the moment.			"

												Awesome and punishing at the same time, just keeps you coming back for more! The music and theme of the story complement each other perfectly and make for a very enjoyable experience.I have only two complaints, firstly the combat can be a little too slow, whilst its not an action orientated game it could do with a little polish to make it feel smoother. Second, I felt that the choices you made that affected the army didn't make as much of a difference as you were led to believe; If you mastered the party combat, it didn't matter if you made all the wrong choices and were left with a decimated army. This made me feel like it wasn't important to try and save your army.Those two point aside, its beautifully crafted and the narrative between the characters is compelling and pulls you in, (making you want to know more and explore as much of the history as they will tease you with) permeated with morally grey choices that are explored through the dialog, hugely affecting who stays in the party and the course your journey takes.

												This game is just pure awesome! The story of the game was a lot of fun, getting attached to the characters and then something sudden happens, brings saddness to the whole thing. But having the advantage of changing of how the story goes it awesome. This game brings back memories of the old days of play the orignal 'The Oregon Trail' game with the survival of your caravan and its people of supplies. The orchestrated score of this game fits in so perfectly with this game its just wonderful to just sit there and listen to it. The only bad thing what I really don't like is that I wish you could sell some of the items that you don't want to gain some renown but overall, I highly recommend this game to others, you'll just fall in love with the whole thing.

The graphics step right out of a Bakshi/Don Bluth film and the characters are very vivid and vulnerable yet they grow to be strong and very likeable. Each play thorugh allows for different alliances with different characters and if not careful you could lose a favorite permanently so there are so many angles to this game.

												this is up there with one of the best rpg's ive played. I sometimes even hate it at times beacause the story can be very brutal with the decision's you make. i wont call the game a true choose your own adventure because the story dose not end after you make the decision's you make, only if you run out of people in your caravan it could be game over. it's a fairly short game but it's mostly a main quest with a few side option's to deal with in the game very good charcter deveopment in my opinion. it has a uniqe battel system resvering your best DPS charcters is a must on higher diffuclty because you loose hp and hitting power at the same time. all up great fun			"

												From a gripping story, to characters that feel real, The Banner Saga is an enormous feat of brilliance. Masterfully written, an art style filled with heart and soul, and gameplay that will leave you sweating, this game brings “saga” to it’s truest sense in both scale and experience. And what a saga it is.With an opening that states “The Gods are Dead” you can tell that this is a harsh and unforgiving world, and you’ve been thrusted into the middle of it, with your clansmen at your side as you travel from settlement to settlement more often than not just trying to survive.The gameplay is tactical and turn based, similar to XCOM and Shadowrun Returns, so before buying I’d suggest looking into it to be sure it is something you consider fun. If you are unsure I’d suggest letting this be your first! Though, even if the gameplay is not your cup of tea, if you like well told stories with great characters you might want to play it solely for that reason. Aside from a VERY abrupt ending the story and progression is golden. As you journey across the land the game feels very Organ Trail-ish as you watch your banner wave against the wind. Though, dying from dysentery is not a thing, so you can put that fear to rest if the mention of “Organ” gives you flashbacks.Being funded by Kickstarter, the budget for this game did not allow for it to be fully voiced acted aside from a handful of moments where a few main characters will speak, but with the soundtrack by Austin Wintory (Journey) you will hardly mind. The soundtrack alone is worth the price of this game.The experience refuses to leave my mind even days after completion. The Banner Saga has left me breathless and is one of those games that is both amazing and shows the power of what a well crafted game feels and looks like. I cannot suggest this game strongly enough!P.S. This game could also be called, “The Banner Saga, or,♥♥♥♥♥♥Continues to Get Real even when you think the♥♥♥♥♥♥has Reached it’s Realest Levels.”			"

												This is one of the more refreshing RPGs I have played...and in a while too.It's testament that a good game does not need advanced graphics and effects to make the player have a good time. That being said, the artwork is really something at least I could appreciate.The story doesn't fail to engage you and every decision you have to make will certainly leave you wondering. Not to mention there will be times of frustration, the kind you get from watching Game of Thrones.Anyway...I can't really find anything negative to say about The Banner Saga, although at the end I was left wanting for more. It is short in my opinion and it could use some more features, like bigger battles and more RPG elements such as conversations.I for one hope to see more of this in the future!			"

												So far I've only played it a little bit, but It's a novel that you play. THIS GAME IS FANTASTIC! I normally don't play turn-based games like this, the closest I had played before this would be the classic D&D games, but the combat is easier to understand, and its sort of like chess where each piece has a range to move in, its own abilities, and a person you know from the story instead of a wooden pawn! Tutorials are well written, and easy to understand. I feel like I'm going to log some good hours, with multiple playthroughs. The Banner Saga is probably one of the greatest games I have ever played to date. Rich story, history, characters who have old friends and thier own personalities, beautiful artwork and locations, a giant (no pun intended XD) map with information about every treeline, mountain range, pool of water and landmark. 10/10, buy this game.

												8/10This game is like a cross between Oregon Trail and Might & Magic: Heroes. You traverse beautiful 2D landscapes in Oregon Trail fashion (stopping for scripted events along the way to make important decisions as well as managing your resources). The battle sequences play out much like Might & Magic: Heroes or similar games (turn based RPG/Strategy).There is very little spoken dialogue so you will have to be prepared to do a lot of reading. Most of the decisions you make effect the game in significant ways so reading all the text and selecting your answers carefully are a must. After the first hour or two of play the characters and story really started to grow on me. If you think you’d enjoy this game, you probably will; it’s extremely well made and a decently long adventure for the price. If you hate reading or simply like to zone out while playing games this is not a good choice; it requires 100% of your attention.  "

The only (reasonably small) problem I had, was that the story was kind of short, and left quite a few things left hanging over the player. hopefully they'll sort this out, in either updates, expansions, or a new game entirely.

												I thought Banner Saga had a well put together story line and I am a big fan of the tactics game starting from Final Fantasy Tactics and on. The art style is beautiful and the game play is good. That being said I was disappointed in the length of the game. Its one of those games that you can beat in a sitting and when I  look at a tactics game that is not what I am looking for. I want something I can sink my teeth in to for a good amount of time, but short games seem to be the thing now a days. I suggest if you can get it on a steam sale get it and have fun with it.			"

												Banner Saga is a turn-based tactical combat game that is guaranteed to enthrall you with all its Viking seriousness. Combat mechanics are simple. You take turns and you attack either STRENGTH or ARMOR.You start off as a small band of Varls, powerful horned giants mowing down puny humans that stand in your way, with the entire story becoming more and more epic as your band of follower grows and new characters are added to the cast. Use your kills (translated into renown) to upgrade your team members. The trick here is always to have an even mix of bleeders (strength damagers) and breakers (those that specialize in attacking armor so your bleeders can have an easier time). You'll make hard choices... choices that will kill off your characters or alter how the ending goes. The art is classic, a refreshing crisp clear feel that stand in its own way against the super-realistic graphics espoused by most third or first person shooters and platformers we see nowadays. I don't know about most people, but I FELL IN LOVE when I reached my first Godstone.The only sin that this game has done is its way too short, and there are too little items, I suppose... but the Kickstarter somehow mentioned that this is just the first part of this Saga, and I know Viking Sagas have to be much longer than this. STOIC deserve a good pat on the shoulder for this game that redefines the turn-based genre and storytelling. Just make the second part so we can continue dealing with the Jormungand lookalike.			"

												The visuals and musical score of this game are alone worth the buy. There is no mountain of backstory you need to know to understand what is going on in this world. It does a good job of introducing the world's lore throughout the course of the game at a steady pace. The combat is straightforward without much RNG involved, but remains challenging even on normal mode. The decisions you make in the game both inside and out of combat have immediate and reverberating effects throughout the rest of the story. After my first play through the only thing left wanting was a sequel.			"

You make meaningful decisions along the way, and based on those decisions your people, including playable companions might live or die. I'm writing this before banner saga 2 has been released, but the developers are saying that your actions in the first game will carry over which makes your actions in the first game all the more important.  The combat system is also a lot more interesting than a lot of tactical rpgs, and despite knowing the story, I've played the game all the way through 4 or 5 times now just because of how fun the combat is.I highly recommend this game.

												In a nutshell, It's a Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, or Tactics Ogre for the masses. The gameplay in combat is relatively simple and thus approachable, but the story is as compelling, involving, and dark as those of the epics mentioned above. And in essence, this focus on narrative, art, and music, relegating gameplay to making simple choices reminiscent of those found in Oregon Trail and engaging in light tactical combat may be the game's greatest strength and weakness. I pre-ordered mine from GameFly for $14.00 and am glad to support this flawed but tremendous three-man effort.			"

But easily frustrated people beware - characters will be removed forever without warning, or through event dialogues that are IMPOSSIBLE to forsee what will happen, based on the choices offered to you. The game is modestly challenging without much effort, so even with losing leveled soldiers due to no fault of your own you should still be able to complete the game. But it all feels out of your hands.Worth $5. Would be much better if they gave players more real power.			"

												A fine Viking saga with a nod to Ragnarok even though it is a different Ragnarok. Turn based combat. Old School. Cartoon style drawings. A successful Indie game that has a board game Kickstarter happening and a sequel to the video game coming out very soon. Well worth it especially when on sale for five dollars.			"

												A beautiful game with a decently crafted story. The biggest downside is that the game really just ends out of nowhere. It's not satisfying, and doesn't give you a whole lot of closure. Apparently they've decided to make this the first game in a trilogy, so it may be better to wait for the rest before getting into this one.			"

												The Banner Saga is an absolutely stunning Strategy RPG. From a technical standpoint, the visual style is magnificent; whether you're looking at the each character's design as they engage in dialogue or the passing vista as you journey in you caravan, you will not be disappointed. The use of rotoscoping in the animated cutscenes and the actual gameplay was a very good choice and enhances the charm of this Indie title. The music suits this game as well. Thanks to the composer who worked on Journey, you are treated to aural goodness during battles and travelling.The story is quite engaging with the player taking mulitple viewpoints of the situation from different characters. Without spoiling too much, you play as a leader of a caravan moving from various settlements attempting to escape an ancient foe. However, you will soon find out that life on the road can be quite harrowing and decisions must be made so that survival is ensured each day. That's another thing: the decisions made in this game aren't typical black/white/red/blue choices; they are considerably gray and deal more in how you choose to lead your flock.Congratulations to Stoic for this great game (I've played through it twice now!) and I look forward to future installments.

												Brilliant game! If you're even remotely into turn-based tactical combat (and believe me, the combat system is really good) and love a good story with hard choices having real consequences, you'll love this game. The story pulls you in and the characters really grow on you.Add to all that a gorgeous art direction, and you've got one gem of a game. It's been a while since I enjoyed an RPG this much, and that by a team of three developers, amazing!For people who:- enjoy reading text in games (there's plenty of it, but they haven't overdone it)- enjoy tactical turn-based combat- don't tableflip when they make a bad decision (there's no manual save system, so decisions are rather permanent. Although you can reload an autosave, I wouldn't recommend doing this, as it will ruin the experience of making hard decisions)- appreciate hand-drawn graphics			"

												Having just weathered my own journy through the Banner Saga, I can assure you that this breath-taking work of art is more than worth what I paid. The Challanging tactical turn based combat, where characters are mere peices on a board, is a perfect metaphor for the strory were the lives of everyone following you are dependant on each and every choice you make. The weight of leadership weighs heavy at each turn of this journy where somtimes there simply are no good choices. But thats exactly whats so brilliant about this game, It's so real. It's as harsh and bitter as nordic snows it takes place in and equaly beautiful. If your looking for an easy mindless game to pass the time this is not for you. If your looking for somthing as challenging personaly as it is tacticly look no further			"

												Good first impression, and then it continues doing the same for hours on end. There's very little reason to play this game if you're looking for deep gameplay. This game would have been better as an interactive comic on an iPad or some such.  If you're looking for something to keep you entertained,  get a book. This ""game"" is all hype. At 10 hours In I decided to call it. Started hating the combat, and started skipping the dialog, that's not a good sign for an RPG..  If you are into RPG's purely for story, this game might have something for you, although I can't say I was impressed with the (insanely slow moving, almost final fantasian levels of slowness, glacial almost) story. At that point the story had gotten to a point where Dragon Age got during the first 10 minutes. And yeah, sort of your standard storyline. Some evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s have resurfaced, laying waste to everything, bla bla bla, done.			"

												Quite disappointed.Would recommend, but at bargain prices. The game is utterly linear, the choices feel arbitrary, cruel and very random. You never feel much control. There is no real value to a lot of the in game resources, the map, supplies. You also get annoyed about never having enough resources to level your units and keep fed or in items- protip, supplies are pointless, you don't need your army, so just level and buy items. The story is okayish, but weakly told and you don't really care after a while because random events kill people. The art, of course, is utterly beautiful. I would rather there be an animated series of this, than the game we got. Combat is the only part I liked, but is very samey. You don't get that much variation in units. The superboss, is stupidly overpowered and will annoy you. Buy at bargain only. Should be played, but is pretty disappointing and utterly linear.			"

												Epic Saga based on nordic Mythology. Focus on round-based combat, gripping story and decisions that matter. You will find yourself more than once facing tough choices, and come to regret them later on. The round based combat is solid and comes at three difficulties. The story is a gust of fresh wind, but fits perfectly in its setting. The game itself is pretty linear, which though helps telling the story better.			"

												The Banner Saga is greatly inspired by Norse Mythology and does well to capture that viking feel to it. I thoroughly enjoyed the art style of this game, that old cartoon look was very appealing to me. The gameplay was challenging with a turn based combat system and caravan style out of combat system I often found myself carefully constructing my strategies before taking any action (Which I seldom do in strategy games these days since you can normally brute-force your way through things). The choices you make in the game are rough and small, seemingly insignificant choices you make near the beginning of the game can and will affect you later on.There were a few things I disliked, first being the voice acting. The game begins its first cutscene fully voiced but that's it, the rest of the game is purely text. Budget concerns would make sense but if they were to not voice the entire game it wouldn't have taken much effort simply to just take out that one set of dialogue. Secondly, and I will be brief to avoid spoilers...the story just stops when things get intense which was a killer for me because I fell in love with the story and wanted closure. There are rumors for the next Banner Saga game and I hope they made enough money to continue development because this is a story I do not want to have left unfinished.7/10 (Average: Definitely worth your money and a playthrough or two)			"

												Oregon Trail meets a choose-your-own adventure novel with tactical turn-based combat elements. Setting is Scandanavian fantasy.Very unique and beautiful art style that captivated me throughout the playthrough. Nothing to fault here - I don't think the artist(s) could have done a better job.I was consistently suprised by the well-balanced divergent outcomes based on the choices made in the storytelling sections. Characters were memorable and genuinely complex in some cases. Occasional twists had signifcant narrative impact.Depending on the difficultly setting, however, combat can be too easy or punishing. Could have been fine-tuned more.Is clearly set up for expansions and follow-ups, which I hope happen. As a result, though, I was left with a somewhat unsatisfied feeling at the end of the game.Overall, a very impressive Kickstarter-backed game. Worth it for the visuals alone, in my view.8/10			"

												If you don't know much about this game and just jump to the reviews, here you go. This is a turn based strategy game with meaningful choices that feel similar to a choose your own adventure. It is set in a viking styled fantasy setting, with humans and giants with horns called varl as the two dominant races, fighting against the evil dredge. This game is the first of three parts of the Banner Saga story. The game has a fairly steep learning curve to truly excel at fights, as many fights that seem to be a cakewalk at the beginning can turn into a bloodbath for your party, resulting in injuries that can linger into the next fight if not taken care of. The system of two health bars, one armor and one health *and* attack is pretty unqiue and can take some time to wrap your head around to take advantage of, as well as with the way turns are done. However, it is not something so bad that you have to throw on easy to get by, normal is definitely managable and I can't wait to try it on hard. Also the experience earned in battle, renown, is also treated as your money, similar to Dark Souls. However, there are some nuances.  The story (thus far) has been exciting and made me care about the party characters. When I made a decision that ended up resulting in a character's death, I felt crushed. Sure, I could save scum and reload and change my choice, but that defeats the purpose of the choices. If you play it, dare I use the word, correctly and without loading saves to pick the perfect choice (not always applicable), the game feels similar to FTL if you've ever played that. You can't always be the friendliest guy or else it can be bad for your and your people. While I personally enjoy it, it's not for everyone. There is definitely some dark to this world and story. However, there are some faults. As previously mentioned, the way that the turns are handled in combat can lead to some... interesting things in combat, such as an enemy character going twice or even three times to your characters once, purely because there are only two enemy units remaining. Due to this, it is better to simply hurt enemy units down to a weak state rather than outright killing them to prevent stronger enemy units from getting more turns. Also previously mentioned are the nuances of the renown system. To level up a unit, they must have acquired a set number of kills in battle. Unfortunately, some units are better set to weaken enemies to let others strike the killing blow, which naturally leaves them weaker in level unless you specifically farm kills with those units. Not a huge problem, but something that can be annoying to deal with.  Overall the game gets my recommendation, and if I hate to rate it I'd give it a solid B+. It is definitely worth the price (moreso if you get it on sale), and certainly a good game, with some room for improvements which will hopefully find some way to work around for the other two parts. If you want to give the combat a spin, you can try The Banner Saga: Factions which is the free PVP version of the game.  "

												I really wanted to love this game. I really did. I pushed through one play through, that is all this game is getting from me. I'd be more upset if I hadn't picked this game up for only 10 bucks. The art, great. The music, great. The story, I didn't know what to expect. It is a good story, sad for sure. Nothing epic at all. The game ends on a flat note leading into the upcoming second game. The leveling system is terrible. The only way to level your team is with kills, well kinda. In order to promote a unit, that unit needs to get the last hit on a bad guy. Then you have to spend the only resource in the game, renowned in order to get points (2 per level) to spend to make your unit more powerful. That is obtuse enough, but it gets worse. That same resource is what you also must spend on food to keep your people from starving to death. The game has little replay value as you are railroaded the whole time. The world map has no reason to be in the game as it is not used for anything. There will be a good, neutral, and bad out come to many of the random encounters that pop up as you wait to get from place to place. Given enough time you could find what answer A B or C is best. So those encounters aren't choices, they are only consequences. The UI is a bit odd at times, you can't delete your last played game. If you start over, the save gets pushed to a new profile that is ambiguous at times. This is another in a long string of games that has come out lately from indie dev types that has been a let down. This was a Kick Starter backed progect. The goal was 100k, they picked up 700K. 7x as much cash as they were looking for. Along with the multiplayer packs that can be bought... I just can't see where that money went. Clearly they dropped a very large sum on the music, and that is great. But what is better? A game that is better than a 7/10 experience at best. I will keep a lookout for The Banner Saga 2, but my expectations will be twice as high.			"

												Sorry to say that bue The Banner Saga is a disappointment to me. As much as I like tactical turn based combat and the impressive 2d art style, the lack proper voice overs and sparse music breaks the game for me. There are voice overs but there incredibly rare (a line here and a line there, minimal at best) and the music while beeing fine is also used too little. The result is a game that for the most part is dead silent. Sitting there in front of the monitor reading the countless story related diaglogs is very tedious. I have no problem with reading books but reading from monitors is quite tiring for the eyes.I just don't get why a game that was so well funded on kickstartet is not fully voiced. There is no graphics engine to speak of, no 3d-models or textures. It's all hand drawn 2d and that is good. But why did they not take the money and time and have it fully voiced? There are speakers there, just far far to rarely used.Edit: I have to edit my review and have to correct the score from 'no' to 'hell no'. I played through the entire game fairly easily on normal difficulty but the final fight is impossible for me to win. I simply don't have the right characters properly skilled. You can misdevelop your party without even knowing ending up in the final fight you can no longer win. I would need to start the entire game over developing my party just for that final fight. That is such a stupid design that I'm lost for words how such crap could come ex-BioWare-devs. Banner Saga ist my pesonal favorite for disappointment of the yeat.			"

												With most games I buy, I wonder in the back of my head if it was worth the purchase. Did I really get my money's worth for this experience? Was the price tag justified? If I went back, would I buy it all over again?The Banner Saga is one of those proud few things I can say ""yes, absolutely"" for. The game is a work of art literally and figuratively, adding an enjoyable (if not the most complicated) tactics game to a fantastic story. The writers' grasp on both mythology and real-world culture is impressive and it shows throughout the game.Virtually all my criticisms boil down to ""Not enough, give us moar"". I'll gladly pay for the sequel whenever it comes out, and personally? I'd love to see a free-roaming adventure saga with more randomization and caravan management involved. I don't know if we'll ever see something like that but if nothing else, this game proves that Kickstarter can lead to great things. Outstanding work, Stoic.			"

												This game is reaallly  pretty.  You should get it, and you should set aside a good 8 hrs to play it in one go.  I have some minor problems with the battle system. First, some of the battles are pretty luck based.  As in the order that your team takes actions in is never quite as easy to determine as it should be, so I had to replay a few times in order for the objective to be possible.  Second, I think the level up system should be different.  It was fine, but I don't feel like it got to upgrade things as much has I wanted.You should buy it.  The story is great, and I don't even usually like the viking motif.			"

												tears were shed, blood was spilt, feels were felt. this game touched me, whenever anyone died or anything bad happened i grieved for a whole day knowing it was my fault, this game hates me, whenever i make a small mistake everything comes tumbling down. i was scared but i pulled through and worked with my problems, i survived. this game is not forgiving this game is not easy and this game is not happy, the whole game it feels as if everything you do is just slightly less bad than the other option, that there is never a time of happyness or peace. this game hates you, this game wants you to hurt welcome to a tale of life and death to pain and misery where the only good thing to happen to you is /spoiler getting to see that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ olef who killed my best character out of nowhere die. the banner saga is a gritty and unforgiving game that will try to hurt you. but it's a game about survival, about fighting for your freedom to live another daywelcome to the saga, the banner saga			"

The music, the graphics and the gameplay fit together pefectly!I can recommend this game to anyone who is intrested in strategic/rpg based games.The Story is rly good aswell, except for the ending, ita a little bit to open for my taste. It feels somewhat unfinished and leaves you with the desire to continue the story, which at this time is not yet sure if its even possible (stoic wants to wait out how good the game sells until deciding to make part2/3...)Only negative point ~23€ is a bit expenssive for a game with a playtime around 13h.(given the circumstances: the game was funded by kickstarter, their aim was to pledge 100.000$, they got 700.000 so i cannot understand why the game is still so expenssive.)

												A masteful, powerful, challenging and rewarding tactical role-playing game. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys turn-based strategy games and anyone who enjoys a good story. Where to begin? I guess I will start first on the battle mechanics. The armor-health/strength system, willpower and exertion points, and the ordered, one-move-per-turn system was a hurdle to me (I've only experienced the HP/MP/Atk/Def... system) and challenged me to rethink my strategies. But although it took me a little while to get used to, it's actually a really fun and rewarding system that above all, after a little thought, makes a whole lot of sense. This dynamic made me think twice about sending my heavy-hitters to the frontline and made the defensive characters all the more invaluable. In this game, not only do enemies block movement but so do allies (with one or two exceptions). This results in carelessly causing a wasted turn or a character's death, or, if taken advantage of, a clever block to cut off an enemy's path. You'll need to use these strategies and think carefully about moves because one mistake can cost you the whole battle. The game says that itself (in the Training Room), ""Your enemies are stronger than you. You need to outwit them."" Each battle the enemy has an advantage in stats or in number. I love the artwork. It's beautiful. I wish I had the words to aptly describe it. All I can say is that there's a lot to appreciate. Same thing with the music. Put the volume up and you will feel epic.The storyline and setting is great. But I would say it is more mature-themed, along the lines of Game of Thrones. The characters all stick out in their own way. It captured my attention and my imagination. Maybe that's why more than once I spent solid minutes agonizing over which decision to make, on who to trust, on what to give up and what was more important, and even when the decision was made, what if I chose something else..? This game has a big focus on decisions and its consequences and does a great job. TL;DR: mature, inspired by Game of Thrones. fun, rewarding battle system. engaging story with decisions that matter. beautiful artwork, great music. Must try.This game deserves its praise. I really would love to see more.			"

												First off I do recommend the game and it's about 6-10 hours long.When i first started playing i was a little bored because for me it's not a game you must sit and concentrate on. The story is all text so if you don't like reading then it'll bother you. For me though it's a game i played with a film on and it was magnificient as I could play and chill out at the same time. It starts slow, but the more you invest in the characters the better it becomes. There was quite a few ""ah♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; moments when I believe i felt i made the wrong decisions that turned out me losing my favourite characters, but that is the games charm. The ending I was choked up a little which for an RPG is good, it obviously made me invest in the characters. I recently finished skyrim and for an ""rpg"" it never had that effect.Combat is ok, the only fight i ""lost"" was the final fight though which i had to restart so I wouldn't say its difficult. It can also be repetitive to some degree once you sus out a pattern of play.For me to even be on here reviewing the game though, it definately hit a spot :) So recommended.			"

												Alright, this game is amazing in a way that I can honestly say I haven't really come across before.It is also brutal, annoying, and at times depressing, but this is in part why it is so amazing.  Most games that offer you some kind of choice make it clear what the result of your choices are going to be, and even if they don't, there are often multiple ways around the problem (save scumming or similar tactics).  Banner Saga fights that trend, both with its save system, but also, and perhaps more importantly, by separating the consequenecs of your choices from the moment in which you make the choice.  Honestly, at times, it feels almost like you are one of the Starks in the Game of Thrones, with people dying without you having much control over it, but this is why the game is SO GOOD.  It gives you power to affect the story, but it doesn't make that story happy, easy, and most importantly, it doesn't make it simple.This is the kind of game I want to see more of, something that doesn't hold the hand of the player, a game that can actually make me feel base on MY decisions.Oh, and just for the record, the art is awesome, the combat is deceptively simple (look close enough and there is a TON of depth), but for me, it is that journey, that awesome bane of my existence for the last however many hours, that really makes this game.Go play it, now.

												Love this game. I played through it and the length was ok. Could have been longer, but I guess that's valid for every game nowadays and only shows that I enjoyed it.Artstyle is great obviously, I enjoyed the decisions (but have to play a second time to see if they really have an impact), story and the fighting is decent too.With the ""Hitpoints also represent the strenght of your attack"" it was a nice unique feel in an otherwise usual turn based strategy portion.Only thing I'd love to see expanded was the options you have during the travel and maybe more town interaction.Suggestions: Let me choose more routes, hunt in camps, talk with people more often in non-story events and possibly a little micromanagement with food rationing and similar things you know from Oregon Trail.I'd also love to see more games leaning towards viking and their mythologie (even though it's just slightly based on it)			"

												Update 01/17/2014: Finished the game after 13 hours.  Hopefully they will add more.  It kind of leaves the story dangling other than that and the previous issues game is awesome.01/15/2014 - So far this game rocks!  Graphic style is amazing.  I love all the detail.  Turn based strategy with some RPG elements.  If you liked games like final fantasy tactics or xcom series you will love this.  You earn renown for making ""right"" decisions and in battle.  There are a couple different types of resources in the game.  Soldiers are broken up into two groups either Val or fighters there are also clan members but I don't know what if any good they do so far.  One story line just has you trying to keep your clan alive so maybe if you run out you lose?  Renown ends up being the currency that is used to buy items or supplies.  Supplies are used on your travels and if you run out there is starvation and even death.  Great blend of storytelling, battle and decisions.  You also get a fair amount of warriors to use in your personal battles.  Drawbacks: Had a game crash a couple hours in but too early to tell if that will be an issue.  No subtitles which I like because of the amount of noise that can be present at my house.  Also the save game is only auto save this kind of sucks.  I had a game crash after a couple battles and will need to replay if you are going to make it autosave at least autosave more often.			"

												The best description I read for this game was: ""Game of Thrones meets Dinsey and Vikings"". That tells a lot about The Banner Saga. It is a rpg set in a well-made viking world, with disney-like art, full of different (and really hard) choices to make.The game has, basically, three main features: (1) a good storyline, in which you follow different characters and make your choices on how the story goes;(2) a viking caravan to maintain, in which you have to manage supplies, morale, number of clansman and fighters;(3) a turn-based strategy combat (like Final Fantasy Tatics), with different classes, skills, level-up and items.The combat system is so enjoyable that they have an on-line version of it, called The Banner Saga - Factions (free to play).The only bad thing I found for this game is that it feels really short (aprx 10 hours). It claims for its sequels.So, in general, the game is so enjoyable that the only bad thing is that it ends too soon.ps: if you're in doubt if it is worth to pay for it, try the free-version (The Banner Saga - Factions) first as a test =) "

												Character damage is based on his HP and each side's turn is over after only one of his character moves.  This means the optimal strategy is to get an opposing character down to 1 hp rather than kill them.  Playing optimal strategy ends up being very annoying because of this.  Instead of applying rational strategy like most other strategy games you spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to best keep all enemy characters just barely alive.  It is counter intuitive and just plain annoying to do.A problem with this game is that you just end up staring at long cut scenes which cannot be skipped.  There isn't much to look at and a few times they go on for minutes.  It is just your caravan walking toward a hill or whatever.  Really feels like it wasn't game tested... surely somoene would have suggested to skip these.When starting a battle you often have the choice of how many opponents you will face.  The battles are completely random and there is no information to predict which option to choose.  The exact same numbers of army sizes can be given but the number of enemies you face could be double.  The problem with this is that many fights are going to be too easy, yet if you set the difficultly to hard then some become pretty much impossible.  It is just unpredictable and pointless.  Worse, you can't even manipulate the game to make it a reasonable challenge each time - often you cannot save between each fight.  So you end up spending 10 minutes mowing down a super easy fight and the very next one is impossible because you chose all the hard options... then you have to redo the easy one.I faced a total of just a few different enemy types after maybe 40 battles.  Human melee characters that are mostly the same, the armored enemies with a big and small version for melee, and a ranged version of them.  The difference in strategy between fighting these characters is extremely limited... after about 15 minutes you'll have it figured out and be bored.tldr: The game play sucks - I've played many free flash games with better game play than this.  Overall it is just a frustrating experience.  If you wanted a slowly told story with politics and moral choices to be made... then I guess you could set it to medium mode and get through the game, though.			"

												This is a REALLY great game, the voice acting (abeit minimal) is superb for am indie game, and the soundtrack is great, complementing the story and environment greatly. Not to mention a great storyline combined with meaningful player choices, this makes for an intense 2-D old school turn base RPG.However, the ONLY downside is the notoriously frustrating combat mechanics.This game is RELENTLESS in terms of combat, and if you're a beginner I would strongly recommend starting out in normal or even easy mode. The reason why combat is so hard is mainly because of 1 simple reason, you deal LESSER damage as your health decreases. This inherently means that the longer the battle drags on, the more disadvantage you're in. Combine with the fact that the A.I is smart enough to ignore your tank and go straight for your DPS(almost all the time), be prepared for a frustrating game.But however, if you enjoy a little challenge and have a few hours to waste, I would recommend picking this game up, especially if its on discount, if not just for the music and story.

												One of the most beautiful games I've ever played. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing and I'm a fan of the art style they used. The game is very story-centric with aspects of making VERY tough decisions that often don't have clear answers to them. While I wouldn't call the tactical battle style unique, it certainly felt different from similar games. Fighting never felt like a chore, which I enjoyed. Each character feels different, both from a story aspect and a stats point of view.I have a few complaints, however. During gameplay you must make decisions about random story elements, and while I enjoy that several have very dire consequences (such as characters dying), it felt silly that these people could be okay after falling in battle several times, only to dissappear with one wrong prompt. I really wish the character portraits were animated more during talking scenes, as they feel slightly awkward. Also, the story ends very abruptly (I know they are planning for more games) but I didn't understand some of the plotlines shown within the game, so there's that.			"

												Just finished the game, and I really liked it. The story was depressing and my journey was a continous hardship of ruin, everything went sideways and at some point I felt like there was no point of going on.And then, suddenly the game was over.Seriously, WTF?I am usually a strong advocate of quality before quantity, and the games quality is great, but somehow I feel short-changed. I was emotionally way to invested, felt way to misserable (in a good way)  for the game to just end like this. Besides all that: great visuals and music. Combat system is quick to pick up and if there is a game that not only promises, that your choices matter, but delivers, it's Banner Saga.Sadly, all your choices will make you feel bad (in a good way).

												The game is very pretty. I like the music and the atmosphere. The story is interesting and the choices you make actually impact the storyline. The battle mechanics are a little annoying (at least to me), though. The battlefield looks like a chessboard, so you basically move your pieces about.  Some races are bigger than others so it's easy to get confused because it's difficult to see (for example) how many open spaces are behind a big piece. Since it's not really 3D you can't rotate the battlefield (which might feel more natural). Another remedy may be to just make the big pieces somewhat transparent if the potential path of a player's piece was behind it.You can't really have too many different strategies in battle. Basically, battle strategy is:1) Maim everything.2) Try to keep your characters healthy.3) Once you maim all the enemies significantly you can then proceed to dispatch them all. I really wanted to like the game.			"

												Beautiful music, beautiful artwork, and interesting lore. It seemed like a good effort by an indie game company.The problem is that this game was not very polished and unnecessarily frustrating. There were mechanics that were clearly not well thought through. I enjoyed the game for its music and ambience, but I would not play through again. My recorded 10 hours were for one playthrough. I notice that most people didn't play more than that either.			"

												This is an excellent mix between turnbased, tiled combat, with huge story elements where your choice is crucial to who lives or dies, and the end of the game. Things can get out of hand real quick between battles.For one, you have to upgrade your warriors with points earned via battle. Those can quickly run out, and then you have to get supplies for the travels. Those are acquired via the same points, which can come back to bite you in the♥♥♥♥♥fast if you don’t think fast.I lost a good chunk off Fighters and Vargs due to starvation a way into the game. But towards the end it turned around once I focused more on getting supplies, suddenly I lacked a lot of points to upgrade my warriors.Quickly summed up: Fun, calm gameplay, beautiful art, and a story you really get into if you are into Norse mythology and Viking/fantasy stuff. Recommended.			"

												Yes, I can totally recommend this game!The background story is very interesting! You'll come to points where you'll have to make hard decisions and the consequences can be fatal for some characters you've really started to like. There are major plot twists that I really didn't see coming.The gameplay is great. The combat system has rather unique characteristics, and the clan management adds some more diversity to the game's basics.I also really love the art style, the convoy passes several great landscapes and curiosities.I'm really hooked for Banner Saga 2, but I guess I'll have to wait until I have more spare time.. Anyways, great game!			"

												The Banner Saga is a truly fantastic game. It is a tactical RPG set in fantasy world inspired bu Norse mythology. The first thing that you will notice about this game is its very unique, and beautiful artstyle. The striking artstyle reminds me a lot of classic Disney animated films such as The Black Cauldron, and its the first time I have seen it used for a long time in a video game.The Banner Saga's grid-based tactical combat is challenging and very enjoyable, but most of the game will be spent in between the combat sections, traveling across the land. During this journey your main concern is keeping your clan alive and well, through conserving supplies, maintaining morale, and making tough decisions that will often have major consequences; good or bad. The strength of the game however, is in its worldbuilding and enthralling story. A huge portion of your time playing the game will be spent reading the brilliantly written dialogue and narration, so expect to be reading a lot. When you are victorious in battle you will receive 'renown', the game's currency, which you will spend on supplies, making decisions, and equipment that can upgrade your party members. This renown system is very unforgiving however, as you will probably spend it on items, decisions, or  supplies, and then later on realise you needed that renown for a crucial decision that could have dire consequences. The story is fantastic, but a cliffhanger ending left me feeling slightly unsatisfied, although a good sequel would remedy this. Overall, The Banner Saga has very few flaws at all, and should definitely be experienced, if only for its rich story, and stunning aesthetic. 8.5/10Wonderful. A one of a kind experience, that's worth it even at full price.			"

												In games, as in any medium, genuine innovation is rare.  This is not, in itself, something that should surprise anyone. As well following from a kind of  general law of reality (I'm thinking of Spinoza's eloquently expressed truism that ""all things excellent are as difficult as they are rare.""), commerical art -- and what art, today, isn't commercial? -- is subject to all sorts of exigencies that ultimately add up to incentives to follow the apparently tried and true and to avoid the road not taken like a hospital that only doles out flesh-eating viruses and bankrputcies. After all, if you're investing the kind of time and money that goes into a AAA game or a Hollywood film, why wouldn't you try to take as few risks as possible in the hope that you can thereby ensure a return on your (often vast) investment?One reason, of course, is that consumers are capricious and paradoxical in ways that (thankfully!) can be counted on to continually confound people who think they've found the magic forumla for the next mega-hit. Thus, on the one hand, people clearly like (and are wont to buy) things that are like other things that they like. The studio exec. nows this. At the same time, however, when we remember what made us first fall in love with a certain genre (or with a place, a pasttime, a person)  often what we remember most fondly is not that 'this met with our pre-existing desires', but that this encounter, *educated our desires*, made us into a certain kind of desiring-being.  It's the difference, ultimately, between finding an itch that we never knew we had (a sudden awakening of inhoate desire) as opposed to coming back for our umpteenth compulsive stcratch. To the corproate exec. types this is infuriating: consumers want (and will demand) that their tastes should be catered for and indulged to an inch of their lives...right up to the point that we feel that we're being pandered to at which point, we start to feel that we're being treated like drug addicts, that the dealers are cutitng our stuff with random crap that we never wanted and that actually, thank you very much, we prefer the desperate thrill of having stumbled across an undiscovered country rather than being served up the same crap day after day like a child...It's with all this in mind, that I should say  that The Banner Saga is not only an excellent game, but it's the best thing to have happened to rpg and strategy games for about a decade. What exactly is so good about it? Well, if you've seen the screenshots and the trailer, I'm hoping that I won't need to sell you on the art-style and thus it's extraordinarily beautiful, hand-crafted retro-charm. I could also add that the game makes many allusions to what looks like a unique and intricate lore that is, at the time of the game's release, still only minimally fleshed out. In addition, the story is compelling, the characters (though tending towards they archetypal) are generally intriguing and the turn-based combat has considerable depth. All of this, however, could be said about any number of games. So what makes TBS so different?If I had to try and put isolate what makes the game so brilliant and so surprising, I would start by saying that as well as the sense of something new (an original IP, a distinct lore, a distinctive art-style) in a market whose governing principle is: ""you want more of the same, don't you?"", what really makes the game stand out is  the way that its rpg and resource management mechanics (as well as the games fundmaental *difficulty*) are integrated with and contribute to the tone of the game's narrative and its wider world. To explain, TBS is, at its core, a narrative of desperation. It is a story of flight, of exile, of trying to survive and to keep the people you love alive under circumstances so dire as to be almost hopeless.  In TBS, it's an axiom that people (a lot of people) are going to die, even and espeically if you are motivated by nothing more than trying to save as many people as you posisbly can. What is so satisfying about the way that the game manages to connect this  narrative-thematic dimension with the core gameplay. Granted, a skilled strategists might find they get through the game with fewer losses than people who are less adroit, sneaky, determined or just prone to look up strategy-guides. For me, however, the real beauty of TBS is attested by how few times I found myself reloading my save game. This may seem odd (and it's not entirely true -- I did reload a few times to try and avoid certain consequences of my actions). Nonetheless, the game constantly reinforces the way that because your choices  do have ramifications (a desideratum on many gaming wishlists, especially among rpg fans), you cannot both ask that htese  consequences exist and that they should be in your control. Put differently: the game makes it seem not only difficult, but out of the spirit of things to try and 'optimise a set of outcomes' or 'to get the good ending'. As a result of this, every decision you make in the game seems weighty, just as every fight seems like (and irrespective of how much you've levelled up your characters) like it might just be your last. Disaster awaits around every corner. Acting on principle will sometimes lead to disastrous consequences, but so might a cynical pragmatism. The effect is that your partaking in something real, that you're not so much living out a fantasy where everything turns out wonderfully as much as you are a lead character in a tragedy: like you're roleplaying the entire cast of one of Shakespeare's history plays.Overall, what I really loved about this game was the way that it used (relatively simple) mechanics, decision trees, resource management and fairly difficult turn-based combat, to enforce the sense that my characters were fighting for their lives. I felt bruised and battered playing this game. I winced everytime a character got hit. I felt something akin to the shock and grief that my characters must have felt when a loyal companion who'd gone through hell with the party, suddenly disappeared forever not in the midst of a heroic sacrifice but out of a random occurrence or worse through one of the numerous unintended consequences of one of my carefully thought out decisions.  In fact, even the way that I ultimately kind of *sucked* at the game (e.g. being less than masterful at resource management), contributed (a rare thing) to my enjoyment of it, in the sense that it exacerbated the sense that I, like the protagonists, was heavily burdened with responsibilities that I did not know whether I could handle: that I was letting down the people I was trying to help, that I was  vacillating between letting people starve and letting them getting picked off by monsters, that I could and (continually *did*) fail by both virtue and vice, idelaism and pragmatism, trust and distrust, boldness and caution. I'm scribbling too much, but for now, I'll just say everyone (especially fans of crpgs, turn-based strategy or resource management should get this), as should anyone (designers, anyone?) thinking about the Holy Grail of the integration of narrative and ludic elements. A minor masterpiece, I can easily imagine this one playing a prominent role in classes on game design, especially where ""ludic-narrative integration"" (pretentious as the phrase may be) gets discussed.TL;DR: Gut-wrenching. Extraordinary integration of gameplay elemetns to contribute to the overall brooding, tragic, 'unforseen consequences' atmoshpere.  "

I would love to play through the game now that I am much ""wiser"".The turn based combat was fun, and thats not easy to do.  Being a noob to this type of game I played on easy because medium was just not working out.  As others found, I didn't really see what the point of having a large army was since it was just my heros fighting all the time.  Made more sense to me to starve my army to upgrade my heros.  Overall, its a fun game that I recommend *IF* your okay reading a lot because this game has very little voice acting.  To me it just felt like a good book.			"

												I was really enjoying the game and then suddenly it ended at what felt like the half way point. Played for about 10 hours.. So, just be aware, that's what $25 buys you here - ten hours' worth of the prologue and first chapters of a pretty good story. The world is very deep, with a great deal of mythological and historical detail, and the story arc is engaging although they could have used an editor, but there is a strong sense that the developers simply wanted to release the game at a certain point rather than finish the job. Perhaps there will be a more complete version of the game released at some point.			"

												I was totally caught off guard by this game. Just completed the last mission and was in shock to see the credits rolling. I can't believe it's over. You have to understand that I've been playing computer games for a very long time. I've played just about everything, from the original pong to the latest MMOs. As I've grown older, it's become more difficult to find that deep sense of immersion that can make a game experience totally awesome. Partly because I'm getting older and partly because i've been around long enough to notice the quality of games decline over the last few years. I don't even want to tell you how much money i've spent on crap games. If anyone from Stoic Studio ever reads this, I just want to say thank you. You created something beautiful and moving. You are true artists. I hope the Kickstarter thing keeps working so you guys have the freedom to make awesome games the way you want. The way we all want. And I'll be here to give you my money. You earned it. Now please make a sequel to The Banner Saga as quickly as possible. Seriously.			"

												Beautiful game, great story that you affect with choices, actions, and wins/losses in certain battles. The hand drawn animation is beautifully done; the soundtrack is straight up heartbreaking; the story fresh, entertaining, gripping, and depressing; and the game's combat and RPG mechanics are different, yet simple, intuitive, and just crunchy enough without getting too involved.EDIT: Ignore hours on record, I played almost all of this game at a time when I had no ISP.

												I can't really say enough good about The Banner Saga; i can say i regret taking so long to buy it. The artwork is amazing, the atmosphere believeable, and the story (while simplistic) is perfectly serviceable. Combat is a tad simplistic, but it's a fine RPG-lite experience. Totally recommended.

												I absolutely loved this game's music, story, combat, characters, art style, and the list goes on. This game has given me an experience that I will never be able to replicate no matter how hard I try. I can't suggest this enough, and I hope whom ever reads this gives it a chance.			"

												I liked it, but I feel it's been overhyped. The first thing you need to know is that this is essentially Chapter 1 of 3, and the story won't feel complete if you don't play the other chapters (haven't played 2 yet). Otherwise : PROS: Nice caravan system. Choice and consequence. You do have some control over how your character treats others they encounter along the way, and which characters can stick around with you. Not full control, which means some characters... are better left out. Thankfully, it's not stupidly obvious which ones that is, nor is it unrecoverable or rage-quit inducing if you let them tag along anyways. To get back on topic, this is handled well. Risk, if you like that sort of thing. It's perfectly possible to lose your best follower to some story event (I did). It's also perfectly possible to still win. Lore. This is an interesting world with interesting races, characters, etc. The story, overall. Pretty epic stuff going on there. Interesting turn-based combat system. Not your typical combat system either. Hps are used for damage, and it works because of the way armor works. Also you have to spread out your damage because each side gets  a turn in which they play a single unit, and you don't want to give high strength or undamaged units more turns (Ie: if you have 4 dudes and so do the ennemy, and you take one out, then each remaining dude plays once every 3 turn instead of once every 4. If you had instead damaged 2 units then they would have been a lot less dangerous each time their turns came up). It's refreshingly different. I wouldn't want this in every turn-based game but in this one it works. Art style. It's pretty neat. CONS: The ending. I won't say more to avoid spoilers. Except no epilogue. WTF. Managing supplies vs morale vs renown hardly seems to have mattered. Maybe I was just good at it? *shrugs* Didn't feel that way though. Was often in weak morale with no food and no renown (as I purchased a lvl 5 item before i realized how that worked. Protip : don't!). The story diverges into what I assume is the core of the sequel/trilogy's story quite quickly, which means this chapter's story is not as focused as it could have been. This is probably for the best of the overall trilogy, but it contributes to making the ending suck. Fairly short. I played about 12 hours. Overall I recommed this game as it is fairly different, and the story is engaging.			"

												Oh wow. I have just finished my first play through of The Banner Saga. It is passed midnight, I have to be up early tomorrow but I just couldn't stop playing. Tired tomorrow? Still worth it! But you must forgive me if this review seems a little hysterical. It is rather late but I just had to get my thoughts down while it is still fresh.I feel I must break down my review into categories to help me better explain just why I loved this game.First and foremost: Visuals I cannot lie that the distinct art style is what first drew me to this title. It is just breathtaking. Every scene, every character is beautifully drawn that I just could not bear to look away. Even during combat the locations and characters maintained their style. As the caravan journeys across the lands you see magnificent Godstones, carved homages to the dead Gods, the detail is amazing. The artists truly put a lot of love and effort into this game, and it shows. If they ever decided to make an animated feature film for the lore of this series I would ecstatically buy it! Seriously if you are a fan of art and animation this title should be picked up for that alone! The music I was lucky to pick this game up when it was on sale so I decided to upgrade and get the soundtrack as well. I am so glad I did. If you think the art is beautiful wait until you hear the beautiful music, composed by Austin Wintory. It adds such a beautiful ambiance to each scene. Giving you a sense of dread, comfort and awe as you pass each village and mountain. I found it never took over the scenes to the point of distraction though so never fear, it is not the type of soundtrack that you find painfully distracting while looking for the mute button. Combat Now it’s time for full disclosure. I have not played many strategy games, I played a little diablo back in the day, games like total war and Pillars of Eternity (another amazing title! Go check it out!) So I cannot say with absolute certainty that this is a sophisticated, complex strategic combat system, however I found that on normal difficulty the game was very fun and fairly easy to complete. If you are new to this style of game, this title is not intimidating and a good introduction into strategy.Player choice Now this I loved. I adore RPGs that give you decent choice. Especially if you can never be certain if the choice is the ‘right’ one. Do you let these random men into your caravan or send them away? Do you stop and help a person or be on your way? Do you side with person A? Or Person B?  Just what are the consequences? I made a decision on day 3 in game, seemed like a fair choice at the time, All seems well until sometime around day 90 that the consequences finally played out. Each choice has weight to it and no decision should be made lightly, sometimes even the obvious choice may not be the right one.  Who lives? Who dies? Well that depends on you doesnt it?Levelling and resources Now this is a balancing act! Levelling and resources use ‘renown’. Resources keep your people alive, Levelling keeps you alive in battle, winning battles gives you renown. Do you level up your character? Or wait to buy more supplies so your people and soldiers don’t starve to death? Each has their consequences but I found it fun to try and manage it all.Lore and characters I adored the characters in this game! The lore was just enthralling. I found myself wanting to read everything and learn as much as I could about the dead Gods and the Varl. It really is beautiful and interesting so I advise you to pay attention!This game is a solid 9½/10. Why does it lose half a point? Well there is one thing that annoyed me. The final boss fight. Don’t worry this is a spoiler free review. All I can say is that there was a tremendous difficulty spike. It angered me so much at one point I was tempted to lower the difficulty. Luckily I persevered and managed to finish the game without doing so. So don’t give up! But this was the only thing that bothered me in over 12 hours of gameplay.All in all I had a wonderful time, I heartily recommend this beautiful, enthralling game. I can’t wait for the sequel to be released! 9½/10 Stars!  "

												A cheap version of Heroes... slooow game. the willpower stars are not easy to understand. Too much text... Is this a possitive review? Well, yes. The art game reminds me of ""Saga"" -the comic- and the story is good. Get it for less than 5 dollars but not a penny more. The fights are good... A tutorial of the different prefights commands would be good too.  "

												Viewing it strictly as a video game it is, loosely, a turn based strategy game with some other stuff wrapped around it and it's kind of fun. If you instead view it as an immerse story telling experience wherein your primary job is to manage a caravan of refugees fleeing from the end of the world across a bleak Norse mythology inspired world where you occasionally have to play a turn based strategy minigame, it is fantastic. The Banner Saga is probably the best video game I've ever played in terms of its ability to set a tone which it does through music, writing, artwork, and game play. Highly recommended.			"

												To be entirely honest, when I saw this appear on the steam store a few weeks ago, I blindly bought it because I saw vikings, which is pretty juvenile in and of itself. I literally had no idea what to expect when I purchased it, and did no research up until its release. Let me say this; I was utterly floored by what I have experienced. This game is the perfect mix of epic story telling (the world that you become engulfed in, the characters that you invest your emotions into) and old school turn-based fighting (which doesn't really get boring because once you learn to strategize it gets interesting). It might not be game of the year, but it comes damn well close. If you like epic story, and you can handle the turn based fighting mechanics, this is a 100% reccomendation. I have fallen in love here, and I simply cannot wait for more from this studio either pertaining to this game (into a series perhaps?) or a new IC.			"

												To say this game is amazing is an understatement. Banner saga is punishing and unforgiving in both combat and choices you make through out the journey. The game is a mix between managing a carvan (people, supplies, morale and difficult choices) and grid tactical combat. The games enviroment aswell as the story kept me very engaged and attached to the characters, each choice i made brought me closer to them and made it that much harder to decide how to proceed through events. The combat is very deep and nothing feels more satisfying than surviving an encounter while your enemy lays there in pieces. The game is much like dark souls in terms of char. progression... your form of currency is renown which is either used to buy important supplies and food for your army to live and be free from sickness or used to upgrade your hero oh and you can use it to buy better items for your heros, choosing which to spend it on is never easy. All in all this game has a deep combat system, an engaging viking/human struggle story to tell and a nasty difficulty which will have you come back again and again A++			"

												Wow, this was an absolutely fantastic game.  The music and art direction are stellar.  The designers have done a great job mixing a relatively tight tactics experience into a wider battle.  Your small tactical decisions have a significant impact on how many fighters you risk overall.  Throughout the game you feel your decisions make a difference.  This is a story you live, not a simple exercise in min/maxing units.The story and the decisions you make have an impact on the journey, and an arduous one it is.

												Great turned based RPG at an affordable price.  The hand drawn art is really great, voice acting superb.  The only thing I would say, is that it is a bit on ""rails"", there is no explorable world, so if that is a must for you, then I'd steer clear.  Other than that, it has a lot of options and forked paths, it is like a ""choose your own adventure, turn based RPG"".  Similar to Oregon Trail, you go and an issue comes up, and you have to choose how to deal with it.  The RPG elements are nice, and there is a ton of tactical decisions in combat, do you want to attack the armor to allow your next character to do more damage, or take off what strength you can now to lower their strength below your own armor value.  Ranged, Melee, tanks, I only have a few hours in so this is just my first impression.			"

There is no mention on the store page that this game is not finished, and that is unacceptable.Again, Do Not Buy this game.			"

												Well this game has some very nice features but also big flaws.I really like the story, the characters are well develloped. There's a lovely viking fatasy lore that really got to me.I wish there was vocal dialogues though, not just text. Don't worry about bugs, didn't notice any problem.I'm disapointed that you can lose characters kinda randomly, this is very frustrating considering you have to invest points in upgrading them.One sad thing though, is the turn mechanic, ally, enemy, ally, enemy... no matter if you are 6 ally vs 2 enemies... totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ imo.After a few battles, you understand it's better to weaken enemies to 1-3 health (wich is also attack power) instead of killing them right now so that they take a turn without hurting you instead of their full health friends.Still, I do like the game!

The combat part of the game is a decent bit of strategy gameplay, but eventually feels a bit repetitive and simple.

												This game has an astonishing art, some very good music and a great atmosphere in general. The jewel of this game is the combat system for sure. It's not as intense as, for example, new XCOM games, more slow-paced, but still very (and I mean very) satisfying. It has some rather unique ideas too. Although the main idea of the caravan is not new under the hood - the feeling of going for the very long adventure, always struggling against the odds, always on the brink of starvation, facing betrayler here and there makes the story of the game very engaging. All of the story is served as text - a well written text. This may be a problem for some people, but in the end of the day it's like reading a nice book with incredibly beautiful pictures in it. People say it has about 12 hours of content, I was able to squeeze something around 16, but I was taking part in almost every battle I could, trying to save more lives. And this is actually my only complaint - I was a bit tired of the game's mechanics in the end.The best indie I've played to this date, you should definitely try it. But man, the art is SOOO DAMN GOOD!			"

												An absolutely beautiful game inspired by Scandinavian culture and lore from the days of old. The music and art alone are worth giving this game a try. I wholly enjoyed my time playing, watching, and listening to the story unfold. It truly does live up to the word ""Saga"" as it revolves around a long journey full of peril and the struggle to survive an quickly encroaching threat. What is amazing is that this game's universe contains a very fleshed-out map for the players to peruse. It took me 20 minutes to systematically click on and read about the universe I found myself in. It is made very clear that the game you are playing is only scratching the surface of this world.  Hopefully even more of the land will be visited in the sequel!			"

												This game is just... a must buy or die game. So must there be anymore information?The music is peaceful yet empowering, it soothes the soul but also raises spirits, the song on it's own is amazing but accompained with the game makes it immensely more fun to play. The little interaction made with the poeple in your parties of why they each have chosen to fight give you more of a reason to defend and look after you caraven. The main story has epic decisions that will greatly impact what you will do and happen to cities, massive populations and more. The battle system in place has you trying to think out your strategies and grealty reward you with renown that can buy supplies for your caravan, promote your character and buy items.The game in all has an excellent story with writing that is made by the gods (that are not dead). Amazing music that makes it worthwhile to also buy the soundtrack. Battles which have you slowly but strategically win with the warriors you have at your disposal. So buy buy buy people and don't look back.			"

												I can with complete confidence say that this is the most beautiful game that I have ever played. The artwork alone is enough to give this game a try and enjoy the intricate work that has been done. The storyline of the game is also professionally written, very deep and book like, without the unnecessary arcade action everywhere. The absence of a saving option emphasises the importance and weight of your decisions in the game witch at times may seem annoying but in the long run the overall experience is much deeper this way in my opinion. Overall a great peace of work from the entire team. Looking forward to seeing more of there work.			"

												Exceptional gameplay and scenery! I really got excited with the concept art and of course with the music! The battle system is as easy as it can get and the story - is really an epic tale!To play the devil's advocate though, I want to say that the only thing that I missed in the whole game is the narration, and I think I would liked it more if the cut scenes were enriched with simple animation. As a non-English I sometimes found trouble in understanding some of the dialogue - therefore the story... Personally I think a narration would make the game even more enjoyable.Nevertheless it is beautiful and truly emotional! I was very glad to hear that a secont installment is on it's way! "

												Beautiful art. Story is nice.This is the only turn-based game, which I found the battle rules enjoyable. Especially the initative system is awfully implemented. Basically, there are cases you should not attack an enemy unit and pass turns, so the enemy initative is spread amongst weaker units.Eventually battle rules killed the fun for me.Only recommend to buy on sale.If they add an option with revised iniative rules, I would easily rate it as 8+.Overall 6.5/10.

You take great art in a turn-based strategy game with nice music and a cool story and you basically have earned five stars automatically from me. But then you screw up on a bunch of buggyness when the game launches that makes it impossible, and you advertise choices like they matter when they usually don't and you shoot your foot clean off. 3.8/5			"

												It's a pretty game; watching the landscape clowly crawl along as your caravan moves is a really great feeling. The combat is also pretty fun. I can''t help but wish it was a bit longer though. I know they have a sequel, but I'm not completely convinced about whether I'll buy it or not.I'm just a bit unsure about the price; I finished the campaign in a little under 15 hours and I'm a pretty slow gamer at the best of times. I just don't know if there is enough content to justify the price tag. Don't get me wrong; I enjoyed the game, but I would recommend buying it on sale if you get the chance.I also had some trouble getting it to work the first time I played it; the game kept crashing whenever I tried to play. I eventually got the issue sorted out, but it's just something to consider if you're thinking about buying it.			"

												Fans of the ""tactics"" genre will love this game, which is set in a world inspired by Norse myth. You're sucked in immediately by the gorgeous art and design. Then you stay for the intricate combat and for the Oregon Trail-style survival game between fights. Make no mistake about the ""survival"" part: all games are hardcore mode (no rolling back to old saves, except at the very end of the game), bad things happen a lot, and story decisions usually have to be made on the spot, with no option to go back or put them off till later. That said, this adds a compelling immersion and gravity to the gameplay, which you really don't find in a lot of RPGs. (If minmaxing is your idea of ""role-playing,"" you won't like this game.) Another interesting feature is that no matter what you choose, the game constantly progresses forward -- there is no way to ""lose"" the game, there are just different consequences. This is not a beginner's game (unless the beginner has thick skin) -- the difficulty curve is steep, and the game doesn't give you a lot in the way of tutorials or handholding. It's also a little on the short side, which may be a pro or a con depending on whether you like replays. Having played a lot of these games, I really appreciated the depth of gameplay and the story immersion. Saves will carry forward into Banner Saga 2, so grab it now!			"

												The Banna saga is a beautiful Stylized game that takes turn based mechanics from other influential games and puts its own unique spin on them. Visuals/GraphicsThe Style of graphics that this game uses are very beautiful with cut scenes that really showcase their full potential and gameplay that integrates them nicely. The style of these graphics (Coupled with the gameplay) should make this game easy to run on most PCs whilst still being quite amazing. Sound/Atmosphere The music that strikes up sometimes when the wagon is trundling across the countryside is beautiful with a nordic feel to it that adds immensly to the games atmosphere. The gameplay sounds are also very sharp which complements the combat. GameplayI enjoyed the turnbased gameplay in the Banner Saga as it is an interesting take on turnbased combat but i also felt that more could have been added to it because it can get repetitive and easy to master quite quickly (I am going to do a Hard difficulty walkthrough and see how this changes things). The parts of the game that revolve around the characters which includes levelling up abilities and buying items is interesting and gives the game somewhat more longevity but it would also benefit by being fleshed out further. StoryThe Story in this game is amazing with decisions actually changing some parts of the game such as who lives or dies and even the ending quiet drastically. This is exciting as in your first playthrough you come to learn that most characters could be killed and this lends the story some intrigue. This mechanic can also be seen as annoying as you can spend time levelling characters up and investing resources into them only to have them killed suddenly and this has been an issue for many people playing the game. My time in The Banner Saga was enjoyable and i felt engrossed in the story and character development ! This game costs 20USD as of now and i would not reccommend picking this game up unless it is on sale as it is relatively short (My own playthrough was just over 7 hours). I can reccomend this game as a solid title that will be enjoyed by people interested in turn based games or strong story driven games. 7.5/10 Solid Title.			"

												Excellent tactics game. The game follows several characters with their allies and followers as they traverse through a norse-inspired fantasy land where it seems that Ragnarok is coming. The battles are done on a tactical grid and have extremely little randomness to them (if a unit is too weak to straight up punch through armor you have a chance of still doing 1 damage), so battles can be planned out well. There are several different stats that you can increase as the characters level up, and each seems to be approximately equivalent in power to the others. When not in battles, you lead a band of followers and need to make tough decisions and need to balance the ability to buy enough supplies to go on with the ability to get your allies trained and get them new items. There are also many decisions that will have consequences, even if what they are may not be immediately evident.			"

												What can I say about this game other than the fact that it’s absolutely fantastic.The world that is created for us is incredibly immersive and allot of this has to do with the fact that the choices we are forced to make have direct consequences for our group and in turn makes us feel more attached to the characters and adds to the overall story. A special mention must also go to the music and sound effects which in addition to the amazing artwork really helps us feel present in the storyteller’s world.If you enjoy roguelikes and compelling and immersive storytelling this is a must play.

Quick fly decisions that have long lasting impact on your parties are plentiful, similar to Oregon Trail.As a strategy fan, I'm digging the combat. No random dice. No luck of the draw. You either win because you're a better strategist than the AI or you fail because you didn't capitalize on your best assets. Considering how fed up I am with RNG determining games, it's a refreshing and welcome change of pace.It's also a Kickstarter success story and I hope you all support the hell out of this title so we can show AAA game designers huge budgets for sloppily rehashed ideas is not what gamers want.

												An RPG with turn-based tactical combat and lots of tough decisions and moral dilemmas, old-Bioware-style. Casual gamers who just want to play for the story will find an enjoyable, high-fantasy epic inspired by Norse mythology and culture.Plenty of interesting characters, but many of them can die in the story based on your decisions. Perma-death can also occur if you lose certain scripted battles, which adds some XCOM-Ironman tension.Hardcore gamers who want to master the combat will find that the mechanics are like a fusion between Devil Survivor + Dofus + Fire Emblem. Turns are always alternated between yourself and the opponent, and because damage and hitpoints both come from the same stat, you must always find a way to protect your damage dealers from harm -- otherwise the battle might become unwinnable because no one is able to deal damage. Basic, common-sensical turn-based tactics still apply here, but you must learn several new tricks (such as leaving near-dead enemies alive to obstruct stronger enemies from reaching you).Overall, an enjoyable game for the combat, story, and tough in-game decisions. However, beware of the final boss battle: on Normal/Hard difficulty, it's an absolutely unfun and frustrating fight that will seriously test your patience.			"

												It's over-priced. It's boring -- long and frequent loading screens, static dialogue screens, endless watching a caravan move from one end of the screen to the other. The combat is on a bare grid, against usually the same enemies -- after the first few fights you'll be sick of them. The story is unfinished. The choices are either the same choice worded in different ways or too random to matter. It's not really about Vikings -- at best it has a Scandinavian ""vibe"" (names, art style, and some voice-acting). I feel like I was cheated and the game was not marketed accurately. The visuals and music are good -- maybe that explains how it got  a high rating within minutes of relase?			"

												I'm not a big fan of this game. The Developers made it so you cannot just save/load whenever you want, for the sake of meaninful choices. But for someone kinda obsessive like myself, thats a damn nightmare, people are dying left and right due to choices in scenes, and theres just nothing I can really do about it. I guess they were trying to give it a realistic feel where choices matter big time, but damn. Obviously I'm going to want to choose certain characters over others and such, I shouldn't have to have a damn walkthrough just to avoid a certain character dying.I restarted the first battle like...10 times thinking there was some way I could save a certain character, even if you clean house with the enemies, they still die. Theres another point right after that where you are given a choice, and I was trying to be a bit of a♥♥♥♥♥♥and just let one person die, but nope, so and so jumps in and gets smooshed instead. Woulda been nice if I seen that coming.Anyway, if your a casual gamer, I'd recommend this game. But if your hardcore, or obessive, or have OCD even, this is just going to torture you.It'd be like what happens to Aeris in FF7, but for multiple characters. The fact that I need to consult a guide to know ahead of time who is going to die when so I can avoid leveling them is just silly.			"

												Score: 9/10The Banner Saga is the first part of a trilogy, so the story doesn't end here, leaving a lot to be told. Despite that, the game has amazing art work, good music, a good approach to player failure (after all, you don't win every battle you fight), and a ""not going back"" approach that enhances the weight of every decision you make, leaving you with a unique feeling of consequence upon your choices.

												I really wanted to recommend this game. There were just too many negatives from my perspective to recommend it. Here are the ""I would like to recommend the game BUT...""Most importantly, there was just simply too much waiting on the caravan to travel from one place to another where you're just watching... well... the caravan travel from one place to another. That really killed most of the enrapturement (sp?) about the story for me; it detaches you from the continuity of the story's most-appealing drama.Another 'but' to a lesser extent, is the fact that some elements either don't work, such as the morale (spent the larger portion of the end of the game with the lowest morale possible with no effect), or are counter-productive, such the use for renown to purchase supplies AND upgrade the characters with. Eventually, I felt that I had to trade off one for the other.There were some other minor nuisances but they're not worth mentioning.The good news is that the story was riveting (albeit a little on the short side - It only took me ~20 hours to finish the game on normal and that includes the battles and the meaninglessly arbitrary zombieing as I helplessly watched the caravan trudge their way across one terrain after another) and the battle system was somewhat engaging but was significantly redundant - the final boss battle was far too easy . I still hear myself yelling inside my own head ""THAT's IT!!!???""I hope some of these issues are addressed in the sequel coz I really wanna love this game.			"

												It's been said already, but the art direction of this game is spectacular. Reminiscent of Dragon's Lair and ""good"" Disney animation, this game is visually stunning. I'm on a huge fan of turn-based RTS, but the pace of the combat fits my playstyle well. The bleakness of the game, both visually and in the fact that major characters die from your actions (or inactions) is really refreshing.			"

												I thought this was a beautiful game to play and thoroughly enjoyed how it willed me to continue on, even after making bad decisions. The game doesn't just stop because you've lost a fight or made a single bad choice which resulted in a character dying, the story simply adapts. For that reason alone, I highly recommend anybody to play through this game.The only negative is the ending. It feels awfully abrupt and doesn't tie up the countless loose ends that you open up throughout the game. I was somewhat relieved to hear that they have other ""episodes"" planned in the future though, although no official announcement as to whether this will actually go ahead or when they'll be coming.

												First, I'll start by stating the obvious.  The graphical design, battle animations, and music are absolutley amazing!  I felt like I was engaged in a movie (in a good way) as well as playing a game.  I only crashed once while playing this game, so I'd say it's stable. If you are looking for an action packed game, then this is NOT for you.  I would say this is a casual, relaxing game at best.  All you need is a mouse to point and click.  TBS is as linear as a game can be.There is a very detailed map in the game that feels wasted.   Every nook and cranny has detailed lore about it, but you're not going to explore over half of it, which is a shame.There are 3 races in the game.  Humans, Varl and Dredge.  I feel like they could have done more with the Dredge.  There are about 4 or 5 different looking dedge sculpts, then each of those has a couple colour variations of the same sculpt.  So after a few battles with them, it can get a bit tedious fighting the same enemies over and over again.The reknown system is both your XP and currency.  You gain it from killing enemies, or through the decisions you make throughout your travels.  It can get very frustrating when you have to make a choice of starving your army or promoting or buying items.  I really wish they would have put gold or silver in the game to buy items and supplies.You get 1 reknown for killing an enemy, no matter how big or how small.  It would be nice to be rewarded a bit more for killing larger enemies.Also, your characters only get a reknown towards their promotion if they get the killing blow on an enemy.  I'm still trying to figure out if I like this or not, because it definitely adds strategy to the game, if you are trying to level up a certain character.  The downside is you could have a character make some really critical strikes that help your teamates, but if they don't get that last shot to kill the enemy they will stay a low rank and die easily as you progress.Combat is simplistic.  Hit their strength or armor.  There are no tactics such as flanking or backstabbing, which really makes the battles feel tedious as you progess through.  I think they can do a lot more with this system to spice it up rather than just rushing forward and hoping you kill them before they kill you.On to the caravan sequences.  As you travel town to town you will get dialog options that will help, harm, or do nothing based on your dialog choices.  You will lose caravan followers, supplies, and even playable characters (used in battles).   A lot of people feel like this is just a pointless guessing game, as some logical choices harm you and some bad choices help you, but not always.... so in a way they are right, it is a guessing game, but there were a lot of times when I was really surpised by the outcome, good or bad, it gave the game some depth for me and really brought me into some dark times (people starving, poor morale, people unhappy with my choices and leaving), but Iwas fine with that.  It really playied into the dark depressing atmosphere of the game, and because my main characters were not natural leaders, the guessing part really made sense to me.  It made me appreciate those choices that worked out in my favor that much more!All in all, I recommend this game!  I really enjoyed it and felt like I got my moneys worth.   It was a breath of fresh air from the games I usually play. Yes, there are some things they can improve on and I'm sure they will if they make another installment.  I give it a 7.5/10 "

												So far, I've thoroughly impressed with immersive world of the Banner Saga. Viking culture and mythology are quickly becoming an overdone thing in games, but I feel that this world is more than unique enough to be interesting. The interactive world map, which tells you about places you hover over is also great, and if you're truly into the lore behind games, you can get a lot of information about it, and it displays a truly developed world. The combat is also quite good. I've only had a few fights, but they are tactical and precise, with a wide array of different fighters that have different abilities to be used.			"

												If you like games that make you feel things, you're in luck.Combat is.... interesting. I don't know if I'd consider it good, mainly due to the way turns alternate (regardless of the number of combatants on each side) you end up with kinda ♥♥♥♥y situations. I also pretty much shouted at my computer once or twice when the aggro mechanics meant one of my characters got targeted by every enemy for 2 solid runs of turns because his armor was 1 less than full. Combat aside, the story is compelling and the characters are interesting. You genuinely feel bad when they suffer and smile when they develop because of choices you make. You care about them, basically. If nothing else, it was a welcome diversion from my life to explore this gorgeous fantasy tale.			"

At first glance......I thought this game to be one of the same over-simplified turn-based combat-driven games I've been avoiding since that genre (and my interest in it) peaked along with the rise of Gameboys. I've become rather disinterested in comparing shallowly described classes and carefully coordinating important story battles such that my opponents are always outmatched before combat even begins. I'm particularly bored with the fantastical colors and purple-teal magical glows that have illuminated far too many games since Warcraft made the scheme popular, each new level bringing bigger and brighter spells until the screen resembles a cosplay rave party. More of my discomfort comes from the tedious line-by-line conversations with innumerable boring, lifeless mouthpieces for plotlines.Drawn to Norse mythology and anyone willing to give it the credit it deserves in our modern creative landscape, I set aside my defensive suspicions and took a second glance, a third, and eventually an eleventillionth. This is a spectacularly well made game that knows exactly who it is and what it was meant to be, systematically ignoring every expectation in favor of its own designs. I find myself at a loss to compare it because there is no reason to do so. Simply put, this is the Banner Saga.A list, if you need one:Though numerous, classes are barely more than labels to help you recall the character of each member of your party. They are unchangable memory sinks for behaviors in combat and a helpful tool for describing the titles within the cultures of the two main races.The heart and soul of the northern mythologies is as clear and chilling in this saga as the harsh landscapes they emerged from. Your characters march onward through the blistering blizzards that blanket the earth in snow, the cool breezes that chase across green fields, and the dark shadows cast by craggy mountains even as troubles press endlessly upon them from all sides. As their hopes freeze, hidden strengths unthaw, bringing forth the selfless valor that once fueled one of the fiercest cultures in human history.Banner Saga is ten parts story and ten parts gameplay--out of ten. Rather than being set loose to interview town after town, progressing from quest to quest and moving freely between to train your party, Banner Saga permanently aligns the two in a single, linear journey that winds its way towards and away from harm with each new decision you make. Along the way you face both internal and external threats, each delivered with the utmost forwardness such that you immediately recognize and accept the costs of your actions and move on, even at the cost of your own party (as opposed to abusing your saves). There is as much story within your own party as there is in your travels and you are free to choose your own way forward even if circumstances often influence your inevitable direction.To die is to have lived. At first you will watch as your party grows, meeting each individual and initiating your search into their past and into their motives. Many of them will be taken from you long before you get a chance to truly know them and others will submit or rebel, dramatically altering the composition of your band until you come to realizethat there is no time to understand them all.The visuals in this game are inspired. Hand drawn and uniquely detailed characters lend an incredible depth to conversations and the shifting glances, blinks, and blowing winds keep the otherwise still images from appearing as static thumbnails. The parallaxed landscapes provide a smooth, easy transition between the more sketched out locations in the game and a true sense of scale that holds up against the immensities of the world.The map of the world provided for this game is incredibly detailed and intuitive to use. Quick, short descriptions reveal how the world came to be the way it is and the first few times you peruse it you'll find yourself digging deeper into the lands around you until your curiosity is sated. I'm fairly sure there's a considerable amount beyond the scope of the game itself even.If you close your eyes and listen to the music, you'll almost certainly feel the snowflakes melting gently on your nose and lightly dusting your shoulders and hair as a cool wind passes you by.

												Innovative and Compelling, this game was absolutly fantastic. If you read no further heres the bottom line, Buy.Tthis.Game. Throughout the entire game I had the sense that my choices actually mattered and affected the world around me. The story telling was driven, fresh, and innovative. I loved the level of realism and grittiness that was displayed through the story telling, random events, and combat really helped with the imersion of the game. For me however, the real heart and soul of this game was the atmosphere of the world. Combing the weather, the art style, and the music really pushed this game into a higher tier of games. Very memorable, very immersive, will play again.Pros:Very atmospheric soundtrackGritty story tellingWeather SystemChoices carry weightRealistic Moral expectationsDeep character development, and interactionsBeautiful Art styleSolid, and detailed combat systemResource managment was challegingCaravan interaction really filled in the travel sections and made it interestingCons:I felt like the stoy was cut short (sequel?)The reknown system seemed a bit...lore breaking? In a game that seems to be completely invested in itself I think that there should have been two seperate systems, one for unit upgrades, and one for trade and other economics. You cant buy food with your battle prowess.Addition of being able to trade supplies for Its on sale for $5 until November 16th. If you enjoy SRPGs then this game is for you. If you enjoy atmospheric and immersive story-telling this game is for you. If you want to spend 10 hours playing a great game this game is for you.			"

												Wow... this game! I came into it with high expectations and it delivered. It was fairly difficult to get over the first 3 hours or so, the story was a bit tough to get behind, but fight was fun and the characters had quite a bit of depth.After that it was a marathon, sped up through it in something like 2 days. Feels a bit bad for my time management, but had a BUNCH of fun. The game gives you much more than just tactical combat (which kinda fluctuates in difficulty across the game and finds an unnecessary spike in end-game, in my opinion).My favourite part, by far, was deciding on the small calls you have to make throughout your journey and seeing how they play out. I went with the calls that I would make in real life, and it ended up being quite emotional towards the late game. I still think, like I mentioned, that the ending battle was unnecessarily difficult, but hey, if you don't feel like grinding it, just change the difficulty (which I did). Also, quite strangely, it ends with a loose end, which left a question mark in my head, but other than that, just BRILLIANT!			"

												Its a beautiful game, not so much even in terms of visuals, but in the story.  The game has a poetry and it leads you on an epic storybook-like tale.  You make meaningful decisions along the way, and based on those decisions your people, including playable companions might live or die. I'm writing this before banner saga 2 has been released, but the developers are saying that your actions in the first game will carry over which makes your actions in the first game all the more important.  The combat system is also a lot more interesting than a lot of tactical rpgs, and despite knowing the story, I've played the game all the way through 4 or 5 times now just because of how fun the combat is.I highly recommend this game.

The addition of the Giants really brings a nice breath of fresh air to the Tactical RPG genre. The story is excellent, with great characters that you'll quickly grow to love. The quasi-norse mythology is engaging and interesting. The developers have done an excellent job crafting a world clearly rooted in mythology, but also unique in it's own way. If this is what I can expect out of every kickstarter endevour, there's a very bright future for the game industry.			"

												If you don't want to read all of this here's the short of it: I love this game. Plain and simple. It's stunningly gorgeous, extremely well animated, and the story is very compelling and moving. It has it's flaws, but I don't find these flaws severe enough to keep myself or anyone from playing this game. It's basically Fire Emblem crossed with Oregon Trail. If thatsounds good to you then, by all means, buy this game. You'll have a blast. Now that that's out of the way, let me explain the shortcomings of this game that I've experienced. There are, by my reckoning, two major problems. One is the options menu. The other appears to be a mild stability issue which may or may not affect you.  In the course of my sessions I've found that during extended periods of gameplay it tends to suddenly go into a window and become unresponsive. Effectively leaving me no choice but to force quit via the task manager. Otherwise it runs very smoothly with no drops in frame-rate.Secondly, the options menu is practically non-existent. You can, somewhat, adjust sound by clicking on some icons that don't  really explain themselves very well or switch from full-screen to windowed--and that's about it. Granted, the game was set up so well that I didn't feel like I needed to change anything in the options menu. But still, it's nice to have a wide array of options.Aside from the options menu and the fact that it seems to crash from being played for too long--it's a fantastic game!  I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with the Banner Saga. The only thing that I think could make it better, aside from fixing the flaws mentioned above, would be to add more content--new character classes, more story/quests etc. I especially wish that all the cutscenes could have been animated like the opening one. But it's understandable that they could not maintain that throughout. I have some minor issues with how the story ended. It seems like they may be trying for a sequel at some point since a lot of questions were left unanswered. Hopefully Stoic was successful enough with this that they can expand upon the story and world with future releases.All in all, I had a lot of fun with it. If you love strategy games then you'll love this.			"

												I just finished TBS, the first game I've finished in 2014. Helps that it was short, I'm thinking no more than 6-8 hours of actual, non-experimentation, non-reloading last checkpoint play time. This is one of the games I Kickstarted back when that was a thing (meaning before I figured out that it really wasn't worth it). No regrets through, well worth the KS$.The game looks and sounds great. The visuals (Eyvind Earle-inspired) and music (Austin Wintory) are major parts of what drew me to TBS in the first place. The game universe, billed as a Viking fantasy, is competent. There's nothing groundbreaking about the story or characters, but they serve the purpose.Gameplay is hit/miss. I'm a TBS (turn-based strategy of course) fan, but the oversimplified systems of TBS (The Banner Saga, of course) leave me wanting more options. Even the Gold Box TSR games had more combat choices than this. The initiative and action mechanisms leave a lot to be desired, as units don't have fixed speeds. It's always a he-goes-you-go deal, so if you mop up weak units early you're left with more powerful units acting more often. This leaves you with a counterintuitive strategy of weakening units without killing them. I'm also torn on the health-as-attack-power thing, but that much I can live with. Last glaring thing for me is the lack of any way to influence movement. Short of a couple of minor abilities that address threat, AI units can waltz around your melee units and go right for ranged. Nothing you can do to stop them.The overland mechanisms are brutal, but if you've played King of Dragon Pass that's nothing new. The game has one currency, caller Renown, which is gained by killing enemies. Renown is used to level characters, buy items and buy supplies that keeps your army alive while travelling overland. You're probably not going to be able to afford any items, unless you're willing to lose people to starvation (events generally cost you supplies as you travel) or you're going to show restraint when levelling your characters (which can backfire if a toon you've invested a lot or resources in gets auto-killed in an event). Still, this is a thing you can get used to compared to the combat.The save system can be confusing, but the game seems to save frequently on its own. You can't seem to manually save, but on hitting Load you can see that it's got three checkpoint saves. Not too bad. The system options are sparse for a PC game in 2014 - no volume controls, no graphics options. Again, nothing too bad. What I wanted most was Steam Cloud save capability, but it's not there. All mostly quality of life stuff here, which may be upgraded when the second chapter ships.Word of warning - this is the first part of a planned trilogy, so the ending kind of feels exactly like that. There's a major event/battle, but a lot of loose ends remain to lead into chapter two. If you were ok with the ending of The Fellowship of the Ring (old school) or The Hunger Games (new school), you'll be fine. :)Overall though I'm satisfied with the game. This is my third KS'd game to deliver (FTL and Shadowrun Returns were my first two) and so far all three are winners in my book. This actually kind of feels like Shadowrun Returns in terms of heft/depth/scope. I recommend TBS to anyone who's into the genre.			"

												Wasted three full evenings trying to play this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, had to uninstall.Gameplay drives me crazy. -No manual saving, only autosave once in a while. -Frustrating battles: you have to plan your actions several turns ahead, and one small mistake may cost you a big chunk of one hero's hp, which makes him useless... Then you lose the battle and have to load a while ago.-Idiotic idea of alternating turns: instead of reducing effect of outnumbering, it just makes you spare lives of damaged enemies so that the stronger ones act less often.-Unskippable animations of slowly moving caravan.-Completely unpredictable choices. If you don't want to lose all opportunities, get a walkthrough (and thus, put up with spoilers).Want an interesting story? Go read a book or watch a movie.			"

												This game is simply great. For what it is, a simple and relatively small story-based indie game with interesting tactical combat, it works brilliantly. The art is gorgeous, the characters are memorable, and the story and choices you make all feel meaningful. The whole atmosphere of the game is just great. Stoic has really succeeded in making a game that drags you right into a deep world with an original feeling. That isn't to say the game doesn't have flaws, because it certainly does. At times, it might feel a bit slow paced, and if the tactical combat or text-based choice making does not interest you (and I can understand why it wouldn't), then this game is not the right one for you. But all things considered, this game is a true gem.			"

												I hesitated for quite some time before deciding to recommend this game. Here's why.1) The game claims that every decision will be meaningful, and superficially, they are. The game provides you with nowhere near enough currency (renown) to upgrade every party member, purchase items, or maintain your supplies. Therefore, you must choose carefully where to spend your renown. However, there's no way to keep most characters from dying during a dialogue/decision. Even if they are fully upgraded, if a decisions outcome is that they will die, then there's nothing you can do except return to an earlier save. Also, the number of people in your caravan has little to no effect, except in a couple of decisions, so you may as well let them starve. Items can't be sold either, so there's little reason to invest in most of them. All this just left me feeling that there was no point to anything I was doing, as the game would arbitrarily take things from me regardless. 2) The combat definitely takes some getting used to. You are forced between choosing to attack your foes armour, to deal more damage later, or their health/strength, represented by a single number, which means you can get them closer to death as well as reduce your enemy's damage when they attack. As nuanced as this makes the battles, there is never any terrain to hide behind, put archers on, or bottleneck the enemy with, so it still becomes a matter of taking your highest strength party members and trying to get the first hit on any opponent strong enough to break through your armor. There's no perma-death from battles, as far as I could tell, only a few days of recovery from being felled, so you may as well bring the same six characters until the game cheapshots them in the unknowable outcome of a dialogue or decision.3) It's very short, on the easiest difficulty it took me under 10 hours to reach the credits. It may take longer if you play on harder difficulties, but I feel the almost random nature of the consequences would make the experience futile. If you just masterfully won a battle with your last fit character at the hardest difficulty, what would you feel when a minute later when that character dies? Or half your party leaves because the plot said they would? Or because you picked the 'wrong' option, even though there was no indication what it might lead to? Better perhaps, to play on easier difficulties, where you at least feel like you can make a useful impact on the condition of your caravan.So why then, would I recommend a game which blindsides you at every turn, makes you feel like you have no meaningful agency as a player, and seems clearly designed to depress you? Because by doing those three things (and with it's incredibly beautiful rotoscoped graphic style and haunting music) it oozes the atmosphere it needs to provide an engaging story and world. If winning combat meant anything significant except less time injured, you'd have no reason to try and avoid it through your decisions. If you could keep everyone alive, you'd only pick the options which kept them so. If there was enough currency to upgrade everyone, you'd never have to worry about any single character being taken from you as you'd have a better replacement.This may be a game you will find little to no joy in, but I feel like that's what it had to be to really capture the futility and helplessness so core to it's story. I cannot help but wonder if it might have been better as an animated film/mini-series, or whether that would only have reduced the thematic power of the story. Who knows?What I can say, is that if you can approach the game as it wants to be approached (i.e. without imagining that you can 'win' or that your decisions can be 'right' instead of just 'yours'), there is definitely something worthwhile there.

												Interesting game...i can't say i've played anything quite like it.I found the plot, characters and setting very engaging and it kept me playing day after day until I completed it.  However I do have to say the combat leaves much to be desired - it's fairly slow and dry (but in a way does fit the scene so to speak).  There are better recent examples of turn based combat.Regarding difficulty I played on Normal and barely made it through a few fights and had to deal with starvation several times.  I expect Hard difficulty gets a bit dull unless you're very familiar with all the class abilities.  Despite my playtime it took probably 10 hrs to complete.Overall definitely recommended to anyone interested in a story-driven turn based game.			"

												This one's a great turn-based strat woven into beautiful 2D visuals with a kickass soundtrack and some RPG goodness.  I enjoyed it immensely.High replayability as choices you make throughout can greatly impact the game. ♥♥♥♥♥♥someone off, they'll stab you in the back and steal your supplies.  Make rash battle decisions like rushing into a mob head-on and you'll lose warriors.  Just a few examples of things that played out in my first playthrough.  The story is outstanding, which is expected from ex-Bioware folks.  Most of the ""cutscenes"" are not voiced out and you'll find yourself doing quite a bit of reading.  I know this can be a detractor for a lot of gamers but I didn't find it to be an issue.Overall, I highly recommend this one.  It's a nice change of pace from much of today's rinse-repeat annual reboot of the same CoD clone.			"

Love it. Looking forward to the next in the series.The gameplay is fun and interesting. The story is epic. The characters are interesting and tend to cause you to get upset when bad things happen to them. The normal difficulty level is not harsh (no game overs) but not a breeze, either. Next playthrough I'll try on hard, and go for some more of the challenge achievements.The combat mechanics resemble those from other turn-based tactics games. I appreciate that this game was tuned such that every single stat point matters, and such that all stats are equally important. There is no ""never put points into that"" stat, and your choices simply must reflect your strategy. The game also has a little bit of chess heritage in it. In between battles, the game is a lot like Oregon Trail, and even has some easter-egg references to that. You encounter a variety of story events and have to decide how to handle each thing that comes up in your caravan. Depending on what you choose, you might gain or lose allies, fight extra battles or avoid them, acquire special items, gain or lose caravan population or morale, etc. I'm not sure what degree of randomness applies to these events after my first playthrough.I found that I struggled with combat earlier in the game, despite already being familiar with the mechanics from Factions, but as I leveled my heroes and had more choices to fill my lineup with, things got easier on average. I managed to lose a couple of battles and was too weak to take on some of the optional ones, so next playthrough I'll have to be a bit more careful to unlock a few of the achievements. On the other hand, the caravan-management seemed overly easy-breezy at first, but then got very difficult towards the end. It was never clear to me whether or not I shoud stock up on supplies or if what I had was plenty to get me to the next place to buy some (or if they would be cheaper or more expensive). At any rate, I think I spent too much renown on supplies early on which cost me hero levels, and then didn't have any renown left to spend when the supplies were cheapest and then finally ran out in the final stretches of the journey, losing morale and most of the population of the caravan before the end. At that point in the game it wasn't clear whether it would have been advantageous to have an army with me or not, as those numbers didn't seem to come into play in the story events any more anyway.Some of the events are ""wars"" where your caravan population are weighed against the hordes of dredge somehow, but I was never able to tell what effect these numbers had on the outcomes, or what the results would be of the various options for approach that you have to choose from. In my game, either I charged in with my team of heroes and fought a normal-looking battle against some dredge, or I chose some other option and we were defeated and lost population.			"

												Firstly I will say this game is utterly beautiful. The characters, the environment, and music(which is not played enough) are all very reminiscent of the old classic Disney movies. That being said the story is actually pretty good, even if the ending leaves you bit unfulfilled. The game still weaves a pretty good story, and really make the player feel the decisions that they make. I'm assuming that Stoic is seeing how the game does first before they continue this saga. The combat is much like any other Strategy RPG. The only grip about it, is that instead of one side going first or characters going in different orders based on stats, the turns go back and forth regardless. For instance player moves one unit, computer moves one unit and so forth. This system feels very odd to me, as the computer can easily gang up on 1 person because you have to alternate before you can get that character to safety. Once again that's my biggest gripe is on the combat. Rather than use a full team of characters it easier to have just 4 players that are your strongest and use them. Overall the game is great even if it feels like a slow bleed. The game is bleak, and most of the time you are simply struggling to survive. Game runs about 12 hours, will the intent of playing through a few times to see all different decisions.			"

												I really liked the banner saga. The Banner Saga has beautiful rotoscoped animation, and an immersive world that feels like you are set out on an Epic journey. It's norse viking world was a refreshing break from more stereotypical fantasy genre games. The game struck all the right chords in its landscape design. It evokes a sense of awe as your caravan comes upon the towering stone monuments, marches through chilling frozen wastes and descends into the smoking husks of destroyed cities. The decision making process in the game added another element to the game, as your caravan and characters depend on you to make the right decisions for their survival. If you make the wrong decision someone might die. I wish the game was longer, and can't wait for an expansion. I'd like to see a longer story line and more features, even if they were as simple as letting you explore the various rest houses found in the game, and conversing with locals there. More voice acting is something i would like to see as well.The turn based combat, is very good, i really liked the smooth animation here as well. One thing I would like to see in an expansion is more variance on the number of enemies encountered. I was almost consistantly outnumbered and fighting uneven battles never in my favor. It would have been nice every once in a while to get the jump on someone for a chance to pillage their supplies.			"

												A very different tactical RPG that I have ever previously played. The art, storytelling and music were things that I really did like, especially because the storyline choices that you make during the game could have consequences through-out the story (main characters can die!).  For people who have played Kingdom of Dragon Pass, the possible reward/atrocity depending on what you choose from that game is very similar to this one, at least in during the storyline portion of the game.There were a few things that I did not like. The combat was fun, but I found it slightly unbalanced in favour to the enemies that you fought against. I also found the renown that you gain (XP, but used for buying items and supplies as well) was in short supply, and at end-game in my 1st playthrough I hadn't fully leveled up my characters. Finally, the game seemed pretty short for the $24.99 that I had to pay to play the game, especially considering the ending of the game  just seemed to be geared up for a sequel (there were a lot of unresolved plot issues). All-in-all, I still found it to be a good game with great storyline and music. For people who like a story driven game, or tactical RPG's, I would recommend this game. However, I would recommend to pick it up on sale because the normal asking price is not worth it for such a short game... unless you are someone who likes multiple playthroughs with different stories each time. 7.5/10			"

												I couldn't recommend this game enough. The story and art are largely what will make this one of the best games I've beaten in recent memory. Your decisions matter, your journey matters, and ultimately it feels like the game mechanics actually work to represent the story mechanics well enough. That being said, there are no elevation changes, cover systems, advanced intitiative mechanics, and some scenarios in the game seem too pushed instead of chosen. What I do like is the utility of the strength stat, that armor break is never influenced by a character fatigued in battle, that target square abilities are not abusive, that on HARD mode the game really shows a sense of exhaustion between combat, that losing combat is acceptable, battle decisions and war mechanics, the give and take of travel, that items are limited one per character, that Renown is used both for bolstering forces but also supplying the caravan, and generally I enjoy the tightness of the system to limit having super powered units. There is no Orlandu, and no solo Ramza. There is only the cold, unabiding, and godless lands.			"

												Great music, amazing art style, and brilliant story-driven gameplay. Its not a game I would usually choose to play, but the survival element and migration aspect was very appealing. You really get a sense that the land and everyone in it are experiencing a great calamity and with the encounters you experience on your journey, there is a sense of urgency and survival. My complaints are the length of the game and the price. The game is pretty short, and you think you can level up more characters before the end but thats not the case, I ended up with medium level characters for the last boss because I spread the points a bit to liberally. I had focused on a few characters, but replaying a new game you know you can ditch and forget some characters over others, mainly picking characters for their ability over anything else. The game does have replay value, and its fun to know what you will do next time knowing what happens, but after that your only left with multiplayer, or maybe replaying it to find out alternatives to minor narratives along the game. The current price is a bit much, but not too far from what I would expect to pay for a quality (if not short) game like this. Its a very good game, and very enjoyable and does a great job at sucking you into the world (wait till you see the map, all that lore!). Hopefully Stoic will make the next game in this trilogy a bit longer, but apart from that its a winning gameplay formula and style.			"

												In all the ways a game utilizes already established forms of art, the Banner Saga excels.  The visuals are stunning in their detail, beauty, and style evoking the legacy of Eyvind Earle.  The music evokes the mood and setting quite deftly.  The narrative itself perfectly balances world-threatening-menace endemic to fantasy storytelling and more intimate plotlines focusing around the theme of family.Mechanically the game is novel.  The complexity of the combat emerges from simple mechanics, and (refreshingly) cannot be gamed by grinding.  In this way I would say that the experience of combat is well curated.There are also larger scale 'war' battles.  These consist of giving the size of the respective forces, and letting the character pick from a variety of tactical options.  Most of these options (i.e., 'charge,' 'formations,' etc) result in playing out a regular battle with the option to go a second round to earn greater rewards.  The biggest flaw in this aspect of the game is that it isn't made particularly clear what effect the various options actually have.The other mechanical aspect of the game involves managing a caravan of refugees as they treck agross the games gorgeously detailed world.  This basically involves managing food by purchasing it in town and gaining (or losing) it in events in the world and managing morale by deciding when to make camp and rest.  Most of the events in the game are sort of choose-your-own-adventure dialogue puzzles.  Unlike, say, BioWare games there are definitely wrong answers in dialogue and saying or doing the wrong thing can result in losing valuable party members or resources.The pacing of the game is slow and plodding, but for me this actually added to the experience.  The pacing evokes the slog, misery, and dread that must be experienced by the Banner Saga's Protagonists.The Banner Saga has my hearty recommendation.			"

												A beautfully scripted saga with epic music and gorgeous graphics.Now the downsides it's quite short, there is virtually no variation in the gameplay, any decisions you make you can't do so based on judgement the outcome is pure luck.It's fun enough while it lasts but not worth the asking price, around the £5 mark would be right.

												While I myself normally don't play these type of games.  I am very glad I did end up playing The Banner Saga.  The characters are great the combat is great.  I do wish there was fully voice acted scenes but I got used to reading after a bit.  The game surprised me by making me feel for the characters and how really dark the vibe of the game had.  Some moments were ""happy"" but very few parts of the game are like that.  You can imagine the kind of stress and pain the characters go through while on the journey.  I really enjoyed this game and can't wait for the second one coming this year!			"

												This game is superb in terms of audio and visual. Music is so beautiful and haunting. The soundtracks are really worth to buy. I still can't believe that this is an indie game! The artworks are so pretty but the game itself does not offer a lot of animations. Combats are a bit repetitive due to lack variety of enemies and skills. Story is sub par but can be interesting (and annoying) when you make wrong decisions. The 'renown points' stuff is interesting. You have to trade points in order to level up AND to buy some supplies. Hence, you have to trade wisely since there isn't any other 'payment' method.Audio: 11/10Visual: 8/10Story: 6/10The Banner Saga with rice? 7/10I can hardly wait for TBS2!!!			"

												I really like some of the core concepts of this game.  It combines oregon trail with something like fire emblem or FF Tactics and if it were just that I would probobly love this game to death.  Unfortunately, I can't reccomend this game because there is such an overwhelming amount of unneeded and completely uninteresting storyline you are constantly forced through.  I just popped back in to play, for example, and couldn't actually play any game for over 10 minutes because I had to watch 80's style cartoon characters I couldn't care less about blather on to each other.  I'd hate to know how long it would have taken had I not been wildly clicking to just get past it.To conclude, the gameplay here is awesome except you rarely get to play the game.  Most of the time is simply spent wasting time in a way that isn't even entertaining.			"

												I really tried to like this game. I have been looking at it for several weeks and when it popped up on Steam Sale, I was thrilled. However, I just can't get past the turn based fighting style which is very confusing and challenging. I only could stick with it for the first chapter and can't continue.  Definately not a game for beginner strategist or players.  I would not recommend for anyone looking for somthing fun and easy.  Just not my cup of tea.			"

												Was longing for this game to be released!Love the art and the music and looked forward to a long intresting single player campaign with an epic story and gripping dialouge... The story is 'meh', the dialogue is 'yeah whatever'. Besides the fighting system, which i somewhat enjoy, the game consists of a dialogue guessing game which is suppose to have an effect on the world. Alot of the choices you make either has no effect at all or instantly makes you lose one of your characters, often in ways that doesnt make any sense. And as you progress through the game you can suddenly find out that you for unexplained reasons have lost even more characters since the last chapter, which at some points leaves you with a bunch of low level characters in your party. I understand that all not all dialogue choices can have forseeable effects, but in this game the effects are sometimes just plain absurd and frustrating.			"

												great art great music great story lots of things about the banner saga are simply great. The setting feels vibrant and alive and the score by Austin Wintory (same guy who did the OST for Journey) perfectly complements and builds on the atmosphere. The story takes place in a viking like world in the midst of an apocalypse. The sun has stopped, the Gods are dead, hordes of long forgotten foes pour out of the north and serpent the size of mountains rips apart the earth itself. In the face of this, bands of humans an giant horned varl struggle to stay alive and it is your job to guide them through this. Gameplay wise, the banner saga plays like the Oregon trail, you manage your caravans resources and make descisions that may gain or lose party members, with grid-based battles. The sheer challenge of the battles and the constant struggle to maintain morale and food supplies helps to create of feeling of desperation  and futility further building upon the 'end of the world' theme of the game. One of the only problems that i personally had with the game is that some seemingly trivial choises would end up losing you a unit and this felt cheap, more dumb luck then an actual costly mistake.Overall this is a must-play for any fan of turn based stategy games or anyone who justs wants a good story in a beautiful. immersive world. 9.5/10			"

												I gathered the caravan and head out, leaving behind a ruined town. Smoke still smoldering from the recent infighting while refugees continued pouring in, threatening to implode the city like a rotten bloated frog.As we reach the hill side, a scout called out. ""Dredges!! On our tail!""I look beyond the sea of people, spotting shadows. It can't be dredges, I thought. Too small.As they drew closer, it was that traitorous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that almost killed us. ""Form ranks! Caravan press on!"".The group drew closer, weapons readied. Their leader however, walked past his lapdogs and addressed me like old friends. ""Friend, I surrender"", he said. ""Take me prisoner. And let us escape the dredges""Without a word, I slowly drew my bow. My daughter cried out from behind. ""No! You can't!""Someday, you'd understand. But for now, I'll do what had to be done. I glanced at my trusted friend. He gave me the barest nod.The traitor stood unflinchingly even as I slowly nock an arrow. And shot the insane ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ through his unwavering left eye.I heard her collapse. SobbingWithout another look, I turned for the caravans. Let's press on.10/10 would shoot him again.OR maybe I'll kill him the moment I meet him. Who knows? That's for another saga to tell.			"

												The game was short and the ending felt a little rushed. It took me half the length of the game to get used to nuances of the combat system, as it wasn't very intuitive. You have to figure things out for yourself, such as how far you can shoot and what counts as a diagonal unit (when there are 4-tile large units). More variety in the combat would've been nice. Anyway, I still quite liked the game. The art style was refreshing and I felt attached to the main characters. Really looking forward to Banner Saga 2, hopefully that one will be made in to a more complete experience.			"

												This game trades freedom of exploration in exchange for offering you some very tough choices. So many bad situations to navigate through and so many ways things can go wrong... and you really want them to not go wrong. Caution is not always the best choice and losing people always sucks. I am torn; I want to play the game again and try to do better, but I also kinda never want to play it again because I reaped exactly what I sowed.If you like games with tough moral choices, this is one to get. If you hate linear RPGs without the ability to explore environments, this may not be for you... though the choices you can make keep it from feeling linear. It's so easy to wonder what would have happened if you chose differently. And the game offers you a lot of beauty on its linear path. It's gorgeous.I backed this on Kickstarter. They took forever to finish it. I took forever to get around to playing it. And it's turned out to be one of the best Kickstarter game investments I've made.			"

												Game has a great story, amazing art style and fun gameplay my only complaint is that it can be beaten in less than a day :(. Its really fun game and you feel invested in most of the maincast particularly the humans as a few of them are explored in much greater depth. However again really disapointed in how short this game is, however it is really high quality and definately worth a playthrough - but don't expect to play it for more than a few days on even the hardest difficulty. I bought it full price but I suggest wait for a sale at least 50% off as you will likely only get 5-10 hrs out of this game. looking forward to a sequel that is perhaps 10x as long story wise. - Great game XD			"

												I hardly ever think about making reviews, but this game was pure perfection for me. ""The Banner Saga"" is an extraordinary mixture of storytelling and strategic turn-based fights. The world is inspired by Norse mythology and the plot is really challenging. Many times I found myself stuck with an impossible choice to make, very often the characters had to suffer for my naive nature. It amazes me still how mature this game was story wise despite the graphics imitating animated movies. The battles were challenging at times, even on Normal difficulty, however as a big fun of turn-based mechanics I can't complain much. I like challenging games even if they tend to frustrate you sometimes. The whole award and character leveling system was interesting but also demanding, as the player needs to choose carefully since the same currency is spent on upgrading your heroes as well as supplying your caravan.Finally - the caravan. Never before was travelling from point A to point B this entartaining in-game. No fast travel, no skip button, the player observes the army marching forward with banners put up high in the air and sometimes I caught myself counting the days or looking forward in hope to see a village (especially when I was running low on supplies). As in life though, sometimes you may find things you'd rather not see in your journey and pay a high price for your good intentions.This game is a unique experience, definitely worth a try in my opinion.

												A game that feels like it is a lot more than it is, which is of course a bad thing, but it's a good game none the less. The art style is wonderful, the lore of the world is a brilliant parallel to Nordic mythology, but sadly, for all the choices the game gives you, it's still very linear, which is very fine for the first playthrough, but outside of making your life easier on successive plays, or unlocking achievements, it doesn't really warrant extra playthroughs in my book.Now, don't get me wrong, I absolutely love character based stories, and this game features several interesting and diverse characters, set in a seemingly rich world of vikings, varls, dredge, and ancient history. I say seemingly, because this first installment is too short to give you an actual view of the world as a whole, but rather, you get glimpses into the mythology of the world, and the local settlements. Of course, this is meant as a series, so I am sure much more of this world will be revealed in the subsequent games, so don't take that as too much of a criticism. Graphics wise, the game is quite a thing of beauty, and the style is very deliberately ""raw"". The handdrawn landscapes are marvelous, and the game's artstyle was something I personally fell in love with. Even the animations are top notch quality, and there seems to be weight in the sprites as they get hit and move around. Gameplay is kind of retro, but in the good way. Think Fire Emblem, Shining Force, etc, turn based, grid combat. It's well balanced, and in my playthrough, even the most hopeless battle was winnable, hard fought as though it may have been. There are some unique mechanics, such as how health, damage and armor is calculated, adjecency effects, as well as abilities that lets you manipulate the position of the enemy characters, and much more. And the music/sound? I wish I could've gone into some greater detail with it, but it's been a long time since I played this, and I recall it being good.			"

There are some hard choices to make in the story, and sometimes it's like rolling a dice, you have no clue what the consequence will be of your actions: this will leave you feel a little bit cheated and frustrated and yet at the same time it's realistic. Combat is rather basic and can get a bit tedious. Story ends a bit with a cliffhanger, is not completely finished and many events are not explained. Companions can get killed due to your choices, but often I didn't care because you barely got to know them.			"

												Banner saga is the first part of a trilogy. The game itself is turn-based strategy with an unfamiliar turning mechanic and rather bland battlefield. The story involves the end of the world, the pantheon of dead gods, giants, men, and a race of stone golem called Dredge. It's surprisingly rich, deep, tragic, and captivating story. You will have to make hard choices, your men will die, and your family and friends will see the calamity that will change the north forever. However, the turn-based design is a bit bland. Sure, the AI evolves and add more units over time and battle can take plac when you are not ready. It's the stage design that really dumb things down. Basically you have just one type of map, a plain old board with no obstacle, no destructible enviroment whatsover. You will see some background change depends on where the fight is taking place but that's pretty much all the game has to offer. (well, to be perfectly clear, you have one unique map with a few obstacles. I have no idea why developer didn't add more).The game compensates mentioned flaw with Varl units, big giants that take 4 spaces on the board. They serve as tanks and obstacle for both player and AI alike. You will grow fond of them soon since they are the only thing that stand between your range units and horde of Dredge that can one shot them with a swing of an axe. TheRPG element exists in term of character customization which is quie limited. You get to assign two point of attribute for each levelup and you get just 5 level to max plus one slot for artifact. Too little for my taste.Pro:    Great story with choices that will be carried over to the next game. Great artwork. Good character design.Cons:  Bland board design. Limited customization.Do I like it? Yes.  7.5/10			"

												I was quite excited to play this game following the successful kickstarter, and the Banner Saga will be a testament to early successes of crowd-funded indie games. The graphics are beautiful the rotoscope animation style a great choice to go with a simple yet elegant art aesthetic.The gameplay is simple enough and can get a bit repetitive once you've mastered the system, but thanks to some interesting design choices that hopefully wont happen until you're well and truly entrenched in the story.Banner saga is a rather wonderful game. Its not quite as deep as I wanted it to be, but that should simply be taken as a sign that what I wanted was more.			"

												This game is fantastic. Visually it is unique and beautiful, with wonderfully drawn characters and beautiful landscapes. In no other game have I seen parallax effects used so well. Its gameplay is a refreshingly different take on the tactics genre that is simple, but challenging and interesting. It has a fantastic story and believable dialogue that kept me intrigued and pulled me into their hopeless, end-of-the-world saga in a way only Game of Thrones or The Road have.In short, It's a brilliantly crafted cross between Final Fantasy Tactics and Oregon Trail that gave me an exciting 15 hours worth of gameplay. If that sounds up your alley then I encourage you to buy it now instead of waiting for the sale price (if it ever does go on sale!). I found it to be worth every penny and can't wait for further projects from Stoic.			"

												The Banner Saga is such a refreshing game on so many levels, the influences are very noticable, but it all feels remarably fresh. The visuals are stunning at times and it's one of those games that really made me wish I was an artist. This fatasy world Stoic has created is something remarkable and, as far as I know, new to video games. There are no dwarves, elves or other things you might expect from the 'fantasy' genre, but rather something entirely new. Gameplay to me was the weakest part, it is engaging and fun to play, and weak for this game is still very strong, but I felt myself wanting to finish a battle quick just to see where the story went. It's very easy to sink many hours into this game. Be warned though while it clocks in at around a 10 hour or so play through, this is the first part of a larger series, so don't expect a full conclusion. There is only one major issue I had and that was that I wish more of it was voice acted, most of the cutscenes are, but the rest is just text. Even though I got over that very quickly, it would have added so much to the game in my personal opinion. If you are like me and have always wanted a hand drawn Disney style Viking themed dark fantasy RPG that plays like the love child of Fire Emblem and The Organ Trail, then this game is for you.			"

												Beautifully crafted game; art and music is wonderful. The battles are a bit monotonous, but the storyline more than makes up for it. Kind of like reading and interactive book more than a traditional gaming experience - but also the first game of this kind to leave me truly enthralled. It is a bit short though. I don't think I would bother going back through this chapter and the price only gave me 26h worth of gaming. Which is perhaps a lot of storytelling, including graphics and music, but very little ""game"" compared to the 100+ hours worth of entertainment I get from the other games I play. But all in all an experience you shouldn't miss out on.			"

												This is a great game with a very interesting combination of genres. It has elements that remind me a lot of games like Oregon Trail, Walking Dead Game, Heroes of Might & Magic/King's Bounty, and FTL.It has the wagon-train travel aspects of Oregon Trail where you have to travel unerringly in a straight line from one destination to the next, managing supplies along the way. The decision making and roleplaying situations that occur along the way invoke the Walking Dead game, where you have to choose your allies and the choices you make can come back to haunt you. The tough, tactical, turn-based combat is reminiscent of the fights from Heroes/KB. Mix all this in with risk/reward events that pop up during your journey that will have you celebrating when something goes right or crying when it doesn't, ala FTL.Just note that this is the first chapter of a series, so it has a bit of an abrupt ending just when things start getting really interesting.

The blend of turn-based combat and the strategic choices you can make to manage your caravan and character interactions make for an addictive cocktail. I couldn't stop playing.  The beautiful music accompanies your journey throughout, and really enhances the atmosphere. The combat is fairly challenging on the harder difficulties so I stuck with normal mode, it's good the devs also let you lower the difficulty if you just want to enjoy the story. The only downside - I WANT MORE!  Go buy it now.			"

												The Banner Saga is a very engrossing game, with powerful narrative and a real sense that every choice you make will have unforseen consequences down the line. The world is very rich and teems with backstory, giving a real sense of epic-ness. Unfortunately, it's also very short, and ends rather abruptly, leaving many important plot-points unexplained. Apparantly there are to be sequels at some later date, but after only ten hours of playtime, it left me feeling unsatisfied and a little cheated. The story is a good one, but it is unfinished in a very big way. Rather than feeling like the first volume in a trilogy, it feels more like a prologue, like a demo that only shows you a hint of what is to come in the full game. Unfortunately, this is the full game.All in all, it is a stunningly beautiful game with gorgeous artwork, a good soundtrack, excellent gameplay, and a heroic saga as a storyline. That said, the saga is utterly incomplete, leaving a profound sense of WTF upon the suddenly (and unexpectedly) rolling credits. I will recommend this game, with the caveat that there is no closure at the end.			"

												Kickstarter works! A wonderful and atmospheric game with an interesting, well written and winding narrative. The choices you have to make hurt and come back to bite you. If I have a small gripe it's that the choices aren't always that well explained, and I felt I avoided some options because I had no idea what they entailed.The combat is well balanced and fun, and most importantly never gets boring. I looked forward to each encounter so I could try out new strategies and abilities. The upgrade system is also interesting, making you sometimes choose between spending resources on upgrading your warriors or feeding your people.			"

												Ten years ago I would have stayed the hell away from turn-based strategy games (including tactical rpgs). But I seem to have grown wiser and more open-minded. Or maybe the games have gotten better. One half of a dozen and six of the other.As for the Banner Saga itself, while I didn't back it on Kickstarter (because I found out about it too late), the concept of fantasy vikings battling each other intrigued me.Now I have the finished product in hand and I can only say... money well spent!Yes, the game's hand-drawn backgrounds and animation cutscenes don't have a prayer against current generation graphic engines, but I don't mind that. It gives the game a unique charm. And, as it has been said before, as long as the gameplay is organic and intuitive, the rest of the game can look like §$%&! and people will still play it. Fortunately the Banner Saga has really amazing artwork. One example that comes to mind is that you can always see the main characters in your caravan walking at the front. And the gameplay is what I just said, organic and intuitive. Nothing seems tacked on or out of place, although the strategic battles could have used a bit more finetuning. But this is just my nitpicking and by no means a dealbreaker.So in short, yes, I do recommend this game.			"

												This game is a stunner! That cannot be stated enough as you huff it up mountain landscapes that give a real sense of how dire times have become but you're always on the edge to see what's coming up over the crest of that hill. The gameplay is something not often found in that it's lovingly drawn 2 dimensional characters are given 3 dimensional personalities and you find yourself wanting to both slap and warm to many, just to try and put a smile on someones face!Combat finds you in a battle field and you can't help but look it over to give a picture of what the place you're fighting in feels like, adding continuity to the story. The character animations are given from every angle and every character has their own unique style and blend to lend you in the fight against...whoever happens to be hungry, brave, stupid, ignorant, irritating or evil enough to risk it. Having said this, fighting is not the only way to solve problems in this game and you will find yourself making complex decisions as you assume command and control of what happens to your caravan, friends and family.Decision making in the game can be incredibly tense, both active and passively, but sometimes it does feel like many of the options would lead to the same result (unless you pick the extreme option to just pummel someone in the face). Some character animations are lacking during cut scenes, but the strong story filled with twists and b*♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at every turn it's hard to fault.Overall this game is an excellent and uplifting stratergy game that leaves it's mark on the genre and I would recommend buying it!

												A game that made me really want to invest my time in learning its combat system, the Banner Saga angered me enough to the point where all I wanted to do was get better and then show the game whose boss. While there are people who will dissuade you from playing this game for its difficulty and random encounters that, in most cases, will do nothing but hinder your adventure, listen to them not. As a wise wizard once told me, ""get gud"" (Salt Chronicles, page 277).My terrible review does nothing to promote the ending of the game, which will either make you cry 10 years of tears because it will affect you emotionally, or because you can finally stop playing the game. All in all, wait for a steam sale. What are you, a plebeian who buys digital PC games at full price?			"

												A magnificent game that should please fans of RPGs and strategy games alike.When I first began playing this I became hooked; I was addicted to this game s if it were nicotine. The only reason I ever stopped is because I had exms nd had to uninstall my steam to concentrate. I recently re-installed this game and I've got to say it is still extremely fun and refreshing. The strategy and RPG elements are both very well done. The game is incredibly immersive and the visuals are breathtaking. No, really it's a beautiful game; the true brilliance is displayed when you andyour clan walk across the screen during long treks. The background and the landsacpes are exceptional.The story is easy to immerse yourself in and that is exactly what happened to me. I jumped for joy when an impossible foe was defeated due to intricate strategic planning and a little bit of luck. I just about pulled all my hair out when an earlier choice had dire concequences hours later in the game. Be careful of who you trust but also realise that you could make the wrong choice by not trusting someone.			"

												It was decent enough to play all the way through, but more from lack of SRPG alternatives then an actually compelling experience.Combat is repetitive, the decisions that you make seem arbitrary with no real indication as to what the outcome will be. (Standing up to the bandits instead of surrendering your stuff may lead them to take stuff anyway etc) character deaths come randomly as well, which is fine as a story mechanic, but when the resources you use to level up and equip those characters is so scarce, it quickly becomes frustrating.The concept is unique, the art direction is fantastic, the combat system is fresh enough to be engaging but all in all, i'm left with a rather ""meh"" feeling.

												Maybe I expected too much. Why?When I first saw the map of the game ... I thought ... wow! This will be a f****** long game (something like Baldurs Gate etc.). Everyone who played it knows that it is too short.The story was very interesting. The enemy, too. Especially because it is not pure evil vs. good crap.The decisions are awesome. Only problem here was that I didn't really get what exactly they meant by some options. I played it hardcore ... no loadings ... straight forward.On some places the translation of the dialogues seems to be somehow ... wrong(?). *I play it in German*Was difficult to follow the dialogue ... who said what to who? Etc.But the ending ... na ... I though that the whole stuff till the end was kind of intor to the game.Too short ... but enjoyable(?). Ps, some decisions I made seemed to be very frustrating but in the end they (developers) didn't have the balls to make it this way ... you know what I mean ... *someone pull somebody into the forrest etc. etc.*Gil ... you stupid ... EDIT:Aw yeah, now I remember why I was disappointed about the story etc. ... while playing you make decisions etc. and in the end I hoped for some summarize(?) like in Fallout or something where you can see your decisions and the consequences in a comic-style way ... maybe they could patch it. But I guess this will maybe only be in the next banner saga ... but then I hope that the game will continue by made decisions in this one.			"

												Like an interactive, nice illustrated book with challenging turn-based fights between the exciting story parts. Never seen something like that before. A very nice idea of game-based story telling with a great atmosphere. Every decision has consequences and there is no ""remaking them"". I recommend it to any person who likes nordic mythology and compelling stories.			"

												This game is amazing.  You should consider it with a grain of salt because a lot of gamers will not be able to get over the slower paced meticulous nature of gameplay; however, if you have lamented the industry's lack of story driven content, this is the game.  The single most engaging story I've ever played, better than skyrim.  It's like a viking-oregon trail mixed with a choose your path novel and chess.  After around 8 hours, I found myself almost giving up on life in the game because it didn't seem to matter what I did I could not stop my people from dying...this game affects you and that's a good thing, even though it felt hopeless I never wanted to quit playing!

												This is one of the best games I've played in the last couple of years.That said, this is not a game for everyone. It is a combination of a complex turn-based tactical strategy, played on small board (you literally need to plan for 6 turns ahead if you want to play on Hard), rpg and text-based ""tribe"" management game, somewhat reminiscent of King of Dragon Pass. It is ""forgiving"" to a player, in a sense that you can play it through even if you make bad decisions, lose a lot of people, etc. But if your goal is to actually keep your people alive and try to do the best you can, it's unforgiving - and that's one of its best points. It's easy to play it; it's hard to play it so that your people would still be alive when the game is over. :)			"

												The Banner Saga is an amazing game.  In it, you travel in a caravan full ofsurvivers of the onslaught of the monsterous dredge, who are the main enemies of the game.As you travel, you must make sure morale stays high and there is enough food for everyone.  When you're not traveling, you're fighting.  Combat is in a  grid-based strategy format.  You must take out armor to really damage enemies.  Combat is simple yet difficult.  If a unit falls, they are wounded for a few days (in game) and are less effective.  As for story, the Gods are dead, and you are a simple farmer trying to lead survivers to safety, and you take on large armies of enemies along the way.  Overall I enjoyed the story, but at times it seemed held loosely together.  I was often bored of the story, which is never a good sign.  However, the ending was perfect, and it leaves me waiting for part two.  The score was composed by Austin Wintory of Journey fame, and he absolutly nails it.  Last thing, the art is beutiful.  The hand drawn style really fits the game's theme and gameplay.  The screenshots above are a testement to that.I would reccomend this game to anyone, even if you are not familier with strategy games.  This is the type of game that will make you a fan.Story:4Gameplay:5Overall:9-Great "

												This game is amazing and I'm glad I backed it. The story is compelling, and the artwork is just beautiful.  The tactical combat is presented very well, and the learning curve is handled nicely. The gameplay is like taking the Oregon Trail and Chess with a deep story and vikings. I never felt like it was throwing me into something I wouldn't be able to handle (though sometimes it took a few tries).  It was challenging but not unfair. I highly recommend it!			"

												Bottom line is this game is quality and for any respecting PC gamer you should own this title.  Music excellent, ambiance deep and overflowing, art simply breathtaking, but how about the gameplay you ask.   The gameplay itself is 75% turn based top down combat game and 25 percent choose your own adventure.  It all works seamlessly and will kick your butt if you don’t learn from your mistakes.  I would say the game is similar to portal in that its feature packed goodness but short.   Gripes you ask, well length is a bit short clocking in at about 10 hours and towards the end the combat will get just a hair tedious.  Oh and did I mention the ending, it’s not an ending.   It ends on a cliffhanger and is clearly meant to be part of a series.  However considering the price (under 30 dollars) the terrific quality and the fact there is some replay ( I immediately replayed 2 more times) it’s worth every penny.  My Score 85/100 Great			"

												Fanal Fantasy Tactics meets a choose your own adventure book. The art is a fabulous rotoscoped Dan Bluth-esc / early Disney style that catches your eye like an arrow that missed your knee.The really hooking part of the game is the resource management where buying supplies or ranking up characters can adversely affect your gameplay; every victory is a viceral badge of reknown and the battles can be utterly unforgiving but so rewarding upon sucess. The choices are very heavy, and a bad descion can loose you your favourite warrior in the blink of an eye.Any RPG fan needs to consider this game as it is very original, in a very un-original way. There are no clever game mechanics, no novelty minigames, just a brutal combat system where a single move can swing the battle at any given moment.I give this a stunning 9/10...And i'm not even a big rpg fan!

												Fun game!  It's like nothing I have played before so it is hard for me to draw a comparison.  The story is good and the combat, though simple mechanically is load with possible combo's of abilities if you care to explore them.  The game is very linear, so you aren't in control of the story.  Rather, you are taken along for the ride and are allowed to make key decisions and fight the battles as the Banner Saga unfolds.  The game is priced well for what it delivers and it is worth playing it if you haven't already.			"

												The Banner Saga does what it wants to do. It weaves together some of the strongest world-building in recent years with a good core game mechanic and a fantastically varied roster of characters and a well-written story. Sure, it has flaws, but none of them glaring. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with the game's combat system, for example, but it does appear in need of a bit of fine-tuning. I will not spend any more time discussing the gameplay and art assets themselves here - other people have done so, and better than I can do it. Instead, I want to discuss some points that have turned other reviewers off, because it would be a shame if they scared away somebody who would truly enjoy this game.A fellow reviewer wrote that to his dissatisfaction, the player cannot play ""good or bad characters"". Another reviewer was very disappointed with the ""disjoint between decision and results"". If you want to play a ""good or bad"" character, or if you want the choices you do to make sense in a moralistic superhero-world kind of sense - where altruism will always pay off and bad deeds are always punished - then this game is not for you.If, on the other hand, you realize that a game that always rewards you for being altruistic essentially does not give you a choice; it is parenting you - this game is for you. If you consider the ""good-evil o'meters"" from games like Mass Effect to be stifling, oversimplified and condescending of your ability to comprehend your own choices - this game is for you.And just like Game of Thrones, this harsh and often ""unfair"" world gets under your skin and stays with you - even as you curse making a decision that had disasterous implications for your success, it pulls you in. If you enjoyed the bittersweet sense of loss when a soldier died in XCOM, this game is - by all the gods - very much for you.			"

Where you recognise evil, speak out against it, and give no truces to your enemies.― Old Norse ProverbI don't like games like 'caravan' too much, but Banner Saga is really solid and full-climate product.After 18h (2 full runs):PROS+ Norse mythology inspiration+ interesting (little apocalyptic) story+ 2D drawing+ decisions have consequences+ fine heroesCONS- sometimes little too hard/too unfair battles- useless archers- sometimes small problem with team/equipment roster (bug, but we can load)- items are not very well-balancedSubjective rate: A- (apart from minor bugs, which we can live and play, BS does a really good impression. The game can create attachment to the caravan, to each of its members individually and all together. And the finale - sad but beautiful at the same time. I look forward to sequel.)			"

												This game is proof that game development has matured to the point where games like this can happen. It's a complex story game with stunning visuals, beautiful original soundtrack and incredible turn-based combat, where your choices really matter. There is no going back once you've made a decision (watch out for mistakes). It even has great replay value, which is something I didn't expect from a story-telling game. Mind you, this game is HARD. Given my previous experience having beaten turn-based strategy games on hard mode (such as xcom, civilization, shadowrunner, etc.) I thought I could just jump in on hard mode... I was wrong. I made a run for it and I basically failed, so I had to play it in normal to adjust to the pace. This game is  already quite challenging as it is. Now that I've beaten it on normal, maybe I'll try beating it again on normal before I can aim for hard mode. Conclusion: I expected this game to be great and it exceeded my expectations. Bought it on sale, but would pay full price for it. Buy it! You won't be dissappointed. This game is a work of art.			"

												This game has one of the most appealing artwork among recent (and event older) games. This is of course pretty obvious. But not only this point makes the game stand out. The game is full of tenuous, arrow-sharp content, which is placed in such a way that it has the ability to drag the player in the chilly and dangerous atmosphere of the game, full of dangers, precipices and sudden turns. The battle system is strongly reminiscent of asian tactical RPGs like Final Fantasy Tactics and Disgaea, but with what seems a western RPG touch. In between battles you talk, you make descisions, you role play. And your descisions matter.Overall it is a very nice game. So if you like the games with an athmosphere and some kind of subtle feel, this game is worth to check out.			"

 The Banner Saga is great and if you like trurn based strategy RPG then read not further and buy this game! Do it!!  Now!!!  Still here? Than let me tell you a bit about  The Banner Sage (TBS) .GameplayTBS core is its gameplay. It is fun and challanging and the combination of Strength and Health in one Stat makes the fighting pretty complex. Each unit also has an Armor Stat. Damage equals your Strength minus the enemys Armor, as you take damage you loose Strength and by this you do less damage on your next move. So you have always to decide if you weaken an enemy by attaking his Strength directly or if you lower his Armor so that another unit can deal mor damage.TBS offers a nice range of different classes for your units, each with his own special ablility. The classes are ranging from tanks to fast and versatile units to archers. The Story The heart of TBS is its story. You are provided with a huge Universe overflowing with lore. Each of your characters has its own backstory and motives and I enjoyed their interaction quite a lot. At its core TBS story is about Family and the ones your are responsible for and how far you are willing to go for them. It is about concequences of choice and dealing with loose.As you progress through the Story you are faced with decisions and your choice will affect your experience. Presntation The Soul of TBS is its presantation. The artstyle andt the animation is gourgues and the Soundtrack is fantastic. It is just to sad that there are quite a few passages where no music at all is used.All in all as said above TBS is a very good game! It is a bit minimalistic in some places (cutscenes and story presantation) but in a good way, resampling the charme of oldschool videogames			"

												I buy a LOT of steam games, and I often spend less than a few hours on them before my ADD kicks in and I start playing something else. This game on the other hand has kept me interested hour after hour. The story is extremely well written, the art is beautifully done, and the music is a pleasure to listen to. I don't usually write reviews for games, but I felt i would be doing this game, and the guys that created it, a great injustice by not spreading the word. Buy this game, play it, and enjoy it. It is well worth the money.			"

												This is a good game:Prositives: -Good story and felt like choices mattered-Combat was okay-Art and visuals were excellentNegatives:- As another reviewer put it you will often get railroaded by the side choices. You will likely spend far more on supplies than promoting your characters. Overall: Its no Dragon Age: Origins RPG but it is a good RPG and worth your time in my opinion.			"

												I finally picked this up on a sale because it's been popping up in my recommendations view nearly every single day, as well as being critically acclaimed and recommended by so many others.What I expected going into it was a fairly linear adventure with tactical combat and story where your choices on how to proceed was of outmost importance.And now that I've completed it....Ehh...Alright, ok, I guess in a sense I got pretty much exactly what I expected, but at the same time.... not really.But, before we go any further.....----SPOILER WARNING!----The following alludes to events in the game without going into specifics. If you want to go into the game knowing absolutely nothing about what will happen, do NOT continue reading.You have been warned.The game is excellently made, with wonderful graphics and engaging characters you grow to care about. You emphasize with their dilemmas, and are torn whenever you have to resolve them.However, this only lasts for about one third of the game before you start to see a pattern, and upon passing the half-point you realize the truth.This game is unhappy. That's the best word I can use to describe it. It is unhappy in the extreme. You will feel that everything you do is wrong, and that there really is no way out that is even slightly hopeful. By the time I reached the finale I just wanted the game to END already so I could get it all over with and do something else, because each and every choice I was presented with was hollow... the world tempted me with hope I knew by this point I could not have, because everything was going to suck no matter what anyway. It was a frustrating feeling, knowing that choice was more or less an illusion, and one that actively punished you arbitrarily by killing off characters you spent points levelling up due to a plot decision you made much earlier in the game, and deleting the items they wore in the process.I managed to scrape by, but I find it absolutely feasable that you could hopelessly screw yourself to the point where the game would be more or less unbeatable simply by investing in the wrong characters. Perhaps this too was an illusion, and if so, good job in making me think my choces mattered in at least one thing.Honestly, I wish I could give this game a neutral rating, because I cannot really recommend it, and yet it's not really a bad game at all.This game absolutely achives what it sets out to do, and in a very engaging and beautiful manner. The graphics are nothing short of gorgeous at times, and the music sets the desired tone perfectly. The tactical combat is a little weak, but does its job despite being hampered by the story choice system.All that said, I have absolutely no desire whatsoever to play the sequel. I don't even care what happens to the characters anymore, because I'm sure many of them will just die horribly in some engaging and tragic manner I cannot look away from, thinking I could've saved them when In reality I could not.If you're a sucker for punishment dressed up in one of the most engaging and pretty dresses ever, play this game. If not, look for something else.I'm erring on the side of positivity and giving the game the thumbs up, but this is the kind of game I'm both glad I played and regretting it at the same time.			"

												Absoloute steal for under £4, if i'd of paid full price, i still wouldn't be disapointed, great game,  story took me 7 hours to play, a lot of choices to make, all of which impact you and yours, for better or worse.I read online the game can last a bit longer too depending on your reasonings.If you like games like the telltale walking dead/borderlands/wolf among us/etc, but want a little more (turn based) action, this is for you!

												Quite a cool indie game! Financed through kickstarter as well, it seems. I guess I missed all the ruckus two years past. Excellent music! The story is perhaps more interesting as the in the end quite simple isometic turn-based combat parts or the overly simple RPG mechanics. Quite a lot of decisions as well to make along the (literal caravan) journey. Good, entertaining catch for 4.99 € :-) Looking forward to conclusion of this epic in The Banner Saga 2.			"

												I haven't been completely hooked by a game in quite a while, but this one has hooked me. The artwork/animation is stunningly beautiful; the various decisions driving the storylines are fun, and the fighting is addictive.  The soundtrack is so very beautiful that I ended up buying it too.  I put it on repeat while I am working.  I like that players can go back to earlier parts of the game to start fresh or even start over from the beginning.  I also like that there are three difficulty levels.  The Banner Saga is definitely one of my favorite games!			"

												You can feel Myth: The Fallen Lords through the veil while playing this game.  It is beautiful to behold, has an interesting story with choices that can change the outcome of your traveling band depending on the outcome, and is challenging!  I have to admit I had to lower the difficulty to defeat the final battle.  I'm hoping to overcome that on another play-through.  Speaking of another play-through, I quickly discovered that changing one choice in the story mode led to losing a character that I used until the very end on my first play through.  Awesome.			"

												Awesome Visuals, Smooth controls, gripping story and realistic art style.  Think the animated Lord of the Rings story meets Final Fantasy Tactics meets Oregon Trail.  Gameplay is really tight and combat is balanced. Choices help shape the story how you would perceive events and interactions.  Classes for characters all serve a useful function on the battlefield and tactical combat is heavily regimented towards long-term thinking instead of short term gain & positioning. Worth picking up the deluxe edition for the breath-taking soundtrack.			"

												This game is much more about story than it is about freeform entertainment. It's an animated adventure that reacts to what you do, and you are part audience and part participant. I enjoyed almost all of it - and the bits I didn't like turned out to be fundamental to the storyline (at least in my playthough). Don't get this game expecting a sandbox of tactical strategy, get this game for beautiful scenery and animation, emotive music and immersive lore.			"

												Though the combat is simplistic it is still enjoyable enough. But it lacks the tactical depth to go for a second playthrough. Gamplaywise it brings nothing new to the table tho it is well executed. Why you want to play this game is the well written story and amazing athmosphere it provides. Which is more then enough to compensate for the mediocre game mechanics. I found it hard to stop and finished the game in two days. My only real complaint is that the ending is a bit abrupt and the game is short. Overall it is hugely enjoyable experience if you care to read the text in which the story is delivered and can value the art of this game.			"

												This is a beautiful game. Excellent artistic graphics, decent ambience and music.Story is nothing too special. But the game is short which surprisingly is a good thing as the story doesn't get time to 'get old'.The gameplay is decent. Although not very well balanced. But 'normal' difficulty really means 'normal'. I had a couple of challenging battles but didn't loose a single one until the last boss battle.The decisions player has to make, heavily impact the story and the rather generic but relatable characters.I can't help but feel that this game needed voiceovers. Maybe because I played on my couch with a steam controller. So, all the reading got tiring after a certain point.If you have 10 to 20 hours to spare in the week and looking for a refreshing experience without any grinding or difficulty curve? This is the game for you. "

												10/10. Best game I've played in years. It's really incredible how much you are sucked into the story for a game with a relatively small amount of interaction; the interaction that is there feels meaningful at every turn though. It's a masterclass in storytelling, character building and the fascination of feeling that a world is really actually coming to an end. READY FOR PART 2			"

												The Banner Saga: a very ambitious game that delivers.... more or less.Before I get to discuss the problems I have to say that the graphics/artworks are beautiful and  the soundtrack is gorgeous .Now let's get to the meat of the game:-The game is advertised as a game based on every decision that you take....and that is more or less true. Some of your choices affect the game that is true but not by very much except from like 2 of them. Also the game is not afraid to take decisions without asking you. For example: in the beginning I chose to level up a character because I liked his stats and skills and I said ""well if I level up this guy I will crush my enemies in no time"" . Well quess what: THE GAME DECIDES THAT THEY HAVE TO LEAVE AND RIGHT AFTER I SPENT MY LEVEL POINTS ON THEM. You don't get to see them until the final  battle and you don't get a character with similar attributes anywhere in the game . So in the final battle you get them right, but they are already low level by the  standard of that time.  What the hell?-For a game praised for the importance of your choices the game is quite linear. The game will switch most of the time between 2 groups of people whenever the story wants. Which makes it a bit harder to follow the plot.-The gameplay consists of a turn based combat strategy game. It's refreshing and unique but is also  so basic and you will get bored in a few battles. It is also sometimes punishing and unforgiving.Overall the game is good but not what people make it out to be . I give it a 6-7/10 . It's enjoyable but gets tedious by the end of the game.			"

												Spoiler FREE review.The visuals and music are beautiful and so it's the concept. But gameplay?First let's get to the core of the game,The Turn Based Combat System!:The turns are like a chess board game, let me use an example:Le's say you have 4 guys and your oponent has 8.This means that each of your guys will get to move at least 2 times by the time your oponent has managed to move it's entire team, this is ofcourse if you didnt slay any of them. If you did then, things can get reversed until you reach pillage mode.When you reduce your foes numbers to just one, you will go into ""PILLAGE MODE!"" To put it simple It just sounds cool and the turn mode becomes like those of any Fire Emblem Games. Meaning everyone gets one turn per round, including your opponent. This can help you set up the kill for the hero that needs to level up, or simply for the next wave of enemies.It is an interesting concept but could had been done more justice.The enemy will automatically go next - even if it just moved in the previous turn - and will do what this game does best, search for your weakest guy and try to bring it down.I understand that this was so that if you had 5 guys left and your oponent just one it wouldnt get to move every time your oponent does, otherwise it would be crazy!But anyways, do you get a reward for pillaging? Do you get to burn stuff? No, you dont, Unlike real life Pillaging.In real life the last unit would flee, do a last stand or surrender . Not search for the weakest and going on a programmed kamikaze mode. But this is what this game does.I often wonder if the programmer or the “Creative director” ever bothered on playing fire emblem or final fantasy tactics or doing some research on other strategic war games.And talking about the  A.I. of your enemies, It is ridiculou! It’s like you are fighting terminators that know exactly every specific movement that you will take and that will ALWAYS have more bonuses than you and will charge at your weakest unit no matter if other units are closer to them.They are like Kamikazes that will search for your weakest guy no matter if it's behind a giant maze. So get ready for an intense challenge.The Story and Writting ELEMENTS! choose your dialogue wisely:First and Foremost be aware that every dialogue you choose can mean the life or death of one of your heroes. Even at the very beggining of the game. So unless you want to save it, you will have to redo the battle all over again and explore for the proper dialogue option. Sometimes it is often the most cliche one the one that saves it.However it appears that at some point the programmer or writter got aware of this ""save scamming"" as they like to call it. And very early on the game you get a choice and you will take consequences near the end of the game depending on that choice.An extensive dialogue tree will be presented and no matter your choice of dialogue or any other thing that you have done in this game, you will loose at least 3 characters that may be some of your strongest ones.Meaning you wont be exploring their relationships anymore and you will be heavily outmanned when you get to the last combats.This was Lazily implemented and poorly written, many players consider it BS yet the programmers think its cool and even compare it to The Game of Thrones Death of Ned Stark. Which doesnt make sense because that is the predetermined story, it is very well written and its not an option just to screw the honest players.Suffice it to say that if you want to save them, you will have to restart the game or edit the game save files.The Renown!Renown it's the currency and blood of the game. With it you level up, improve your skills, purchase items and most importantly get FOOD!It is extremely scarse you can only get it after battles or after certian actions so be very greedy on it, unless you have to level heroes or purchase food supplies.But why food?:In this game you are the leader of a caravan, as each day passes your people will consume food ""supplies"" and if you start running out of it then the morale will go low and they may ended up dying out of starvation. You have the option to set a camp and rest in order to improve morale, and morale helps you A LOT when it comes to battles.Items can be found and obtained after war simulated battles or visiting places and interacting with them. Others can be purchased with Renown. I personally didnt like that Renown and currency where the same thing in this game, because you either have to choose wether to level up your character or purchase food or a cool item. The tutorial it’s extremely basic and leaves you to learn the new abilities by yourself. The game doesnt like rewarding you and it's always trying to make you miserable or frustrated.In Short, the game doesnt like to reward you but will try in a constant basis to screw you and make you miserable. Maybe it wants you to understand how frustrated the main heroes of this story feel, I dont know.Visuals and looks:Bloody Gorgeous, reminds you a lot from the Sleeping Beauty and all those animated movies from old disney and  the knight and medieval movies Like Ivanhoe. Even if it's Norse Mythology based.Definitly the selling point of this game. The art and coloring it's just pure eye candy and even sometimes eye protein too. You can spend a good amount of time just examining screens, horizons, forests and even the battle scenarios.The music it's really beautiful too, and sometimes very inspiring.If you are a hardcore Turn Based Strategy Game Player that loves to play It's Fire Emblems in hard mode. Then you are on for one hell of a ride! If you are just going to enjoy the ride, I suggest you to play it on easy unless you are up for some frustrating times or a real challenge.Thank you for reading through this sincere review, as always no boot licking.
