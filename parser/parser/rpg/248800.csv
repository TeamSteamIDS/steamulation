												TL;DR: Since the developer has abandoned the project and the remaining episodes will not be made/released in the foreseeable future I wouldn't spend your money on this. Its story is incomplete and will probably never be completed. In the end by paying $5 for this you'll have 1.5 hours of prologue that is, in itself, not nearly enough to leave you satisfied. Update: As of July 14th, 2015 Dischan Media has officially shut down. Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos will not be reinvigorated.Game review:Dysfunctional Systems is a visual novel about, as the title inclines, the managing of chaos. The premise of dysfunctional systems revolves around an organisation in some technological utopia that sends meddlers to other worlds to solve their problems and reclaim order. It's an interesting concept, but it's not too different from what we've seen before. That said, it doesn't mean dysfunctional systems has no potential, in fact it has loads of potential. Too bad none of that really matters.The story is basically an introduction to the universe and it's characters. We get to see the main characters do their jobs as meddlers in a world that is having diplomatic problems. Things escalate, I won't spoil anything, I'll just say that: it's way too short to develop anything outside of a prologue to the other episodes. Yes, there is a story in it, no you're probably not going to cry over it. It isn't insanely good and it isn't bad. At best this will leave you wanting more, where the problem of an abandoned project reels in again. Even if an incomplete story wouldn't bother you, this first episode leaves too much to be desired and too many questions to be asked. The game is way too short to accomplish any real world building, something that is so important when your game is literally about travelling and meddling in the affairs of other worlds. The characters, focusing on the two main ones, consist of your basic grumpy teacher and stubborn student. That's not to say the characters aren't enjoyable or not well written, they share some funny and touching moments. It's just that the game is simply way too short to develop any character properly. Thus we are left with... again, nothing special. Then there are the choices, which are very important to get right when you make something in this medium. It is unfortunately something dysfunctional functions had a serious lack of. The entire game basically has 1 choice. 1 choice in the entire thing. After this one choice dysfunctional systems might (depending on what you choose) present you 2-or so more rather confusing choices. Too bad none of these matter. At all. The only difference is that you'll be getting a different achievement. Something I can praise dysfunctional systems about is it's amazing art and music. The art, although perhaps a bit repetitive at times, looks amazing, there isn't a whole lot of animation but that's alright, in the end I wasn't expecting there to be any. The UI is really good, everything fits together nicely and I actually enjoyed reading the few codex entries there were, as bland as they may be. As for the music, it was very nicely done. You won't have the same track looping every other sequence or anything like that here. Good stuff, Ill probably end up listening to it more in the future. The real reason you shouldn't buy this:After all that I do feel the need to honestly say that Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is not a bad visual novel at all, at least, as a prologue. Sure, it doesn't hit all the good spots and the lack of choices is pretty disappointing. But that doesn't mean it's necessarily bad. It does it's job as a prologue - it gets you excited for more whilst giving a basic introduction of the universe.The real reason you shouldn't buy this is because the developer abandoned the two sequels that were originally planned. Reason? Financial problems and a lack of motivation. The development team did a poor job of financing the funds received from the kickstarter campaign. People have lost a lot of their trust for the developers, and righteously so, it was one big mistake after another for the dev team and the death of Dysfunctional Systems as a result of that. It's a real shame, I would have liked to see more from this. So, in the end Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos gives us a 1.5 hour prologue of a story that will probably never be made. Whether you are willing to spend $5 on that is your choice, but I personally wouldn't recommend it.			"

PLAY JUNIPER'S KNOT BEFORE YOU BUY THIS GAME!Juniper's Knot is another game created by the same people that made Dysfunctional Systems, and is legally free to download for Windows, Mac, Linux, and iOS at Dischan's website[junipersknot.dischan.org]. It's pretty short, and should give you a good idea whether or not you'll actually enjoy this game. You'll probably notice that there was no sort of interactivity involved in playing Juniper's Knot, aside from clicking to progress to the next line of text. This is more or less how Dysfunctional Systems plays, except this game actually has moments where you get to choose from a short list of options what you (Winter) should do. However, there aren't many times you actually get to do this, and it is actually possible to play through the entire story by only making a single decision. All of the choice moments in the game are placed together around half-way through the game, and they only lead to two endings. The ending you get is determined entirely by whether or not you can convince your mentor (Cyrus) to listen to what you have to say, and not do what he initially decides he should do in order to solve the problem he's given. I wouldn't consider either ending to be a ""good ending"", but I suppose that's why this is only the first episode in the series.As for how the game looks and sounds, the artstyle is similar to Juniper's Knot's, and you can listen to the ost on YouTube, so you can decide for yourself if you like those parts before you buy the game. If you really like the sountrack, you can find all 18 tracks in both flac and mp3 format in the game's files.This game is short. I'm not a fast reader, but I played through this the first time in only about two and a half hours, then about another hour to get the second ending. You can get more playtime by going through all the routes for the achievements for a little extra replayability, but there's a guide on the game's community hub that'll tell you exactly what routes you need to go through to unlock all the achievements.After a successful Kickstarter campaign, episode 2 of Dysfunctional Systems is planned to be released by September later this year, and episode 3 by March 2015. Until these episodes are finished and released to the public, the story in this game is incomplete. If you're looking for a complete story, then you should at least wait until the next two episodes come out.EDIT: Yeah, Dysfunctional Systems is dead. Basically, a bunch of stuff happened [dischan.co] that caused the devs to stop working on episodes 2 and 3. The prequel will be released, but other than that, it's not certain if we will ever see more from this series. Because of this, if you're going to buy this game, know that you probably will never be able to get the full story that was planned out for this game, and what is available isn't all that much.			"

												The first of the few visual novels that'll eventually land on Steam through Greenlight, and one that IS NOT made by Japanese.  It is important to know that this genre is less gameplay, and more of a narrative through combining visual design and audio work. The few gameplay options are that of ""dialogue choices"", which you might be more familiar with in case of Mass Effect, choose-your-own-adventure kind of novels, or point-and-click adventure games. Each episode will present dialogue choices that'll affect the story outcome for future episodes.The game takes places in a utopian world, where you play as Winter Harrison, a young 14 year old girl who is pursueing the career of a mediator. But what is a mediator? A mediator takes the job of travelling to chaotic worlds and attempts to restore order by finding the root of the cause and remedy it through various methods. The first chapter follows Winter's second meditation, where she shadows an experienced mediator, Cyrus Addington, who will mentor her through the process of solving a poverty stricken country known as Brighton. The game features beautiful artwork, an amazing soundtrack, and interesting writing style that can't help but draw me in. My only complaint is that it is unfortunately short, but being only $5 is more than worth the price (since it comes with an amazing soundtrack, did I mention its really good?) and definitely a cheap investment for a new interactive experience. If you have any confusion or are sitting on the fence of investing the money to playing this game, I recommend trying out Juniper's Knot, its a free game that Dischan made that'll introduce you to either visual novels or their style of production a little bit better.

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos  Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Visual Novel; Sci-Fi; Anime; Story Rich; Great Soundtrack My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 2-5 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Strong narrative advocates; Visual novel buffs REVIEWVisual novels are not for everyone, and that is fair. Even fans of the genre can admit that some of them are boring and disinteresting. That said, Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is one of the best visual novels I have “played” to date. Instead of relying on cartoon drawings of “waifus” in underwear to keep your interest, it actually has a very interesting and well-told story. (But don't worry, there are still some cartoon drawings of ""waifus"" in underwear). The artwork is high quality and the soundtrack is one my personal favorites in the realm of video games. In fact, it’s one of my favorite music albums in general, but I also like that genre of music a lot. Anyway, if you like a good sci-fi tale, and enjoy visual novels with real substance, this is one you probably want to consider trying.Unfortunately, the game was intended to be episodic and it does end on a cliffhanger; and at this time it seems unlikely the development team is going to be able to produce more installments. Such is life. There is still a very interesting and self-contained story within the game that I think most sci-fi fans will find interesting. You can just ignore the epilogue and still enjoy the primary narrative. If you think you would like this game, but only don’t want to try it because of the open ending, then that is your choice. But I think you will be missing out.The universe created and the primary storyline are both products of premiere sci-fi writing. I was enthralled the entire time. The soundtrack is comprised of amazing songs, and each one perfectly captures the emotion of the game at the time it is played. The art style is mostly traditional and nothing overtly special, but it also is pleasantly not overloaded with stereotypical anime cringe and unnecessary sexuality. It is a nice, well-produced visual novel that can be taken seriously.Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos isn’t for everyone, but I think it will appeal to fans of good sci-fi and fans of the standard visual novel paradigm. Yes, it is unfortunate that we (probably) won’t get any more installments set in this universe, but this visual novel is still very highly enjoyable. Some things will be left unanswered, but that happens all the time in storytelling. And, honestly, if you can find it for a good price, I would recommend it for the soundtrack alone. I know music tastes are highly subjective, but damn do I love these tunes.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												I just finished this first episode and I must say it was absolutely fantastic!  It's been a long time since a VN I've played had a story that was so engaging and held my interest so much.  I mean, the art is very well done, the music is excellent and the story itself is something that's rather unique and it was very well written to top everything off.I could go on and on about how great this visual novel is.  But like others, I can't, in good conscience, recommend anyone purchase this game.You see, after finishing this first episode, I raced to the forums to see when I could expect the next installment to show up.  Alas, I found the message, dated over a month ago, stating that Dysfunctional Systems was no more and that future episodes would most likely not see the light of day.  I still hold a small hope for that one miracle to happen though.So, while you may feel free to ignore my (and others') non-recommendation and purchase this game, you will still be receiving an excellent piece of writing and an excellent game in general.  Just don't expect any more, at least for the time being.			"

												Episode 1 left a pretty nice taste in my mouth. In the end I wanted more.But alas, life sucks, and things die. Things like this, but it died early on, and probably won't be getting any sort of sequel until a miracle happens. Or the devs get more money, but that's probably not gonna happen.But hey, if you're ok with settling with the cliff-hanger-tastic episode 1 for a measly five bucks, go right a head. If you're not, which is probably the majority, then wait for hell to freeze over, that's probably when this game get's finished and it's OK to buy. Unless episodes 2 and 3 end up sucking.

												This game is so engaging if you like to be challenged on moral decisions. The political dilemmas and agendas and the issues that plague humanity are experienced from the innocent point of view of a child.Playing as a young girl on what was supposed to be a simple 'shadow' lesson of following an experienced mediator, suddenly having ""xxxxxx <spoiler> xxxxxxx"" thrust upon you, and being forced to make choices with little knowledge and no experience.This is a visual novel... That means lots of reading. Do not buy this game if you can't rest your WASD fingers long enough to get to know the story.Just going to add in here for anyone who skims over long reviews, since mine is the first shorter one, please, if this game, or genre interestes you, Kuro's review (above) has a link to a kickstarter page for the next 2 episodes, it's active until March 24th, please consider helping out to get the rest of this story done!

												The sad irony of Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos, is it comes so very close to standing alone but in a last minute effort, fully commits to setting up more episodes we’re all but certain never to see.Let’s back up for a moment though. Dysfunctional Systems is a visual novel following Winter and Cyrus, who play the part of mediators: peace keepers of sorts to the different distant worlds surrounding their own. It’s their job to step in when things become too extreme, and ensure a world doesn’t destroy itself in acts of war.Learning to Manage Chaos then, is Winter training to learn how exactly someone is capable of keeping a world in check, especially in times of extreme turmoil. If anything though, this is more the story of Winter growing as a person than a mediator, her naivety and innocence being tested as she’s thrown into situations where there is no right decision and not everyone is going to come out alive.It’s not uncommon for authors to craft ignorant protagonists or side characters so as to have an easy stepping off point for relaying important details to the reader, which characters should likely already know, but Dysfunctional System manages to very rarely fall into that trap of artificial stupidity. Winter feels authentic in her cluelessness about the larger world, being only fourteen but having her heart in the right place. Her actions and ways of thinking are often flawed, but her internal indecision and discomfort of wrestling between what she believes is right and what she’s being told is logical feel very relatable and sincere. She’s been living a life in a pristine society, where the concept of war is difficult to even imagine, so being flung into a far less peaceful and sustainable world comes at more than a small shock.Cyrus, her mentor, is the counterpoint to Winter’s pleas for peaceful discussion and her fear at wandering into a world she doesn’t understand. He’s calculating and experienced, but also cold and seemingly worn down by the things he’s had to do for the sake of keeping worlds alive. His discussions with Winter are often full of frustration, but the glimpses of understanding that poke through give him the feeling of more than just an old, mean-spirited teacher. He’s smart and recognizes that Winter isn’t prepared for the role of a mediator, but he wants to ensure she gains the experience needed, which even if uncomfortable isn’t anything like what she’ll eventually have to face.Most of Learning to Manage Chaos takes place between only these two characters, and the back and forth between them is surprisingly compelling. Their dialogues can get heated, but developer Dischan Media does a fantastic job leveraging this between brief moments of humor (such as Winter trying her first bear) to create a very personal, relatable feeling to every interaction. The core plot holds no great weight in all of this, being a tool to spark conversation but without much depth in and of itself, but it’s a short outing that manages a great amount of character development before then closing in a scene that while not perfectly finite, feels complete.But then the screen comes back and here is where Dysfunctional Systems unfortunately suffers as at the time the first episode was being developed it was still believed future episodes were on the way. The fact is that development has been put on perpetual hiatus, dying after internal troubles caused the project to fall through and any hope of seeing the series completed along with it. This wouldn’t factor in nearly as heavily to Learning to Manage Chaos if it wasn’t for the extended epilogue that comes after the credits. It’s a series of exchanges which don’t exactly propel the plot forward, but leave it in an awkward state of uncompleted development. It disrupts the finality the episode originally ends with, and itself feels rather unpolished, with an abundance of useless dialogue and very limited artwork (most of the epilogue takes place in a sort of text only terminal)So there’s the clincher. Dysfunctional Systems is an engaging visual novel, with a wonderful art style and a brilliant score, but it’s a story you have to commit at the start to being left hanging with. It’s hard for me to say then if I recommend giving it a chance. I’m caught between my enjoyment of what it is, and disappointment at what it will never become. It’s a weird place to find a game, and it’s not a judgement call I’d be able to make for anyone else.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

												Dysfunctional Systems Episode 1: Learning to Manage Chaos is a Western-made visual novel from Dischan Media available on Steam it features features two distinct endings, unlock able bonus art, an animated opening video, and a jukebox of in-game music.I stand on a neutral ground for this visual novel. Meaning yes i do recommend it but to a certain extent. (Go to the bottom for reason of standing on a neutral ground)The StoryDysfunctional Systems is a visual novel series featuring Winter Harrison, a student mediator from a utopian world. Learning to Manage Chaos is the first entry in the series.What is a mediator? A mediator is someone who travels to chaotic worlds, attempting to resolve the issues plaguing them. The first entry in the series follows Winter's second mediation, where she shadows the experienced and aloof mediator: Cyrus Addington.Audio and Visual elementsCharacter sprites are used in the standard visual novel style, but sometimes characters are integrated into the backgrounds which really brought the images to life. I loved the detailed background work. The color palette was extremely ""muted"" which suited the world they are on, gloomy and dark.The music in Dysfunctional Systems is beautiful, especially ‘Terminus’, the theme track. Sound effects are well used too overall really a good job of fitting into the Visual Novel's environment.Reasons for a neutral standDysfunctional Systems Episode 1: Learning to Manage Chaos is in an episodic format providing episode by episode is satisfying, while still leaving you wanting more. Unfortunately this isn’t the case with Dysfunctional Systems Episode 1: Learning to Manage Chaos, which serves as little more than a teaser for a story that could be potentially interesting. Meaning if you do get this there will be no continuation of Episode 2 because it is confirmed by Dischan Media there will not be Episode 2 at all. [I honestly wish there is Episode 2 because I liked it overall]To sum upYes I do recommend this Visual Novel but be warned there will not be an episode 2 forever[as off now] so take this visual novel as just something to be read when you have nothing to do.Review with images click here[azusantiara.com] "

												tl;dr: 6/10 - Pretty good but really short.Full review:As a rather critical visual novel fan, I can't say I'm easily pleased. A visual novel being sold on Steam does raise some eyebrows, but nonetheless I decided to give it a go, and I was pleasantly surprised after reading the disappointing World End Economica a while back.Although Dysfunctional Systems is an original English language (OEL) visual novel, which is generally a good indicator of poor quality, my past experience with another OEL VN (Katawa Shoujo) was actually rather good, so I wasn't deterred from the beginning. Overall, the visual novel was quite good, all things considered, but we can take a bit of a deeper look into things.First thing's first: the writing. I can't vouch for the story being fresh and original, but it was well executed regardless. The characters' personalities were generally consistent and the story developed in a logical order. However, the visual novel was painstakingly short. I felt like I was just thrown into the middle of things, and even though the story wasn't too complex to figure out what was going on, a longer introduction would've been welcomed with open arms. There's also the issue of how easy it is to get to the bad end. After several playthroughs of making and recording different decisions, in desperate search of the good end, I was sorely disappointed to find that there was none. As it stands, the story is good, but much too short for my liking, and a lot more content is due. The ratio of number of choices to length of story was horribly skewed in the wrong direction, but I can respect the amount of tedious coding it would've taken to link everything together the way it was done.Technically, the English was rather good. It was by no means perfect, but it made good use of stylistic devices and all of the other things English professors like to rant on about for an easy-to-read experience. There were a few mistakes that the more pedantic of us (such as myself) may wince at, and the word choice was often pretentious, to say the least, but otherwise, Dysfunctional Systems was well written. If anything, it was better than the disgrace World End Economica was, which I can only imagine was a machine translation done by an IBM 5200.On to the art and sound - long story short, they were also quite good. While the drawing didn't exactly fit the conventional visual novel clique, there was something about the brushed watercolour style art that appealed to me. All the ren'py animations (yeah, I actually bothered to look through the game files to confirm it was a ren'py game) were used well and surprisingly weren't skimped on - this kind of production quality I can appreciate. I'm not much of an audiophile, but I can also vouch for the soundtrack being great on its own. In the game, it can be a bit overpowering at times, but the volume controls presumably exist solely for that purpose. If only they had some voice acting to go with it - in Japanese, of course, since I'm a filthy weeaboo and English sucks - but alas, one can only dream.It might seem like I'm bashing the game pretty harshly here - and that's probably true - but I actually did enjoy the game. Although it was extremely short (short enough for me to get 100% completion after only 3 hours), and there were the other issues I'd mentioned previously, it was an interesting story and fun to read. Even though I'm bringing it up again - the sheer lack of content was detrimental to the score I gave - we mustn't forget to interpret the ten point scale correctly. 5/10 is perfectly average, and not garbage by any means. Going from there, 6/10 isn't a bad score, despite what IGN and whatnot want you to believe - but that's a story for another time. I know episodes 2 and 3 of this series are due to come soon, though, so hopefully they can make up for where this episode fell short and salvage the trilogy as a whole.			"

												Dysfunctional Systems is a visual novel that attempts to portray the idea of a utopian society using their advanced magic dimension-tripping technology and superior history and intellect to help guide other planets in subtle ways -- managing their ""chaos"". However, Episode 1 presents itself as more of a teaser than an actual iteration in a series due to its short length (two hours is more than enough time to rinse this out), lack of choices and minimal explanation of who or what is really happening in the utopian society.Given that the start of the game (and store page) makes a point to mention how ""Your choices affect the story"" theres a distinct lack of any choices to be made. Which is doubly odd as the game takes care to give you a codex with which to keep you up to speed with the world and current trends or plot devices. This may be a personal qualm but I expected it to come in to some use when it came to ""managing the chaos"" of the world, such as reading it granting an insight into how to take action, but instead the sole decision you get to make in this title has but four resolutions resulting in two endings that you make through a series of choices that are mostly red herrings. This makes the codex feel rather unwarranted as everyone always explains themselves in enough detail such that reading it is a waste of effort.The writing itself feels quite contrived: characters and, in this episode, countries presented are almost painting-by-numbers in their given role. I mean, who hasnt heard the one about the gruff, old mentor with a plucky, slightly rebellious voice-of-reason apprentice. Or the one about the two large nations stuck in a [cold] war over a third, smaller independence. That being said, credit where credit is due, the game does look lovely. The UI is clean and distinct, backgrounds are nicely detailed and the character portraits display many emotions in a variety of poses. Most of all it feels consistent -- portraits dont just sit on top of the background but instead fit in, general colours and tone do well to make this.I can only really hope that future episodes really expand on what I would only really call an extended teaser here.

												Let me preface this by saying that I really, really enjoyed Dysfunctional Systems. However, I cannot in good conscience recommend this for many people. Let me explain.Firstly, what I did like about Dysfunctional Systems. While very short, the story is extremely compelling in terms of the writing, and especially the premise, which is very unique and one of my favorite aspects. The interface is very slick and polished, and the art and character design is fantastic. I absolubtely loved my short romp through the world(s) of Dysfunctional Systems, and I sincerely wish I could spend more time in that world.Unfortunately, this brings me to why I ultimately cannot recommend Dysfunctional Systems despite its fantastic setting, storywriting, and art direction. Dysfunctional Systems was originally created with the intent of being a 3 episode series, which was funded through kickstarter. However, Dischan, the creators of Dysfunctional Systems have confirmed the cancellation of the release of the next installment of Dysfunctional Systems, and have put the entire series on indefinite hiatus, and most likely permanent cancellation.I cannot recommend Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos because the entire VN was clearly centered around the notion that it fit into a greater story, and the endings of Learning to Manage Chaos are clearly structered around this assumption. While Learning to Manage Chaos is a great story for what it is, it does not work very well as a standalone story.If you are willing to play what was suppossed to be the opening for a greater story, then go ahead and get Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos. If you feel like you will be dissapointed by the notion the story is incomplete, then please avoid this title. It's a pity really because I really did like the premise and setting of Dysfunctional Systems.			"

												This is a painful review to make because on the one hand, the game's story is really interesting and somewhat engaging like a typical Visual Novel would but without having to resort to overused tropes and makes it clear that it has it's own identity from the get go.But on the other hand, there's no following story because the dev team ♥♥♥♥ed up hard and tried to be a fully functional studio like Telltale Games is by comparison and produce several titles following after this. The sad truth is, there was no form of planning or meetings being held consistently. The studio filed bankruptcy some time after this title was released. The management was abyssmal, to say the least...Onto the game, it has a very good soundtrack, one I still enjoy hearing to this day, the art style is nice to look at even if bleak at times for dramatic effect (well used and impactful I might add) and the dialogue is quite mature, despite being very one sided for a pretty good chunk of it, it doesn't feel draggingly long like in other games and is actually well written enough if you are into untraditional VNs. The included encyclopedia like feature is however not useful for most of the story aside from it's introduction. It is wasted effort and could have been made much more relevant if they bothered with it a little more than to just add an entry every now and then for plot purposes, which is to it's detriment. The amount of work put into the encyclopedic portion of the game is respectable but ultimately laughable if you take out the important bits that relates to the plot which, again, were used to introduce the player to its function/presence.""Should you play this game in my opinion?"" is the last question left to be answered; as of right now, no.The end is a cliff hanger into the next volume that will never come. If, by some miracle, this gets a reboot/revival by the original creator and owner of the copyright and is actively working on developing the sequel, then I will revise my judgement of this first game and give it a recommendation, but unless things start moving again for the development of just chapter 2, stay away from this and save some money for an actually finished game.

												Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos might be the beginning of something pretty good, but on its own I don't think that I would recommend it on its own. It is a visual novel, essentially a choose-your-own-adventure game on your computer. It has plenty of good points: the art is good, the premise is interesting, the setting is introduced nicely, and I found the characters entertaining. The problem with Dysfunctional Systems is that it does not have many interaction points, at least not in the path that I took. Along the path that I selected, I was able to branch the story only twice. I can understand that as the first episode in what seems to be a planned series Dysfunctional Systems wants to keep its possible end states manageable, but the game would have been vastly improved by adding a few more interaction points, even if they did not actually impact the story.As it stands, Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos would probably have been better served by being a graphic novel than a game. If the premise interests you, then by all means buy it. It is an interesting story, but its gameplay value, at least at this point, is limited.			"

												UPDATE: A sequel was kickstarted, then cancelled. You'll find no closure in this game. Just a lot of unfulfilled potential---I like VNs and all, but with this game you're essentially buying a prologue. In fact I'm pretty sure that the Steins;Gate prologue was longer than this entire game. It's so short that even at such a small asking price I can't justify in my head wanting a VN that serves as merely an introduction to the main cast. Here is your protagonist. This is her mentor. Getting to know them? Good! TRAGEDY! Oh no something bad happened in the first 45 minutes of the game. That was tough- hey look at this cutie pie. Do you like her? Good! Game's over! See you next time! Roll credits.I need more to go on than this, I don't decide if I like a show after the first episode and I can't decide if I like a visual novel after the first chapter. But if I absolutely must, then no - it's not good enough.One out of five Lennys( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )			"

												So, I bought this game some time ago after seeing it streamed on FinestKO. It's a wonderfully well written and incredibly interesting story about a young girl named Winter who is studying to become a ""mediator"", a dimension hopping negotiator who seeks to help solve the chaotic problems that exist across the multiverse. However, on her second mediation, things take an intriguing turn, and it's up to the player to see how the story plays out, making choices along the way that will supposedly influence further events in the series, similar to Telltale's Walking Dead games.This is a story from the guys who made Juniper's Knot, another fantastic (and free, so you should play it) visual novel. The writing is top notch, the story is well crafted and takes a few unexpected turns, and in general is quite the joy to experience. At only $5, you're missing out on a fantastic story if you don't pick this one up.			"

												It's too bad that the project is discontinued because this game was a good premise to a complex universe.You're Winter, a teen learning to be a mediator, whose mentor Cyrus seems to be kinda blased by everything. You arrive in Brighton, a country that is depending of the good will of another one. Your goal? To protect peace. But what will you do?The problem with this game is that you're only making a choice in the middle of the story and it's the only action you can do. After that, you have to see the consequences of your actions. There are two major endings (although these endings are only affecting your own character and Cyrus).There are so much to read, thank god, a codex is included, with facts about the world you're visiting. But the best about this game is the art and the music.And given the fact that to reach the endings, you're not stuck with one path, the achievements are also exciting to do.For the price, you're not robbed. But you'll never learn more about Dysfunctional Systems. The rest is cancelled, left in the dust because of mismanagement that wasn't intended. I don't know where the money will go but if anything, if it's still on Steam and still on sale, you can still give it a try.			"

												Man oh man, that just might be the best 1 dollar purchase that i have ever made. This Visual Novel just made it on my top favorite list, tied up with my pavlove: Corpse Party. This just might be the most political, phylosofic, and sweetest experience that i had this week. After telling you that you should totally buy this game and all the episodes as they come by, let's get to the review:Graphics and General Design: Pretty beautiful to look at. Everything's detailed and the drawing is just too good to look at. All the scenes are perfectly shown and make you feel completely immersed on the story. Seriously, this is indie and we're talking about some high quality visuals here. Take Dangan Ronpa for instance, it has a visual that assembles a lot of it (When you aren't on the 3D parts, obviously enough). All characters looks charismatic enough to make me instant fall in love with then, and getting a good look at the extras, i can tell that they really put an effort to make the best presentation possible in this first episode.Gameplay: It's a Visual Novel, you will read and read A LOT. But that's okay, because that's what this genre is. I like medias that can make me read something that don't hurt my eyes so much like a book and has some kind of interaction of the player. The interaciton on the first episode consists of opening your codex (I'm serious) and choosing. That's the big card in the game. I loved every pathway that i did (You can see that i have already unlocked every achievement for this game) and i have two profiles for the next episodes: The one that i called ""good choises"" and the one ""♥♥♥♥ choises"". As i do with multiple endings/pathways games (Take The Walking Dead for instance). Like every other good game that follow this pattern, the game makes choosing hard and, even if you think your choise was right, you will think twice and realize it just wasn't. It was ""a little shitier"" than the other ones (Again, like the walking dead). Since this game talks a lot about polict and ethics, it is a pretty interesting system to say the least. ""Reading and doing multiple pathways, only to be tired enough to sleep"" doesn't exists here. The game has two kinds of saves: One that you can always acess, either you quit the game or not, and works like a normal one and quicksaves, that works for saving time when doing other pathways. Also, the game has a skip mode, it will skip all the text that has already been presented to the player, so you will never read the same thing twice.  Which is kinda cool. If a kind of system like this could've existed on Corpse Party series, i wouldn't have waster +50 hours of my life to get all the endings for both games (I know, right. I suck :P).Soundtrack: Holy mackina, my ears are so pleased. The opening song is awesome, the game song is awesome, the ambient sound is awesome...But i kinda missed voice acting. I know it isn't much common in Visual Novels to use it, but at least they could do some especific (And important) lines to make us even more attached to the characters, like in the other Visual Novels that i have already mentioned.Story: Oh boy. I don't know how i tell the story of this game without spoiling it, so here you go: Discover for yourself. It's really thrilling, it has heavy amounts of extra information that you can always see in your codex and one of the most beautiful written dialogues that i've ever seen. All characters feel human and you can easily understand they personality as soon as you come in the game. The plot consists of travelling through multiple worlds/dimensions and dealing with chaos, trying to solve this alternate beings problems. But these aren't just ordinary problems (They exist, as mentioned in the game), they involve a lot of thinking and toughs that will make the player guessing and giving his own opinion about what's happening (Even though the game can't hear you xD). It's really explorable and has a good universe to develop the plot and such. Also, characters presented at the end of the game already make me feels that episode 2 is going to be epic.This first episode might be short in your first playthrough, but you can explore many things. Multiple endings, many information and such a work of new scenes and drawings makes replayability a possible thing and it's sure as hell worth it. Also: This game has the best anime opening that i've seen this year. Period. Buy this NOW. (Especially because it's -80%, it's SO worth it!). Can't wait for episode 2 :3			"

												I really can't put into words how good I feel about this game. But I'm gonna try.Learning to Manage Chaos is Part 1 of the Dysfunctional Systems visual novel series. It follows the story of Winter Harrison, a student at some kind of... orginization? It's never too clear. Regardless, you follow the story of Winter and help to make choices that lead to multiple endings, each with varying differences.The story is amazing. It takes place during a futuristic, post-apocalypse setting, where technology to travel between planets in an instant is available. The characters are all unique and very engaging, making you take sides very often in the story. (Go, Winter!~) For someone like me who likes to escape reality (assignments most of all) it is amazing. It constantly keeps you on your toes, and for the amount of value the story offers, the price is soooo worth it.The artwork is goregeous. An almost rustic, stylized and crisp style brings alive, simple yet powerful character designs and image stills for the story events. If you're someone like me who loves a good browse through artwork, the images are available after a certain point.Finally, the music. What's better than a soundtrack that caresses your ears like a silk glove on your bare bre- arms. I mean arms. What can be better than that? If said soundtrack comes with the game once you purchase it. Done and done. :3In short, this game is a must-have for your steam library this Chirstmas, with a soundtrack to keep your ears warm by the fire.~Gen~			"

												I wanted to like this game a lot more than I ended up liking it. It almost feels like 3 different games. The Beginning: Some weird, dry, long drawn out conversation between two people about mundane stuff. The Middle: A political intrigue thriller about trying to stop a war. The End: Some fan servicey cliche Anime dorm stuff.You can probably tell I think the middle was the strongest part. At the same time even there it falls short for me because the choices ultimately don't make a difference and the same thing happens no matter what you do.I think this visual novel works best when it focuses on plot, but they've sandwiched that in between character stuff which for me just really wasn't that interesting. I foundthe main character annoying and the way you're dropped into the story without really having it explained what the deal is was odd. They're talking how strange and alien the people on that world were but from most people's point of view playing this I'd venture that the main characters are much more alien.Though I did like the plot when Dysfunctional Systems actually gets around to it, I've played other Visual Novels where I was more connected to the characters and felt more invested due to more and more meaningful choices.The Jisei / Kansei / Yousei trilogy for example (which was also in the Groupees Build a Doujin Bundle) I found much more interactive and engaging. If you have Dysfunctional Systems from the Groupees bundle then by all means grab the Steam key but I don't think it's worth bumping to the top your play list. Also if you aren't familiar with visual novels don't take it as a great example of the best they have to offer because it's really not.			"

Beating the story proper each time would take a fairly long time and break your mouse/keyboard due to the repeteded clicking to move forward in the dialog.Time to 100%: ~1½ hours (if you use savefile and skip dialog)			"

												[Neutral Review]Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is a well-written Visual Novel with a solid plot and gorgeus artwork/soundtrack. Unfortunately, it's incomplete: the game was intended to be episodic and, for that reason, it ends on a cliffhanger. Sadly, the development team dropped the ""Dysfunctional Systems"" project and we won't see it's sequels. That being said, I still think this episode alone is worth it. I just can't fully recommend it (and it pains me) because the plot will never be complete. Otherwise, I would,If you like a good sci-fi tale and enjoy visual novels with real substance, this is one you might consider trying anyway. "

												One of the most well presented VNs ever. This is supposed to be just the first episode of a long series of games, but sadly the entire project was cancelled.It's still worth your time if you're tired of all the low quality VNs floating around on Steam and Greenlight and need to purify your brain with some ♥♥♥♥ that makes some sense. This is how a good VN shoud look and feel like, with characters and backgrounds moving smoothly together with the captivating soundtrack. Not just a slideshow with drawings simply disappearing and appearing. So they really nailed the 'visual' part of the 'visual novel' genre. Even the UI is beautiful.Unfortunately the 'novel' part isn't as perfect because the story is unfinished. The setting is still intact, and it's genuinely interesting, and the visual elements set the mood just right for this little futuristic trip to a doomed world. But it's not finished and it's never going to be. I would personally still go for it, but nobody can blame you for not wanting to play an incomplete game.			"

												This game is an interactive book but there isn't a lot of interacting until one part of the game, the rest is just reading a lot. But the outcome of the story depends on what you choose at that one point in the game where you actually get to choose how it all plays out. The graphics are anime looking and the story is clever and well done. I really enjoyed this game and all it had to offer. I beat it a couple of times to get all the achievements and to see how many different ways the story can play out differently. if you grinded through the story with alot of clicks or using a macro you can easily get all the achievements in about 30 minutes easily. I really liked this book. I highly recommend getting this game if you would like a good read.			"

												I am an avide fan of anime and the likes so a visual novel is right up my alley, especially when the main character is so cute! that however will not effect my review on this game. Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is a hell of a title and a mouthful to say, but unique, interesting, and well worth the five dollars I had to pay for it.DS:LMC for short is amazing the story in short is about the main character, Winter, helping out her teacher in trying to solve a different worlds problems. While that may seem confusing at first the concept I have never seen done before with the information in the game being well flushed out and researched. The story consumed me, and I felt for the main character as she tried to resolve the problems she was having with the way her teacher went about and did things. I felt for her as she tried to face her problems. A very well thought-out and written game. Much better than anything anime is putting out these days! The art is well done. It has a more handmade feel about it looking more paint like than anything. Art is a taste which I can not decide for you so the final descision about it will ulitimently have to be made by you, I am sorry you have to do so much work.The next game in the series has been cancled and I am not sure if the company will continue it. A very sad thought for me considering how much I loved the story in this game, but if you are looking for a short game to pass the time and love rich story that is very unique buy this game and do not look back!Hoped this helped!

												Just a routine training exercise where nothing could possibly go wrong... isn't that how it always is?Take the role of an intergalactic cadet taking her first field trip with a senior officer. What was supposed to be just a boring lesson in interplanetary politics ends up twisting and turning into a morally gray catastrophe. Before you know it you're completely in over your head as you realize that neither you nor your mentor are properly prepared to deal with the situation at hand. Go through the mind of a 13 year old girl who struggles to deal with events that are completely out of control. Learn what it means to manage chaos.With all that out of the way I feel I need to point out that this game was planned as a trilogy and at the time of this review the developers have been shutdown and future episodes have been put on hiatus.I still recommend this though because it's a very thought provoking and emotional journey of a little girl who just wasn't prepared.

And of course, the concept is really good and Winter is an interesting MC), even tho that the ending left a ton of questions in the air, and we probably won’t be getting the answers… I still recommend this VN. It’s worth the full price (even if it’s one chapter or whatever, it was GOOD and I had fun). But sadly, there’s no ending; I guess that’s left to our own imagination for now…This could have been an amazing series. Maybe, one day, we will have a second chapter… I can still dream, I guess.6/10.			"

												This Visual Novel is very short, but THE MUSIC. I fell in love with the music and am glad it came with the soundtrack. I already have it on my itunes and occasionally listen to it while i'm playing League of Legends. This is worth picking up if you're feeling lazy and want to slow things down and enjoy a story. I would say its worth the $5, but if it ever goes on sale, then it becomes a must buy.			"

												TL;DR: Too short for $5, buy on sale or wait for the other episodes and buy them together. Not interesting, tends to get boring. Lack of a sense of urgency, time literally flies by without you noticing. Main character is boring, has what feels like an entire section set up for characterization and does nothing with it. Seemingly lesbian character outed for no particular reason and also has an achievement seemingly based on the fact that she is lesbian for no particular reason. Not a branching story, incredibly streamline with only one real choice in the whole game.I like Dischan's other visual novel and I wanted this because I thought it would be similar. While that game wasn't branching, it was somewhat thought provoking (even if it's an overused idea that they went with as far as the moral quandry in that game) but for a free game it was really good. With money behind them, I thought they'd make something interesting. Sure enough, they came up with an interesting idea for a new game.Then promptly went nowhere with it.This game is unbelievably short-- I beat it twice and spent three hours trying to get all of the achievements, which I haven't completed at the time of this recommendation-- and it's not even interesting the entire way through. You could potentially divide the story into three parts (though really it's just two if you consider the first and second part the same thing): The Prologue, the Supposed Interesting Part, and the Lesbian(?) Dormitory.In the Prologue, there's a very shoehorned in ""characterization"" of the main character, which is fine but not very well done. But you don't make any choices here. You're meant to use this time to learn about the main character Winter, but she's just so boring and straightlaced and you don't even know why she adheres to the rules so much. She has flashes of her past, which I think was a device to make her interesting, but those are quickly forgotten or pushed to the wayside. She doesn't say anything interesting and mostly whines for the entire introduction. Since the player knows her thoughts, it's made worse by the attempts to make the user ""bond"" with her. It doesn't work because there's nothing to bond with. She's just some rule-follower who seems upset to be...not following rules. Her mentor is clearly her opposite, but nothing interesting happens with him in the beginning.The Supposed Interesting Part is, by naming convention alone, supposed to be interesting. It starts out interestingly enough, but then immediately falls off. You're given a time limit, which is a great way to put pressure on the player. What are you doing? Trying to prevent a giant loss that has a lot of political backing to it. Also interesting. There seem to be tons of different ways to proceed too, which is why it's a shame this game lets you pick between a whopping two different things. And both of them are watered down into very simplistic, almost meaningless drivel. The main character talks alot about death, but there's no weight to it. Nothing makes you feel urgent or makes you want to help the maincharacter. In fact, there's a sense of urgency to the whole game that isn't done well-- you don't know how much time has passed or is passing, and you're not doing anything but blindly following this mentor character who isn't explaining his motivations. You only have one story branching choice and the character will moan and whine unless you pick the one she's been leaning towards the whole time. It would be interesting if her choice actually affected anything, but it doesn't. You don't learn much new information no matter which you pick. The idea that you have four hours to save the world, which essentially is the entire midgame, is rendered almost useless by the watered down argument of morals that follows your choice, and then immediately afterwards, everything comes to a climax. Compartively, a game like 999 makes 9 hours feel like an eternity in the game and out of the game. This game's rush to get to the climax makes it more chore-like than game-like.In the final stretch, the game goes into a fantasy mode I don't quite understand. The main character spends her time either sulking or trying to be funny with her roommate, who makes very many lesbian references but doesn't follow through (you even get an achievement called Undertones for no real reason after the lesbian-esque speaking) and while there's nothing wrong with gay characters and they don't need to have a reason to be gay or anything like that... what is the point of highlighting it so much? It ruins the end of the game because now whenever this new character comes up, she'll just be ""the lesbian roommate"" instead of ""the roommate"". Plus there's not much explaination on this other Earth, so they say a lot of things with no real explaination and people stop by and say things that make sense but it'd be nice to have more information. What's a Northwesterner? I guess they come from the Northwest. That's about all you get from the game. You have no real notion of space or time, everything's so divorced from the player that it makes the game boring.To sum up: This game is not worth buying alone and definitely not for $5. If you didn't get it on sale, wait for it to go on sale, or buy it in a bundle when the other episodes come out. Don't buy this thinking it'll be a huge, twisting, moral quandry inducing story-- it's nothing of the sort. It's run of the mill and ordinary.			"

												Interesting story. It really is a shame Dischan went under, I was looking forward to a sequel. I'm not sure how it would have worked out though with the artist who did this one leaving. I didn't like the early art for the second one nearly as much.

												The first and most obvious reason I can't recommend this game is the abandonment of the series, making this game a prelude to a story that will never reach completion. However, it's also not very interesting. When i can play almost an hour in a visual novel game and not make any choices or select any discussion topics, that's not a good thing.			"

												Now, i have no idea how to review a visual novel seeing as this is the second one i've played in my entire lifetime. But what i will say though is that it gave me a pretty good idea of how visual novels work and makes me want to play other ones in the future. So that is a good sign. However, i felt that the storytelling was a bit amateurish and disjointed at times. and that the pacing varied between being either too slow or too fast. But the story and subject matter was compelling enough for me to stick with it until the end.Speaking of the ending, it leaves many questions unanswered and isn't very satisfying, this is because there will be future episodes to tie it all together. But i am a bit vary, seeing as the sequel has been delayed and even abandoned by the developers until they made a kickstarter. And in my mind, kickstarter often means trouble, there are few things that have come out of kickstarter and been exactly as good as promised. I've been disappointed, ripped off, and lied to thanks to the ""early access/kickstarter culture"" and i've learnt the hard way that you should never ever buy works-in-progress or pre-order things if you don't have a damn good reason to do so.But in the end, i think i would recommend this visual novel. Because it seems to be the best one available on steam currently. And because it combines cute and lighthearted themes with dark and philosophical ones. Touching topics such as ethics or politics.

												So apparently there will be no more episodes for this series, which is definitely a bummer and a cause for lots of negative reviews of episode 1. But judging EP1 on its own - it definitely gets passing marks from me. Right from the start we're thrown into story which quickly unveils it's details and draws the reader in. Our main character is 14 years old girl learning to manage chaos as title states, which in practice tuns out to be solving of worldly problems of various kinds to manage order in the worlds. Yes, 'world' in plural because the story involves travel between distant worlds in the universe. Sounds awesome, no? Episode 1 tells story about one such trip to a world on a verge of conflict and will test our girl in her ability to help resolve the issue at hand. What's the most important for me in giving this VN a positive review is that the episode have a conclusions. Not a definitive one, but it doesn't end in steep cliffhanger without resolving any part of given story. Which lets episode 1 stand firm as a standalone work. Although of course there is a lot of things that could be continued, explained, extended into the next episodes.			"

												Brilliant.  Crude, Grity, Emotional, humbling, and no damn sugar coating. I've never played/read a visual novel as quite intense and perplexing as this. It's political, interlectual, unpredictable and you can learn a lot. The conversations alone are so fantastic and articulate that you wouldn't even need the visuals as an aid to become hooked to this, though that in itself is fantastic. Every character is unique, and none are generic or stereotypical. And ofcourse, being able to make your own decisions allows for more twisted and unique plots that you create deep connections and look at things from the characters prospective. Cogito ergo sum, if you will It's flawless for the most part, and I'm looking forward to part two.			"

												Only part of a series but if the rest of the series is as good or better than this then I'm eagerly awaiting the rest of it, as this is a very stellar beginning. The story has pacing down wonderfully and is quite engaging from start to finish. Naturally can't talk about it too much but there are some serious moral dilemnas raised with no binary answers. There's only one section of interaction but it's used well, and not necessarily a binary yes/no choice. The one letdown is the length, which is admittedly not particularly long (one playthrough took me about an hour and a half, and the second starting from halfway through was 45 minutes on top of that). I think it justifies it with the quality provided, though. Certainly a good visual novel and I do hope the rest of the series gets funded and produced.			"

												I'll admit, I didn't have high hopes for this VN, seeing as this is only the second VN I've ever experienced. At first, I felt that the characters were dull and that I was going to have to drop it out of boredom early on. It didn't take long for my opinion to change as the story picked up. Not that many decisions to make, but hopefully everything becomes more complex as the story continues. The art style is pretty good, as it accurately represents the tone of the story. The ambient sounds are fantastic! Easy to dismiss, but really add to the immersion of the setting. The musical choices seemed right for each situation and only further improved the tone and setting. The bottom line is that I don't regret the purchase so far. I look forward to continuing the story.			"

												Overall, I think this was a good game experience. This was my first attempt at a visual novel, and it's definitely not for everybody. It didn't take me too long to beat the game, and I'm going to get episode 2 when that  comes out to see where the story goes. I think that the biggest downfall to this game was that it took a while before you could really experience the game and make any decisions. After you make your first decision, it's smart to save the game, so you can go back and make different decisions without having to restart the entire game. This is a short story, and it's obvious that there will be more games out there, as the story line leads to a sequel. I enjoyed the art in the game, as it's visually appealing, but I think the characters could use some work and not be quite as dull. Even though the characters seemed a little dull at times, the storyline was great. I think it was well worth the money if you are into visual novels, but just know that you are going to be paying for a game that is a little short.			"

Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of HearingOverall Rating: 5/10Gameplay Rating: 4/10Accessibility Rating: 10/10Overall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and accessibility (how the game includes deaf/hoh gamers).General GameplayDysfunctional Systems is a graphic novel game that tells its story and involves the gamer in a story that plays out via text and images.You are Winter Harrison, a 14-year-old girl from a utopian world who serves as an interplanar mediator.  She finds herself in Sule, a world entering into conflict that she and her mentor, Cyrus, must help resolve.If you're new to graphic novel games, the pacing is slow and story-driven.  As these games go, Dysfunctional Systems' episode 1 is a short, simple introduction to the story that, though somewhat involving in its events, leaves the player left short-changed on any real development of character or story.Even so, if you have the money to spare on something you know is incomplete, this game is a small treat that can, in some ways, make up for its brevity.Replayability/SequelsWhile this episode has a promising start to something that could be interesting, it seems unclear whether or not there will be additional episodes following this one.General AccessibilityAccessibility OptionsOptions can be accessed before the game begins, allowing you control of game settings.  Music and sound volume are controlled separately and can be muted altogether.The game plays out over text boxes.  Text speed, textbox opacity and color, and the ability to skip text are all available options, giving gamers control over the pace of the game.Subtitles & CaptionsDysfunctional Systems is captioned completely from beginning to end and the story plays out in text, which does not advance until the gamer decides to do so.Captions include the speaker's name and quotes for directly spoken text.  Narrated text is provided without quotes and a name, so I assume it's the main character (Winter) thinking or addressing the gamer directly.The game's captions are very true to spoken word, so any deaf/hoh who do not frequently use English to communicate may find it tedious at times.Chatting/CommunicatingDysfunctional Systems is a single player game; no communication/chatting options available.---Visit Games Reviews for the Deaf/HoHhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/gamereviewsforthedeaf "

												I would like to give this VN a positive review as I did like its initial premise and I really do wish I could say it was a good experience.. except it wasn't. Despite its short lenght, it was a struggle to complete – but in order to at least give this game a chance, I felt I had to.The good:Visually, I would say that Dysfunctional Systems Episode 1 is pretty gorgeous overall. The details are beautiful, and if anything, there are too many poses and expressions (because they ultimately appear on only one side of the screen). I also applaud for the layout, which (unlike in many other games) looks well designed and appealing to the eye. Nothing bad to say about the music, either: it is enjoyable enough and far better than what I had expected for a game of this lenght and kind. In addition, the inclusion of the soundtrack so that it's possible to listen to the tracks separately grants an extra plus. Another comes simply from the fact that it is cheap.The bad:As one could expect from a VN, writing makes or breaks it, and it unfortunately broke it for me. My first ending lifted up the (otherwise miserable) experience into something near-decent, but the dragged out nonsensial epilogue successfully drowned whatever good was left. There is also little to say about gameplay in this game, as there only was one point where you are allowed to make choices – but I never minded the lack of interactivity so much as how the game felt so shamelessly pieced together and none of the pieces truly fit. I don't buy the reason that it is the first in the series; it just wasn't good enough for a release. It tries to be serious but never gets past awkward in any of the areas it tries to explore. Instead we get a stupifying amount of details that don't matter, and characters so blank and plain that they wouldn't talk unless the creators had forced them to.Although not explicitly included in gameplay, I must mention that some of the fanart pictures (presented along with in-game art) in the ""extras"" section, are of questionable nature. Fanart is nice and all but I do prefer it as an entity of its own, separate from the game. For the creators to associate themselves with this material and comments kind of begs a question of how seriously this game ought to be taken in the first place. "

												TL;DR: The first video with the fancy animations and cut scenes do not represent this game at all. Watch the second video to get a better idea. Interesting concept but I didn't like the story, which should be the most important part of a visual novel. It takes ~2-3 hours to finish.This is my first ""visual novel"" game and my dislike for this title doesn't really have anything to do with the genre. I think VN's are interesting concepts but the real fun is in the interactivity and the story ~ in Dysfunctional System: Learning to Manage Chaos (Ep1), the story reads like a B-movie script and there is really only one interactive portion which leads to one of two possible outcomes. It's worth noting that the game was designed to be episodic so your decisions will supposedly affect how the next two episodes play out.			"

Failed pretensions and a story without real choicesTwo things!As I was much younger I loved the book ""The Warlock of Firetop Mountain"" and the many books that came after this, it started my year long affection to roleplaying games and adventures. You try to affect the game with your decissions, the newes fad in this category are ""Visual Novels"" - some of them are quite blatantly Dating Sims. Luckily this game doesn't fall into this category of ""Visual Novel"" or ""Romantic Readalong"". It has a dystopian backdrop, and some, well you can say demands. During the past months I developed a healthy - avoidance syndrome - towards this relatively new genre of games, but since so many of them landed now in my backlist, I'll play them. Some of them are good and interesting, the most are not. This game is no exception to the later group.Second, the game was praised for the different and variable outcomes of the game. Ok, there are some choices, but the choices are leading to the same end result (not the epilogue - that isn't even a funny little thing with the room-mate, dear developers). I played it several times only to gain the achievements - but alone on the end result of this first part, I wouldn't buy the second part. You are very limited in the choices, and the outcome is with just little variations the same. To a fan of this genre it might be a godsend, to all others it can become a burden and bore to play, it's winded up in it's own verbosity, it lacks a lot of humor (naivity of the protagonist isn't really funny) and the really good artworks are like a dull firework in a even duller story.I'd vote for more ingenuity.Postscriptum after some months: Yes, some people didn't found this review helpful - I can tell you why, because no one remembers nowadays the really good start of interactive novels. Read some Steve Jackson and Ian Livingston. Take up some dice and play Wizard of Firetop Mountain, Forest of Doom and others - and learn that there were good one, and bad ones - learn the difference why FF and Lone Wolf, maybe even Grailquest were good and while some of the ""CYOA"" and ""Give yourself Goosebumps"" Stuff alongside with ""Endless Quest"" from TSR were bad. A cheesy story won't get better by fancy graphics. Period.			"

UPDATE 2/16: While I will still recommend Dysfunctional Systems personally, as for the foreseeable future it is dead in the water. It is likely that Dischan will not be releasing future episodes for it. Please be cautious while buying, as you are getting a short VN that sets itself up as a prequel and you won't be getting a conclusion. If you are okay with this, then I highly suggest a sale.While short, what Dysfunctional Systems brings to the table is excellent artwork, world building, characterization, and music. Taking the role of Winter, a student from a utopian Earth-like world, you shadow a seasoned veteran Mediator as you learn about how to settle problems in worlds and maintain balance. The story itself uses a lot of sci-fi elements, and while their world is hailed as utopian, the setting of this visual novel is very much dystopian.The premise itself is quite intriguing, and all the world-building (aided by the Codex) is really fascinating to read. Through the dialogue and interactions with key players, you learn a lot about the motivations of each character, and Winter herself learns about the impacts and pivotal role her choices (and sometimes her lack of choices) can have, which does impact her character a lot based on the endings you get. Choice wise, your choices really only branch at one point, however in order to reach a specific outcome you have to maneuver your way through several responses, something that I did not necessarily mind, though you will not have five endings here that are wildly different from one another.A big issue many have is the length of this game, and how it ends. It's not entirely unfounded; the game is very short for one playthrough depending on the speed you read at, and the endings don't really differ except for how the characters react. This almost makes your choice seem pointless, if this visual novel was going to be the only one from this series. However, with the way it sets itself up with the end, as well as the recent confirmation of more episodes, the story will continue and so one way to think of this is the beginning act of the story, and thus everything would not have reached the climax yet. It sets up the events to get the ball rolling. Whether this makes or breaks your decision to purchase depends entirely on how you feel about that.Art and music are top notch and excellent. Even the UI is presented in a rather appealing manner, though not quite as unique as, say, the console in Analogue: A Hate Story. The interesting thing that separates art for this VN with others is the painterly style, and it actually blends in well with the background and makes the characters feel very much a part of the world they are in. Writing is also very good, with a lot of good focus on characterization and growth, however the dialogue can feel stilted from Winter. There was also a lack of world building for their world, for the most part, and something I hope will be explored in the future (it would also explain why Winter's dialogue feels a little forced). While not impacting the core of the game, I also felt the fanservice-y pictures of the underage characters really off putting, and I'd rather there be more varied art to unlock since it's feels really exploitive having those pieces take up 50% of the unlockables.Definitely recommended if it's on sale at all. If you're going to buy it full price, be mindful of the length and endings. The art and music (soundtrack included) does make it a great visual novel to play through, though, and gives us a good idea of what to expect in the future quality-wise.			"

												Unfortunately I have to change this review and no longer recommend this game. It had a ton of potential but the developers dropped the ball hard with the Kickstarter campaign and as a result the story will never actually be completed.I guess they just weren't able to manage chaos after all.

												It's a very, very good VN and I'm really looking forward to the main episodes.It's a bit short - about an hour per path - but it's a great story, great soundtrack, great artwork, great everything.There are only 2 major paths, it seems - but each one is entirely separate from the other, which I liked - your choices don't just make an immediate difference, they completely change the remainder of the story (I noticed no duplicate panels between both paths).So I'd definitely recommend it, as long as you make sure to play both options.

												It's a visual novel, through and through. Though some people may argue that visual novels aren't games because they don't contain actual gameplay, it's certainly not a bad thing to have them around as people such as myself certainly enjoy them. Besides, if you choose to get this game you should be well aware of what it entails. That said, I'll try to briefly highlight the pros and cons without spoiling the story.If you're expecting a story which is tailored to the choices you make as you try to alter the outcome of your journey, then it might disappoint you when I say there isn't much of that to be found (yet). Sure you will get a chance to choose on how the story continues but that opportunity will occur once and can only go in either of two directions. Both having a different kind of ending but aside from the words you choose to get there are pretty much identical. Now I included the word ""yet"" in brackets because this is just the first episode out of a three in total.. and from the looks of it, episode two seems like a more branched out story.Being a visual novel, that's about the only possible con I can think of because the story in itself is really intriguing and takes place in a quite captivating era. Everything else from sound to music and artwork is well done and really sets the mood for the events that are to come. Even the characters look very promising with their different personalities. It's a great and elaborate premise to what just may turn out to become a marvelous series.Like almost every other visual novel, the game features a quick load & save system allowing you to save your progress before you make a choice and go back if you're not pleased with it's outcome. This is partially in vain because you can just use the regular save and load system at any given time during the story or choices. It only saves a bit of time and perhaps a save slot. Also, with only one set of choices and two outcomes, one may question the use of choosing a different road other than fully exploring the available dialogues. In the end it does ask if you want to save your profile, which basically means your choices may affect what is to come in the next episode.. but other than having two profiles for both endings, I wouldn't expect any major changes.In conclusion, it's a great prelude to what promises to be a great series albeit a bit short in length. It is in no way to be considered a full story in and all by itself.. whether that's worth the price comes down to how much you're willing to pay for an opening introduction. My opinion: other than fancying a well-told story; if it develops a bit more and becomes more subject to the player's choices.. I'd say it's definitely worth it.			"

												Dysfunctional Systems is a short Visual Novel about a girl that has to shadow her mentor as he tries to resolve a conflict on an other world. Soon after their arrival there said conflict threatens to escalate dramatically.The story is in large part explored through dialogue, with additional information provided in the form of a short wikipedia summary and the main character's inner monologue. Overall you have very little dialogue options to choose from and there are two different endings, depending on how one argument plays out.The story is well written and interesting. Winter's thoughts are especially entertaining.The soundtrack is great and fits the game perfectly, from start to finish.The art is also good, apparently. Although the series has been discontinued, this is a review for episode 1 and I can only recommand it. It's not like it ends on a major cliffhanger either. The end is actually satisfying enough. My only concern is with the very short storyline and whether it's worth the five bucks. Considering the soundtrack it probably is, though, and you can always replay it.The deciding factor here is definitely Juniper's Knot. That's the producers' prior work and free to download on their website. If you think that it would be worth money than buy Dysfunctional Systems. If Dysfunctional Systems is on sale again than it's a no-brainer. Buy it.			"

												The quality of the writing and the artwork is about what you'd expect from most self-published efforts. The scope of this episode is what would in other games be called a ""demo"".I didn't know the genre ""Visual Novel"" before I worked through this one, but now I now it involves lots of dialogue that you have to click through one by one, along with a handful of illustrations to go along with that that may or may not have to do with the written novel. Don't expect voiceovers or more than few simple animations and sound effects.Final warning: If you do read this ""visual novel"", do not expect the laws of logic or science to hold up.P.S.: Another visual novel by the same producer, ""Juniper's Knot"", is available for free.

												Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is one of the sad cases where an early entry shows very promising result, yet does not come to fruition.  It’s very short, and in essence only an introductory episode of a longer tale.  Yet it’s one of the better but less known visual novels currently on Steam.Now, to answer the question whether this vn worth $5 it’s asking… Maybe, maybe not.  I got it half price ($2.5) as it is on sale now.  Consider other ways I could have spent $2.5 to $5, I’d say it’s definitely worthwhile to give this vn a try.  The art style is excellent, and is quite more creative and cinematic than some budget vn where majority of the scenes are just a background image and two character sprites.  Music is atmospheric; it doesn’t stand in the way though does its job well to enhance the mood at key moments.Many may be concerned about reading only a starting excerpt of a story where the rest of chapters are confirmed canceled.  I had similar issues when I learned about the fate of the studio and this franchise… but don’t let that discourage you.  The current “episode” mostly is self-contained.  While it definitely points to continuation, I think the central plot is independent and doesn’t prevent readers to enjoy it just by itself.That being said, the only complain I really have is about the structure of this vn.  For this episode, there are at least two distinct endings (one is arguably a “better” ending than the other).  There is no way in the game to actually check how many endings there are and if they’ve been reached.  It is also not clear which of these two endings are “true” ending, and how they matter to the rest of the tale… mainly, I presume, due to unfortunate fact of the franchise’s cancellation.Final verdict: Add this game to your watchlist and buy it when it’s on any kind of discount.  Even though there is no sequel episodes, the story of Learning to Manage Chaos is quite entertaining, and along with the good art and bgm, it’s a 2-hour experience worth having.			"

												Dysfunctional Systems is a visual novel that tells of a story about individuals dealing with problems of other worlds. The protagonist, Winter, is one of such individuals - a mediator - who tries to keep a world in proper order. As with most visual novels, you direct Winter to decide on different choices presented throughout the game, ultimately deciding the story's ending.The story itself is a quick one, and I do wish it was a bit longer (a playthrough can be done within an hour or so, if you read through it quickly), though it's a bit understandable since this is the first episode in the series - there're a couple more episodes after this one, and I believe there's a prequel in the works as well (you can check out their website to find out more about them). Given the short story, there weren't really a lot of choices. I liked the plot and I'm quite eager to know how it turns out.The artwork and soundtrack are pretty good too - the visuals are drawn beautifully, and the soundtrack complements the various events in the game. Kudos for including the soundtrack along with the game and not as a separate purchase (I have it on my playlist to listen to on the go, loved the title theme song). It'd be a nice touch to have some character voices though, which should make it even more engaging.Overall, it's a pretty good title - it has an good and interesting storyline, but is rather short that it's like a teaser for the succeeding episodes. A bit pricey for the length of the story, though the inclusion of the soundtrack more or less offsets this point. Everything else is pretty good - 3.5 out of 5 stars for me.Postscript: Considering the story and all(and the fact that it has some kind of an anime opening sequence!), they should try producing an animation for this one after all the episodes have been released. It certainly has potential in my opinion - hope you can make it happen Dischan! =)			"

The themes spoken of are harsh and soberingly serious, just not what one would expect from a visual novel game. The whole concept of mediator institution promises even more goodness in the next episodes, which I will now look forward too.The soundtrack is great and does help the narrative rather effectively.I am pleasantly surprised and impressed by this one.

												+Beautiful artwork+Lovely soundtrack-Only one real decision-Only two endings-Awkward dialogueWhen I first started playing this game, I was very excited. I thought that it would be a very promising VN. The artwork was beautiful and the soundtrack was great. In fact, it has some of the best music for a VN (in my opinion).Unfortunately, those were the only good parts. The entire game only has one major decision. They don't even give you the illusion of autonomy by giving you useless choices that lead to the same path. For example, the game could have asked you whether you wanted to drink the beer or not, a pretty arbitrary choice. Instead, pretty much every choice is made for you. In addition, I didn't find the story to be very moving and the dialogue just seemed off. It's all just worded in a way that doesn't sound natural. To add insult to injury, there's only two endings, despite all of the branches in the one major decision.If you want a good VN, look elsewhere. Don't waste your cash to buy a few hours of poorly worded dialogue.			"

I honestly loved the story and love how it was handled from beginning to end. That alone should make me want to recommend it. However, the series was officially brought to a halt. Knowing there is no continuation of the series I am deeply saddened and it is because it is so good that I fear others suffering as I have, thus I am afraid to recommend it. I played this game, knowing the series was cancelled, but I love well done visual novels.

												Got to be honest here - I've only played a couple of visual novels, so I can't attest to how well-written this game is compared to the majority of them. I can, however, state that it does not live up to my expectations or the standards my previous experiences have set. First, terms. A visual novel is just what it sounds like: a game in which the gameplay is principally reading lines of text, and watching character portraits and backgrounds. Most visual novels allow the player to make choices that will change the outcome of different situations, and this game has those choices as well.In order to write a fair review, I played all routes of this game. The game's main problem is that it feels like it was written by either two people and only one of them knew how to write, or the one person who wrote it was a schizophrenic. Parts of the game are moderately well-written and feel natural when read, but other parts delve far enough into purple prose that it was a physical chore to sit through them. This trend continues in every route, and when the story/dialogue stops being melodramatic, it is boring. My advice is, don't buy this game if you're looking to try out a visual novel - it may turn you off of the genre completely.			"

EDIT: The game is now free on Dischan's site, due to their shutdown. If you want to play the game but don't have the money, you can get it there.Oh Dysfunctional Systems. I love it so. I'm kind of surprised I find myself writing a review for a VN, but this isn't your usual Ecchi bait ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that comes with friends who idle in it for 1000+ Hours YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE. But I feel it deserves this in light of recent events, so lets get down to it.Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to manage chaos (Or DysSys) is a Visual novel that focuses around a young Heroine named Winter Harrison, a ""Mediator"" in training. Mediators are effectively humans from an advanced world of technology, who utilize a codex bracelet and other variety of technology to cross into alternate worlds and dimensions. The goal of this? To act as a mediator. Their job is to find the main problem that causes the realm issue, and fix it. In any real means. In a way they are playing god, without really playing god.LtMC is effectively a prologue, and a bit EP 1 as well. In this you are currently in an otherwise dystopian modern-esque world with your mentor that you're shadowing named Cyrus. Who, for lack of a better word; is a bit of an ♥♥♥. Also a bit brash, and doesn't really have a moral standing at all. This naturally causes him to conflict a few times in the prologue with Winter - There is even a series of achievements you unlock depending on the outcome of a multi-choice argument.One way or another, things go wrong and Winter pays the price. I can't really say more as is; cause I care too much to mention spoilers. But here is one I will mention.The game's funding is out the window.DysSys was planned to have an Episode 0 - acting as a sort of prologue to the start of the whole plot and its own prologue to explain winter - as well as an EP 2 or 3, but a game selling at $5 each doesn't exactly go over well. They had a kickstarter, it got overfunded; we were all happy to receive. Unfortunately, improper management of money on Dischan's part sort of caused the project to fall onto it's face. This doesn't mean the game isn't gonna get its sequels, but it means its gonna be done on Voluntary time. Expect a few months, maybe late 2015 at this rate. Dischan has closed it's doors, so all production has ceased.Does that mean you should buy the game? Sure. Why not? If you have $5 to spend and there isn't anything else you could possibly spend it on, then go for it. If it's on sale though, I'd say shoot for it period. It has good art, good characters, fun dialogue, and the music is phenominal.I was never good with rating numbers, so I'll just leave it at the fact is: I liked it. That's really all I have to say on it.

												From the music to the artwork, the story to the characters, Dischan released one hell of a VN. Although short, this game was very immersive and felt quite polished for an episodic work. The story lasted only about an hour and a half on fast text speed (it would take a bit longer if you read at a slower pace), but it was a compelling and interesting idea about a futuristic society. What really caught me was the parallels between this game and Steins;Gate about the idea of time and space. The music was composed impeccably and every use of each song fit well with the events of the story. It's a great soundtrack to listen to as a standalone as well, and it is provided free, absolutely free, with the game in the game folder. Big props to CombatPlayer for their quality work.The artwork had a lot of detail and depicted each scene exquisitely, which really helped with putting yourself into the setting of the story. It also looks very cleanly and neatly done, with a nice mix of colors to please the eyes. Some quality VNs don't have the most impressive of artwork; however, this one won't let you down.Character development, although it throws you in somewhat quickly, is done rather well. You will get to know mainly three characters with the focus being on two of the tree - Winter and Cyrus. This episode follows them through a good 90% of the game, with Waverly (Winter's roommate) being introduced near the end, where episode 2 is supposed to begin. However, you get a good sense of Waverly at this point before episode 2. Other characters get introduced, but they only appear with very minor roles and nearly no detail about them - yet.I'd love to see the next episode of this series be released, and it was definitely worth the few bucks spent to enjoy the few hours of story and many hours of OST listening.

												Currently at the time I am posting this I have played through to one of the endings. Though short this game will be released episodically, and choices made will be reflected in later episodes. I am a fan of visual novels myself and this visual novel is incredibly thought provoking. (For those that do not know a visual novel is an entirely story driven ""game"", where the only gameplay is the decisions you make at key points in the story. Some visual novels have winding paths with multiple endings each that play on every single choice you make, which makes you feel like you are controlling the direction of the story.) This visual novel plays on the theme of morality, what is right and what is wrong, and gets you thinking about your position in all of it. When you're thrust into such a situation what will you do, how will you react. It plays on your emotions and uses them to form the path that you are making for yourself. This is one reason I love visual novels because even if you play through it only once, and don't want to witness alternate choices, you still get the story because YOU shaped it with all of the choices YOU made. All in all with the great soundtrack and interesting story, if you like heavily or entirely driven stories in games, this is a must buy ESPECIALLY if it's on sale.			"

Sure, I don't mean this is the only one, but it gets enough credit for conveying the idea CORRECTLY.However, the novel ends shortly (in some sort of cliffhanger)after the animated OP, being the 1st Episode. However it's stand-alone enough for people to enjoy and nothing within the game are left vague. The 2nd Episode still need a lot of time though.Plus, the music is amazing and the character designs are good.

												Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is the first installment of a multi-part visual novel series by Dischan, the same company that made Juniper's Knot. Dysfunctional Systems delves into the life of 14-year-old Winter Harrison, who is taking a course in mediation. She and her mentor Cyrus travel to a planet that is on the verge of civil war to attempt to calm things down. This being a visual novel, there are choices that you must make that affect your ending. Your choices are saved and will be carried into the following episodes of Dysfunctional Systems. The decisions are quite difficult to make, considering that they test your morality and your values as a person. Dysfunctional Systems is subtle in its humor, has well-developed characters and settings, and above all, has an amazing DnB soundtrack, available in the game directory in FLAC and MP3. I have played the first episode twice now, and I plan to play it many times over. I highly recommend it to both visual novel veterans and beginners.			"

												I've been waiting a while for this game when I saw the trailer dischan released, and I am not dissapointed. The story might start of slow at the start, but as it goes on, it gets better. It allows you to choose some of your actions, which will affect the story in some way. Another thing I love in this game is the art-style and the music, as they are both amazing(huh, sounds corny but eh)! Take note this IS a visual novel, and might not apeal to all people. If you're still unsure to buy this or not, you can try another one of dischan's visual novels; Junipers Knot, which is free to get in the ios store.			"

												This is a really great visual novel that really gets you invested in the story. The story is amazing, the characters are really interesting, the art style is great, and the dialogue is really good. I for one will be buying the rest of the episodes when they come out. It is a little short but that's only because it's episode 1. For a cheap scape like me, I don't know if I would pay 5 dollars for it, I personally bought it when it was on sale for 50% off, but if you really think about the original price it will eventually add up to the price of a normal game.

												I just bought this game and I'm glad I did. I wasn't aware that it was episodic, possibly because I didn't read the store page enough, but I actually don't mind all that much. It was a well contained story, with the obvious room for addition. However, the 'main' story was wrapped up nicely, with only questions to how it would continue rather than what happened left in my mind.They've recently had to put a hiatus on making the other episodes, and I can understand their decision. Visual novels aren't all that common, with the most promenant ones I can think of being Telltale's Wolf Amongst Us and The Walking Dead seasons, so it's not that difficult to realise that they didn't make enough money from their game sales. Japanese dating sims (being almost identical in structure, albeit not gameplay) have huge markets in their native country, and whilst fanbases for these games grow, there's still not a guarantee that the games will sell, and are left untranslated.They've said that when they get the funds they'll restart. Who knows when that will be is a valid question, but showing support by buying the first episode will at least make a start. Neither money nor time was wasted playing this game, and I hope that this announcement doesn't put other people off at least trying it.			"

												Dysfunctional Systems got everything a good Visual Novel needs. Awesome art, a very interesting story concept in a relatively fresh setting and 'out of the standard' characters. Your decisions got a nice impact on the story and your character. Additional to that you can transfer your decisions into later episodes of the game. That should allow your character 'personal touch' growth.All that sounds awesome, but there is a little throwback, because the game is only ~3 hours long of gameplay (even if you replay it with different decision making it won't get much longer, because you already know most of the dialogue) and the game only marks the starting point into the world. Hopefully the next episodes of this game will be a bit longer, because the time you have with this game is really worth the price, but more is always better.			"

												Visual novels!Learning to Manage Chaos is only the first chapter of Dysfunctional Systems. Because of that, it's not very long (you could easily get through both main routes in a day) and offers virtually no resolution or closure in order to set up future installments. If I had to pick one thing about the story to criticize, it would be that they really, REALLY emphasized how sheltered Winter's upbringing was. The story does, however, have a very interesting premise (complete with moral dilemmas, which is always nice), and I look foward to further exploring its universe.I think five bucks is a fair price, especially considering that the (great) soundtrack is included.

												Dysfunctional Systems is a visual novel with dialogue choices that affect your ending.  There is one ending to the first episode but your choice(s) during the half-way point affects all the dialogue in the entire second half, however, the main events still occur and you will feel as if your choice did not matter.  There's also no voices, which can be bad for people like me who have poor reading comprehension.  That's all the negative aspects out of the way.In DS, you will enjoy an extremely well-written script.  With a great deal of backstory and detail, the universe is very believable and makes it a pleasure to immerse yourself within the world and its inhabitants.  Even with my reading comprehension issues, I found myself focusing all my attention to understand the remarkably deep story.  The characters are interesting and complex to the point where you won't find any stereotypes that you may have grown accustomed to.  The art in its own merit may not stand out, but when coupled with many others of the same genre, it definitely rises up and stands out from the common crowd.  A lot of the music is forgettable, and you may not want to listen to it in your car or on an iPod.  But every track seems to harmonize with the story and situations on-screen.  The music is immensely atmospheric and envelops the reader in the narrative.The greatest strength in this story is the setting.  It is so very interesting that you will eat it up and ask for more.  I can only hope that development for the second episode will eventually begin so that this story can continue.			"

												An enjoyable first chapter in what has the potential to be a great science fiction tale. Dysfunctional Systems has great art, fantastic music, and a lot of subtle touches in movement, scrolling backgrounds, and lighting effects that spice up the text and (entirely non-voiced) dialogue.But be warned: if you're looking for a game, this is probably not what you want. Approach it like a comic book or novel and you'll enjoy it; treat it like a game and you'll be frustrated at the near-complete lack of interactivity.if you're looking for a full story, this is also not what you want. it takes maybe two hours to see both possible endings, both of which are very clearly designed to set the stage for further events.$5 seems, at first glance, to be a little pricey for two hours of mostly reading, but you also get the amazing soundtrack in both FLAC and MP3 formats with it. That makes the price perfectly acceptable, in my opinion.			"

												The fourth paragraph has spoilers, so watch out.Dysfunctional Systems is a virtual interactive story about a girl named Winter.  Winter is Shadowing, watching someone prefrom a mediation.  In these mediations, Winter is assigned a system that have some sort of problem, hence the name of the game.The mechanics and options allow for an automatic playthrough, meaning you can sit back and let the game hit next to show the rest of the story.  You can set how fast they display, and how fast they change in the options.  You can speed through the game as well.  The soundtrack is amazing as well.  There are 6 pages of ten save slots which allow all of the save games.  The game has two endings, both of which I have explored.  Unlike other interactive stories like The Walking Dead, these endings are totally diferent instead of how the same ending is slightly different.  Now, spoilers below, so if you want to play the game, finish the review HERE.     The game's climax is about how Cyrus went about fixing this system.  He wanted to kill the president of the system, and launch a nuclear missle.  The explanation is in the game, but he makes it seem  really  reasonable.  The problem is, the nuke became self sustaining and became a star and blew up the atmosphere, killing everyone. "

												A wonderful, creative visual novel with far more in the works, a beautiful set of art work, and some damn good concepts. The team comes from the people who created the Visual Novel ""Juniper's Knot"" which is freely available, and I would suggest you try that out to see their first, (if somewhat tiny) steps into the world of VNs they came into (though significantly shorter and far less well produced than this). If you like that, or any sci-fi visual novels, this is sure to be a treat, delivering both short bursts of light hearted humor and thick layers of rather dark concepts, settings, and events.			"

When I started the story I was hooked within the first five minutes, it took all my attention to the point that I beat the game multiple times in one sitting. It is a little short as it is took me 5 hours to complete it 100% and I am quite a slow reader. The story was fantastic and hoked me till then end... well ends. The music was just absolutely wonderful and fit very well into what was happening making me more submersed into the story. The art was not the greatest I have ever seen but it fit very well for the game.Unfortunately episode two is currently being held off as sales for this game were not very high. However the game ends in a non abruptly manor, it feels like it can end where it did but it makes you want more.			"

												I think my only complaint would be how short the game is. The entire game hinges on a VERY small set of decisions, and should be almost entirely viewed as a visual novel, more than an interactive one.That said, the story is wonderful. It quickly pulled me in, and easily kept my attention. And while the entire story, if I'd played out my first set of choices without any rethinking at all would have been short, it was definitely interesting to go back and see all of the consequeces for alternate paths, and look at the other courses that were available. The characters, though only allowing for a small amount of exposition in the space given, seemed very fully developed, and were consistent to their apparent personalities, without any seemingly random mood swings with no explanation.The plotline and setting itself were both very interesting, but there is definitely room to grow. For the amount of information that is presented, it could easily be expanded upon, even if only through secondary, non-essential entries in the game's codex, or information accessible through the main menu, but what is shown through the story is very entertaining. A powerful climax of the story, and... realistic, if not entirely satisfying ending following, result in a story that definitely makes me want to read further.			"

												After only playing through two endings, I can offically say this game is incredible!The storyline is well done and spread out wonderfully and the character development is very interesting through the playthrough. The main character Winter I had come to like as well through the gameplay even though at first I thought she was  a bit annoying. Cyrus, especially caused some mood swings from love to hate to love to depise to go die in a whole to I really like this guy. The flaw to the game is gameplay is incredibly limited. You only make one-five(depending on your decisions) choices in a thirty-a hour gameplay session. This however is pretty common in a visual novel game and overall just adding a few more choices like in dialouge would improve this. (consider that for chapter 2 and 3!) However, the music, story, and art all make up for this flaw. Actually, that is the only flaw in this game!Overall, the game is spectacular and well spent on if you love to read like myself and admire story, music, and art in a game.RatingGameplay-4/10Story- 10/10Music- 10/10Art-10/10One of the best games I played in a very long time!

												Dysfunctional Systems could be considered a game by some, but denied as one by others. It's a visual novel and you will be expected to read a lot as the narrative will be presented in such form for the majority of time you spend on this game.As the first visual novel I ever played, there was something that got me attached to this game. It might have been the beatiful soundtrack (that you receive for free as well), the eyecandy smooth stylization or the intelligent dialogue. You won't really handle everything thats thrown onto you at first, but you can always pause the game, re-read the log or do some research in the Codex. The story is intense and the fact that it is (sadly) very short, strenghtens the impression. Albeit heavily advertised, the decision making had not such a major impact as I came to expect, but you certainly felt relevant in that world. My biggest complaint has to be how the story has been cut out seemingly mid-air. I know, Dischan was working on a budget, but that doesn't justify the heavily inconclusive ending. I know that the series is episodic, but the ending was so sudden and the plotline so thin, I couln't help but desire more. And I hope I will get more. For merely 5 bucks, you get an unique experience hard to summarise in a few paragraphs. A story line making you feel the burden of responsibility. A immersive soundtrack that easily justifies its spot on your playlist. And last but not least, the gratitude of a small game company, that offered me subjects to think about. If you'd like to further support the small and humble dev team, you can do so on Kickstarter, but please be advised the video contains Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos Episode 1 SPOILERS.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dischan/dysfunctional-systems/ "

												As soon as I heard of this visual novel coming to Steam, I knew I had to try it out. The story is very interesting along with its unique characters, settings, choices, and music. This VN is about a girl named Winter that is a student mediator on a lesson with her superior; Cyrus. Dysfunctional Systems is nice visual novel with its striking appeal. There are some hints of humor and intense situations. I definitely recommend you try this out for yourself.			"

												Dysfunctional Systems got everything a good Visual Novel needs. Awesome art, a very interesting story concept in a relatively fresh setting and 'out of the standard' characters. Your decisions got a nice impact on the story and your character. Additional to that you can transfer your decisions into later episodes of the game. That should allow your character 'personal touch' growth.All that sounds awesome, but there is a little throwback, because the game is only ~3 hours long of gameplay (even if you replay it with different decision making it won't get much longer, because you already know most of the dialogue) and the game only marks the starting point into the world. Hopefully the next episodes of this game will be a bit longer, because the time you have with this game is really worth the price, but more is always better.			"

												Made by the developers of ""Junipers Knot,"" DS: LtMC is the first part of an episodic series of visual novels (pretty much a novel with backgrounds, music, and character sprites). While short, this VN more then makes up for this with an absolutely beautiful anime-esque art style, pleasant and fitting soundtrack, and smart writing of both the characters and overall story.If you're not a fan of VNs or sci-fi then you probably won't enjoy this as much as I did.I'd recommend this VN to anyone who is either already of fan of this style of story telling or is not as familiar with the genre and is looking for a place to start.

												Having very little experience with VNs (visual novels) I picked this game up on a whim. And what a good choice that was. I found the story very compelling and the music is phenomenal (After hearing the soundtrack I found the music alone to be worth the price of the VN).The game does restrict viewer choice, so don't expect to be making a lot of descisions. However, the few choices it does force you to make are very well thought out and genuinely difficult to make in a great way that gets you thinking. They also appear to be adding a lot more choice in the future episodes (currently on kickstarter till march 24th of 2014, so go back it if you have the disposable income as it is deserving of the support).The only major complaint is that the game is relatively short (roughly 2-3 hours long depending on how fast you go through things) and the ending isn't fully complete (the ending is not bad but it was still designed to be continued), however with the recent addition of the future episodes being added to kickstarter it seems that the story will get the continuation it deserved.If you aren't sure or are fairly new to visual novels I'd recommend checking out the developers free VN from their website (the VN is called Juniper's Knot) which should help you find out if the writing is something you like.Overall a great buy for the price if you're looking for a good story with good art and music supporting it. And while the descisions may be few, they are extremely good at making you think about them and second guessing yourself on what the best choice should be.			"

												An excellent VN that really tugs at the heartstrings, I enjoyed it so much that I completed the five hours or so of the first episode in one sitting. The first VN I ever played is Everlasting Summer, the second happens to be If MyHeart Had Wings, and while my time in them surpasses my playtime in this game I still found Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos to be much more enjoyable. The main character is absolutely adorable and oh so lovable, the world/setting your placed in is far from ordinary and probably something you've never expected before. For those who are fans of VN in general I daresay that your going to fall in love with this one as well, for newcomers beware that compared to most VN this one is quite short and will definitely leave you longing for more.

												Seen from its overall construction, Dysfunctional Systems wants to be respected and so it well earn my respect. Storywise, it can be seen that its creator spends much time crafting the world setting, it's interesting and mildly engaging me to find out more detail on world background. Also the art and music add to the atmosphere which shows that this game is made by so much care.For a visual novel that currently planning for episodic release, I saw this game as a proof of concept of the direction they want to take for their next installment. If they don't do anything wrong and stray from this direction, consider me sold for the next episodes.			"

An excelent VN with both an engaging plot, AND no explicit content. Sadly, there won't be a sequel considering it didn't sell well and has since been canceled.

												Dysfunctional Systems follows a fourteen-year-old mediator-in-training named Winter. A mediator's job is to travel to other planets and to balance the scale of order and chaos by whatever means necessary. Winter is shadowing a mediator, Cyrus, known for being cold and willing to kill in the blink of an eye. Assigned to the planet of Sule, their mission is to balance the scale.The game's art, from the start, is beautiful (I could stare at the menu for a long time). The characters are all well drawn and expressive. The story is written well and the characters' personalities really seal the deal and just pull you in. You can tell how Cyrus is from the art and his lines; he's cold, but also has a side that you don't hear being talked about. Winter is very expressive and idealistic, and it is easily conveyed to the reader. She's not just some random protag-kun, but she has her own personality, and it shows. The music fits perfectly with the setting, and the setting further immerses you and you can quickly get a good idea as to how everything is. The detail in your character's actions and movements has plenty of detail; it gives you enough to where you can picture exactly what's happening.By the end, I was dying for more. Sadly, I finished it in around three hours, give or take a few minutes depending on your choice. There is one choice you can make, but from my experience through the second playthrough, it changes the story line in many ways. Reading after the choice was completely different between option A and option B. It wasn't worlds-apart different, but you could definitely see the changes; I found this highly fascinating.I'm not a major reviewer, so I'd say the only con I could find was it's three-hour playtime, but I'd also say it's a pro because it readies you for more episodes and leaves you wanting more. This game was right up my alley, and I'm utterly excited for the rest of the episodes.			"

												The art was amazing, the music was amazing, the plot was amazing - I thoroughly enjoyed every single aspect of this game. The developers took extra care to create an immersive setting with many overarching themes that allow the reader's mind to wander, even going a step further -  making the reader question him/herself and what he or she would have done in the same situation. My only complaint is that it was extremely short, but VERY worth the five dollars that it costs. The decisions you make really do matter - episode two will most likely be very different depending on what choices you made in the game. All in all, I strongly recommend this game, if not for the plot then for the AMAZING soundtrack.			"

												A thoughtful visual novel (with a couple of un/branching choice points) about social and political conflict and how a couple of Utopian trans-dimensional travelers attempt to resolve (or make it worse). Expect little gameplay and plenty of reading, but also some well done visual and musical vignettes. Unfortunately, once you do the main path, the other choices offer little replay-ability or meaningful content aside from getting the odd achievements. Developer Deschan promised additional episodes in this series, which hopefully will further flesh out the title's world and characters. Until then, I would avoid a full price purchase unless you are a big fan of the genre. 3/5			"

												Many negative reviews stem from the fact that Dischan Media shut down before this series finished. While it is a disappointment, there are plans to bring back the company. It's slow progress, but there is hope.As for the game itself, it is definitely worth the full price tag. Episode 1 can be considered a short narrative without other episodes, with multiple endings, great art, and enrapturing music. It presents a fictional universe and direction that may remind you of the Pendragon books.			"

												Sounds catchy:""Dysfunctional Systems: Act I Learning to Manage Chaos"".The tittle itself was enough to make me buy it on a sale. Now, before giving you my honest opinion, I do want to point out that I'm not that big of a fan of Visual Novels and I don't consider the genre to be game-like  at all. However I did stumble across few other novels in the past like: Bionic Heart and Katawa Shoujo (both are great reading/watching material) so I have the basic idea of what to expect of a creation of an art like this.I have to say this novel is one of a kind. Where in Bionic Heart and Katawa Shoujo my curiosity was sparked by intresting characters and by deeply emotional dialogs and decisions this one fascinates me by it's intelligent plot and setting. Don't get me wrong, the art and the writting are both wonderfully done, but when the story of  an animated novel partially involves political dilemmas with scientific theories and forces it's heroes to solve problems BEYOND global scale - now that's something you can't forget easily. Unfortunatly, as many of you already know this piece of genre fiction is short as hell, but the idea of multiple playthroughs will be tempting once you've finished it.With that said I think that Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is a must buy for every Visual Novel enthusiast considering it's low price and the top-notch soundtrack that comes along. And I still highly recommend it to everybody who's up for some casual reading from time to time.I'm realy looking forward to the second chapter of Dysfunctional Systems, if it's ever going to happen.

												Throughout the entire playthrough I was only given the option to make one decision. One. In an hour and a half. And apparently it was the wrong one which was spoiled for me immediately based on the condescending achievement it unlocked. Beyond the lack of any actual gameplay in this game, I can't even recommend it as a visual novel. It's got lazy artwork, There were only a handful of backgrounds used, only 5 characters drawn (a few others had lines but the conversations took place out in a hall or something so you are left staring at an empty background for 10 minutes).The 'animation' was nothing more than moving static images around a few pixels. The entire thing just screamed 'LAZY'. I don't understand all the good reviews this has been getting. Have those reviewers never read a real book or played a game where they had meaningful decisions?I think I paid $5 for this garbage. If I knew what I was getting I wouldn't have paid anything for it. But even if you are REALLY into crappy visual novels with stupid teenager angsty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I don't think you should pay more than $0.25 for something this weak.			"

												Typically I would not go out of my way to give a bad review to a game, but I feel like this game warrants a special exception.Before I go on, allow me to summarise.The up-sides: - The artwork is excellent. - The soundtrack is excellent. - The story is excellent.The down-sides: - The game sucks.The game is two hours long and is rife with critical flaws. Returning to this page, it's evident to me that Dischan Media put more effort into their Teaser video than the actual video game.The artwork, while very good - is far too sparse to express the story in any meaningful way.Take-away: Draw some more damn pictures and use them to express your story. What you've done is not good enough.The soundtrack, is excellent - but there are not enough sound effects to express the story either. Fix it.Take-away: Not everything is about music.The story is great - but the writing is too lavish and the visual presentation is sub-par.Take-away: If you want to write a novel, write a damn novel. This is a different visual medium for delivery and it has different rules! You should colour your text to express different characters. You should use unique typefaces to express the difference between character thoughts and dialog IF NECESSARY. Dialogue should ALWAYS be a priority and it should always be straight to the point.The game is terrible.This is not a game. There was one single decision tree point with a handful of questions merely seconds apart. I don't know what you were thinking. You need to space this out throughout the game, peaks and troughs - study Mass Effect and The Walking Dead. Test this on people and beware of decision fatigue vs. reading fatigue. Make choices APPEAR meaningful, even if they're not. Be really selective about writing choice breakers into your story! This is exceptionally frustrating!			"

												A visual-novel with an interesting story concept, but suffering from a rather poor execution.The overall pacing is the game's weak point. The early part drags on unnecessarily, the setting isn't very well established, and when things finally start to escalate the episode suddenly ends. And even then, the events that follow the big ""climax"" don't seem to convey any kind of drama or consequence, but instead try to be humorous, for whatever reason. As if different parts of the story were written by different people. Not to mention, some parts of the game feature some disturbing and really forced ""fanservice"" that is really out of place.Still, I can't say I disliked the game. The art style and the music are definitely its strong point. And once things started to escalate I was intrigued and enjoyed the plot and its characters, and I'd like to know how things go from there. If the developers can focus more on the world, work on the pacing, and tone down with the fanservice in the second episode, then I think I'll give it a go. As it is though, it's ""only"" an unfinished visual-novel with no actual gameplay to speak of.			"

												I'm not one to write long reviews so heres hoping that this one won't be. I recently completed this game and unlocked every achievement for it aswell so believe that I have fully experienced what this game has to offer. Anyways, this game might seem like your typical anime romance visual novel that so many of us have experienced but the moment you start the story you realise it's nothing of the sort. It is a rather short game(good thing it's only $4.99) but it delivers one of the best stories I have ever experienced in gaming. You will go through a range of emotions when playing this game, but not from silly romance or some teenage ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but rather from the conflicts of genocide and nuclear war. The game boasts that is like a ""choose your own adventure book"" but it does have as many choices as they do. Although there is about 500 different sets of choices you can make they really only funnel into a couple outcomes. The soundtrack that this game offers is very enjoyable and it comes free with the purchase. The art style is nice to look at and I feel it meshed perfectly with the overall plot. In conclusion:Gameplay-9/10 (too few outcomes)Art style-10/10Realism-10/10Soundtrack-8-10Should you buy it?Considering the price and the experience this game offers you would be foolish to not give this one a go!

												I wanted to like this game. I went into it knowing the series had been cancelled after being drawn in by the amazing soundtrack, and in that I wasn't disappointed. The game has, essentially, one single point of interaction, and the rest is wading through surprisingly poor writing and skeevy sexualisation of 14 year olds. This is really escalated through the epilogue, and the eventual reward art for completing the game. I take comfort in the fact that my $5 is probably funding someone else's refund, but I regret buying this game, as cheap as it was. Listen to the soundtrack on youtube, watch the really nicely animated intro, and avoid the bad writing / gross ending. There are other, far better visual novels that won't make you feel like a creep.			"

												Although short, if you like VN's at all I definitely recommend it. I liked this more than Analogue mainly because the story and characters were a lot easier to follow. Buy it and maybe they will continue the series, I would love to know what would happen next - and that should tell you that it's worth the investment (a small one) as well.			"

												I can't say I would recommend this visual novel. It takes some time for the story to actually get interesting and when it does, the story is unsatisfyingly concluded not too long after, even if it's suppose to be 'episode 1'. There's not much choice in having the visual novel end in a different way as all the choices apparently have the same end but if you're more interested in the story than choices or interaction then this probably won't affect you. The characters in the story aren't really interesting at all, and can make the visual novel feel dull at times. I really would not expect someone to say they had a favorite character. The story can be completed in 1.5-2.0 hours on average on the first play through, which isn't so bad for $5.00 but when completing the story, you should be aware that they are other persons who have done a fairly better job, in my opinion, free of charge.On the upside, I really love the artwork and as for the music I found myself listening to the title menu's soundtrack every time I went to play the visual novel, which make the free included soundtracks a cool bonus. Good art, good music, and somewhat interesting story but the overall VN falls short at truly amazing you.I personally think I could've saved my money for something else. If the other episodes turn out similarly like this in terms of how the this one ended, it would be best to just wait until all the episodes are complied into one and see what the verdict is. You would save yourself the extra money.			"

												This is the type of 'game' where it is conceptually good, but lacks substance and execution to deliver upon its promise. Also, it is more of a hybrid audiovisual book than a game. The main problem here is that the story is boring, and the exposition is mid-numbingly banal. For a title that does not have gameplay and instead is relying upon storyline and exposition for its driving force, that might be considered a bit of a problem. I cannot recommend the project, but I heartily endorse the concept. [ 4 / 10 ]			"

												Beautiful artwork, fun interactions, an intriguing setting, immersive soundtrack, and nifty extras.- Beautiful artwork - these aren't the usual visual novel place and express.  Instead of the clear-cut lines and cel-shading that I normally see, the sprites and the background are in a nicely arranged watercolor.  I'm reminded of Little Witch's art style.  You also have some thoughtful animations like the walking scene.- Fun interactions - remember the screenshot where Winter is punching the guy?  You get more than that right up to the climax of this episode.- Intriguing setting - Think of Sliders, but with a different mission.  Now they have to mediate the conflicts, and there isn't one way to do it.  And fantasy is just as possible as sci-fi.  And, the first episode has a surprising climax that I had suspected but did not completely realize.- Immersive soundtrack - the song playing on the title screen has already pulled my attention.  Did I mention that the soundtrack is included with the game?  Just look in the steamapps\common\DysfunctionalSystemsEpisode1\Learning To Manage Chaos OST.- Nifty extras - I think these were immediately available, but you can see fanart in the extras menu.			"

												The first episode of three(at least at the time of writing this review), Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is a dream come true to those who wanted more depth from their visual novels.I'd describe the 'depth' I perceived in the title this way; first of all, the characters are NOT one-dimensional. They ACTUALLY felt like proper people to me. This cannot be said for all visual novels, though there are always some that are phenomenal(peopel who play them know what I am talking about). Anyway, I won't expand on the characters more than by saying that the vibe of them being like 'real people' really made this story for me....Along with the premise. Goodness. The premise is what really carries the game, along with the characters. Basically(without spoiling anything else than what is apparent from the very start), your character is a mediator; a person who manages difficult conflicts in different worlds. She, as well as you, as the reader, struggles with some of the concepts of mediating, but - once again, like you - she grows to understand and realize the deeper meanings of her job.I appreciated this story both as a writer and as a gamer. Obviously, there's still words to be said for the music and stuff, but I'll summarize it by saying that there's more life and energy in this visual novel, than in some high-profile one's I've played. And I can definitely say this is one of the better VN experiences I've had during this year(and, for comparison's sake, I'm gonna state that I am playing Danganronpa at the moment... And I like this slightly more. Just a personal preference, though).Anyway... As another person on the internet who REALLY appreciates good stuff, I implore other Visual Novel gamers to look into this three-episode title. And, if you like it, consider backing the kickstarter for the second and third episode(as of today, the kickstarter has 9-10 days left, and has gathered two thirds of the money needed for making the sequel episodes).

												First off let's get the music out of the way. Excellent, quickly became one of my favorite soundtracks. The characters were consistent, though I may have disliked the protagonists personality it was a dislike of ""Yeah, I know someone like that."" The art doesn't detract from the game and even enhances it in key points throughout. Now for the downsides. The game is excrutiatingly short, and it is extended to just below reasonable by the slow text boxes. Seriously I feel the transistions and text alone double the game time. The choices are few within the game, I can say I don't have a lot of VN experience but I would've expected more than 2 real interactive dialog points. Even at a low price of $5 it still seems like you aren't getting the full value per dollar. The seemingly branching path does add some replay value but using a save is much easier than wading through the text wall that leads up to the 3-5 questions as nothing mentioned is necessary or even relevant to your responses.The game appears to be setting up for a much larger sequel and that may or may not pend on the success of this one.I enjoyed the game but I hope you understand the true length of this game is a mere 2-3 hours if you read all of the text.

												As someone who has played Visual Novels such as Analogue: A Hate Story (which was really good), I am happy to say that Dysfunctional Systems is just as good, but, obviously, has different gameplay for its visual novels. A lot of the gameplay centers on the dialogue options as these also contribute to the endings you get. Note, the closest thing to a ""bad ending"" in the game is one that basically limits your dialogue options immensely. So, if you get that ending, don't let the lack of options give you a bad impression of the game. The stroy itself is great. Dialogue is great. The art looks really nice.

												The story centers around a mentor and a protégé, and their mission is to go around worlds to prevent catastrophic crisis.  At first, It does sound quite interesting and somewhat unique background setting for a story.  But I was disappointed, nothing seems to get it right in this game.I have played some visual novels before, and I know it's mostly like reading a book with some interaction.  For this type of visual novel, if it doesn't have a good and interesting story; it is vital that they have at least something that can make us like the game, i.e., likeable characters, nice artwork, or even just decent voice acting.   Unfortunately, it has none of that.  Everything seems so dull, and the game doesn't even have dubbed voices.Even with just a handful of characters in this story, I find none of them likeable.  Basically we have this clueless protégé and a cynical mentor.  The mentor seems to have a dark past, but lack of proper character development for us to really empathize with him.This game does give the player choices at different point in the game, so you can get somewhat different endings; that's probably the only good thing about this game.  But to get to those turning point choices, you'd have to do a lot of saving and reloading.  And you probably have to start from the start at least once, and choose skipping text till the point they have those choices.

The developers run out of Money before they could finish the other one. - maybe in the future.. they had a kickstarter campaign - yet canceled it even though they had the goal reached in order to make a new project firstIn the Story you play Winter a 14 Year old Girl that just got a job at a society that warps through the Worlds and tries to manage the Chaos that comes to the Worlds.Just after finishing your first World where Winter managed a serius environmental problem, she sides up with a new mentor.What will happen to the World? Will you manage to save it? What is the Chaos in the new World?  Will Winter drink Alcohol her first time and how will she like it? Does God exist? Will it contain Eroge szenes with Santaclaus and Rudolf? Is Winter realy a girl? How many Nations exist in the new World?Some of those answers you have to find out by playing this game, others are just sh*tstorming in a Review. : POne playthrough takes about 2-3 hours. Fast and english native readers might also finish it in a bit less than 2 hours.The game has 2 primary endings and for all the achievements you have to play the game 6 times.

This game, is a Visual Novel. Something that not a lot of people like. Only very few non-Japan enthusiasts or non-otakus will take a look into the genre. That's why it needs to be a good one.Developed by Dischan Media. This is one of the only few Visual Novels in Steam, and it's good at what it does, especially considering it's Western-made. It has a good soundtrack, excellent story, and a very familiar art style for me.With the familiar art style being said, the game has a similar art style to Juniper's Knot. Another Visual Novel I downloaded on the iOS and eventually Windows, which is about a Demon Girl(IIRC) and a Young Boy. It is highly praised in the iOS for it's plot, and to my surprise, Dysfunctional Systems is also developed by the same people who made Juniper's Knot. Unlike Juniper's Knot, which is mostly just a Visual Novel at itself, this game has some interactivity, with some sorts of political and moral decisions, which are dialogue choices.I would recommend this to people who has some experience to Visual Novels, as it has a lot of reading involved and some various decision makings.With this, I look forward more from the game, and cannot wait for Episode 2 of this.

But, around the time I started to play a huge fiasco occured in the company, which eventually collapsed. That means this story will never be finished. If you really want something from this company worth playing, then look into their free Visual Novel that has a short finished story that it tells to completion.

												I knew I was getting myself into a game with a ton of cutscenes, I was expecting that. However, I was also expecting that these cut scenes would be vital to get information, so that I could make informed decisions later on. Then I discovered that there's really only two decisions to be made, maybe 3. If you're lucky, and choose the right path, you get to choose a little of your own dialouge. This is a story game. Like a choose your own adventure, except without the ""choose"" bit.			"

												""Learning to Manage Chaos"" is a beautiful, thoughtful first entry to the Dysfunctional Systems series. When I first played, I was disappointed in its brevity, but as I investigated the upcoming second episode I became more excited about this series and now I see ""Learning to Manage Chaos"" as a lovely short introduction to the world of Dysfunctional Systems.

												[EDIT; 19 March 2015] I've recently discovered the the company Dischan, that made the game, has effectively ceased to work on this game. I still recommend it, however. It's a great little thing to have, and the music is very nice.I enjoyed this quite a bit, and was dissapointed to find it was rather short. Might have been the way I played it, though, I understand there are some more options than the ones I found.It felt quite fun to play, very immersive. If you're more of a book reader than an action packed gamer, this is a good option, I assure you.If you're wondering about the second episode, I did some research and found this page;https://dischan.co/blog/2014/11/dysfunctional-systems-update-the-prequel-approaches/Looks like the next episode will come out next year in Feb. I hope it helps others when they look at the game and wonder if it's still being developed			"

												What started with a lot of promise ended with a, although clearly inevitable, screeching halt.This game(more suitably labeled ""prologue"" or ""teaser"") was an over-ambitious attempt by Dischan to develop a quality VN. What was meant to eventually become a small series of games ended up falling apart after the development team encountered many mistakes and eventually ran out of funding.Backstory aside - this teaser is amateurish. It is clear the people who made it are new to the field - the choices are somewhat senseless and the writing is sometimes resembling more of fanfiction than a novella. It is these faults that made it clear chances are you will not see the ending of this series.Which is, despite the aforementioned, a shame. It is clear that there is talent within enough of the dev team to strike a chord with the player. The art is fantastic, the soundtrack is really good, and even within such a short time(I'd say 2-3 hours for the average person to complete) you connect with the environment and the characters - even if only a little.So, instead of rambling on even more, I'll just summarize this teaser with pros/cons:Pros:+Great soundtrack+Good character design+Simple yet beautiful UI+CG artwork is fantastic+A story that is both novel yet easy to get into+Although developed using the Ren'Py engine, it looks and feels like a VN environment built professionally rather than using default, overused elements.Cons:-Teaser, ends on somewhat of a cliffhanger-Discontinued development-Writing is very hit-n-miss-Most choices feel pointless and petty-Only 2 ""endings""(the rest of the variation is varying dialogue awarding achievements)Do I recommend this game? Yes. It does have some depth, and it's worth it even if only for the score and artwork. However, if you're the person who can't handle an incomplete story or hobbyist-like writing - there are much better suited VNs for you on Steam.			"

												The first installment of Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is, when taken as a whole, a very solid experience.  The art and music are well crafted at pretty much every juncture, and the story picks up a lot after the first half hour.  It does however, stumble a little bit coming out of the gate.  Initially, the game's protagonist, Winter Harrison, comes across as both incredibly naïve and needlessly childish for a 14 year old.  This, along with the weird, veiled flirting that seems to pass between Winter and her mentor, Cyrus, felt very inauthentic and made me cringe more than a couple of times.  To the game’s credit though, as the story progresses into the climax and the extended epilogue, the dialogue improves substantially, becoming far more naturalistic and believable. Despite some problems with characterization and dialogue, the story of Learning to Manage Chaos really delivers by developing a strong, tight plotline.  Everything that happens feels like it occurs as a very natural consequence of the events that happened in previous scenes, and the events culminate in a pretty exciting finale.  The climax may feel like it came from out of left field to those who didn't take the time to read through the provided codex, but given how interesting most of the entries are, I don’t think any blame for this lies with the developer.Some final notes to keep in mind.  This story is short, probably only an hour and a half or two in length, depending on how fast you rush through it and there’s not much in the way of replay value.  Most of the choices come in rapid fire right before the story’s finale.  If you're not the type who’s willing to shell out a few bucks for only a couple of hours of entertainment, definitely look elsewhere.  I'll also say that there are points where it feels like some corners were cut.  For example, the epilogue, which makes up maybe a quarter or so of the story's running time, is shot from a single point of view, showing only Winter and her roommate.  This wouldn't necessarily be a problem, however it’s very noticeable when three people come to the room, and all three remain distinctly off screen.  This isn’t a sticking point for me, nothing else about the game looks or feels cheap and I know that it can be tough balancing your budget as small developer, but it is something I’d keep in mind.Overall, I’d definitely say dive in.  It’s a fun little Visual Novel with a pretty nifty science fiction premise and nice, well-paced plot.  Thumbs Up.			"

												Immediately drawn to this game because of its art style. The game's story was rather solid, and its only drawback comes from a technical drawback in the dialogue, where Cyrus and Winter at times discuss things they should both know, and it comes off as a cheap way to explain to the audience. Beyond that, super enjoyable. No flaws. I'll be playing the alternate scenario(s) for sure and look forward to future episodes! Get a hold of this game.			"

												Dysfunctional Systems is a visual novel series featuring Winter Harrison, a student mediator from a utopian world. What is a mediator? A mediator is someone who travels to chaotic worlds, attempting to resolve the issues plaguing them. The story follows Winter with her mentor Cyrus Addington to a world that has an issue that needs to be resolved.The novel has beautiful art style mixed with choose your own adventure and music that fits with the story and situation. The story itself is worthwhile, something that you wouldn't get bored of.Dysfunctional Systems is a well made visual novel that should be noted. I say it's just like buying a good novel in a bookstore for just 4,99€. You could buy two chips bags with that. I would say, buy it if you feel like reading a good story or something out of the ordinary. Or, if you don't want to spend money, you can always play a free visual novel from the same team. it's called Juniper’s Knot and it's on there official website.Good story, good music and wonderful art style.

												Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is the first episode in a longer series. The story has plenty of set up, but not as much action, and when you feel like you're getting somewhere, it ends. The achievements are quite easy to accomplish, the art is good, and the story is great. Dialogue is a little slow, but fits the overall mood of the story. If you like visual novels, you'll probably like this one too, although there weren't enough options for me to truly enjoy it. I like the ""choose your own"" adventure games, but here you only get to make a choice once, and apart from that, you click your way through the game.			"

An excellent, but small cast of characters and an expansive world, you will find yourself revelling in all this game has to offer. I, myself am a fast reader and managed to complete the main story arc(s) rather quickly, but there are some minor achievements for you to hunt down too. The characters are well written, and complex. The game ends on a final note, but leaves it open for the next chapter. Overall, the devs did this game right, and in the future I hope it will continue.			"

												This is a game that is, without a doubt, mediocre. Not simply because it was bad but because we have to currently view this game in isolation to the rest of the series. Dysfunctional Systems looks from the outset to be an ambitious project from a group that although experience have yet to release a full fledged commercial game. Dischan as a group has its potential but that potential was not fully realised here. the limited space here certainly contributed to that feeling of mediocrity. Taken part by part, the game excells, the writing was fluent and natural as well as good artwork and a suitable soundtrack. However due to its relatively short play time (2 hours in my case) it lacks a natural conclusion that would make this game excellent. This game can only be considered good when the sequel/ subsequent episodes come out and true judgement can only be made then on the series itself.Then again, if you are a fan of visual novels and have enjoyed Dischan's previous game Juniper's Knot this game is for you.TLDR: Not for everyone. Needs episode 2 to be better. Otherwise solid overall.			"

												Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is the first episode in a longer series. The story has plenty of set up, but not as much action, and when you feel like you're getting somewhere, it ends. The achievements are quite easy to accomplish, the art is good, and the story is great. Dialogue is a little slow, but fits the overall mood of the story. If you like visual novels, you'll probably like this one too, although there weren't enough options for me to truly enjoy it.

I havent actually played it for 70 minutes, I just accidently left the window open while doing other things. I also have the game on my Ipad.

While this ""game"" is fairly short, it provides a method for you to save a finished game as a ""profile"" for when the next episode comes out. Then you deal with the consequences of your decisions of your playthroughs. I also really enjoyed the non-linearity of the storyline (as there are multiple endings). Please try this!

												If you're already a fan of Visual Novels, then I recommend this game for you. If you have yet to play one, or are interested, this is also a great one to start off with. An excellent, but small cast of characters and an expansive world, you will find yourself revelling in all this game has to offer. I, myself am a fast reader and managed to complete the main story arc(s) rather quickly, but there are some minor achievements for you to hunt down too. The characters are well written, and complex. The game ends on a final note, but leaves it open for the next chapter. Overall, the devs did this game right, and in the future I hope it will continue.			"

I can't wait to play more of Dysfunctional Systems as it is released and in the meantime I intend to read Junipors Knot by the same developers.

												My first time playing through a visual novel so it was a bit hard to get into at first however once you get used to reading pages upon pages of text you will soon get used it. The story is entertaining and the art is just as good. It has a set of brilliant sound tracks which it plays at certain parts of the story to set the mood and the interface looks brilliant and does the job well.However there are one or two problems I have with the game. The art is amazing but unfortunately images are re-used over and over again and it only runs at a maximum resolution of 720p. The story is also rather short but considering this is an episodic series I can forgive that. The main problem I have with this is the lack of decisions there are to make and I fell it would have greatly benefited from more user interaction as most of it is just clicking to get to the next sentence.I did enjoy my play through of this title and will more than likely get episode 2 once it has been released.

												Beautiful in visuals, music, and story.  It's breathtaking and tugs at your heart strings.  But before you jump into this, I highly suggest you go to Dischan's web page and try out Juniper's Knot.  It's equally as wonderful, only it's shorter and free.  It will help you find out if this type of game is really for you.  However, unlike Juniper's Knot, in this game you actually interact and pick your own path.  Not large scale decisions, but enough to get you more absorbed.  I imagine that there might be more to the interacting once the remaining installments are added.The only thing that could possibly make this any more enjoyable, would for there to be Steam trading cards.  Because I'd love to have more art from this game within my possession.  Other than that, I love everything about this game and so far, everything from Dischan Media.			"

Most importantly, the story was excellent and I've since completed both key storylines and all of the different major decision routes because it was so enjoyable! The artwork was top notch, the music was excellent throughout. All the extra art work and jukebox that come bundled in with it were also a great touches. Would strongly recommend for quite a different experience to the standard Indie offerings on Steam. Would happily have paid significantly more for this, a nice hybrid of books and gaming into a more dynamic experience than a book can provide whilst retaining a level of interractivity that only ""gaming can offer"". 10/10 - can't wait for the next part of the story and will definitely have to help the crowd funding project I've just read about!

												Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is a short visual novel (VN) that takes about 2 hours to complete. If you're here, you probably know about VNs and you should skip this paragraph. However, for those who haven't experienced them before, VNs are best described as a mixture of novels, comics/manga, anime and artwork all in one. VNs are essentially what you get when you remove virtually everything and focus a ""game"" on one aspect and one aspect only: story (with artwork and music enhancing the experience), in hopes that it will carry the entire product. Needless to say, what you get out the end is usually a story that is very good, with brilliant artwork and excellent music. VNs often feature several choices that offer alternative dialogue and different endings.Now that that's said, let's take a look at Dysfunction Systems: Episode 1. Episode 1 is only about 2 hours long, and the other two episodes are having their funds raised on Kickstarter. Don't let that put you off, however, as Episode 1 is still a full experience in its own right. DS is a VN, so of course the main thing is story, right? On this aspect, DS passes with flying colours. The setting is immediately interesting and the two main characters are defined and interact quite well. For obvious reasons, unlike most VNs (which often feature a long, comedic ""common route"" before a tear-inducing ""true route""), DS gets to the point quickly and effectively. The length of this VN doesn't allow for much ""fluff"", and indeed the plot progresses quite smoothly, quickly leading to the climax and an ""epilogue"" of sorts which serves to lead into the future episodes. More specifically, the plot follows Winter Harrison, a mediator-in-training, and her mentor Cyrus Addington. The job of mediators is to travel (warp?) to a world and attempt to resolve any tensions they may have, be they environmental or political. Clearly, these ""mediations"" are dealing with fragile situations, and sometimes the best course of action isn't obvious. Mediators have to use their best judgment, which may or may not go according to plan.Now, onto the music and artwork. I don't need to say much, as both are brilliant. The menu music, in particular, is possibly the best piece of menu- actually, scratch that- background music I've ever heard. Take a listen to ""Terminus"" on their Kickstarter page: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dischan/dysfunctional-systemsYou won't even want to start the game because this is playing in the menu. Characters and backdrops have a very interesting soft, hand-drawn look to them, which is quite rare in VNs. The menu style and overall aesthetic of the game also looks very nice, with a touch of minimalism which makes the sci-fi feel that much better.A short paragraph to those who are VN veterans, and want to see how this game lines up with others in its category: DS is a bit like Planetarian mixed with Steins;Gate. Here you won't find the same level of despair as Muv-luv, the world-shattering secrets of Little Busters, or the epicness of Fate. But for something able to be completed in 2 hours, it is definitely a memorable story, and without the need to go through hours and hours or what may be a mundane common route. So, to sum it all up, Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is a short game with no gameplay. But what it lacks in action and shooting, it makes up for many times over with its story, music and artwork. Give it a try for a few dollars; you won't be disappointed, VN player or otherwise.			"

												Well, I've had some time to digest what happened in this game. I did both Cyrus' and Winter's conclusions, so I feel qualified to talk about this instead of saying something stupid like ""hurr Winter is my waifu"" or whatever passes for humor. Since I'll be talking about how the plot progresses, there's going to be spoilers. Though if you're seriously reading the reviews for a VN where the writing's the most important part, then the tl;dr for you is that it's a good story for what's basically the set-up to something larger.The writing is good for this type of story where there's shifting between worlds as they are. Winter and Cyrus are clearly human but they come from a world much more different than our own. For instance, their form of government suggests that a group of people are in control of their entire world and what they do. Waverly's references to ""foreign"" literature (as in, from other worlds), as well as their accents, suggests that their standards of writing and academics, among other things, are something completely different than what we are used to. Their level of technology is also beyond that of our own, what with the instant-teleportation devices, access to a virtually limitless inventory, and drugs that can completely flush out radiation sickness within a day. It's a world close enough to ours so that we can relate to it but far enough thanks to the way the characters act about various things.Winter is believable as a teenager: She objects to alcohol, she knows when something is completely out of her depth (be it because she wasn't properly paying attention or because she simply wasn't taught about it), and she possesses the ability to rebel against authority to a point. Her life circumstances are also something some readers may be familiar with w/r/t her parents and how they had an impact on her life (her reaction to the suggestion to drinking due to the suggestion that her mother is an alcoholic and her tendency to avoid really vulgar language thanks to her father).Cyrus is a bit of a punk, even though his intentions are good: He's the one who comes up with the plan to kill the president and the one who pushes Winter into situations under the pretenses of preparing her for this line of work (such as pushing her to drink). He also is patient, but persistant, to a fault, and he'll even concede on his viewpoint provided that the alternative can achieve a better result. After all, the point of what he and his comrades are doing as mediators is to maintain a level of order in worlds that, without their intervention, would fall apart. However, according to what Winter has found out from her classmates, and what Winter will find out should she not stop him, Cyrus is rather cold and merciless and willing to do anything up to and including murder people in order to achieve the best possible result.Which brings up the paths of the game. The end result is the same, which is that the world the two were trying to save ultimately dies thanks to circumstances neither could possibly predict. If Cyrus' plan is carried out (that is, kill the president), the president leaves behind a dying message and informs everyone that the nuclear bomb has already launched at their enemy and to prepare for war. This is pointless on his part as the bomb causes a reaction that ends up burning the atmosphere and killing everyone. Winter feels extreme guilt at being unable to stop Cyrus and prevent him so that they could try finding another way. Cyrus is now in trouble for his rash actions, which makes his current reputation among his peers even worse.If Winter's plan is carried out instead (don't kill the president but suggest to simply detonate the bomb away from the mainland as a showing of power or even come up with a new plan entirely), the end result is that, thanks to the fact they haven't done the proper testing, the atmosphere ends up burned again and everyone dies. (As an aside, that's the reason for both outcomes: Lack of testing due to not wanting to blow their cover.) The two try to teleport to the president's office before the bomb is launched to stop him, but he's already gone and the bomb has already detonated. The shockwave destroys a large window and Cyrus has to shield Winter in order to protect her from the falling glass. Now instead of feeling guilt for not stopping Cyrus from committing murder, Winter feels guilt for having indirectly doomed an entire world.The epilogue also changes depending on whose plan went through. If Cyrus' plan was the one, he lands in serious trouble with his peers, Winter ends up hating him, and Waverly (Winter's roommate) has to deal with a classmate who wants to see her as well as her former mentor with a collegue, and even Cyrus himself. She is also not as close with attending Winter's illness as she is if Winter's plan was the one. Speaking of that plan, the other changes are a more vulgar classmate wanting to see her, the fact that Cyrus got wounded (broken glass is not something to screw around with), and the potential consequence of Winter's actions affecting her future as a mediator.The other parts of this visual novel (the art and music) are pretty good. The music gives off a sci-fi feel, with the proper songs playing during the proper parts (tense music for tense scenes, for example). The art makes the faces and poses expressive, which is important for conveying the moods that the script is claiming at that time. As they are, they compliment the game nicely.All in all, the game's good and I recommend playing both main sides of the story to experience it as it should be.			"

												TL;DR: I liked it. 9.3/10. Let's get ourselves a follow-up!In all honesty, I loved this game. If you are in any way familiar with Dischan's free visual novel, ""Juniper's Knot,"" you'll know where I am coming from. [IN FACT, TRY THAT ONE OUT FIRST, AS IT IS FREE AND GIVES YOU THE FEEL OF THEIR STORIES JUST LOOK IT UP ON GOOGLE OR SOMETHIN'.]The characters all have their own personality to me, and that is sometimes hard to find when you have more than one or two characters the story focuses on. I believe that this series will have more than two crucial characters.  Sometimes they all just blob together, but, well, if you play this and see the characters, you'll know who I'm talking about. I would like to say that the story begins with Winter Harrison, who's an apprentice of sorts to help manage chaotic worlds. She is mentored by a certain Cyrus Addington - whom I absolutely adore, though that is beyond the point - and the two are sent to a certain world that is about to go over the boiling point.The music. The music fit in so well with the story, and I never really got pulled out of my reading to think, 'Hey, this music really doesn't fit in at all.' The atmospheric sounds brought me to believe this world actually existed, and I particularly love a certain song that plays in a certain place (WOW GURL Y U NO SPOIL). The twist in this episode really got to me. I didn't expect it at all, and I love that in a story. Too many times am I reading and I completely called the big climax, but this one had me floored. Granted, I may have just been tired and woozy from something. But I think that it was well played out by Dischan. It made me feel something; I almost gave in. When I was done, I sat there just revelling in what had happened, then jumped back in to see if I could change it. Because this episode has a crucial choice that you have to make, and you are able to save multiple stories where your decision can impact how the characters look at you and how your character looks at herself.I have played games where your decisions don't matter at all, and you get the same speech from the same people over and over and over as you try to find some variety. This one is almost completely written differently. It may be because the choice I'm speaking of is rather drastic, but I felt as though the developers did well in almost completely rewriting how everything turns out. Winter will actuall respond to your choice. It can and will have dire consequences.I am writing this review because I believe that not enough people know this game even exists. I just found it randomly on Steam, for a really low price. That may be my only complaint here: the price. Dischan has ceased development on the sequel to save their money, as they really didn't have much to begin with since this story was rather glossed over by some. Hopefully, this review may bring more people to enjoy the story and coax the developers back onto their feet so they can give us the next chapter in this story.			"

												I recommend this as a VISUAL NOVEL. This is not a game. You make a very limited selection of choices, and even fewer of them that have any impact on the outcome. It is however a good visual novel. You do get an interesting story and an intersting world. I look forward to futre entries into this. I must stress again that this is not a game but a visual novel. If you go into this thinking that there is anything but a bunch of reading and a few choices to be made, you will be disapointed.			"

												This game is rather short and sweet, and left me hungry for the next one. The different decisions make one want to go through at least two playthroughs, if not more for the sake of achievements. As a lover of story heavy games, this was right up my alley. enough exposition and background to get a feel for what's in store, without grinding anything down into one's head over and over again. It's an excellent first chapter to what will hopefully be an excellent series. I very much look forward to the next one.			"

												Although there isn't much in the way of traditional gameplay here, DS is a visually gorgeous game, with some pretty weighty decisions and consequences. The first episode of five, Learning to Manage Chaos promises a wonderful journey through the unknown, playing as different characters, and seeing different perspectives onto a vast multiverse of problems and applications. At $5, you really can't say no to this, even if only to experience it once. You won't regret it.			"

												A classic visual novel where your only gameplay is making a few key decisions. The story is intriguing and the characters are interesting enough from what little time you have to get to know them.Rather short due to it being an episode and the releases of the following ones are delayed as of now, but the utopia depicted and the premise of being able to travel to all kinds of worlds in which magic or different physics may exist is extremely promising for a unique and engaging story.I do hope the next episodes will be released and I get to see more. Definitely recommended unless you can't stand visual novels at all.			"

												I like the concept but sadly this ""game"" just doesn't have a very intresting story to tell. I'll try to avoid going into details to avoid spoilers, but it's a very black and white world and when shades of gray are introduced nobody wins. The charaters are likeable if a bit cliche.

												While I was engaged in the first person prespective narrative and enjoying how the events unfolded. The gameplay itself, as a visual novel, didn't feel all too engaging.It felt more like the game was a narrative tool rather than a interactive environment, I feel it could do more if it gave players more choices and freedom, allowing more immersion.It felt more like a story and less like an interactive experience, even just adding options for 'how' characters interacts with small or trivial things would of added more activity and involvement for the player.I look forward to future episode regardless, as the art style was well composed. Just overall a well put together visual novel boasting in visuals, audio and narrative. Only lacks in some player involvement.I'm not too fond of reading books, but I enjoyed this. Wholeheartly.

Title: Dysfunctional Systems | Episode 1: Learning to Manage ChaosDeveloper: Dischan Media[dischan.org]An IntroductionDysfunctional Systems is a (planned) series of interactive visual novels, where decisions in previous novels are planned to reflect in future episodes. The episode, and perhaps the series from what I've read, focus on the character of Winter, a sort of student or trainee paired with a mentor to learn how to do their job, which is...manage chaos and bring forth stability. Cryptic, I know, but considering how the episode plays out even explaining the basic premise of the plot could be considered giving spoilers, which I shall not do. :P Episode 1, which is what I'm reviewing here, was released last year, while Episode 2 is in the process of being developed after a successful Kickstarter campaign raised $67,000. As with most visual novels, there is very little opportunity for user input in this ""game"", so it lives and dies by the setting, plot, story, as well as the art and music to a lesser extent. Pretty Things: Art and MusicSpeaking of the art, it's obvious that a lot of time and effort went into it...yes, they're static graphics that change as the scenes or situation changes, but there are a number of scenes drawn for any particular part of the game. For example, one may have one of the characters looking a different way or with a different emotion on their face, so they can change the scene graphic when something particular is said to show the character responding to it. Also a neat little thing I noticed is that there is a particular scene where our character is walking and the camera moves with it to simulate movement...buildings move in and out of range, which I thought was a nice little touch. The music was overall pleasant and seemed appropriate to the situations and settings that arise in the game, but weren't horribly memorable. Not like they had Morrowind's budget for music though, I'm sure. :P The Meat and Potatoes of Visual Novels, the Story:As for the story, I like the premise a lot...without saying what it is, it makes for a lot of potential variety in the game as other episodes are made, and I thought the characters were well-written as well, with unique personalities. My problem here is that much of the game comes off as feeling static, like it's a teaser or tutorial level instead of a paid game. It's not the lack of interactivity that bothers me, it's the lack of variety. Most of the game is spent having discussions between the same two characters, and there's precious little breaking all that dialogue up. It also made the story feel like it was proceeding slowly, even when urgent events were building up...a very odd feeling in those instances. Also, I know this was an introductory episode and they wanted to focus on the two main characters, but it's disappointing that there wasn't much interaction with the actual game world, especially given the game's main premise of dealing with worlds and systems. I think two birds could have been killed with one stone by having more scenes that focused on the world they were in, such as the bar scene where Winter meets David and a game event happens. To me that was a standout part of the game that temporarily broke the monotony. Another standout part of the game was during the epilogues, because the character interaction between Winter and her roommate was just so damn good, and it was nice to get a taste of Winter's life and the people she's around. In fact, I wish the game had started out this way...I think being able to be introduced to Winter and her friends before the events of the story start would have been a nice touch, too.I want to stress, it's not that I found the story bad...quite the contrary, I thought it was quite good. It just would have been even better with more variety of things interlaced within it. There's only so much you can do in a visual novel that mostly involves the same two people talking with each other. :P Overall, I suppose I find the implementation lacking, but the concept promising. From what I've read, the developer is improving on many of the issues I'm pointing out here for Episode 2, and it already sounds like it's going to host a much more vibrant world than this episode did.In SummaryMy recommendation? If you like visual novels, go ahead and get it! $5 isn't a lot of money, it's hardly a bad game, and I have enough faith that Episode 2 is going to be so great you're going to be glad you already know the basic premise of the series. Otherwise, wait for Episode 2 to come out...Episode 1 at least is definitely not for people who don't like the genre, so it may be worthwhile to see exactly what Episode 2 has to offer before putting down money.If I were to give a rating, it'd be 6/10, a rating that I'm almost certain will go up when Episode 2 comes out, which I am looking forward to. :)			"

												My first time playing through a visual novel so it was a bit hard to get into at first however once you get used to reading pages upon pages of text you will soon get used it. The story is entertaining and the art is just as good. It has a set of brilliant sound tracks which it plays at certain parts of the story to set the mood and the interface looks brilliant and does the job well.However there are one or two problems I have with the game. The art is amazing but unfortunately images are re-used over and over again and it only runs at a maximum resolution of 720p. The story is also rather short but considering this is an episodic series I can forgive that. The main problem I have with this is the lack of decisions there are to make and I fell it would have greatly benefited from more user interaction as most of it is just clicking to get to the next sentence.I did enjoy my play through of this title and will more than likely get episode 2 once it has been released.

												Beautiful in visuals, music, and story.  It's breathtaking and tugs at your heart strings.  But before you jump into this, I highly suggest you go to Dischan's web page and try out Juniper's Knot.  It's equally as wonderful, only it's shorter and free.  It will help you find out if this type of game is really for you.  However, unlike Juniper's Knot, in this game you actually interact and pick your own path.  Not large scale decisions, but enough to get you more absorbed.  I imagine that there might be more to the interacting once the remaining installments are added.The only thing that could possibly make this any more enjoyable, would for there to be Steam trading cards.  Because I'd love to have more art from this game within my possession.  Other than that, I love everything about this game and so far, everything from Dischan Media.			"

												Very enjoyable. The limited nature of the conversation tree speaks volumes to the story which unfolds as a result. This medium is a very intricate work of character development, and story telling. I would encourage any curious members to try the Juniper's Knot (by the same company) for an undestanding of this art-form.I am very excited to experience future installments.			"

												It's pretty good, and I see promise in the interesting setting, but it's definetly not a super great visual novel or anything. The depth to it is kind of lacking, you're not going to get an expeirence like Clannad or If My Heart Had Wings out of it, but it's still kind of interesitng. I'm definetly looking forward to see how this game progressed though, so I'd recomend it.			"

												Extremly well done game, however as noted below in the reviews, extremly short.This really serves more as a introduction into the future coming episodes, recently kickstarted and currently under prodcution.My recommendation is buy the game if you are loooking forward to ""reading"" the rest of the series, however if you are looking for a visual novel to tide you over for more then 1-2 hours, I would suggest looking elsewhere until the entire series is released.

												Alas, this Visual Novel with most likely never been finished, as the stuido shut down, but I will do my part in this review.Dysfunctional Systems is a visual novel that has you playing through the perspective of a young mediator in training. Mediators are people from a highly advanced civilization that use technology to go to other realitys and such, changing things as they see fit, and nudging the other civilizations in a way that would be benificial to the home-reality. The story was fun to play through, decisions felt impactful and the dialogue was very compelling. The soundtrack for this game is also stellar, never seemed out of place. I would recommend getting this on the inevitable steam sale to lesson the cost just a mite, but definately worth it if you need something short to chill and be immersed for a short while.			"

												I started the game, and after a while, nicely designed menu showed up. My mouse pointer was hovering above the ""New Game"" button, but I waited for the song, and hell was it amazing. With newly built up excitement, I pressed the button, and have been thrown straight into the story. I was curious what codex was so I opened it up, and ""no records found"" popped up on me. Nice touch, I thought, I closed it, and started with the story, I couldn't stop untill I got through it, it was written very well, and took me around two and half an hour to get through and the end showed something like ""profiles"", that will  enable next parts to access my choices from previous parts. All in all, this was the second most awesome Visual Novel I've ever played, the first being Katawa Shoujo. (Don't judge me guys!)			"

												This is part of what was intended to be a visual novel comrpised of, in addition to this 'chapter', two additional chapters and a smaller spin-off. After a lack of news regarding the two installments, Dischan launched a Kickstarter which raised approximately $60,000. They later announced that they would be halting the production of the future installments. They cited numerous reasons why the Dysfunctional Systems story will not be completed, most annoyingly for fans and those who had supported the Kickstarter was what the developer referred to as a 'lack of motivation'. Do not purchase this game if you are expecting to read (watch?) a story that has an ending, let alone a decent plot, as the majority of the lore seems to have been intended for the second and third installments, which will probably never be produced.

												I think Dischan (the devs) has the potential to make of this a great series. The artwork, the soundtrack, and most of all, the story, it's all so different from what has been stablished on the VN industry, and it left me wanting to see more. However, it's a short novel (around 5 hours for 100% completion), but it doesn't mean it lacks content. The soundtrack has 18 songs, there are 30 ilustrations (14 used in-game, the others are extras), and even an animated opening! I finished the game some time ago, but I still love hearing the soundtrack again. The only letdown is that a sequel is unlikely now. But if you love interesting settings and visual novels with ACTUAL PLOT, you will like this.			"

												Dysfunctional Systems:Learning to Manage Chaos, is not a game, but rather a visual novel. If you judge it under the umbrella of games it doesn't fair well but under the latter it is a very high quality piece of work. It is an enjoyable read from start to finish, this is the first episode in the series and introduces the characters and the concept of the world. I will say that it does start slowly for the first 10 minutes of dialogue and environmental setup, but as it progresses you will get entralled in the world they have created. It discusses some difficult issues of morality and without going into spoilers has school/adventure elements. It has   a relatively good soundtrack, clean interface and offers a few dialogue options (although very minor and few and far between). On the downside it has no voiceacting (but decent sound effects, just shocking no VA given how polished everything else is), and it is quite short, capable of completing within about 1.5-2h. Lastly its second episode is on hault for whatever reason and although at the time of writing this it is underway, the story leaves you desperately wanting to know more. Do I recommend this, yes, however if cost is a major factor I'd likely wait until it goes on sale to see if it is something for you, plus as it is presently an unfinished series you will be left waiting for more.

												The brilliant trailer and soundtrack are worth more than the rest of the game, which is complete くそゲー and worthless even as fanfiction.The concept is fascinating, and brutalized by a substandard script. The storyline is paced badly, and there is never a proper sense of characterization developed through the text. Ellipses are overused for dramatic pause. Winter's narrative monologues are tediously long, and the profanity is gratuitious while failing to generate dramatic tension.After the decision point leading to a drastic scene shift and the introduction of additional characters, the creative team behind this game decides to lose their minds. Characters such as Henry Pen are text only. A massive wall of text is a placeholder for character interaction. The shallow script essentially craters, lost in marooned plot devices like hints of a lesbian romance which inexplicably awards an achievement.There is minimal backstory to speak of. The Codex, an interesting plot device, is grossly underutilized. The origins of Winter's homeworld and how they developed Mediators are neglected. Some brilliant, evocative art direction could have filled in, but what we get are anime watercolors and bad writing that demands mashing the space bar to banish from screen.Visual Novels require superlative scriptwriting and engrossing characterization. This game provides neither, unless the tastes of the reader are just as shallow as the gameplay and satisfaction comes easy. Future episodes in this series are not worth consideration, the dismal writing and the plot structure would require vast improvement beyond the hack writing in place.However, the soundtrack is lovely as background music, which is why I have so many hours logged.ざけんな、バカにするのも程々にしろっ。This is not representative of what VNs are capable of being, and under the lovely facade it is shallow with no substance. Do not buy, do not play.			"

Edit: Due to the developers not being able to make a sequel right now, and this game being what is essentially the first chapter of a book, I can't recommend this game if that's not your thing. It's still an excellent experience, however, and is worth it's small price.StoryI notice people complain both about the length of the story and the small number of choices. However, the story is rather deep with a good sense of innocence that really drives the character development. Equally so, the choices carry with them some fairly large ramifications. For example, the first choice is ""Follow Cyrus"" and ""Rebel""; both choice trees may lead to the same ending story-wise, but both of them lead to very different outcomes emotionally for the PC: Cyrus blew up the soalr system (and I let him) vs. I blew up the solar system.Yes, the story may be rather short, but I still feel it has a good amount of content; considering it's only $4.99, you can't really turn it down.There are many a debate in the discussions area for this game, about world economics, strife, turmoil, and the other various topics this game gives you thought to. If anything, if you're the debating type, you could get a lot of brain candy out of playing this and mulling it over with others.Obviously, the length and the content are the main factors to gripe about, but like I said, it's worth it taking the price into consideration. Another reason you might not want the game is the fact that though the choice trees give a different emotional outcome, the story is largely ""on-rails"" and the physical, general outcome of the story is the same no matter what choices you choose. Of course, this allows the story to follow the path the developers want and to allow them to craft a truly excellent story, but veteran VN players may find issue in this.As an up-side to the short length of the story, each choice tree provides almost completely different dialogue than their comparatives, filled with witty, humorous writing. It'll be the same general story no matter what you choose, but you'll get a totally different emotional side of it. I think this really helps define the characters, as well, giving much more depth in the span of time the game allows.ArtThe art is really quite excellent. I love the sharp facial features and the muted colors. However, the ""painted"" style of the background is somewhat iffy at times; it isn't to my tastes. It would look much nicer if it was a bit sharper to match the foreground, though it does allow the characters a better contrast to their surroundings, causing you to focus on them and their expressions more.It would have been neat if the 3D designs featured in the AV sequence were extended and put to use as background material or similar.The UI is gloriously developed and a joy to both look at and navigate. All of it animates smoothly and completely and fits the psuedo-futuristic feel of the game. It's a little visually busy, but I like that.CharactersThe characters all feel like they have established roles, identities, and personalities, but the story is too short to really get to know them as much as I'm sure the average VN player would like. If you're the kind of person to play VNs for the character development, Dysfunctional Systems is rather good at that in the small time it plays for.SoundsThere are a lot of different sounds in Dysfunctional Systems, all of them atmospheric, quality, and unique. They put a lot of work into the sound design of the game. I will most certainly be putting the complete FLAC OST, which is included with the game files for free, into my music library. If anything, get it for the kickass music. It's incredibly high fidelity and plays like a professionally released album.ConclusionI would recommend this to any VN player that doesn't mind a shorter experience. Despite its length, the story is hard-hitting and is both relevant to the issues of today's world and challenging to the mind.Unfortunately, the developers went essentially bankrupt and have shelved any and all future projects indefinitely, so we won't be able to see any more of this universe for a while, if ever. It's a shame, really. You can check our their blog to see what happened and to browse their other works (including more awesome music).			"

												If you like Visual Novel I'm sure you'll love the artistic design in this game.

There's no story-changing decision, I felt that I was just an omniprescent third-person without being able to change anything.

A sleek UI, a unique and well drawn art style, well written dialogue and narration, easy to read text, and an intriguing story. ""Learning To Manage Chaos"" is apparently the first in a series that will be under the Dysfunctional Systems name, and with the groundwork that this first entry has layed down I can say that I'm pretty excited for the upcoming episodes. Be weary that it's kind of short though. Being that I'm somewhat of a slow reader, this took me around 2 - 3 hours to complete. So, your mileage may vary.

												An absolutely amazing visual novel, though the reader influence is minimal it's still important, and your decisions can have consequences. The art and music are simply beautiful, and the storyline and characters are engaging. It's a good start to what will (hopefully) continue as an amazing visual novel series (due to financial issues, episode 2 is unfortunately on hold). Dischan media continues to put out quality content, if you've never heard of them give ""Junipers knot""(completely free on itunes) a try to get a sense of what you can expect from them art and music-wise. The writing in both visual novels is stunning, and Dysfunctional systems has become one of my favourite visual novels. It is most definitely worth the 5 dollars, and I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys visual novels.			"

												Standard style visual novel with lovely art and music. Your character is a mediator in training (shadowing a mentor). Mediators travel to ""chaotic worlds"" and attempt to fix problems. I really like the premise, but the game only focuses on one world's situation, and is fairly short at about 3 hours. The backdrops and character animations/expressions are fairly basic and there isn't a lot of variety, but the game is still pleasing to look at.The first third of the game is fairly long and sets up the story and characters. There are no choices to be made during this time, so you really just watch it play out. The second third of the game is where all of the dialogue branches are made, but they really only unlock variations of dialogue. The last choice you make during that section determines which ending you get. The last third of the game is much like the first, just seeing it play out.Aside from the lack of impactful choices, my only other gripe is that much of the dialogue is simply bickering back and forth. Some of the choices seem slightly out of character, but they offer the sense of you being able to change someone else's mind via dialogue in order to open up a different viewpoint.Overall, I enjoyed this game but would have liked it to be much longer, with more characters and more impactful choices. This is supposed to only be ""Episode 1"" and is priced appropriately for its length; however, the developers are unable to make a sequel unless they find funding via their Kickstarter (Found here https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dischan/dysfunctional-systems )I'd love to see a sequel that expands upon what they've created here, as it has a lot of potential to fully explore the plot and characters in much more detail.

I for sure, can't wait for the next episode of Dysfunctional Systems.For those who are new to Visual Novels.. Look at it as a mix between a comic and a book with the occasional option to select a certain development regarding the story.Visual Novels aren't about action and fast reaction, they're about emotion, fantasy and the power of words. They take time to enjoy and sometimes they take time to understand. Visual Novels aren't enjoyed by all people, but those who like to read will enjoy them.Although the protagonist's often a youngster, many visual novels, if not most, are meant for a mature audience. This can be noticed by certain social challenges many of them present of the political discusions regarding certain actions.			"

The second third of the game is where all of the dialogue branches are made, but they really only unlock variations of dialogue. The last choice you make during that section determines which ending you get. The last third of the game is much like the first, just seeing it play out.Aside from the lack of impactful choices, my only other gripe is that much of the dialogue is simply bickering back and forth. Some of the choices seem slightly out of character, but they offer the sense of you being able to change someone else's mind via dialogue in order to open up a different viewpoint.Overall, I enjoyed this game but would have liked it to be much longer, with more characters and more impactful choices. This is supposed to only be ""Episode 1"" and is priced appropriately for its length; however, the developers are unable to make a sequel unless they find funding via their Kickstarter (Found here https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dischan/dysfunctional-systems )I'd love to see a sequel that expands upon what they've created here, as it has a lot of potential to fully explore the plot and characters in much more detail.

												Wow, amazing! You know Ren'Py...You know Katawa Shoujo, you know Analogue...? Well, this is just the same and very, very good. Beautiful graphics and top nodge story telling. I for sure, can't wait for the next episode of Dysfunctional Systems.For those who are new to Visual Novels.. Look at it as a mix between a comic and a book with the occasional option to select a certain development regarding the story.Visual Novels aren't about action and fast reaction, they're about emotion, fantasy and the power of words. They take time to enjoy and sometimes they take time to understand. Visual Novels aren't enjoyed by all people, but those who like to read will enjoy them.Although the protagonist's often a youngster, many visual novels, if not most, are meant for a mature audience. This can be noticed by certain social challenges many of them present of the political discusions regarding certain actions.			"

												SPOILER-FREE REVIEWMy specs: Windows 10 with 8GB RAM and an AMD Radeon RX 480 graphics card.There is a lot to be said about the final chapter of this trilogy, and while not all of it is good, I still definitely recommend the game. Let's get the BAD out of the way so that we can focus on the GOOD.First, every time I entered the game I was warned that I only had 4GB of RAM, and that the game recommended six... *looks at my specs mentioned above, then back at warning* :\ Yep, I'm pretty sure that EIGHT gigs is not the same as FOUR, but I digress... This did not seem to affect my gameplay.GLITCHES: I only saw two actual game glitches. One was where a character mysteriously appeared OUTSIDE of the compound where I'd been fighting his crew, and the other was that the bat signal indicated a quest item being over the WRONG building. Not bad, as far as glitches go!TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: They are many, and could be game-breaking if you are not comfortable with adjusting some files. I had no troubles in the beginning, but then the problems started: Lagging, crashing, and even completely shutting down my computer with zero warning. *cries* Lagging I can deal with. Crashing I can deal with. Shutting off my computer over and over again? WHYYYYY??? It started happening so often that despite how much I was enjoying the game, I was beginning to think that I'd have to stop playing...... and then I found the Master Fixes for BATMAN ARKHAM KNIGHT thread here at Steam, and my hope was rekindled. It turns out a couple of files corrupt over time, and all I had to do was delete one file and one folder, then verify the integrity of the game cache (very easy on both points), and voilà -- WORKING GAME! *cue angels singing*GRAPHICS: If you don't have a new enough graphics card, the game won't even start for you. The plus side of the high-spec card is that the graphics are amazing. From the smallest dust particle to the sweeping bridges and skyscrapers, Gotham City truly feels alive. Every crack in the sidewalk, every fierce tattoo, each choppy wave, an craggy wrinkle tells a story that makes you want to know MORE. The people may not be as attractive as in previous installments, but they are more realistic, and they truly have character. The devs have introduced a photo mode, where you can pause the game and do a nearly 360-degree rotation to get just the perfect shot... Just use the Steam shortcut you set up (F12 default) to take screens, and it removes the ugly interface when you take the shot.THE GADGETS: We do have a couple of new gadgets to play this time around: A voice synthesizer which allows us an extra layer of tactics by giving orders to assailants, plus the Batmobile, which I'll come back to in a bit. The gadgets are by and large underutilized and not really explained, bringing back my recommendation to play the games in the order in which they were released: Asylum, City, Origin, Knight. Not only will these previous installments give you a feel for the story, combat, gameplay, and general useful knowledge, but you'll get to play some GREAT games!THE INTERFACE: Most of the controls are the same as what we're accustomed to, though they had to do some tweaking in order to include...THE BATMOBILE! What a great addition to the series! Not only can you zoom around Gotham City like a boss, you can destroy half the city as you go~! I had great fun running down criminals (literally... Muwahaha), blowing up cars, knocking down trees, fences, support pillars... you get the idea. *evil grin* In addition to a new form of transportation, we have a great many quests, riddles, and fights to win using the Batmobile, which is not only a car, but a BATTLEmoblie! At the touch of a button we can transform it to a highly-maneuverable tank in order to kick all ♥♥♥... We can even do Batmobile-assisted takedowns with Wayne's patented non-lethal rounds. ""It's like being punched in the chest by an angry gorilla!""Many of the Batmobile quests are optional, but you will need to develop some proficiency in driving it, as eventually you'll have to use it to progress in the story.COMBAT: As usual for the series, combat starts off deceptively easy, then amps up in difficulty as you progress. We have the new Fear Multi-takedown ability, which enables you to take out up to six enemies within seconds... provided that you can come upon the group by surprise. There are also points in the story where you can play two characters at once, and during this time you can do multi-character takedowns. Those are great fun, let me tell you! ;DWe have some new attacks that we can do whilst gliding, plus the items mentioned above, but nothing really game-changing about the combat. We've got our guys with riot shields, cattle prods, brutes, guns... and a few little extra things that I'll let you discover for yourselves.THE STORY: When the game started, I felt that the side missions were much more engrossing than the main storyline. I went through the game knowing not only exactly who our mystery assailant was, but why we were being attacked... Absolutely positive right up to the moment of the unmasking, and then... Everything changed. That which had been mildly interesting was suddenly fascinating. My mental shift was profound, as far as such things go, and it pulled me into the story in ways I had never considered. Although one aspect of the story I had totally nailed, there were several real surprises throughout, something which I really cherish. A good story is something that I truly appreciate, but you have a good story with great gameplay, and I'm in heaven!THE ENDING/THE RIDDLES (Still no spoilers!): You must secure a certain number of criminals in order to view the final sequence of the game. You do not have to 100% the game to see the ending, BUT, to get the FULL ending, you have to defeat The Riddler, and THAT means solving, saving, maneuvering, finding, and destroying a total of 243 riddles, people, courses, trophies, and destructible items.The riddles are the one thing I won't be doing 100% on this time around, though I did get 100% on the rest of the content.If, like me, you don't plan to solve every single riddle in order to secure the post-Riddler portion of the ending, then NEVER FEAR, YOUTUBE IS HERE! Although some may feel that it's not really important to see that extra tidbit of story, one little sentence during this scene completely changed how I felt about the ending of the game. I'm not gonna add a link, since that's just too tempting to click, and I want this to be spoiler-free.THE BOTTOM LINE: Batman: Arkham Knight is flawed. The devs have no plans to fix that which is broken, but you CAN fix the problems yourself! If you're a fan of the series and can problem-solve enough to follow the instructions in the Master Fixes for BATMAN ARKHAM KNIGHT thread, then it is ABSOLUTELY worth your trouble. I enjoyed this title immensely, despite the frustrations with the technical difficulties. I would even start the game over again right this minute if it weren't for the fact that I have so many other games that I want to play.IN CLOSING: I loved this game, and if it weren't for the technical problems that I encountered, it would be my favorite of the series. As it stands, I rank them as follows: Arkham City, Arkham Knight, Arkham Asylum, and then Arkham Origins. Definitely a MUST-play!I am Batman... I am the Night!			"

												I really like this game, the story is good, and I really liked the art and the music, so why I dont recommend it?, is simple, the development of the game is on hold, it looks like the game is almost cancelled, so even if is good, it is not worth to buy a game that maybe never get finished, if you really want to support the devs buy it, if dont, wait a couple of years to see what happens to this game.UPDATE:Now it is a kickstarter campaign to ""finish"" the game, it was supposed to be 5 chapters in total, but now it is going to be just 3, which is kind of disappointment, The game is going to get finished, but I cannot change my review, because of the new art style, maybe this sounds rude, but the new art is nothing compared with the old one, you should check the kickstarter page, and compare it, the story is good but is not that good, so the art was the thing that made me love this game. for me, it is not worth it until the new art gets better. I still encourage you to check the kickstarter page, maybe you like the new art better.UPDATE 2:The new concept art is getting a lot better, So I backed it in kickstarter, That was my only problem with this game, but now that it is not the case, I have to change my review and recommend the game, So what are you waiting for? it is just 1 dolar and it is great, Also you should back the Kickstarter project to get the game finished.

												I like visual novel games, but I don't know if I'll finish this one.  The music so far is great.  The art is alright.  So far the story is moving a bit slowly.  Mainly the reason I have stopped playing it to write this review is that after an hour of playtime, I haven't been able to make a single choice.  Not even a minor dialog choice.  Just endless clicking, and reading.  I know it is described as a visual novel, but it's also supposed to be a game.  Being a game should imply some level of interactivity.  And if there is going to be so little interactivity, the story should at least move along a little quicker!  If you like visual novels, I wouldn't recommend this one, even for $5.  Go find something else, or read a graphic novel or a regular novel.			"

												Dysfunctional Systems is basically a picture book that you rarely interact with. In certain ways, it is similar to 39 Steps. Unlike The 39 Steps, the writing in Dysfunctional Systems is terrible. People drone on and on about pointless issues, and when you have to 'click' every time you want to see the next part, (some of which are single words, like ""um"" and ""er"") it makes it an annoying and unpleasant experience. Unlike The 39 Steps, there is NO voice acting, and the art isn't nearly as good. It doesn't even support 1080p.If you like the premise of the gameplay in Dysfunctional Systems, buy The 39 Steps instead.			"

												This is a bad, bad piece of fanfiction. The whole mess starts with the arrival of a whiny 14-year old from an Orwellian world on a cross-universe job shadow. Her name is Winter, but I call her Little ♥♥♥♥. What an idiot she is, and an inconsistent, infuriating character. She's supposedly an avid reader but couldn't be bothered to read about the world she'd be observing, and her disinterest is not from depression or apathy or culture shock. And she cannot analyze the world around her when she’s there. The capitol is a derelict wreck, but she can't even look around her and say, ""Gee. This is a dump. How ♥♥♥♥ed is the government, economy, or deaths-to-births ratio?"" She doesn’t even understand how serious a declaration of nuclear is in a world that until then had none! All she does is scream about how she isn’t prepared for observing or participating in a warring world, that murder for the greater good is wrong.Winter, you Little ♥♥♥♥. Your inability to even discuss the situation and the history concerning it makes you unfit for this assignment. Or any assignment. Go back to kiddie school and see a counselor. At one point I invoked Nostalgia Critic and started arguing with the game, begging often to ""let me guide the naive fool,"" and ""please, I read the files one these nations. Let me control their destiny."" Instead I chose to have her follow her let’s-assassinate-the-president-to-minimize-damage mentor. And whine, and be petty, and sulk, and try to sabotage the assassination. And nearly admits in a crowed of stunned nationals that they were the murderers. I... I just kept saying ""No."" Then I started yelling it. Supposedly ""Part 2"" will require more than one impotent decision from me, but based on my button-mashing experience of the first part I might just quit. Most of the dialogue is just filler that doesn’t inform me of diddly-squat. The emotions I experienced from the game were anger, frustration, indignation and most of all, BOREDOM. I was intellectually insulted by this “story”. Winter is a child whom I cannot empathize with. I am an adult. I want more stimulation than reading a tantrum and the indecisiveness of a writer whose work I wouldn’t even comment on if I found it on Fanfiction.net or Archive of Our Own or Tumblr. It’s a poorly-written trainwreck, and currently I’m hoping that Little ♥♥♥♥ dies of trauma from radiation exposure and the guilt from the death of that world. "

												Actually this was my first visual novel, so i'm gonna expose my opinion as a gamer, not as a visual novel lover. The story starts pretty good, even a bit funny, though it has a totally nonsense ending. There is basically  nothing for you to do then to read, except a few options you have to choose and which will infuence on the outcome of the episode. So dont get this is you dont like reading, dont even bother. First time i started it i was lucky enough to be provided just with once choise, and that was it. The only thing that didnt let me delete it was the nice designed art and the amazing soundtrack. As i understood there should be more episodes coming, and if they will be added for free for the owners of this one it's fine, overwise the game is overpriced even for it's 5$ price. If play it just once and dont bother with the achievements - there is 1 hour of ""playing"" it. Dont judge me hard, i tried to enjoy the story, i really did, but  it's just too lame, it's not possible...and i even bothered to get 100% achievements done...			"

												Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is a visual novel sure, but what it really is is an instructional book, teaching storytellers how to navigate through dynamic decsion-effected storylines effectively, with emotion behind the character the Player is creating.  If you pay attention, it teaches you how to avoid your reader/player railing against what their character is doing and consequently failing to get behind your story.  Decisions have impacts, good, bad, expected, and unexpected.  Your job as a story teller (mediator) isn't to force the player into one choice, but to build interesting stories around those choices.

												Bought this on a whim and rather enjoyed it. It's well written and very well drawn with surprisingly good music. My only criticism is that it's quite short, I think I went through the entirety of the story and it's various paths in a little over 3 hours but then this is the first real release by a start up developer so you can't expect a huge amount of content. If you're a fan of visual novels it's certainly worth picking up, if only in the hopes of supporting the developers into making further episodes. Even if you aren't a huge fan of the genre I'd still recommend it since it costs next to nothing and is a fairly short sit anyway. Who knows, maybe you'll end up enjoying it?			"

												A decent, if short, visual novel. The story is actually quite good, definitely worth it's price, but buyers beware - unless you are the sort of person that can live with an unfinished tale or unless you can fill in the ending yourself with imagination, you will be left stranded and wanting. Originally, it was meant to be a multi-part game, but will probably never be finished, as the studio got itself in a quagmire and abandoned all further work.			"

												I'm a big fan of visual novels, and I like this one especially - the art style, the way it is written - everything fits together and so I like it - a lot.But why wouldn't I yet recommend this game? Simple: Because the dev dropped it. They only released the first episode, and while I was waiting, thrilled for the next ep, at some point the dev decided to drop it. So I can't really recommend this, after all it is a story that will probably never end. (A pity - I liked that, too...)So, while I generally cannot recommend this, if you are planning on writing a VN (or even a regular novel) you might take a look at it, just to look at the way it narrates itself. It is REALLY good.			"

												Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos was a promising beginning to what could have been a genuinely intriguing science fiction story. Points I especially liked were:- Interesting premise- Well-written female characters, complete with complex emotions and relateable motivations. - Characters and dialogue which were not written in boring black-and-white prose, but with varying shades of moral ambiguity woven through the narrative.By the end of the story, I was left wanting to discover more about the characters and in what way my decisions had influenced the trajectory of the plot... Sadly, since there will never be an Episode 2, so I'll never know.In summary: I liked what I saw, and will be keeping my eye on this development team in the future. Hopefully, the next one will be a story I can follow through to its actual conclusion.			"

												A well-written visual novel which manages to (mostly) break away from all the tired romantic tropes and panty-shot fetishism which stereotype the genre; the setting is unique and compelling and the groundwork is laid for some interesting development in later chapters, it looks (or looked) like setting up to be a somewhat similar in structure to a Telltale style experience where the choices made branch out progressively as chapters progress; in this episode however the choices are few are far between, and heavily biased towards the earliest decision point in terms of quantity.That said, there’s a lot to enjoy about the writing and the characters here; and if you don’t mind more reading than interacting then you’ll probably enjoy watching the well told story progress at a good pace. As a side note, the soundtrack (which can be all be streamed on Youtube) really is well above par, and honestly I would have been happy to pay $5 just for the mp3s alone. The same can be said for that ‘animated opening video’ that the blurb talks about which is a really well put together piece of art by itself and makes me think that the developers should be pitching their concept art and story as the basis of an anime series.Unfortunately the audience hasn’t flocked to this title and harsh commercial realities have led to many of the team leaving Dyschan (including the chief Art director), so this is one story that you’ll probably have to generate an ending for in your own mind (or read fanfic). It’d be nice to see this find some success though; and it’s a great price for what it is.			"

												This game is one of THE best visual novels I've ever played/read. It features decisions you have to make, even when you don't want to do them at all. As like other visual novels, the choices affect your character in different ways. It can make you feel things as you are sent into different universes to try to keep that world and planet safe from ""chaos"". Like preventing world wars or complete destruction of the whole planet. It shows this by making your choices make a HUGE impact on the storyline. But it's also the character that brings out the meaning to this game. You play as a 14 year old girl named Winter Harrison. She is still naive and very emotional, and with the combined effects of music and sound, as well as background coloring changes and pictures, it makes you feel like you're in the game and whatever happens to her, you can also feel it too. So if you have leftover money and want to spend it on a good game which allows you the fate of a universe in your hands, then Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos  is the game for you. "

												Great game that got gifted to me by someone from my friends list.It's a little bit short but as opposed to The Walking Dead, when you make a different choice, there is no rehash of dialogue, it's all different which is mighty impressive.I'm glad it doesn't feel as ""anime"" as most visual novels tend to be. I noticed Winter isn't wearing pants but I'm glad there was never was a fanservice moment ingame (there is in the extras section though).Beautiful writing. The later episodes were kickstarted today. I'll definitely get them when they're out.I hope there will a better differentiation in the text between thoughts and ""actually speaking"" in the later episodes. When you are actually speaking, text gets put between quotation marks which isn't super obvious. I'd rather have some sort of differently shaped text bubble or coloured text to show the difference.

												Recommending this not just because I loved it, but it makes you think.The concepts and ideas put forth in this visual novel are fascinating, touching on morality, utopia, equality and a mix of other categories. The story is hard to grasp at first, without prior knowledge, but you do eventually slide into it, and its a tough ride to be sure. The artwork and presentation is very standard of a visual novel, in that it looks gorgeous and sounds great, and the character's text is very fluent and well edited. You essentially follow the character Winter around, (its extremely linear, as with all visual novels) and experience the story via text and choice making. Your choices can lead in various directions, allowing you to see different outcomes (make sure to save  haha); which reinforces the whole theme of the story, which revolves around managing Chaos on remote worlds.I greatly enjoyed this experience, and will definitely be buying the second episode when it releases so as to learn even more.

												This is probably the most disappointed I've ever felt with a VN.  The premise sounds so interesting; you're like an interdimensional peace ninja, manipulating societies from behind the scenes for their own benefit, and at the start, it really feels like it will follow through on that premise, what with giving you a bunch of information about the world you're on that all sounds like it could be important later on.  I wasn't even expecting MUCH, given that it was billed as the first game in a series, but ultimately, what the game delivers is one meaningful choice that has absolutely nothing to do with all that setting material.  The protagonist solves all the problems on her own beyond that, and it doesn't even matter if you looked at the world-info at all.  This is basically a kinetic novel being billed as something more.

With that, this game is kind of let hanging. Otherwise, this was a great VN. The music was good, dialogue was real, and choices matter, although they ought to be excellent choices if you want to change anything. This is a  great game to kill time with. I immediately fell in love with the protagonist and, despite the game's possible intention, grew very fond of her mentor.  The game's lore made the immersion factor go through the roof.

												This is probably the most disappointed I've ever felt with a VN.  The premise sounds so interesting; you're like an interdimensional peace ninja, manipulating societies from behind the scenes for their own benefit, and at the start, it really feels like it will follow through on that premise, what with giving you a bunch of information about the world you're on that all sounds like it could be important later on.  I wasn't even expecting MUCH, given that it was billed as the first game in a series, but ultimately, what the game delivers is one meaningful choice that has absolutely nothing to do with all that setting material.  The protagonist solves all the problems on her own beyond that, and it doesn't even matter if you looked at the world-info at all.  This is basically a kinetic novel being billed as something more.

												Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is a 2014 Visual Novel developed by Dischan Media, the creators of Juniper's Knot. Learning to Manage Chaos is the first game in the Dysfunctional Systems series and acts more as a sneak peak for the rest of the series.Learning to Manage Chaos follows the journey of Winter Harrison, a 14 year old Mediator who has traveled to the world of Sule to control said world's chaos with her mentor Cyrus Addington. Dysfunctional systems blends politics and sci-fi elements to create a very interesting world (or worlds) which is genuinely intriguing to read about. There is a good deal of world building through not only the dialogue but also the Codex which acts as a portable encyclopedia with information on the world. Learning to Manage Chaos does a good job of exploring philosophies such as Utilitarianism and their effects, both posotive and negative. Despite having very few choices to does a great job of adding weight and immersion to the story through the writing. The biggest flaw of Learning to Manage Chaos is undoubtedly the length which clocks in at less than 2 hours. There are reasons to play through such as the getting all the achievements and different dialogue but even with this you won't be spending any more than a few hours on Learning to Manage Chaos.The majority of Learning to Manage Chaos has you playing as Winter Harrison. Although Winter is naive she has a strong sense of justice and is pretty cute. On the other side of the spectrum Cyrus Addington, her mentor, is a more mature and experienced Mediator whose opinions often clash with Winter's. The interactions' between both characters are at times funny and cute and at others' thought provoking as much of the subject matter is war and nuclear weapons. The characters add a lot of substance to the game and make the tense moments of the story more gripping. There are few other characters introduced that I won't go into because they only play a small part in episode 1 but they are all fairly likeable so far.One of the games strongest points is it's visuals and music. The character designs are very well drawn and nice to look at and the backgrounds are some of the best I've seen in this genre. They are all very detailed and unique. The music is very atmosphere as it contains some great Ambient and Electronica tracks which heavily lend to the dystopian-esque atmosphere that the VN is going for. All of which can be accessed from the main menu.While the length of Learning to Manage Chaos and the miniscule amount of choices hinder the overall quality of the game, Episode 1 of Dysfunction Systems has a great story, characters, visuals, and soundtrack. Although this is only a review of the first episode and shouldn't be applied to later episodes in the series.			"

												Disclaimer: review copy provided by the developer.As visual novels go, this game has very few branches. It is possible to go through the entire game and only make one choice. (One branch from that first choice has other choices to be made.) Even still, the game doesn't allow the player much freedom. What it has, though, is really good writing. The characters and setting are very interesting and the dialogue is great.It's the first chapter in an episodic series and the developers have promised that there will be more branching later, with decisions made in this first chapter affecting later episodes. It seems they were trying to keep the scope of the whole series under control going into the future by limiting options now. Given how it ends, I'm really looking forward to seeing where future episodes go.			"

												This is a fantastic VN. It's truly engaging and the characters are fantastic. If you liked this developer's free iOS VN, Jupiter's Knot, you'll love this. His truly gorgeous art and impeccable writing style are back, just this time on a much grander scale. He pulls off the transition really well ever and paints a very unique but believable universe. Sure it's not the longest thing in the world, but more episodes are coming and this is a five dollar game. Not like Stein's Gate which is 40 dollars. I truly felt like my choices changed the world and that how informed I kept myself was what made the difference. It felt real. It's amazing. Buy this ♥♥♥♥.			"

												The novel is confusing and boring, and really not interactive at all. I couldn't stand to play much of it and understood very little. It just kind of drops you into the story with little or no explanation. Maybe it's part of a series and I'm missing some previous information, but the lack of interactability and bland characters didn't make me want to pursue anything. If you are looking for a novel that is actually interactive and well written, search up Tin Star on steam. Totally worth the 5 bucks while this wasn't worth the 99 cents I paid when it was on sale.

												Recommending this not just because I loved it, but it makes you think.The concepts and ideas put forth in this visual novel are fascinating, touching on morality, utopia, equality and a mix of other categories. The story is hard to grasp at first, without prior knowledge, but you do eventually slide into it, and its a tough ride to be sure. The artwork and presentation is very standard of a visual novel, in that it looks gorgeous and sounds great, and the character's text is very fluent and well edited. You essentially follow the character Winter around, (its extremely linear, as with all visual novels) and experience the story via text and choice making. Your choices can lead in various directions, allowing you to see different outcomes (make sure to save  haha); which reinforces the whole theme of the story, which revolves around managing Chaos on remote worlds.I greatly enjoyed this experience, and will definitely be buying the second episode when it releases so as to learn even more. Bloody beautiful.			"

												Dislaimer: This game is no longer in active development. While the team might work on it in the future, and wish to do so, they are by no means spending full time on future episodes. With that, this game is kind of let hanging. Otherwise, this was a great VN. The music was good, dialogue was real, and choices matter, although they ought to be excellent choices if you want to change anything. This is a  great game to kill time with. I immediately fell in love with the protagonist and, despite the game's possible intention, grew very fond of her mentor.  The game's lore made the immersion factor go through the roof. This game is definately worth getting, if only to make a follow-up more likely.			"

												Great game that got gifted to me by someone from my friends list.It's a little bit short but as opposed to The Walking Dead, when you make a different choice, there is no rehash of dialogue, it's all different which is mighty impressive.I'm glad it doesn't feel as ""anime"" as most visual novels tend to be. I noticed Winter isn't wearing pants but I'm glad there was never was a fanservice moment ingame (there is in the extras section though).Beautiful writing. The later episodes were kickstarted today. I'll definitely get them when they're out.I hope there will a better differentiation in the text between thoughts and ""actually speaking"" in the later episodes. When you are actually speaking, text gets put between quotation marks which isn't super obvious. I'd rather have some sort of differently shaped text bubble or coloured text to show the difference.

												First Warning : This is more a book with a few choices here and there rather than a game!Personnal rating : 17/20 as a book.It's really well written, and very interesting though.And it's actually more a fiction in a science-fiction world : the world you are during the first half is pretty the same as ours, technologicaly speaking, while the origin world is far more advanced but we only see a fragment of it that still seems pretty near us. The story is really great and perfectly written, the audio/graphics are really cool because they're not covering the ""Visual-Novel"" concept while staying interesting.I would still put this in the Science-Fiction category because of the ""true"" fusion bomb (which made me smile a bit^^), and its potential told consequences (embrasing the atmosphere was still near reality compared to the ""it'll transform into a star"" which isn't possible...)The next episode is promising!

												This is probably the most gorgeous visual novel I've ever played, and the production values are top-notch. Moreover, it's smartly written (the interactions between characters is so fun and compelling, and I really enjoy its worldbuilding). This game has a fantastic premise and I find myself hungering for more. I really, REALLY like this game and feel it comes at a price where it is well-worth the investment. And I like the weight of the decisions I made and the possibility it could have on future installments.My previous edition of this review warned that this series would remain incomplete, but since the successful kickstarter you can expect more installments in the future. Dysfunctional Systems has all the potential in the world, so keep an eye on it!Look into Juniper's Knot if you haven't already as well, it's free, it's the right length, and it's very captivating.

												Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos was a promising beginning to what could have been a genuinely intriguing science fiction story. Points I especially liked were:- Interesting premise- Well-written female characters, complete with complex emotions and relateable motivations. - Characters and dialogue which were not written in boring black-and-white prose, but with varying shades of moral ambiguity woven through the narrative.By the end of the story, I was left wanting to discover more about the characters and in what way my decisions had influenced the trajectory of the plot... Sadly, since there will never be an Episode 2, so I'll never know.In summary: I liked what I saw, and will be keeping my eye on this development team in the future. Hopefully, the next one will be a story I can follow through to its actual conclusion.			"

												I'm a big fan of visual novels, and I like this one especially - the art style, the way it is written - everything fits together and so I like it - a lot.But why wouldn't I yet recommend this game? Simple: Because the dev dropped it. They only released the first episode, and while I was waiting, thrilled for the next ep, at some point the dev decided to drop it. So I can't really recommend this, after all it is a story that will probably never end. (A pity - I liked that, too...)So, while I generally cannot recommend this, if you are planning on writing a VN (or even a regular novel) you might take a look at it, just to look at the way it narrates itself.

												The concept and setting are neat, the story and characters are written well. The artwork is okay-ish. Too bad the other parts aren't getting made, this one is sort of useless on it's own.Easy 100% achievements though.			"

												This game is so incredibly beautiful, I find it hard to believe that I got it for this cheap.It was made by the same people who created the iOS Visual Novel, Juniper's Knot, which I fell in love with at first sight.The soundtrack is amazing, the art is amazing, the visual effects are amazingHell, even the UI is amazing!When I closed the game for the first time, my only thought was:""My god, that was a beautiful button!""I would ABSOLUTELY reccommend this game to ANYONE, especially otaku like me who love a good story.I've only played this game for 10 minutes or so, but I'm already so head-over-heels in love with it that it's kinda scary.But really. Buy this game. Support the developers, so that they can continue this project and start new ones.Because all the work I've seen so far from them,Is ""utsukushii"".			"

												i quite liked the plot, characters, and themes of this visual novel, at least for the first portion of the story, and i was interested to see how the sequels would build on them. unfortunately the developers gave up at the beginning of the month after mismanaging employees and kickstarter money, and the artist for this first episode had already quit before then, so all that's left is a glimpse into what could have been a fairly mature science-fiction series. a real shame.

												Fantastic storyline, and outstanding sound track...My only regret; was not reading reviews and finding out that It's a cliff hanger, with no hope of being contenued...If you can handle that, it's so worth your time.			"

												I thought that this was decent the first time I played, but unfortunately it now needs to be viewed as a standalone effort. The sequel is on permanent hiatus and will probably never get made. As such, I don't recommend this visual novel anymore. It just doesn't really work on its own.			"

												This is a brilliant introduction to the visual novel genre. The dialogue is engaging, humorous and, best of all, carries serious connotations. If you enjoy fencing debates and making decisions that arguably carry more weight than Mass Effect 3 ever did, this is for you.			"

												It's pretty darn good. Pretty darn short, at the moment, but pretty darn good too. Biggest problem is that the production of the rest is halted indefinitely. Kickstarter is a dangerous undertaking by all accounts, and giving people who make stuff for fun a budget and expect them to run a business well just doesn't seem to pan out more often than not.This being said, I can only hope there's more to come. This was a pretty enticing taste of what's to come :/			"

												Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos was a promising beginning to what could have been a genuinely intriguing science fiction story. Points I especially liked were:- Interesting premise- Well-written female characters, complete with complex emotions and relateable motivations. - Characters and dialogue which were not written in boring black-and-white prose, but with varying shades of moral ambiguity woven through the narrative.By the end of the story, I was left wanting to discover more about the characters and in what way my decisions had influenced the trajectory of the plot... Sadly, since there will never be an Episode 2, so I'll never know.In summary: I liked what I saw, and will be keeping my eye on this development team in the future. Hopefully, the next one will be a story I can follow through to its actual conclusion.			"

												A superbly written story with solid characters and a great hook. Sadly, this game has been abandoned. Even just the first chapter is good enough I still recommend giving it a read, but prepare for disappointment as this is only the prologue to a story that, as of now, is not going to be written.
