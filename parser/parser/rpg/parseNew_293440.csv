												As an obvious homage to Zelda 2 for the NES, Elliot Quest largely succeeds, but a handful of serious flaws hamper what would otherwise be an easy recommendation. As such, I'd only recommend it to players who like the style of game enough to enjoy a budget version that falls short of its potential.Awkward and frustrating mechanics really cut down on the fun in leveling up and exploring. The low level cap prevents you from maxing your abilities. Experience loss on death punishes you for falling down some pits while others contain secrets. Several abilities only have a small chance to activate, meaning you will often die from something that you easily could have beaten if only your abilities had worked.Exploration also feels extremely limited and unrewarding. In contrast with other games of this style, Elliot Quest has you constantly running into walls instead of finding new areas to explore. Often you'll finally get past one barrier only to find another on the other side. Your eventual reward is then too little too late: mere coins or exp for finally getting through the area you've revisited three times.Elliot Quest is not a bad game, but it suffers from numerous rough edges that take quite a lot away from the parts that are supposed to be fun.

												I really, really wanted to recommend this game, but I just can't.  I've never been so torn between giving a thumbs up / thumbs down.  2d metroidvanias are my favorite genre, and even still this game was 60% fun, 40% frustration.  It was just *barely* more fun than frustrating.  That's not something I can feel good about recommending, unfortunately.Other reviewers have written about it in detail so I'll skip that, and just say that I abandoned it in the endgame, when I realized it was essentially impossible for me to beat the optional secret endgame bosses and get the good ending, because I hadn't maxxed out my magic skill.This game is a real shame; if the developers had spent just a liiiiittle more time on it then it could have been an indie classic.

												Elliot Quest is an exploration based platformer that borrows heavily from the platforming classics of yesteryear such as Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Kid Icarus, Metroid and Wonder Boy in Monster World. You play as Elliot, a young man with a troubled past, afflicted by a powerful curse. The story here is secondary and is conveyed through short, vague cutscenes and occassional flashes of internal dialogue. It has yet to draw me in and is so far nothing more than a simple backdrop for the game itself.Mechanically the game is very impressive and satisfying. You start with the simple ability to shoot and jump. Jumping is floaty and allows for change in trajectory mid jump which enables tricky platforming sections and the ability to fight in mid air. The arrows Elliot fires travel along a set arc rather than directly ahead allowing you to kill grounded enemies from above and calculate your aim. Killing enemies in succession fills a 'chain' meter in the bottom left of the screen which seems to increase your overall damage, of course it could be doing anything which leads me neatly to my next point.Elliot Quest in true old-school style presents incredibly little in the way of tutorial, granted there's not a lot you can do at the start, but simple keybinding would have been sufficient.  This becomes a greater problem later down the line however as new items and upgrades  don't even come with a line of text explaining what they do or to what extent. Additionally, the game contains no options whatsoever beyond adjusting audio levels. No remappable keys, no screen-size options, nothing. The game opens in a window by default which can be maximized but cannot enter fullscreen and while controller support exists it does not seem to allow control with the analogue sticks, these are, however, only minor criticisms.The game employs an overworld map with sidescrolling levels and enemy encounters (think Gargoyle's Quest on the gameboy).The metroidvanian influence becomes clear during the first level as I was soon presented with inaccessible secrets and shortcuts I would have to come back to later with enhanced abilities. Those who care to explore will be rewarded with many 'secret walls' and rooms containing treasure, all optional and all hidden. There are a number of collectibles to find including rare treasures which are housed in Elliot's trophy room and  11 crystals - I have no idea what either might do, but I want them all.The first dungeon boss bestowed upon me the power of the wind which can be used not only as a means of traversing new areas, but for combat aswell, allowing me to travel through enemies and stun them while still being able to fire arrows from within my mighty typhoon. Pretty much all spells and items thus far have had different uses in and out of combat making the upgrades you receive feel more meaningful as opposed to simply being a tool to beat the dungeon it was found in. The inspiration from the Zelda series is undeniable here from the dungeons, to the items ,even the aesthetic. And as expected, before long, I found ERROR sitting happily in one of the village houses.Graphically, the game creates a pleasing, simplistic pixel world with vibrant colours and a charming style. Nothing fancy here, and I wouldn't ask for any more. The soundtrack  by Michael Chait is well constructed with suitably archetypal tracks that scream 'dungeon, or 'town' or 'forest' (which if I didn't know any better was a straight rip from A Link to the Past's lost woods theme). Some of the compositions are very enjoyable to listen to and knowingly harken back to the 8-bit classics the game so heavily resembles.Mild rpg features such as exp and skill trees grant a sense of purpose to the never ending slaughter in which you will partake. Enemies respawn every time you exit and re-enter an area and many cannot be comfortaby avoided. The fact that even when revisiting an area for the umpteenth time and having to kill the same enemioes over and over, im still benefitting myself reduces much of the drudgery of backtracking. Additionally the passive abilities granted by the multiple skill trees can assist somewhat in combat and help to vary gameplay styles a little potentially aiding replayability. By the time the second town is reached the gold gained from backtracking and grinding can be put to good use for more meaningful equipment upgrades, Elliot keeps getting stronger and the pace never slows.Overall Elliot Quest is a fun, suitably challenging (the difficulty seemed to leap up after the first dungeon, compounded by the fact that health is scarce) adventure-platformer that should appeal greatly to sidescroller, Zelda and metroidvania fans. It's a little rough around the edges but the gameplay shines through. There's a meaty amount of content on offer here, rife with secrets, shortcuts and easter eggs. There are a few frustrations such as sometimes cheap insta-deaths (which can be a real pain late on in the game as dying results in loss of XP), and I got painfully lost on more than one occasion, but those looking for a challenge should feel right at home with Elliot Quest's old-school style of action platforming.=EDIT=Developer Ansimuz has continued to patch and update the game. Fullscreen option can now be toggled from the ingame pause menu. Game fixes and enhanced pixel resolution have also been added.Pros:+Nice overall difficulty+Exploration is fun and rewarding+Classic dungeon delving meets metroidvanian upgrade syatem+Clean pixel graphics+No hand-holdingCons:-No hand-holding-Backtracking can become a tedious memory game-Some music tracks border on plagiarism (overall nice)-Lack of polishScore: 8.5/10			"

												Elliot Quest is a side scrolling 2D action adventure with a low fidelity art style that adds a lot to enhance an already great game. There's a good blend of action, puzzle solving, exploring and traversal. A lot of what the game does, others have done before it with a few exceptions such as a whirlwind attack that pulls in enemies and items that also lets you cross large gaps or cut through green vines.You play as a boy named Elliot on his way to rescue Cara. Its a typical plot for a typical game. Every so often text will appear telling you about Cara or what she means to Elliot, but beyond that the story and plot are an afterthought.The time was spent in making little traversal puzzles that feel engaging. Defeating a snail and using its shell to get to a higher place. Throwing the body of a stone spitting octopus into purple goo to travel across. Rolling a giant bomb off a cliff are just a few ways the game turns the typical into engaging.Your primary weapon is a bow with short range arrows. Gravity affects your arrows and it turns the game into one of skill and finesse. There's a nuance to timing, gravity and enemy location that more games should have. Shooting off a cliff to have gravity take your arrow down onto an enemy is satisfying. At some point you can unlock a charge shot that launches the arrow straight forward with no drop off. This charge shot results in a critical hit every time rather than a small fraction of the time.Along the way you get a number of different items, skills and abilities. You gain a shield that you can use to block projectiles if you are standing still, a double jump feather, a shovel for digging, a lantern so you can see in caves and light other lanterns, a limited supply of bombs and much more. The only catch to the bombs is that they have to be purchased or found in a specific spot. So if you run out, you'll be headed back into a dungeon to replenish your supply. Defeated enemies will drop hearts or magic pellets to restore health and mana.While the game is a 2D side scroller for the most part, there is an overworld map with several locations some are hidden and you need to touch them before a bubble comes up indicating you can enter. There are a few towns, labyrinths and out of the way places to explore. In the labyrinths these are so big that you'll get a map indicating which room you're in. Its nice to have, because there's a lot you can miss and a lot that you'll need to come back for once you've got specific abilities. You'll have to scour a lot of places several times over.There are a couple of enemies on the overworld that you can run into. These enemies send you to one of a few random side scrolling battle zones. These zones are well thought out and can be little mazes by themselves. One has an old key for a house door, another has a bag. It adds exploration and intrigue to what could have been mundane.There are often labyrinths on your way to labyrinths; the second of which is the one with the boss fight. The boss labyrinths have keys and giant keys needed to unlock boss doors. Guardians can be found in select locations across both types of labyrinths.While you're scouring dungeons, you can come across heart containers that increase the maximum amount of your health and green elixirs to increase your maximum mana. Its a mechanic used it plenty of other adventure games, even action games and it helps give a sense that you're getting better. There are plenty of other things taken from its inspiration, but there's always a twist to them in order to make them feel fresh. Stone shooting octopi are only vulnerable when they're shooting at you. Slime will split into other slime.Make sure to push up against every wall, because there are frequent hidden areas that become visible only when you've found them. These are nothing mandatory, but they do contain plenty of chests with gold inside and collectible crystals. The gold itself feels near useless. There are only a couple of things worth purchasing in the entire game. Other than necessities, there are a few consumable items like red potions for health, green potions for mana and a feather to return you to the last save point. You can only carry two consumables at a time and often, I'd just forget that I have them.As you defeat enemies, you'll earn experience and once you get enough of it, you will level up and earn a skill point. With these points you can assign them to one of five stats: strength, wisdom, agility, vitality and accuracy for an improved chance of critical hits. Each stat can have a level of five with each level unlocking new or improved abilities. Strength is to shoot arrows farther, but at the third level, you can unlock a charge shot. Wisdom says magic orbs might give double the mana, and at the second level, your mana regenerates, level four spells do more damage and at five spells cost half. Agility improves your shooting rate, level four lets you run faster and level five lets you evade projectiles. Vitality says hearts may give double health, the second level takes half damage 15% of the time, at the fourth health regenerates and the fifth lets you take half damage 30% of the time.With all the great stuff that's here, the only real issue I have with the game is that it can be cryptic. The townsfolk are no help. Some things are self explanatory, but others such as catching a draft as a whirlwind to launch yourself up took me a few hours to understand that's what I needed to do. I was stuck looking and searching through every secret room looking for a double jump.There's often too much locked away from you at once. Since the game is open world, you can enter fifteen different areas, but only get so far in them before you need to head back. If you're stumped, taking a look back through each labyrinth for something you've missed just takes too long. Is that a bad problem to have though? At least the leveling up and experience mechanic meant that every time I explored the same area, I was still being rewarded.The only other downside that I can think of is there are no achievements or Steam overlay. Instead there's great music and a charming art style. I'll take the latter over the former.Elliot Quest is a wonderful game that scratches every itch for intelligent gameplay. Its well worth the price of admission, even if its been done in other games, Elliot Quest does it on par with its forefathers and surpasses them.			"

												Imagine playing Zelda 2, but instead of Link you play as Kid Icarus, and collect Metroid style power-ups.   Thats is Elliot Quest in a nut shell.   This game far surpassed my expectations in terms of how big it is, and how well designed it was as a Metroidvania.   Tons of secrets, optional bosses, and upgrades to find.   The game also has a leveling system that allows you to allocate points into various stats that yield various passive bonuses, although the max level isn't high enough to let you get everything, so decisions need to be made carefully.  Clearing the game and all of its final bosses took me about 20 hours, which is really good for a metroidvania, so good value for your money here.As far as negatives go, the in-game options are pretty weak.   There is no way to remap your controls, and the default ones are a little weird using SPACE to jump and D to shoot.   It's not enough to ruin the game or anything, but why wouldn't pick 2 buttons next to each other.   Also there is no explanation for many of the items you find telling you what they are and what they do.  Not a super big deal as many of them are obvious, but some of them have pretty obscure uses that may not be obvious at first,  like using ice to freeze wooden boxes?  Would have liked to see steam achievements as well.All of the positives far outweigh the negatives though.   The game is everything you could want in a metroidvania, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes these types of game or any Zelda 2 fan.			"

												A wonderful old school inspired game that's hamstrung by its obvious design inspirationsPros:- Graphically beautiful game - Music is great, there are hints of another game's music in the composition- Runs smoothlyCons:My biggest problem with this game is that there is literally no aid whatsoever as to what anything you find does. You get an item, what does it do, who knows. You get key item with a message ""you got key item X better store this at home"", what is this item and where is home who knows. There is no description\flavour text for any item or spell. Hell the game doesn't even tell you what the controls are. Is this fun, not for me it isn't and I'm from the NES era where I grew up playing a ton of jrpgs. My second issue is with the experience loss upon death, why is this here anyway. I really wish this MMO mechanic was not implemented as it makes makes levelling up a chore and a grind when you die as you lose huge chunks of XP.Another issue I have is the 'pay off' for finding chests. I really dislike that money is all you get from chests, normal chests give you small amount of money, blue chests require a blue key and gives you more money. To me this was extremely unfulfilling as there's nothing really to buy besides a few upgrades and potions.Verdict:- Did I enjoy my time yes and no. It was fun when it worked like a game, moving from dungeon to dungeon, discovering secrets and beating bosses and not when you're lost and frustrated as to where to proceed next. So who do I recommend this game to, those of you who are into old school games alone but in general I don't see my recommending to anyone else.			"

												Elliot Quest is essentially the second Zelda game, on the NES.It feels old, and it's intended. While it does have some more modern features (the checkpoints, for instance), it doesn't really try to do much beyond being a Zelda tribute, and a really hard one at that!I'll admit that I didn't finish the game, entirely. I beat the main story, but I gave up on the last ""end-game"" Boss, out of frustration. The pay-off wasn't very alluring either.The problem isn't the Boss itself, but all of the little problems around the game that make big fights a problem.I won't go into details about most of it, so don't consider a review. These are just some of my thoughts about the game, and one aspect that might make the game worth it, for you.If you're looking for that old-school, very hard experience, go for it! Including some of the very cryptic puzzles, and being lost and disorientated for hours.The game is somewhat like a metroidvania. You have an overworld separated into areas. Each area, then, is separated into other areas, these being gated by several of the items you will acquire on the adventure. It gets very confusing, because you'll see many ""gates"" throughout the areas, and when you get the item, you have no idea where the gate was. There are also many gates for little upgrades, to make matters even more confusing.Nothing too unusual for NES-like games.Anyway, my problem was mostly the checkpoint system: it doesn't restore your HP fully. Nor your mana. Only half of it. So, if you die in a boss, you'll be handicapped. The only way of getting HP/Mana then is either to kill enemies, or go into a town to buy potions/rest. You can imagine how incredibly frustrating this is. It's a waste of several minutes each time you die, if you want a decent shot at the later bosses!Not to mention you can only carry 2 potions at any time, and these are not replenishable at checkpoints. So yes, it's a far too punishing checkpoint system for me to bother with that one Boss fight. I endured through all the others, but after 5 bosses, the 6th one was too much. Death from a thousand cuts, I guess.So, rant is over. So far, you have my reasons for not enjoying it (well, the ultimate reasons, although there were several little reasons throughout -- old design. I don't like it, but I expected it from this game, so no hard feelings!)The thing that surprised me -- and the reason for me being writting about the game, right now -- was the end-game. Things you can do after you beat the story. Technically, you should do it before, but it's much harder than the final boss, so you might as well...Anyway, you can collect these little crystals that are very well hidden. Either hidden, or behind a very cryptic puzzle, and mostly isolated (as in, the game doesn't prepare you for those types of puzzles). It's cool. It's supposed to be hard, and the ultimate challenge.What I loved about it, was how ""grand"" it felt, in a way. I was simply exploring, after collecting some crystals, and saw a door that required crystals to enter (there are many). I entered a completely different area, and discovered even higher upgrades than the ones you encounter through the normal story. Then Bosses! I was pumped. It reminds me of the Legendary aspect of Pokemon, where you go into these secluded areas and find ancient monsters to either capture or simply beat.Plus hidden stores, etc.I wasn't expecting that at all and it seems like something games don't really do much, anymore. PC games, anyway. The whole end-game seems rather lost. The story guides you through all of the upgrades, and after you beat a game, there's isn't anything ""bigger"" beyond it.So yeah, sorry for ruining the surprise! Regardless, if this seems something you enjoy, get the game -- but know what you're getting into.			"

Elliot Quest is a fun ""metroidvania"" with little player guidance.You are liable to get stuck not knowing where to progress, attempting dungeons until you reach an obstacle requiring a new upgrade to progress or you'll look at a walkthrough.VisualsWith its simple and serviceable pixel art graphics, this game should run on most PCs. The aesthetics show an interesting juxtaposition of calm environments now infested with enemies.GameplayThe gameplay is fun and responsive. Be warned that gamepad control is done with the arrows not joystick (unless you use a 3rd party software to map the analog stick inputs to the arrows).If you enjoy TLoZ and Castlevania games you'll have some fun with a playthrough of Elliot Quest, there's quite a few upgrades to collect, secrets to find (you can take a look at our guide) and several bosses to fight.The biggest problems I found were the lack of direction and the backtracking needed to restock bombs. The first can be fine for fans of the genre, but it might push some newcomers away, the second just seems to be an error in the programming of the game. It has the same obfuscation problem as many rogue-lights where items are not explained.The game also has experience loss on defeat which could be a problem for people who are not great at platforming.For me, the outstanding feature was the extra boss fights. Trying out your spells and weapons to figure out how to damage them while having to dodge their attacks was enjoyable, even if 2 of the game's bosses took me over 10 attempts to defeat.AudioMusic is ok, but some special effects (particularly the spike shell enemies' ring) are overly loud to the point of it being astringent.StoryThe story is simple, but it seems like they were going for a shadow of the collosus vive and didn't write enough story to sell it. The ""Good"" ending has satisfactory, even if it isn't the happy ending some might want.The ""Karma"" system is very basic and has no nuance, so expect to end up with the neutral ending if you don't act 100% one way from the start.Quality and ReplayabilityThe game is missing a some polish in multiple areas and the developers have evidently no interest in fixing those things. Some examples:  There are many spots of incomplete content, for example collectibles hidden behind doors that can't be opened or keys with no purpose.  Bomb drops from crates which explode on discovery rather than allowing the player to pick them up.  Cutscenes which can't be skipped (reduce the enjoyment when re-trying boss fights)  Bugs leading to Elliot getting stuck in walls  Errors in physics**You can you can move objects using your arrows and pushing them against some ""inmovable"" objects makes them slide on the ground.There is no real reason to play through it twice as New Game+ is basically just hard mode, you could look at the other of the 3 endings, but there is not much difference to it. And there's an arena you can unlock, though there are no rewards tied to it.The addition of Achievements would help guide the player and give purpose to some of the unused systems.Conclusion/TL:DRThe game should be fun enough for fans of the genre, and I expect there's enough game to justify the money, especially if it is purchased during a sale.Just be warned that the game shows cut corners and lack of polish in some areas, as would be expected from its source.

Elliot Quest is a great neoretro game.  It's got beautiful big-pixeled graphics with a soothing earth tone palette.  The music is very nice.  The gameplay follows the framework of its primary inspiration, the unfairly snubbed Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, while outdoing it in nearly every way:  better challenge balance, ten times the enemy diversity, a more sensible level-up system, the list could go on.  The most impressive thing is that though Elliot Quest is astoundingly organic (no copy-paste), the game is very long, with tons of hidden content to uncover (extra bosses, secret items, etc.)So taken was I with Elliot Quest that I was on the verge of calling it the next Cave Story -- that is, until I reached the tired, brief, depressing ending.  It made me very sad, because it undercut the rest of the game so much!  And I even got the ""good"" ending (apparently, it gets worse)!  As fun as the ride was, I will probably never play this again because of the hateful and hackneyed finale.  Childish?  Perhaps, but I believe that an epic fantasy quest calls for an appropriately epic conclusion, and anything less is unacceptable (a SHMUP or an arcade brawler shouldn't have to worry much  about this, obviously, though it should still not end in a needlessly depressing manner).  Dumb ending aside, you should get this lovingly handcrafted game when it is on sale; it fills the Adventure of Link niche like no other modern game I've played and we need more like it.			"

												I want to like this game, but I can't.  It has nothing to do with the presentation or story, but with how horribly broken it is.  Maybe this only affects the linux version, but the controls consist of spacebar, directional keys and D, with no way at all to change it.  This is simply not a control scheme that works.  Controller support is also almost entirely lacking, with only a handful of keys mapped to my logitech pad, not including movement, and again, no configuration at all.  There isn't even a way to display it fullscreen.  Sorry, but this gets a thumbs down from me until it gets fixed.			"

												I can still remember the birthday I got Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. Being a huge fan of the original, I was so excited to dig into the sequel despite knowing nothing about it. For years it was one of my biggest NES disappointments, being too hard and too confusing for my elementary-aged self. I've learned to appreciate it in the intervening years, as well as similar games from the era like Simon's Quest and Journey to Olympus. I only bring this up because Elliot Quest has done an amazing job of refreshing all those memories, good and bad alike.You play Elliot, a terminally ill youth on a quest to maybe save himself through divine intervention. There's a pretty rich and developed world to explore that contains four guardians that might have the key to saving Elliot's life, and it's your job to guide him through those forgotten places, and the cliffs and caves that lead to them, mostly unscathed. The world map is huge, with tons of locations of interest, side areas, secret areas, and even enemy encounters.Elliot's default weapon is a bow that fires in an arc, but you gain experience from enemies that can be used to upgrade your attack (and movement and health and magic) that can make it fire faster or straighter. You'll also pick up magic spells, items like bombs and potions, and abilities like double jumps from the many locales you visit. Almost every single area has alternate paths and secrets accessible only with the right powers, so you'll have plenty of reasons to revisit parts of the world.There are SO many paths and secrets, in fact, that it can often be hard to tell where you're supposed to go next. My main complaint about Elliot and his Quest is the difficulty, and it's a two-fold issue. The game dumps you in a wide-open world with a fairly clear path to the first temple, but after that there are tons of caves and forts and forests and cliffs that may or may not be the path ahead. You'll need to be very familiar with your abilities to know how to proceed, and many of them are creative enough to make that difficult. Your reward from the first major area, for example, is unlike most powers found in platformers and takes a good bit of experimentation to understand.Even if you know where you're going, though, there's no guarantee you can get there alive. Elliot Quest can be very difficult at times, with a major spike around the second temple that came as a shock to me. Some enemies are posed in ways that make them almost impossible to avoid, and invincible enemies start appearing with more and more frequency the further in you get. Checkpoints are plentiful but you lose XP every time you die, a particularly brutal punishment considering how challenging some sequences can be. After a few hours my problem wasn't so much where to go, as my options being almost too difficult to face.It's pretty remarkable how faithfully Elliot Quest follows in The Adventure of Link's footsteps, down to the confounding levels and difficulty spikes. They're both games that demand a lot of time and attention to appreciate, but are undeniably worth it in the end. Elliot Quest has an absurd amount of secrets and side content to uncover, all presented in charming pixel graphics and pleasing ambiance. If you like your retro platformers challenging and engrossing, you'll get all that and then some here.			"

												40+ hours so far. The most frustrating feature of this game is the obscurity. Controls are L-shift, S, D, Esc, Enter, Space, and arrows and cannot be changed. They are not explained in the game. The max level is 20 for a total of 19 upgrades. This was not explained beforehand. I could not figure out how to progress at one point until I tried using an item in a slightly different way. And I only just realized what an item I found days ago even does.But this is where the lack of explanation in-game enters the gray area of pro/con. To some, it's a barrier. To others, it becomes an invitation to experiment and explore. I was incredibly frustrated while I was stuck, but when I progressed it was extremely satisfying. I've died again and again trying to find out how to even damage some of the later bosses. But slowly learning their weaknesses and taking them down has been incredibly rewarding. The exact order in which to explore the progressively open map is a little foggy, but the overall direction is clear. Exploration is where the game truly shines. Many areas are more accessable than they first seem. Enemies can be tackled with more practice as opposed to more items. Many puzzles are solved not by finding a new upgrade but by creative use of Elliot's existing abilities. There are many side areas with their own rewards, and one or two decisions for Elliot to make that will stay with him for the rest of the game. There are always multiple uses for an upgrade. None of them are spelled out, but some are made clear by the design of the area they are found in. The clever puzzles make yet more applications for Elliot's powers clear.In summary, this is a game that is difficult to get into at the start due to the complete, *absolute*, UTTER lack of hand holding. But it quickly builds momentum and continues building it the longer you play. For those who enjoy exploring their surroundings, their alternatives, and the hidden mechanics of their game world, this is an experience I can't recommend highly enough.			"

												Elliot Quest is one of the best games I've played this year.  Playing through it, you can tell that a lot of heart was put into making this game.  The sense of exploration in Elliot Quest is far greater than any other game I've played recently.  It keeps pulling you back to find out where else you can go and what else you can find now that you've gotten the next powerup.  The art style is wonderful and unique, and the music and sound effects are great, too (there are also some well-placed Link to the Past references).  The game does sometimes fault in not explaining enough of what is going on, but I feel this is better than erring on the side of explaining too much and ruining the chance for discovery and exploration.

												It's a metroidvania, it's a good game but a lil' bit frustrating because:1. Lack of information on the dugeon maps ui, I mean why not display on those maps info from rooms you already visited like: keys, doors, crystal gates...  2. You're forced to walk way too much even if you don't get lost (which will happen) this is one of those games you wish for a teleport ability that you can use to quickly move to locations already visited, even if you only get it later in the game it would make the game 100x more enjoyable.3. Bombs, they don't drop from monsters/ objects if you run out of bombs inside dungeons it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥because you have to go back to the town, walk to the shop, buy more bombs, walk back to the dungeon and then you have to remember where the * is the room that had that breakable block/wall.This isn't an option but consider my recommendation as Neutral.

												Quite good old-school action-adventure game, somewhere between Legend of Zelda II (which I still maintain was a great game) and Kid Icarus.It also does not hold your hand at all - there is no tutorial or explanation of what buttons do what.  I don't mind this at all, but I wish there were a manual for two reasons - one, I'd love to see the flavor text it would incorporate.  Two, I can't figure out how to make it go full-screen or how to turn on v-sync, and I am getting some tearing at the bottom of the screen.Still, despite those small flaws, definitely recommended.

												Context: at time of review, 10 hours in. just at the 3rd dungeon. Spending most of my time trying to hunt down the various secrets/powerups I can get to w/ my current kit.A Fun but Very Hard metroidvaina, which takes a lot of cues primarily from Zelda. LOTS of secrets & powerups to hunt down, although most of the majority of them are just gold drops. There is a leveling system, where ea. level you allocate a point to strength (range), wisdom (magic), vitality (health), agility (fire rate/move speed), or accuracy (random crit chance). Game works on a save point system, die or quit & you restart at the last save point you touched. the Savepoints give you a base amount of hearts/mana... and the only drawback to dying is you lose current xp to next level.  Developers obviously expected you to die somewhat frequently, and then retry ala platformers like VVVVVV. There is also a morality system, based on a limited set of choices you make thru the game (save this kid, partner with this evil guy, do/don't rob this temple). It's pretty low key though; and you can pretty much ignore it for the most part. The game is light on explaining its mechanics, while the basic function of most of the items is pretty straightforward, you'll need to experiment a bit to figure out everything they can do. That could be a plus or a minus, depending on your preference, if you hated Dark Souls cryptic item descriptions, you might hate Elliot Quest's lack of almost any direction too.Graphics are obvious retro-pixely, but they're clean and attractive looking. Think classic NES style, but with more detail. Music is ok, but not spectacular and the 1st level is a very obvious rip off of a Zelda theme.Bottom line, if you like metroidvanias and don't mind a bit of a challenge, give it a go.			"

												Did you enjoy playing Zelda 2? If so, you will like this.  If not, you're probably going to be frustrated and get stuck in the first area. The art and music are enjoyable, the obstacles and secrets are mostly well done, and I feel glad I took the chance and bought it. There's a lot of stuff to find (and miss) and it's enough to warrant two or maybe even three playthroughs.Overall, I had a good time with this game and I would recommend it. If you don't like NES games, then this will be outside the range of your enjoyment.			"

												The most important thing in my opinion is that this kind of games REQUIRES a good TRACKING SYSTEM, but Elliot has none, you just find something and then you feel like ""what to do now?"" all the time, and I pesonally don't like games that needs google to find out what to do next, you need google even for the description of some basic items! I really wanted to recommend this game and I really wanted to like it, but after finding out that you can miss some items and that there is a level cap after I spend my points (and you can't reset your points), it made me quit it.Maybe I'll try it later, but I don't feel playing this game 3 full times just to get the 3 endings.Elliot Quest is a superb game but it's lacking some basic features to make it really enjoyable.

												If you're searching for a game like Zelda 2, you have found it!Surely you will enjoy this game...but, there are some problems!The max level of experience you can reach is 20.For each lvl you gain a point you can spend to upgrade a stats.There are 5 stats (stregnt/agility/magic/vitality/critic) and a max of 5 point to distribute each.So.... you can't max all the stats, you can only gain 20 points through all the game!If you want to play and enjoy the game, finding all the secrets (items/places/boss)I recommend you to MAX the MAGIC stats because it's essential! (you can't reassign the exp points).Nice pixel art.Nice music.Obviously it's an hard and challenging game.			"

												There are too many things wrong with this for me to recommend it. A game like this needs good controller support, but the current support is rubbish and glitchy. The control schheme is unbearable on keyboard and the lack of a settings screen makes that worse. Thheres no tutorial or anything, which isnt necessarily a bad thing, but more intuitivity on thhe map and menu screens could hhelp that out. The game itself is fun, the difficulty is not too bad, but the strong lack of checkpoints is ridiculous. I understand the appeal for perhaps those who wishh to chhallenge themselves, but this is not the 20th century where checkpoints are difficult to work into games for whatever reason, leaving them out does not help an aesthetic it hurts gameplay. The lack of checkpoints can put you back 2 - 3 minutes of gameplay, and up to even 5 if you wish to be thorough like me. And this is only at the beginning of the game, I do not know how much worse it gets late game. If there were better controls, many more checkpoints, and a bit more intuitiveness I may not have ragequit as many times as I did.			"

												I wasn't entirely sure what I was expecting going in.  There was talk of the game being inspired by Zelda II, but sometimes it's just small influences.The influence is not small in this one.  It's very much structurally like Zelda II, and a bit of Kid Icarus as well.  Add in a leveling system, and you've got you a nice game here.Graphically, I liked the look of a lot of the areas.  I wish that it was a little less pixelated, but it all works well in motion.  The soundtrack is heavily inspired by Nintendo classics.  I couldn't help but catch some of the same beats as the Lost Woods and Hyrule Castle from A Link to the Past, Gerudo Valley from Ocarina of Time, and the Palaces in Zelda II.  Truly, the game's inspirations are open.Fittingly, though, there's quite a bit of puzzle solving as well through inventory items acquired throughout the game.  In this way, it takes after Zelda games made after Zelda II.  There's even an item that lets you pull some Mighty Switch Force-style shenanigans.  It's not all perfect, of course.  If you're going for the ""good"" alignment, you're going to run into a few bosses that are brutal.  I highly recommend not doing what I did and going critical-heavy, but instead at least maxing out wisdom to get the 1/2 MP cost and double-powered spells.  The bosses that gave me fits would have dropped quickly in the face of that combination.It's also not always clear which cliffs you can safely jump off of.  There's a spot between the second and third temples that I got stuck.  Just realize that even if it doesn't look like you have the item to cross a particular area, you can fall down to the bottom and pick up another needed item.Another issue is that it saves your progress even after you die.  So if you're taking on a really tough boss, and you use a potion and die, it's going to save that.  It can be frustrating in the more difficult areas...  but again, I think a lot of that is on my build.  It's not impossible by any stretch.Truly, though, if you want to be entertained by a excellent action-RPG that doesn't crib as much from Metroid as a lot of other modern indies, this is the one to give a shot.  You'll probably get around 25 hours out of it (my total doesn't reflect five hours in offline mode for some reason), and for the price, well, that's hard to beat.  Kudos to the dev on this one!			"

												What an unexpectedly fantastic little (big) game! As others have mentioned, this does have a Zelda 2 vibe. But, expect to enjoy a Metroid vibe as well. Lots of exploration for loot and upgrades. The game throws you into the environment, and the world is your oyster! You can make it as difficult or as smoothe as you'd like, depending on what stats in which you invest and progressive upgrades you have.So, the easiest way I've found to outline a game's points is to list the pros and cons...Pros:- 8-bit feel with near-modern control scheme- Lots of exploration, lots of upgrades, lots of secrets- Great boss fights...and lots of 'em. There are 4 main dungeons before unlocking the last, but plenty of other side dungeons. Each dungeon comes with at least 1 boss; some have mini-bosses as well. It's a weird construct, but it definitely works.- It's unconventional. Yes, it resembles Zelda 2 and Metroid, but it has its own style. It doesn't hold your hand...it has very little in-game prompting. You need to discover things for youself.Cons:- Honestly, I really can't think of any. For an indie title, it feels polished and rewarding...Great job!In summary, for $10 and nearly 24 hours until the final cutscene  (not 100% - other higher level areas to explore), this game pays dividends. That's what I love about Steam. These little-known games creep into your ""Recommended"" list, and, after perusing the reviews, you're enjoying another hidden gem! Pick it up; give it a try.Just an addendum with regard to another game Elliot Quest feels like...not the difficulty...the construct. Dark Souls. There were only a few, but, in the negative reviews, a common ""complaint"" existed...unreachable areas and circuitous routes to backtrack. In its defense, the game is intentionally designed to have barriers between sections of the world. And, after exploration and lots of enemy fights, shortcuts begin to appear...much like Dark Souls. The first playthrough of an area is a real challenge, twisting your character through a maze. But, as you unlock the shortcuts, the map and game design begin to unfold before your eyes. I view this as a postive for sure!			"

												Beautiful, Challenging, but Ultimately FrustratingThis game is so close to being a classic. It's clearly influenced by the likes of Zelda 2, Super Metroid, Kid Icarus, Castlevania and Demon's Crest. It's got a great visual aesthetic, music, and game feel. The world, villagers, and monsters all feel great. The bosses are challenging, and have respawn points beside them if you mess up and need to retry.However, there's a lot of frustration in this game. First, there's no instructions to tell you what the controls of the game are. There's only movement, shoot, jump, and secondary item (arrows, D, spacebar, S) so you'll figure them out pretty quickly, but that's still not great. Could have just been a quick screen accessible from the main menu, even if they weren't remap-able. There's also a lot of unexplained things in the game. Your new abilities are always unexplained. I can sympathize with not wanting to hand-hold, and have condescending tutorials like most modern games have, but you can't just chop them out of the game. The powers could have had a short little cutscene, ala Megaman X, that show your guy using the new power. You'll probably figure it out in a minute or two, but it's still annoying. A really bad one, is that there's an unexplained level-cap in the game. So you'll be playing along, thinking that eventually you'll be able to fill out all the little level-up skills, that are all shown from the beginning of the game in your inventory screen. Instead, you'll eventually hit the cap, and find out that you spent your level-ups wrong, because you didn't know you'd run out.The real killer, however, is the sheer volume of time-wasting you'll do in the game. There's no quick-travel in the game, and almost no short-cuts, so you'll spend a lot of your time back-tracking through levels you've already traversed numerous times. I know the games I listed as references have backtracking, but in this game it's a lot worse. It's aggravated by not knowing where to go, your character's painfully slow movement speed on ladders, and slow walking speed. Finally, there's the time wasted by the economy in the game. There's some plot-essential things you need to buy, which need hundreds of coins. However, you'll only be scraping a few dozen coins per hour of real-time, from the enemies and crates in the game. There's some one-time bonus coin-chests in the game, but those really just feel like a reminder of the stupid grinding you're doing for gold, rather than something to be excited about. Plus, they're usually locked behind some metroidvania-style doors and item-requirements, so they also serve the purpose of confusing and annoying you, because you thought there was going to be some useful item behind that locked door, or a new area to explore. Instead, it's just a handful of coins.If I were to wave a magic wand, I'd get rid of the coins in the game. Just have the villagers who sell you things, instead make you use your metroidvania abilities in a small little mini-dungeon, or room in their house. I'd also make your level-ups tied to main-plot progress, and maybe a couple hidden optional items, instead of killing monsters for exp. Actually, the chests that used to contain coins would now contain level-up items (and maybe some ability-items), since I've gotten rid of the coins. Finally, I'd make your character move faster on ladders, and throw in a fast-travel system, like Super Mario World, or Shovel Knight. (Actually, Shovel Knight is a good comparison, because I have 8 hours in that game and 100% of the secrets. After nearly 8 hours of Elliot quest, I'm about 1/3 done the game.)Unfortunately, I don't have a magic wand, so I just have to recommend not playing this game. :C			"

 < Disclaimer!! I got this game for free for reviewing purposes  A Spectacular Pixelated metroidvania adventure, If you are into platformers of that type you might be quite interested in this game. Elliot Quest is a really good game that I enjoyed a lot, One of the best features about it is that, It takes a lot of time to complete, And you'd spend a bit more to replay the game and get another ending. The level designs are splendid, The graphics and animations are very good, The game music are outstanding .. just outstanding, Reminds me sorta of Alundra+FFV mix. A new fresh feature that this game has, Is that its both an Rpg in its looks and a platformer, You get inside levels as a 2d platformer, And when exiting the world map it looks like it is in the 4th Screenshot on the steamstore page ( Which is like FinalFantasyV ), Which is really good and has a lot of places and secret areas to discover, And also monsters to encounter which enters you in a small level and fight a few enemies to get gold and what not. The game has a lot of monsters, A lot of abilities and stuff to unlock and find and kill, A good set of bosses and levels.Seriously there are a LOT of things to discover in this game, The levels are so big. And its a metroidvania so you'd get skills (DoubleJump being an example) And go back to previous parts in the game that you couldn't access before. With many places to explore, There are a few villages, In which you can talk to people and buy items and weapons.I like the creepy way talking npc's keeps staring at you and following you with their sight. Another remarkable part, Is how the game starts with your character being slow, Really slow but as you kill monsters and level up you pick upgrades, Str-Agi-Wis...etc  which can make you either run faster or shoot faster or having better range and a lot more, Gives the game this (progressive) feeling. A bow is an interesting weapon to have in a game like this, Kinda hoped i'd get something other than it but it develops also so that's nice. The game left everything basically ""Unknown"" Which is for you to figure out, There is no explanation so figure stuff by yourself, Makes it a bit harder and frustrating at parts but not taking it too far. There is also the matter of ""Choices matter"" In the game you get to choose certain things in the story and your actions, Which leads to different endings, Not quite sure how many endings are there really. So here is the other Part. I might made the game seem perfect right now I apologize, Its not. Here is whats not so good. First : There is the story .... and how the game starts, You start in a level, The left side is an exit to the world map the right side is a forest.So if you go left, You'll find yourself in a huge world map and get so confused on where you're actually supposed to go and question the dev's thinking and why they did this.And the story, It does not explain to you anything, Just starts with a small line and keeps revealing itself as you go on.But really ? That's not enough, And when you go talk to the villagers you hear them like "" Wth are they even talking about and how do they know me"", Because you don't even know what you're doing.And I'm sad to say that the story kinda is vague and dumb until the very end, Finished the game and still have no idea wth just happened exactly.  Second : There is the difficulty, Although this game is quite long and impressive but its really easy.( I Don't think this acts as a spoiler ) There is a (ChargeShot) Attack, And let me just say if you use this at a boss it will die from 2 hits, Which is stupid they shouldn't make it possible to hit bosses with it, However the enemy part in the game is thankfully not easy, Just the bosses are really really easy even the last one. Third : I feel like the game consumes so much of my Cpu, Note that i tried it on my mid-gaming laptop and Pc, And still there was this frame-drop issue at certain levels, While working perfectly at everywhere else on my Pc, There are a few places where it just has to drop to 45-55 ish rate. Fourth : I kinda feel a little bit clunkiness in the game, Like while finishing an action or opening a place, The character takes time to continue moving and to do other actions, And while  pushing rocks, thats when it feels really clunky Fifth : It really sucks that this game has no achievements, Its screaming for it.And there is also the matter of not being able to take screenshots due to the game not functioning with steam-overlay. So to sum it up for light readers.  Pros 1 - Amazing level designs and animations.2 - Spectacular music and effects.3 - Long time to finish and many places to explore.4 - Secrets, Monsters, Abilities, Bosses they're all good.  Cons 1 - Lack of achievements.2 - Feels a bit too easy.3 - Steam overlay not functioning.4 - Story seems vague and not done right.5 - A few frame drops  ( This might not happen to other systems I believe )  So overall.A very fun platformer game that is long and beautiful, Similar to good'ol metroidvania games we all love.Recommended for those who'd enjoy this type of platformers and wants to spend time on such game.

												Although it might show I have played onlly 84 minutes on steam I have actaully played it for more than 10 hours including the time spent in playing the demo and the alpha. After finishing the alpha I was eagerly waiting to play the full game. I have been playing it non stop and even if it means playing it from the start again, I dont mind playing it all over again. Since I havent player any of the metroid or zelda games I was eagerly waiting for something to quench my curiosity. I cant cant say any hing bad about Elliot Quest. From the Art style, to the Music, to the Gameplay this is the most fun I have had playing any game in a looooong time. I mostly play AAA titles and play few independent games from Capy Bara and Klei. These days I seems to enjoy playing more indie games than AAA titles. With their big price tag and their buggy gameplay it completely ruins the fun. But I bought Elliot Quest for a mere 6$ on indie gamestand and if there was a editors version I would buy this game again eventhough it not by a big game developer. In fact the art, code and design for was by one person. Even at 10$ this is a steal and an absolute no brainer. You wont be dissapointed. One small gripe of mine would be that it doesnt have steam save so I have to replay the game again if I switch between mac and PC. That is only since I have played a good bunch on the game in alpha. But you know what? that it is still fine. I will play it again a second time. If you are a fan of retro games and platformers and enjoy good gameplay you must buy Elliot Quest.  I give it a 9/10.

												really wanted to like this game, but man is it poorly designed. I get that they wanted to do the overworld thing and tease future abilities by blocking progress, but they do it ALL THE DAMN TIME. Literally every stop on the map when you start the game with the exception of the village is a progress blocker, so you go in- turn around and leave. With no explanation.There might be a really solid game behind the first 30 minutes- but I don't even care enough to find out anymore.			"

												If you like to walk randomly around for hours with no direction from the game just hoping you might figure out what you are supposed to be doing and pick up random items that you are told absolutely nothing about what they do or what they are used for than you'll love it!Although it can be and is a really fun game if you can forgive the major shortcomins.

												Zelda II: Elliots awakening.  A far more gorgeous version of a NES classic.  Has the same crippling difficulty.  Doesn't provide any hand holding to a fault.  Yet once you complete a task that killed you 17 times, you breath a sigh of relief.  Not for anyone looking for an easy ride, or those prone to throwing controllers.  I hope for a sequel!Pros: Zelda 2 beautifully reimagined, yet unique in it's own right.  Huge number of secrets.  Well thought out bosses, level design.  Tough yet rewarding gameplay.Cons: These are not game breakers, rather quips that are worth mentioning: No item explanation, Sometimes it's tough to figure out where to go.  Bombs can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get, Level cap, No ability to redistribute skill points 9/10  Highly recommended!			"

												Elliot Quest is an action game that uses elements from metroid and the classic zelda games. You start the game with just a weak ranged attack, over the course of the game you can upgrade your gear multiple times and find powerful magic attacks. Like in metroid you often need special items or ability to progress but because the map is just the right size it is easy to find the correct way (sometimes by trial and error). On top of that it controls well (with a keyboard) and has a great soundtrack, the bossfights are excellent and the levels are challenging, you als have an rpg like level system that allows you to customize your skills.However the game is a little rough around the edges:-the game has only limited controller support and doesn't accept the analog stick for movement.-exploring at the start and finding money chests feels great, but after a while you have so much gold that exploring feels like a waste of time. -the game has additonal content that is locked behind doors that only open if you have collected enough crystals, it feels bad to make it through a difficult cave to just end up at something that is a dead end at the moment. -the game always auto-saves after a death, that is annoying because if you used potions before your death and couldn't beat the boss you have to go back all the way to the city to buy yellow potions again, that is a huge waste of time. -it is possible to enter areas that you can't beat, for example it is possible to enter the ""black and white cave"" way before you can beat it which leads to an unavoidable death.-the first magic upgrade you get blocks every source of damage other than things that insta-kill you, allowing you to ""cheat"" your way through levels.Conclusion: Elliot Quest is a good game that is worth the asking price, if it was more polished it would be a great game.

												This game is really fun.  It's graphics and music fit the gameplay exactly.  It is similar to NES games, so you just load up the game and start playing.  It isn't going to waste your time with tutorials or explainations of what most stuff does.  The game is pretty large with many optional areas and it is somewhat challenging, but not so hard that any normal person wouldn't be able to complete the game in a reasonable number of times.			"

												TL:DR -- Go!  Find!  Fight!  Level up!  Backtrack!  Win!I am really enjoying Elliot's Quest from Ansimuz.I won't waste time talking about the plot, because I think the real value of this game is in the playing experience.  Elliot's Quest is a fairly straight-forward game where you go around, kill stuff, level up, find new equipment, and find new abilities.  There are two wrinkles, though: 1) the game never tells you where to go or what to do, and 2) there is a fair amount of backtracking to earlier areas to make use of new skills & equipment.The actual play is firmly rooted in the old NES game, Zelda II, even down to the little inns where you can refill your health.  HOWEVER, Elliot's Quest has a lot of newer sensibilities, like frequent savepoints, that make the game a joy to play.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but it's just a terribly frustrating experience. Pick up something I presume to be a potion, what is it? No idea. Consume it, nothing happens. Huh, I guess it's a health potion as I was at full health and nothing happened. Doesn't matter, as you will never find another one. Pick up a scroll, what does it do? No idea, as it's not even in your inventory. Pick up some sort of amphora vase, game text tells me I better keep it at home.. mmm, ok? But it's not in my inventory! And I won't even go into the rest.. Frankly, I'd like my money back..			"

												It's an excellent game. A fun and difficult platformer. Good music and style. I like it.But it's incredibly buggy. It's built in JS with an HTML5 engine and I've had no end of game breaking bugs and floor clipping. Random behaviour. Playing through it on another platform I broke through the floor and it autosaved in an unrecoverable way and had to delete my save file from near the end of the game. Maddening.It also does not in any way work in the Steam Link. White screen and crashing.So the game is good, but it's plagued by technical problems and is no longer supported.			"

												Man, this is a tough one to give a thumbs up or down, and I'd say I'd give it 1.5 thumbs up, due to what could have been a truly amazing game that is held back by some curious decisions on the developers part, some of which could have been fixed by a week's worth of programming. Overall, the game is gorgeous, and the music is a good homage to the bit tunes of yesteryear. The gameplay is solid, with good 2D shooting action, and the level up system is very good and dynamic. The boss fights are fun and each one is different, and each area gives you a different feel, but now for the bad points.1. This game does not hold you hand, in the slightest. While hand-holding (I'm looking at you, Navi) is generally discouraged in games nowadays, I'd still like to know what the heck I am doing, or what a powerup does that I just got. Occasionally, the game will tell you, but othertimes it doesn't. I picked up this book atop a mountain that, after completing the game, I still have no clue what it does. Further, when the game starts, there's basically no cutscene or story, you just find yourself in a forest (more on this later) and have no idea what is going on. I went to the left, and before I knew it was on the overworld map, wandering around aimlessly. Eventually I went back and did the area, but this happens ALOT in this game. You'll explore and explore until you are blue in the face, only hitting wall after wall until you give up and look online where you are supposed to go next. Also, once, I went through this temple and afterwards it said a new area had opened for me in the East. Where? What area? A little cutscene or a show on the map would have helped tremendously. This game desperately needed an Exclamation point on the Overworld just to tell you where you can go next. All the great open world exploration games do this. Fallout 3, Zelda games, Skyrim...They all tell you where you can go next if you get bored or lost, but don't force you to go there. This is a simple feature that, if the developer makes a 2.0, I'd highly recommend.2. The leveling system: Now, before I said the leveling system was good in its inner workings, but in the way that you level, I feel it is broken. When you die, you lose a % of your XP earned on the current level. AND all the enemies respawn. There were many times where I was stuck in an area that I had gotten too deep into (got halfway through and got a save stone) and then realized I was over my head and tried to go back, only to die a bunch and lose a bunch of XP. Or, in tough dungeons, you will die alot to monsters and traps, and so halfway through the game I realized I had to go to the next area, and it was kicking my butt. So then I had to farm for XP. Luckily, I discovered an exploit in the mountains where you can grind a level for only a few minutes of grinding, but this should not have happened. Half the problem is that when you go to a save point, you only get half health and half magic. The original Metroid did not refill your health at save stations, and there is a reason no game has imitated it since. It either leads to boring grinding for health, or that you die alot. So when you die, these three things happen: 1. Lose some XP, 2. Enemies respawn, 3. Down to half health and half magic. This means that it is very easy to get into death cycles, and get behind in the XP game. My simple suggestion to the developer would be to simply eliminate the lose in XP AND to give full health at save stones. Or least create two difficulty settings, where the easier one did as I suggested.3. The story. Now, I love stories where you wake up and know nothing and it is slowly revealed to you who you are and why you are here. My favorite game of all time is System Shock 2, and it did this, but it needs to make sense, or at least have some story to start you out with. This game literally just starts. Bam. Time to play. That's ok, but it doesn't make sense from a story perspective, since, as it becomes revealed, you didn't have amnesia or anything, and thus should have known the story from the beginning. Now I am not opposed to telling the story over the course of the game to not bog-down the beginning, but something would have been nice. Some little cutscene, 20 seconds. Even Sonic 3 has a small cutscene at the beginning. Later, in dungeons, alot of the story is told in text while you are playing, and half the time I miss it, but it is so vague that it doesn't make sense until almost the end of the game. Again, my suggestion to the developer would be to add a simply 20 second cuscene at the beginning so that the player can get their bearings as to the general plot.4. The final boss fight: The final boss fight is probably the most boring slog of a boss fight you will ever face. Once you figure out his patterns, he is easy, but he has like 8 different attacks, and, if I understand correctly (looked at an walkthough online), you can only damage him on ONE of them. And they are totally random. You can go for 5 minutes not being able to attack him, and man does that get boring fast. And that one time her actually does the attack you can hurt him on, and you screw up and do no or little damage? Well, welcome to 5 more minutes of not being able to attack him. It...just...won't...end. It is also disappointing that, over the course of the game, you gain all of these spells, but only one of them actually does anything in the battle.  My suggestion to the developer is to change the random % that procs the attack you can actually damage him to 50%, or at least 25%, but it feels like right now it is somewhere between 5-10%, and that makes the battle drag on forever.5. A Warp System: This game deperately needed the ability to warp to and from locations. Sometimes, you get stuck in a place that is too tough for you, and you just want out, but you're stuck. A few key areas, containing portals, would have been awesome. One time, I climbed this tall mountain full of tough enemies and I finally ascended to find a strange building, and when I went to open it...It's locked, and I don't have the key. So now I have to scramble down the mountain, find the key, and go back up, AGAIN. If, by climbing, I had activated a portal, so that I would never need to climb again, not having the key would not have been so annoying as it was.So, after all of that, why do I recommend this game? Overall, the game was fun, but exceptionally frustrating at parts, and while some of the deeper game elements could be improved, my main gripes with the game where simple things, some of which would require very little effort to fix, and thus aren't deep-rooted problems. It's unfortunate these problems made it through playtesting. Thus my recommendation has an * attached. If you like this style of game, you will like Elliot Quest, but until these problems are resolved in 2.0, it will be annoying to play it.			"

												Elliot Quest is a game I can't recommend enough for fans of the metroidvania genre.Pros A compelling world that encourages exploration outside the main quest and backtracking An visually enjoyable atmosphere Constant accumulation of skills and items keeps the game interesting Level up system that allows the game to become progressively more approachable for those of us less skilled Solid gameplay mechanics Controller support The development team seems intent on constantly improving the game and squashing bugsCons Areas of the game seemed sparse or unfinished Even with all the side exploration and secondary bosses the game feels short XP penalty for death discouraged exploration and led to mundane grinding at times Storyline seemed derivative NPC personalities and interactions were flatOne of my favorite games this year. Definitely going to try for 100% completion on this one! "

If, by climbing, I had activated a portal, so that I would never need to climb again, not having the key would not have been so annoying as it was.So, after all of that, why do I recommend this game? Overall, the game was fun, but exceptionally frustrating at parts, and while some of the deeper game elements could be improved, my main gripes with the game where simple things, some of which would require very little effort to fix, and thus aren't deep-rooted problems. It's unfortunate these problems made it through playtesting. Thus my recommendation has an * attached. If you like this style of game, you will like Elliot Quest, but until these problems are resolved in 2.0, it will be annoying to play it.			"

												If you liked kid icarus, or any metroidvania titles, or zelda II, you should play this - it's absolutely amazing. Polished, fun, and VERY good pacing.This game will obviously take from games from the past - but not in a cheap nostalgia sense - in a sense that it takes the best parts of a good dessert to make an absolutely perfect finished products. The sum of it's parts is much greater than some of the obvious inspiration. One of the most helpful reviews almost discouraged my purchase, and I'd like to address some of those points from the perspective of an absolutely ravenous consumer of metroidvania and platformer games.Experience loss on death does suck, a little bit. It sucks more, at first, but you'll NEVER have to grind. I spent 20 minutes grinding out levels early on, frustrated with a boss - nearly 3/4 of the way through the game, I was max level. You'll never, ever NEED to grind, and will hit max level through normal play. You also retain experience when you die and go back to a check point, so rather than as punishing as zelda II or many other games with death=reload, it's actually pretty nice unless you're trying to zerg your way through something. On death, you seem to lose about 10% of your XP towards the next level.I never at any point found a pit that didn't have some sort of visual hint that dropping down it offered rewards.In the same way, many of the other hidden areas are clearly marked - the walls are cracked, or the shadow stops at the entrance to the secret area, etc. Classic metroid tropes label almost all secrets, and you won't be forced to ever run into walls - your arrows won't stick to anything you can interact with or pass through, so if your arrow dissapears, investigate. This is only necessary if you don't have a very keen eye - I had no issue 100%ing this game over the course of... oh god, 28 hours in 3 days. You will be locked out of some areas, a lot in the beginning, but at no point did it♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, just made me wonder what would get me around that, I never felt stuck or frustrated that I couldn't advance through something. As for random activation abilities - some of them, like occasionally double health/magic collection, average out to be very helpful. Others, like half damage 30% of the time, I skipped entirely, as the earlier perk required to get health regen was far, far too unreliable. You won't be able to take all the perks - skip the ones that don't sound helpful.Some reviews were critical of items without descriptions - all items in the game are pretty obvious. Again, in following the metroid trope, every main item you get or usable item you get traps you in a room forcing you to use it to get out. Some of the very non-obvious ones, dash, and one other, had a tome describing how to use it near it. The only item that's really a mystery is the blue book, which is optional, and extremely hidden. Some folks think it makes you magic regen faster.The boss battles throughout the game were tough, especially the optional ones, but rarely frustrating - classicly difficult bosses that are well patterned, or well telegraphed makes it much, much less frustrating to deal with - pay attention to what you're looking at, the boss will tell you what it's going to do. The only really frustrating thing for me was that many of the optional bosses are very, very far from potion shops, and don't include a full heal save point, which just seemed mean - it's worth noting, try the boss several times before you take any of your potions, for your own sake and time.A lot of this review has been spent contrasting against other reviews - I have trouble seeing how anyone who's a great fan of the metroidvania genre could toss this aside - this game was absolutely, completely amazing end to end. I had so much fun figuring out every little puzzle, never feeling as challenged as La Mulana or Environmental Station Alpha left me to google up answers - and the puzzles constantly evolved from block puzzles to shadow puppet puzzles to an area of the game that was clearly just frogger. The way puzzles evolved throughout this game was a huge testament to what made all the zelda games so popular, and so absolutely perfectly executed.my only real criticism is that it started a little slow - it's hard to figure out exactly what you're doing. Just push forward, it'll come to you. (go right, not left, at the start) You have two hours before you have to decide to return it, so I'd heavily advise, unlike some negative reviews, you give it 90 minutes of good, hard playing and see how you feel. This game is a masterpiece, and again, if you like metroidvania games, you owe it to yourself to give this a fair shake - it's a brilliant game and long enough to feel absolutely worth the 9.99.Some final thoughts/spoilers/helpful tips - There are 3 endings, depending on your character karma. You can look it up if you want to aim for something, but usually it's pretty obvious what is good and not good. Don't rob people if you want to be good, you will overflow with money by the end of the game anyhow. The only not so obvious thing - A goddess will at some point ask you to turn back. turning back is good, and the only way to get a specific item. If you don't, this item is permanently lost. I wish the game had detailed this.At one point you will be in a cave and it will be all dark and shadowy, the whole foreground will be black. Don't light the torch in this cave or you cannot complete this little side area. These are the only really rough missable things that come up on the whole adventure, and neither is required to finish, but both are required for 100% item collection.Game keys are NOT remappable, but although I'm familiar with xpadder and have used it many times to compensate for bad keying, I loved the key layout in this game and didn't need to.

												Elliot Quest is a game I can't recommend enough for fans of the metroidvania genre.Pros A compelling world that encourages exploration outside the main quest and backtracking An visually enjoyable atmosphere Constant accumulation of skills and items keeps the game interesting Level up system that allows the game to become progressively more approachable for those of us less skilled Solid gameplay mechanics Controller support The development team seems intent on constantly improving the game and squashing bugsCons Areas of the game seemed sparse or unfinished Even with all the side exploration and secondary bosses the game feels short XP penalty for death discouraged exploration and led to mundane grinding at times Storyline seemed derivative NPC personalities and interactions were flatOne of my favorite games this year. Definitely going to try for 100% completion on this one! "

												I kind of wish I could give this game a neutral review. But I can't, so negative it is. I feel like this game is really really close to being a great game, but falls short in the controls department.I first tried it with my xbox controller. And the game made me use the arrowpad. No analog stick. I'm sure the arrowpad is great for some people, but I prefer the analog stick. So then I decided I would forget the controller and just use the keyboard. I've done keyboard controls on these types of game before. So I put my left hand on WASD and my character doesn't move, he just attacks. It turns out I would have to use my right hand on the arrow keys to move my character and my left hand to attack and jump. This feels very backwards. Also, I did a quick forum search and did not find any info about being able to remap controls.My theory is that the person that developed this game never plays computer games. Which is fine... but before he released the game on steam he should have allowed a ""pc gamer"" to play it for 5 minutes, or 1 minute... that's all the time it really takes to find bad controls. Or at least done an internet search on what controls other similar games used. There's no need to reinvent the wheel after all.Having good default controls is too important, considering the small amount of effort that it probably takes to change, to not spend some time on getting right.

												This game is a fantastic Zelda II/metroidvania adventure.  It was lots of fun to play, very addictive, and it only became a drag at the very end when trying to beat the superbosses.  I 100%ed this game (well, I didn't get all the coin chests or all the endings, but I don't think that counts) and I have to say, I enjoyed it quite a bit!  I did not use guides for most of it; I did get lost at one point and used a guide there, and I also got guidance for the superbosses and the final crystals, but other than that, a careful explorer can get pretty much everything.  So:Things I liked: the metroidvania gameplay, obviously, is the main draw.  It's not a straight metroidvania: each area is self-contained.  Basically, there's an overworld map filled with impassable areas raising exclamation points, and you go into these places to cross the map to the other side of that impassable area.  These areas often have challenges requiring the use of upgrades or spells, so you may not be able to cross them at first but have to come back with better stuff.  The game also has a nifty story told in flashbacks, a karma meter (which I never got to move), EXP and level-ups (it would have been nice to know what's actually important to have late-game, because you get 1 skill point at level-up and with the level cap you can only get some of the upgrades).  Also, every new thing on the map is exciting to explore and discover!  I guess that's what kept me playing for so many hours.Things I didn't really like: the lack of direction.  The game is deliberately designed with a ""retro"" feel.  I honestly wish developers would stop doing that.  I buy the simplicity in graphics, that's fine, but the game could well have explained more.  For example, at one point you can find a blue book.  It goes into your upgrade grid.  What does it do?  The forums aren't sure.  The game sure doesn't tell you!  I think, for the most part, you can kinda figure out where to go by just looking around on the map, but maybe also someone in the towns could kinda say something to point you in the right direction too?  You also collect crystals -- why?  What's the point?  Turns out they open doors if you have enough of them, OK.  So they're... door counters?Other things of note: the game is pretty hard.  There are lots of puzzles, lots of challenging platforming, etc.  There's a very nice Hell-Temple-esque challenge area that's quite a bit harder than the rest of the game.  And then there are... the superbosses.  MASSIVE DIFFICULTY SPIKE, even compared to the Wizard's Tower.  They're not required, of course, but yeah.  My last week of playing this game was spent getting frustrated against one of these guys for a bit and giving up for the night.  On the other hand, it felt damn good to kill the last one and open the door they were guarding!Anyway, I had a lot of fun playing Elliot Quest.  Other than those superbosses, the challenge level is great, though you may want to look things up on occasion in case you missed something big (I missed a crucial game mechanic, for example, that nobody bothered to tell me about in-game).  Enjoy!			"

												How hard is it to make this games controls re-mappable? Even in a separate file even? Maybe?			"
