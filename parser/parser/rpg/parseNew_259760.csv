												Very, very clever Zelda-like game.  Tells a good story while affectionately poking fun at older games and using the pseudo-GB format to do some interesting things.  Decent length so far, gameplay is pretty good (if ""clunky"" much like older games often would be), and the music's great.  Unfortunately, it seems to have a fair number of glitches, mostly related to collision detection; just be careful and consider backing up your saves every once in a while.  (The game autosaves very frequently, so don't worry about losing progress if you have to restart it.)			"

												I so want to recommend this, but I can't quite do it. This game is a love letter to classic 8-bit gaming, and more specifically, the Game Boy. While the game plays most similar to The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, it also has references to Pokemon and Final Fantasy. Since the Game Boy was one of my first gaming loves, and Link's Awakening my favorite title on the system, the game just hit me hard with its nostalgia hammer. The story has some very profound, and dare I say it, vaguely religious themes, at least what I played of it so far. The writing is easily the game's strongest aspect. It's full of refernces to classic games, but it also contains a great deal of pathos and questions about death, science vs faith, and the afterlife. The soundtrack is good as well.But this thing has more bugs than the last two Bethesda games combined, and even compared to the games it tries to emulate, it actually falls short technically. It plays in an extremely tiny window, and pressing the Escape button quits the game entirely instead of pausing it. You have to be very careful when playing this game lest you run into glitches. And that's too bad, because everything about this game shows great promise.			"

												There's a lot of bugs, which is sad because I like the story and the world design. The combat system is boring and usually it seems like buttom smashing is more efficient than actual strategy. I've got stuck in moving walls and I've been stuck forever in mid air because some rats were standing under me and I couldn't fall all the way down from a ledge. Some graphics layers are in wrong places. The water animations only work in places where there are splashes, otherwise it's the regular walking animation. There seems to be no other way to get back to main menu than to restart the game.Anyway, I hope they fix all this. Other than the bugs, I really like it. Seems like they forgot to playtest it completely.			"

												The game is broken. In my short experience with this game I had fumbled with setting up the window, messed with the controls, started the game outside of the level where I could walk around, collision with walls is wonky, broken tuturial, and slow dialog text.They are remaking the game with a different engine which shows promise, but according to one of their most recent project updates they announced that levels are now grid based instead of whatever they did before. So apparantly their game, featuring tile graphics, did not have a grid. I must assume these guys are not common programmers.Their vision is interesting, the graphics are cool and are what you imagined the world to look like back in the days of the gameboy. I want to take a look at the game when the unity version comes out but do not buy this right now.EDIT: The remake is called Chromphore and should come out this month. Free for owners of Two Brothers. Let us hope their learned how to program.			"

												This review has spoilers.This game was so bad that I decided to write my first review.I played for about twenty minutes, and then it froze.  In that time I got through the prelude and finished the first dungeon and fetch quest.  To be honest, I nearly dropped it when Loving Wife died moments after her simpery and bland introduction, towards the end of the tutorial.  Sluggish text cannot be skipped.  UI design, even in the configuration menus at the start of the game, is poor.  Conversations awkwardly remain on-screen even after you have moved to a different room, leaving no context for the hanging text.  Maps are too large and often leave you wandering through a featureless landscape with nothing of interest to look at on-screen, scrolling for page after page.  Other design issues, such as unfair/pointless traps, make the gameplay boring.For me, the storytelling didn't work very well, either.  From the first looks of it, the world is pretty interesting--but incoherent.  Typos abound.  Long sections of backstory are delivered with little context, first in a ""meet-the-characters"" way reminiscent of good old Red/Blue Pokemon, and later in long blurbs that seem more like a poorly-kerned emotive flash game or visual novel.An interesting fact is that when it comes to game writing, the limitations of the user interface play a crucial role.  The writer needs to plan for line breaks so that moving to the next text window is a pleasure, cutting out as many words as possible to keep the whole message on one screen and so that clauses are not split.To make a long story short: Two Brothers, although individual elements are very appealing and promise something great to come, is riddled with and has serious structural flaws, still has game-breaking bugs, and suffers from poor design in general.   This is not a good game.  Do not buy it at any cost.  I sincerely appreciate the work that the developers put into it, and wish them well with their next game.  The graphics look nice, he indie market is hard.  That said, $15 is an unacceptable price for a game with so many bugs and so little overall polish.			"

												Oh, brother. This is perhaps a great game that shows we've come a long way from the 8-bit world of Space Invaders and Pong. Two Brothers pays homage to all the great games of yesteryear and combines that with modern surprises.The story is definitely the game's best feature. Growing up as a 90's kid, death in a video game was a great deal of annoyance and frustration. Two Brothers took that notion and completely deconstructed it and shaped into a robust mechanism that changes everything we've known about death in gameplay. Everything. The budding geniuses at AckkStudios reminds us perhaps how we can deal and relate to death, and how we cope with losing someone important to us. The game does so with a great amount of light heartedness and bittersweet quality that remind us of days long gone through the main character who, might I dare say, is quite the gentleman of fortune. The gameplay is somewhat of a thank you gift to gamers from the past decades who are familiar with the top-down structure of classic Zelda and Sword of Mana. You're in for quite a treat there.The soundtrack is also quite wonderful and sets the bar high as it draws on inspiration from the classical music to metal to the legendary scores of Nobuo Uematsu.However, the game isn't without flaws. There were bugs at launch, but the team at AckkStudios has been quite receptive to consumer feedback and is constantly working to correct glitches with rapid updates and fast bug support. Just reminiscing a bit, but who remembers Nintendo's game help hotline? That's pretty much AckkStudios's Facebook Page.With bittersweet sentimentality, the verdict is that Two Brothers features graphics lush with fond memories and homages, a great soundtrack, and quite a treat in gameplay. Two Brothers gives all its love to games long ago and to games in days to come. This was a game worth waiting for.			"

												I really wanted to give a thumbs up to this game. As far as I´ve been able to play, it has some very great things: The retro feel is great (even if the music gets a bit annoying). The story is very original and interesting, the characters and backgrounds are cute and detailed, more detailed than they would have been in Gameboy. The autosave feature is good, but......there´s no other way to save and I haven´t been able to work out how to even save in a different slot (my guess is it can´t be done unless you start a new game in that new slot). This would not be much of a problem if the game was flawless in its programming, but as others have reported, it isn´t.  There are conversation loops you can´t end, the senistivity of the loading file is erratic (I sometimes have to hit the key more than once for it to acknowledge). On my firts try in the game, after a couple of days playing, I tried to load the file but nothing happened. I tried other keys and eventually had to restart the game, which was not nice. The dialogues are good but quite long, so going through things I had already been through a couple of days ago was  rather a joykill. So off I go on round two. I come across some bugs (like not being able to skip the storyteller unless I agree to listen to him) and eventually I enter someplace I seems I shouldn´t have entered (not that there was any restriction as in other areas, where it tells you you should first do this or that). I meet Celia, a flying thing of some kind) who embarks me in a kind of quest, throws me in a dungeon to help her in a trial. That wouldn´t be too bad, except for the fact I can´t get out. Apparently I am missing an item, I can´t move forward, I can´t go back to the previous area. Because of the autosave function, the last saved file is already in this place. I haven´t been able to find a walkthrough to even know if I can get out or not, but I am not looking forward to starting the game again. This game would be awesome if it were fixed. If you are very patient you should either wait for that to happen (if it happens), or give it a try and accept the fact you might be having to restart often. Despite its virtues and its potential, as it stands I couldn´t really recommend this game. A shame.			"

												I've tried to play this several times since I purchased it, but the bugs just make it impossible. The game locks up often in some areas requiring a restart. They made the bizarre decision to have your inventory available only when you have a particular party member with you, but he frequently leaves. Combat is rough to say the least. Controller support is ""partial"" at best and has to be reselected every time you start up. Dialog/text stays on screen until new dialog comes up. Meaning your conversations stay around long after they're over. This obscures a portion of the world at all times. The whole experience feels unpolished.It's been out for over 2 years so I'd expect these glaring issues to have been patched by now. I don't like reviewing a game that I haven't finished, but I just have to give up on this one. Don't waste your money.			"

												If you won't truck through an extremely buggy game, then pass on this one.The story is very compelling—and while the game isn't killing you: getting you stuck in walls; blasting your ears with glitched audio; barrading you with typos; not having attacks, which indicate that they've hit, actually hit; or not being allowed to proceed for whatever unknown reasons—it can be veeeery immersive. Hell, I've spent quite a bit of time on this game on my first playthrough, and I still haven't completed it. All the side quests are very engaging, and though the game has very little direction, the main story had me 'pining' to know what will come next. It had that classic, old video game story which deals with many adult themes very well in the context of a child's game.So, if you're willing to pay 15$ for a buggy, seemingly incomplete game for a great story and truck through it, then I recommend this game. Make your assessment, eh?			"

												The gameplay is fun (as people have said, similar to Zelda) and I like the story so far. There are plenty of references to older games - Zelda and Pokemon seem to be the main inspirations for the layout - and there's quite a bit of comedy relief. The only issues I have with it are the lack of responsiveness in combat (but that's not such a huge deal) and the unreliable autosave. I've followed the instructions and not exited game whilst going through doors and still lost my save file (luckily only 1 hour's worth of gameplay - thank hell for that).

												I am a player who has finished this game prior to its release on Steam, so please ignore how Steam thinks I've only played this game for 0.3 hours.  In actuality I must have put at least 30 hours into this wonderful gem.  I am a huge believer in this game and couldn't wait to write a review on Steam for the devs.I am an old school gamer at heart and this game truly strums many heart strings for me.  If you enjoy old school games, buy it.  You will only tease yourself by reading more of my review.The music is nostalgic, yet new and exciting.  The composers somehow found a balance between old and new.  The music is catchy and simple while chip tune like and then when the game gets intense it switches to full orchestration while upping the complexity.  Then sometimes it sits comfortably in SNES land.  The sound track alone is worth the game purchase, let me tell you.The story is something else.  It’s not your typical story, and yet its setting is.  Again, the balance of old and new is there.  The brothers are instantly memorable and you feel their strife, their victories, and their journey.  You take it with them.  I haven’t felt this way about a game’s story in a long time.  It made me think and analyze lines of text.  Just like old school games, there aren’t millions lines of text, so it takes old school gamers to read between the lines to fully ‘get’ it.  In short, it got my mind running on full throttle, just like the games of old.  Revisiting the glory days of videogame RPG story telling has never been so sweet!The graphics are beautiful.  If you enjoyed Gameboy and Snes, look no further.  The game starts out like Gameboy, but changes as the story develops.  I feel I need to say nothing else here, it’s simply awesome!The gameplay is great.  Fighting monsters require good use of arrows when at range and melee when hiding behind corners and using your weapon’s reach.  And, in the open, you can’t help but swing madly with your favorite weapon as the enemies charge you.  It’s great old school fun.  There are also great puzzles that break conventions.  You’ll need to be ready to approach these puzzles differently than you did the puzzles of games from back in the day.  Just a fair a warning. ;)Being the first game from Ackkstudios, there are some bumps in the road.  But, hear me, I’ve been with them from the beginning and I know for a fact they are working amazingly hard to constantly improve the game.  They are committed to find that “Nintendo polish” the game needs before being put on the WiiU.  And, I believe in them that they will get there. I’ll be supporting them the entire way.That being said, here are the negatives.  The collisions are off here and there and in general there are some bugs.  Sometimes they affect the flow of the game.  However, if you love old school games at all, you’ll be open to fighting through the couple of rough patches in order to continue the story.  Also, I haven’t played the game through on Steam yet, so there is a good chance many of the bugs that…bugged me…haha, are gone.  I’ll be on the look out!  That brings up another point, if you find a bug, the devs are very responsive and willing to listen and help their players.  The communication I have had with them has been amazing; they want their players to believe in their game as much as they do.In all, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed this game and the memories from it will pleasantly haunt my mind for years to come.  And now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to start my second play through and get a different ending.  :D "

												This monochromatic tale tells the story of an explorer/scientist brother combo dealing with death and life. Roy Guarder was out exploring forsaken lands with his wife when tragedy strikes and they are both killed. Except while his wife moved on he was stuck in some strange colorful limbo world. The story follows Roy’s attempt to come to terms with this strange new change in his life and exploring the world with his brother to collect the color pieces and uh… er… I think show them to some group of scientists to prove Roy isn’t insane? I’m not entirely sure actually why we’re out risking our necks for colors other than they’re there.This game seems to be somebody’s love child with classic 1990′s Nintendo. The game plays a lot like a combination of Link’s Awakening and Zelda 2 with a similar over world to go around in with various locales to explore. Combat is like much of the old top-down Zelda games but with a large variety of melee weapons to chose from and an infinite supply of ‘throwing arrows’ to hurl at enemies. There’s a few pokes at Pokemon too with a “it’s hyper effective” screen popping up when you’re using a weapon enemies are weak to and even a weird not entirely sure if intentionally buggy boss fight against MissingNo.It is certainly interesting the way the game incorporates things we generally forgive into the game’s story. For example your inventory is carried around on the back of a companion and you ‘jump’ into his backpack to access things. Also, death is but a minor inconvenience for Roy who caught in some strange after-life loop. He can’t seem to die but instead travels back and forth freely between living and dead. So when you die you’re just sent back to the strange colorful after-life world. Once there you just gather yourself up and go back into the fight. Also the game is monochromatic but it seems that the characters of the world are used to it being varying shades of mustard and olive. The introduction of colors pretty much freaks everyone out and Roy’s ranting about them has had him labeled as a loony.In fact dieing is kinda an important thing to do and at various points during the game you must go to the strange after-life world to achieve certain things. The after-life being some strange floating platform in the sky also has a telescope which lets you look down on the planet and spot where the color shards are. It’s sadly about the only sense of direction you get as you wander around the world trying to find said shards.And now this is where I have to start complaining about the game. The story is pretty decent, although at times it can dump some pretty wordy sequences upon you. But combat starts getting pretty dull and repetitive after a while. Most enemies provide little in terms of challenge and just become repetitive time sinks. The occasional boss fight is usually well done but are so few and far between that they don’t make up for having to slog through hoards of pretty uninspired enemies. Despite them having different sprites and varying amounts of health and damage there’s really only two enemies in the game. Those that wander around shooting projectiles and those that charge at you. Which get pretty boring after a while.And then sadly, there are the bugs. There’s a few pretty bad ones in the game. Mark, your inventory guy, I think is not supposed to follow you into the afterlife each time you die. If you try to access your inventory while in the afterlife it screws something up as when you come back to the real world you appear off the map. The only way out is to quit the game and relaunch it. There’s also a few points where you will get stuck and nothing can break you out of it. The music track in the museum is horrendously screwed up and is just a loud high pitch screech that made me want to throw my headphones against the wall. I also have issue with the game not remembering my preference for a game-pad, having to select it in the menus each time. And really, who makes the escape button close the game instantly with no confirmation menu?The music of the game though is pretty darn good and the graphics for what they are aren’t bad. I even dig the theme that buildings int he world are actually giant living creatures. Heck if this game was released 20 years ago the graphics would be amazing but today they are just mediocre sprites.It is clear this is a someone’s self indulgent love fest to games from the early 90′s. While there is some fun to be had and a decent (if not a little cliche) story to be told here the game started to drag for me. I really wanted to finish the game before I wrote a review but in the end the repetitive combat and bugs in the game really started to turn me off. Having killed many a AA battery on my old grey Gameboy brick I’m as nostalgic as anyone for such things but I would only recommend Two Brothers if it were on sale. Also give it a pass if you can’t stand Gameboy quality graphics.Final Score:Graphics: 5/10Game Play: 6/10Music / Ambiance: 8/10Story: 8/10Value: 5/10Overall: 6.4/10Read more reviews of Indy games on my blog!http://www.markofithian.com/ "

												Two Brother is a really unique and strange game. I wanted to write strange little game... but I'm on my second play through now that it's on Steam and the game has a lot more content than I've come to expect from Indie Games. Two Brothers has a great story with lots of intriguing dialogue and plot twists. There are some moments that generally shocked and even scared me. The game has a ton of original boss battles. That's when the game is at it's best. When it's trying to be Zelda, or Allundra, it isn't perfect but when it's being Two Brothers the game is honestly brilliant. There is one battle where you fight a Missingno like boss, or ""creepy pasta"" boss and holy ****it's scary. The soundtrack is great. I found myself humming a lot of the tunes and I went ahead and bought the soundtrack of Bandcamp so I could listen in the car. There are some hitches in the gameplay, but each build it seems to get more polished. If you're down to try something original and are okay with something that plays against expectations of indie games and Zelda games you'll love this!			"

												I am torn as to what to put into this review. While I do enjoy it, This game definitely needs to be updated something fierce, there are many glitches, of which I am astonished that this was released in the state it is in. Though, as I got this in a bundle, I can't complain about the price point. Just wouldn't pay the amount that the game is asking as it stands now, thanks to all the bugs. If they manage to fix it, it would be much better.			"

												From the moment that I first saw screenshots of Two Brothers I knew that it was something I had to keep my eye on. The game plays like A Link to the Past, while also adding in new mechanics to give the classic Action Adventure a fresh take. The biggest thing that I can think of is how the developers have done away with the traditional game over screen and replaced it with the Afterlife. Also the music of Two Brothers is one of the best soundtracks in recent memory. I’ve put more than 10 hours into the game so far and there is so much that I havnt done.			"

												Two Brothers is the perfect successor to the games made by Quintet in the 1990's.This game has an absolutely wonderful story, graphics, and music, but is just a tad glitchy at times.  The gameplay is fairly simple, but engaging.  It plays similarly to Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening.  By itself, the gameplay is fun, but this game truly shines artistically.  I was hooked on the story within the first scene, and I guarantee that if you give this game 15 minutes of your time, you won't regret being drawn into this amazing game.			"

												Two Brothers is a game with a ton of promise. The game feels and plays like a Seiken Densetsu but ditches the tired fantasy setting in favor of a more surreal world. It's hard to assign an existing tag to the world style. I would say that Two Brothers compares most closely to Anodyne or even Zeno Clash in this regard. The presentation contains simple 2D sprites juxtaposed with highly detailed pixel art for large scale creatures. This mixing of styles really left me with a sence of excited uneasiness; that feeling where you are a little disturbed but much more fascinated.The combat is, from my brief experience, somewhat shallow and uninspired. It serve it's purpose but otherwise felt like a chore between story points. You have a basic melee combo and a ranged attack. Hitboxes are unpredictable and so every encounter feels like a clumsy struggle to spam melee attacks before the enemy can hit you.The story is surprisingly detailed and well crafted. It deals with some interesting themes and can get rather philosophical at times. Quite enjoyable but I won't delve into it too much to avoid spoiling anything. It's just unfortuante that the only way it's conveyed is through a painfully slow, two line text crawl.The combat on it's own would not be enough to drag Two Brothers down. Sadly, there is a monumental number of bugs in Two Brothers, a plethora even. These range from innocuous graphical glitches to game breakign bugs that will demand you restart. I was about four hours in and had just finished the first dungeon when I encountered a bug that forced me to reopen the game and then broke sequence such that I could no longer progress. Sadly to say I don't believe I will be able to risk losing another four hours or more to a bug. It is for this reason alone that I cannot reccomend this game is it currently exists. I would be more fogiving if this was early access or beta or something, but this is a shipped product and it is not at all ready.It's truly a shame. Two Brothers is clearly lovingly created by a team with a great vision. Unfortunately, until the nuts and bolts are not solid enough to properly present this vision. I hope a patch comes to rectify at least the most glaring and game breaking issues. You can bet that once it does I'll be back to see the potential of Two Brothers fully realized.			"

												This game is pretty cool, but it has a lot of bugs. I found my self stuck in between some objects. Game crashes quite a bit too. I would give this a little more development time before jumping in. Currently, I havent beat it yet, so my opinions (ON THE STORY ONLY) may change.Pros: The animations remind me of Legend of Mana. One of my favorite games. Animations are smoothe and enjoyable enough to keep you swingin'. Also, the dungeons are Zelda style which is another one of my favorite games!The story (so far) is interesting enough to keep you interested. It wont blow your mind though.The Different kinds of weapons change up the combat a bit. Music is really cool and probably one of the best features of the this game.Chat log is a good idea, but I wish there was a way to roll back past conversations (sorry if there is and i didnt see it).Cons:There is No real inventory system. There is a gentleman you can find in a pub that carries your things for you, but either the story progrssed to a point where he left, or he died. Either way, I have been stuck with my axe for about an hour with no way to swap! Kinda strange.I didnt see a map that you could toggle on and off (again sorry if I missed it). It would be nice to track the coverage of the space you are exploring. The glitches are rampant in this game. You WILL get stuck in weird places. Your game WILL crash multiple times. Recommend? Sure it has its problems, but I still think its fun.			"

												Game has a lot of potential, but is riddeled with glitches. Strange collision detection between monsters and weapons makes some weapons nearly unusable. Sometimes you wind up outside the playable area. Sometimes the field glitches in such a way that you don't see anything. Both of these make it necessary to restart the game. What really killed it for me was when I got teleported to a different part of the world that I was never in before and wasn't supposed to get to at that point. You only get one active save slot so I can't even load an earlier save.			"

												Finally decided to give this game a quick try.After getting into the menu, I immediately noticed that there is a lack of options for graphics, audio and custom keybindings. Real VBA playerz use arrow keys with Z, X, A, S, Backspace and Enter for these kind of games. There was no premade configuration for this.I started a new game and disliked the weird intro that didn't really tell much. I then played the game for a while and noticed that there were very few enemies to kill and the combat was a bit too simple (no damage numbers, but similar to melee and ranged fighting in Sword of Mana). I thought there would be some kind of inventory or stat screen, but didn't find one even after pressing all keys. On my way to the second town, I slashed some grass to see if I could get anything from it, but would often get dropped down a surprise hole hiding under grass (that you couldn't tell was there). Dropping down took up to 80% health away, which felt excessive. Because of not getting XP or levels and thinking the story was bland, I felt like giving up.I continued moving towards the second town and found a few npcs who spoke about very random things that probably didn't have anything to do with the game's setting. It's like all the npc dialogue was something that kickstarter backers got to add as a reward. Other than that, I thought that the areas I played through were either forgettable or bit too messy. Because of all these issues and feeling like I'm only hacking or shooting forward to hear more of the somewhat bland story, I uninstalled.			"

												The appeal of Two Brothers is the same as a lot of Steam Indie games: nostalgia. Too bad Two Brothers manipulates you, the consumer, by that very means. Sure, the trailer seems like a cool, chip tuney ode to the good-old-days of earnest action rpgs like Secret of Mana, but I can tell you--without hesitation--this game is a buggy, unplayable mess. And, weirdly, the developers try to play it off like its all part of the overrall aesthetic. That bothered me. And this game goes for 14.99. Wow. One of the other reviewers was like, ""Oh, we've come a long way since the 8-bit days!"" Well, yeah, you would think that if you played this game, but in reality, Two Brothers is not representative of the ""8-bit"" days, ""16-bit"" days or any other good day you might've ever had. I mean, just the typos in the dialogue were so laughably bad, my god. Buyer's remorse, people. That's all I'm feeling. Luckily I got this game on sale. Peace. Don't buy it.			"

												Charming retro looks. Fun tune. Makes me wish I had this on a gameboy or my PS vita.However, the game is buggy. Real buggy. Like I just spawned somewhere random outside of the area and basically I just missed Roy's adventure with his lovely wife. Instead I got Roy walking on random tile, completely ignoring the boundaries of the game, walked outside of the frame, meet a giant fish and suddenly a wife appear.See all the thumbs down on the review? They weren't joking.I could give Two Brothers thumbs down, but the developers promised some fixing soon. So I guess it is better to give it a positive review >  more people buy this > devs got more money > game got fixed sooner = profit for both players and devs.Don't let us down Ackk Studios.			"

												Two Brothers is absolutely one of the most underrated games I have played. I have yet to finish the game, but have played about 18 hours which, to me, is impressive for an RPG with no grinding. It has its share of glitches, which I hope will be ironed out in the future, but that's not to say that I don't love the game in its current form. The story is simple but interesting, the combat is challenging but uncomplicated, and the classically inspired graphics are filled with colour. The story is thought-provoking and touching. As a whole the game is very retro-inspired (what drew me in), yet it plays with and subverts many of the classic aspects of gaming, particularly death. I look forward to the finished product with all of the kinks ironed out.			"

												(SPOLIER) Ending!!!! And final thoughts, Review 8/10Ending movie (SEE THE FOURMS)Final ThoughtsIntresting Zelda like style of game. Great story line, intresting World, Dungons were just right for the puzzles, Got a stuck a few times, but for the most part was able to solve them out without needing help. Controls were easy to use on the Xbox 360 Pad as wellIssues : TOOOO many, this game felt like a beta at best. I had to restore roughly 18+ save files and lost about 4 Hours of total time having to replay parts I been though,Opening Chest some times froze my chararter in place requireing a reload but never losing anything anything (annoying but not game brakeing)Hell, The Inn in the past minning town, The gaurden Trial? were you have to help the flying Person, Mace of life (inventory swap before tellepoiting back out of the Temlpe of the first men. ALL broke the save file, I ether ended up being teleported out side the lvl, or teleported back into the same spot with a BLACK SCREEN,,,Buying a ideam that you don't have enough money for still makes you lose money. I ended up losing a lot of money in this game from ether buying and taking more then it asked for or, buying and taking money even though I can't affored it.The Buster Sword of COLOR is completely broken, Hit detection is non exsistent, Unable to defeat boss at all with it equiped... Almost made me rage quit in the Fish Dungon,Unable to change wepon with swim suite on :(NO indection of inventory? I went through the better part of 5-6 hours before some one pointed out that I can get into the inventory, switch clothes and wepons... I was completly dumb founded.World map Colors almost made me feel like I got them all (they all look the same in some cases,) thought I broke the game again :(the only part of the game I didn't find access to was the monster cave west of grave yard, and the Kick starter code area east of begning town.Some of the textures/graphics were a bit wiried and or hard to tell what was going on. The Missing ""M"" / ""QR code"" boss battle was completly unessery. I thought I broke the game yet again... it was kind of hard to follow.-------------------------------------All in all I honestly think this should have been 9.99 at most, labled as early access, NOT compliled into a single EXE file... and the inventory system could have been handled a bit better. The humor in the game made it worth the time.. Finding ""Link"" dead on the island made my day, also the stabs of making fun of the other adventure games, like Real Harts, Zipped of locations and layout of zelda were epic.. The dialog of the NPC were steller,All in all game gets 8/10 for overall even though there are some major game braking bugs.. All in All once there fix this would be a soild game!!			"

The email goes on to say that everyone who backed the kickstarter will get a free version of Chromophore. Doesn't say anything about people who bought the buggy Steam version. So If you bought Two Brothers and can't finish it or progress due to bugs, you'll have to buy Chromophore. I'd rather I didn't waste $10 on a buggy, unplayable game, but I guess I learned my lesson to purchase a game from this developer again.

												-As an nostalgic I think it's not worth the time really-I played all the great game boy classics so I got this one right off the bat. Graphics and music are great nostalgic tokens. Even the story so far is decent. Sadly technically it's more of a mess. Resolution changes screw around with my desktop icons, there's the need to play as admin, game starts up multiple times on the odd occassion. Combat is plain boring and there's no level or interesting item progression system in sight. The first dungeon which took a long time to get to isn't inspired either. While it's unfair to compare it to say ""Link's awakening"" or ""Final fantasy adventure"" which is really ""Seiken Densetsu"" I'd expected more gameplay like the classical bombs to set or exploration or how about switching to your brother for some riddles or anything original really. But in the end it's the combat really that kills it.Contains nice ideas (color, dying, animal for houses) but in the end not enough to keep me going - also faster text would have been good. A missed opportunity here. Anodyne made a better impression.			"

												I have a Mac. Steam says it's available for Mac. So I downloaded the game with Steam on OSX ...and tadaaaa - not playable because it is not available for Mac. Thats quite a mess. I mean I spent 14 Euro for a game, which i cannot play on my preferred Plattform although it was announced by the publisher.So I dowloaded the game again. This time the windows version. The game started well, but then a hell load of bugs finally made the game unplayable at all.The sound hangs, there a tons of Graphic-Glitches and after beating Eagle-Island the screen gone black. The sound played further. So I waited...but nothing happened. After restarting the game, I was put into the beginning area. No way to play any further. This is a NO-GO for RPGs. Getting stuck, with the only possibility to start all over again. I'm really upset, because I liked the story. Bring an update for this game...and relase the Mac Version as you promise hiere in Steam.Up to then I cannot recommend this game.			"

												A lot of bugs, it some cases makes game unplayable. I finished Eagel Island, and right after getting back onto the ride, I got a black screen. I waited for some minuets and nothing happened, so I restarted the game, and it threw me back into the first town. That made the game impossible to finish, and with the dialogue being slow, makes the game hard to resart. I like the story, and the mechanics are interesting and fresh, but the bugs make it impossible to play.			"

												I normally don't do reviews for games, let alone ones that I haven't beat, but this game really bothers me. At least to me, the concept behind the game is great. It isn't just a throwback to the oldschool gameboy games in visuals and gameplay but also throws a bunch of meta-references. For example, when you die there is small visual corruption that looks like a visual glitch ala gameboy style before you go to the ""Game Over"" afterlife. In fact, faux glitches seem to play a big role such as a mysterious character that seems to cause glitches whenever he is around or a boss fight inspired by MissingNo of Pokemon fame. The numerous real glitches however take any enjoyment you get out from playing it. Seemingly self referential  NPC states something along the line of ""Test"" followed by ""That is what I would say if the developers were lazy"" (not a direct quote but the meaning stands)The glitches are too many to number. In fact I had one 5 minutes in where a NPC did not show up. I had no idea that one was suppose to appear and spent a good amount of time looking for where the hell I needed to go. Luckly the game allows you to reset by hitting the tilde key, a key I had to use way too many times. At least the game saves every map transition.  Another glitch was after I did something in the afterlife which explicitly told me I would be taken to a different area from where I did. All was fine until I had to reset. The game saved the map location but apparently didn't update the name of where I was (when you load a game it tells you where you are) and still thought I was where I died in the first place. This resulted in the first screen being fine but all the other ones had a huge portion of them completely black.  I managed somehow to find my way out of this into the overworld and all seemed fixed but the fact that it happened in the first place is ridiculous. Now add numerous freezings (including ironically one while fighting the MissingNo clone), messed up NPC text and other minor things and you get a decent understanding of how broken the game is.Fixing the glitches won't save the game since the design is pretty bad too. Combat is OK at best with it being likened to Link's Awakening. There is a strange combo system where you can find a TEMPORARY item that gives you a combo attack while moving but this extra attack is only a little faster than the normal one and does no more damage from what I can tell. A power attack it also implemented but it also seems to do little to no extra damage and you have a delay before it activating. There is simply no incentive for fighting enemies that you can easy avoid and the ones that you can't there is a ranged attack that has infinte ammo and does as much as melee. Monsters only rarely drop health and there are no rooms that are locked until all monsters are killed. Currency is only found in chests and it is basically worthless, You can spend some on resting at the inns which will give your health back and there is at least one cutscene (although it is implied there are more but I have rested a couple of times more and haven't seen any). Health isn't a big issue either, if you die you can quickly start back on the same screen with full health. The other use for currency is to buy weapons. However I cannot really tell a difference between weapons. There seems to be differences in strength but it seems nelgible (like with power attacks). Certain enemies will die in one fewer hit with one weapon over others. Also most of the weapons act exactly the same from what I expereinced (some like the spear are slightly different).  With the amount of weapons there seems to be the fact that there is no information on the differences between them if there are any is simply stupid. I did find one difference with some weapons, faulty hit detecting. Some weapons like the Death Scythe often don't hit when it seems like they should and when they are equipped  you can't even reliably open chests (not that chests contain anything worthwhile).The inventory system is also relatively inane. Instead of a normal menu, you get a follower with a magic backpack and when you want to switch something you enter it and then enter the room that contains what you want (think Fable 3). The idea isn't bad but it is just time consuming and gives even less reason for wanting to switch weapons even if they were different. Not to mention when you leave the bag, all enemies that were on the screen respawn.The bosses are not horrible but not great either. They are marred by bad design much most of this game. For example the first boss requires you to enter his body through a door (don't ask) when it is exposed so you can strike the heart. The issue is that you only have a short time when the door is exposed and the boss spawns monsters from the center of his body so if you try to enter while there is a monster being spawned you get damaged and knocked back. Another boss requires you to knock back one of his attacks in order to damage him. You don't know you can do this however and I was trying to figure out why I only damaged him sometimes. It wasn't until the boss taunting me (was doing so the whole time) telling me to hit back the projectiles. This was after dying about 4 times though.The puzzles are either really simple or fundamently flawed due to what I assume is bad programming. One that stood out was where you needed to use a bomb to hit a switch a second time after you are past the field that it deactates. Sounds simple enough right? Wrong. On the side of the switch that is not against a wall there are respawning plants so you can't place the bomb there. Directly south of the switch is a conveyer belt that moves towards the switch. What I assume you are suppose to do is to push the bomb onto the conveyer belt, hit the switch so the gate is open and the bomb moves towards it, and hit the bomb as you move towards where you need to go. The issue is that the conveyer belt makes the bomb shoot towards the switch so you don't have time to hit it before it gets there. To add to this problem the bomb gets stuck in the switch and arrows won't cause it to light anymore. My solution was to get it so that I hit the bomb and the switch at the same time with my sword and that the switch was in the 'off' position at that time and hull♥♥♥♥♥to where I needed to be. It took a number of trys but I finally did it.I have not touched on some of the other issues such as bad collision detection, accessible out of bounds areas, your companion NPC getting messed up so he doesn't move and instead teleports with you and more. It was a good thing that I got this in a bundle with games I actually wanted because if I was to buy it on sale I would have been even more♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you have the game from a bundle, I would actually recommend not playing it unless you are REALLY interested in the concept/story. If you see this on sale do not buy it. I probably will continue to play it but only for the story since I have invested time in it. I don't know if the devs can fix anything, possibly some of the glitches but even with those gone the core game is still relatively broken.			"

												This game has a nice concept, but the execution is terrible due to a ton of bugs.Right off the bat, the game would only run at a single resolution; resolution options were available by pressing the number keys but doing this crashed the game unless I ran the game manually by double-clicking the .EXE instead of launching it through Steam. The keys weren't customizable in any way other than to switch between two preset key selections and a non-customizable controller layout that omitted several keys.The game locked up again when I spoke to a plot-important NPC in the second town; his dialogue never loaded and the game wouldn't let me do anything. I didn't lose a lot of progress since the game apparently auto-saves whenever you enter a room, but the fact that it was apparently necessary to save the game every time a new room loads is not encouraging.The bottomless pits in this game do not play well with the ability to move diagonally. They especially don't play well with the fact that the very first dungeon expects you to be able to cross them by walking on very narrow ledges with misleading hitboxes; in order to cross, you apparently have to have your knees on the platform and your feet dangling into the abyss.There's a room in the first dungeon that's one of those cliche traps where the walls are covered in spikes and closing in on you, with several floor switches and a couple of switches you attack to trigger. However, none of the floor switches work and the attack switches just make the walls come at you faster. I died a few times to this trap before the game randomly decided that the trap would only take half of my health off instead of all of it, then reset the room, dropped me into it (literally, there was a falling animation) and unlocked the doors. ""Puzzles are solved by dying until the game decides to let you pass"" is not the way to make a Zelda-style game.I finally gave up entirely when the first boss in the game was completely immune to damage under all circumstances, whether or not he was exposing the part of his body that was clearly supposed to be his weak point. Neither of the two weapons I had at that point did anything, and trying to walk into his weak spoint (which looked vaguely like a door) just made me take damage.If the developers do a lot of work on bug fixing, this game might be worth it, but I'm not going to hold my breath.

												Well, I played this for a few hours and I think it's absolutely amazing, I just love it. There were a few bugs but they more added to the personality of the game than anything -for me atleast-. I did not come across any game-breaking bugs or currupt saves. I AM waiting for patches though, only because I enjoyed it so much I want to play through in the best possible shape. I mean, if they're going to improve combat/hit detection, and add more quests...I want all of that.I LOVE the music, love the art, and the story is just ... interesting, and sometimes even subtly creepy. I'd prefer it to be in color, but atleast they use the Black and White as a plot device, which is really neat. Sometimes I even get a bit of a ""Hotline Miami"" vibe, just from some of the...trippy psychedelic things that happen, but maybe that's just me. I actually never played many portable games. I'm an older gamer and most of my RPGS were NES/SNES/Genesis and this still brings back memories. Something about it gives me a real ""Crysalis"" vibe. ""Lagoon"" too. I'm sure it's closer to the Gameboy ""Final Fantasy Adventure"" game, but I didn't really play that.Probably also inspired by GBA's ""Sword of Mana"".Anyway, I love it. If it weren't being patched more I'd just play through it right now and enjoy every minute of it (which is rare for me nowadays, I have almost 200 games and only a few really keep me interested.)

And The Puzzles I encountered in my time of playing were not hard, they're just annoying. I'm glad I didn't really pay for this game, as I got it as part of a humble bundle. I rarely give negative reviews on a game though but this one I am warning: Stay away. If you like old school action adventure games, go back to play them instead.

Not sure what the glitch do, but apparently... i'm flying over an empty map, and I can't get to... well.. any place.13,99€ for a game we can't play? (yeees, I know, i've bought the game on one of this ""Bundles"" and payed less but, anyway, payed for it). Sorry, developers, but this is an outright scam.I've seen videos of lucky people that can play the game, and I love the idea, the graphics and the music BUT... it's a game!

												I have to write a positive review for this game despite the flaws others might describe, because this game is still being updated and is reciving an update soon, hopefully.Why should consider this game?My answer is in the story as told within something you'd like to have seen in a later gameboy color game or even a gameboy advance title. The quirky, non lethal, bugs in the game, as it is prior to this game's upcomming rewrite, even seem to fit into the story at times. This game's art is dripping with a nostalgic style that seems both familiar and unfamiliar to me. I found it easy to fogive most flaws.... or at least endure them to see the story through.Why shouldn't you get this game?This game isn't currently stable, I nearly completed the main game and that required me to fight both the ingame enemies and more than a few crashes, glitches, and varying levels of confusion when I got legitimately stuck on something that was less than intuitive. This is on top of the pitfalls of recreating the gameboy's ""feel"" when it comes to movement, which made figuring out some puzzles more difficult than nessesary and is the main reason I personally stopped playing in order to wait on the rewrite the DEV has promised is comming soon.My recommendation is to wait till it updates in july and see if the new engine that the DEV is reportedly working in is more stable. This game has potential, I do not regret buying it on sale in the same way I do not regret buying Cave Story+ despite the original being free.			"

												Gorgeous aesthetics and soundtrack that really hits you in the nostalgia, but the UI and set up of the game is ridiculously broken. Glitches abound and there is really no easy way to format resolution/controls. To me, this is unforgivable for a modern game! It's a shame because if this was more polished I can see it being a hit. The story/writing seems a bit fanfiction-y as well and isn't the most memorable, but I was able to ignore that for the great style of the game that harkens back to the Capcom Gameboy Legend of Zelda games.

It isn't unplayable as most are saying, but it does have a few game crashing bugs. The story is excellent from what I've been hearing many say, and from what little chunk that I have experienced. The creator of the game has been working to rebuild this game from the ground up, and during that time his mother fell incredibly ill. He still comunicates with the fanbase though and still works to make this game much better than it currently is.			"

												The most common concern people have for this game is the game-breaking glitches. Yes, they happen. However, I bring good news. With the current version, I have yet to have a playthrough ruined by a glitch. Granted, it sometimes takes some troubleshooting, but in the end I found it worth it. Nostalgia is an important element in this game, and I feel Two Brothers used it to weave new stories rather than dwell on old ones. If you are really on the fence about this game, I would wait for the Director's Cut of this game to be released. I found the game, as it currently is, to still be immersive and memorable.			"

												I didn't build a PC in the year of our Lord 2014 in order to have a game look like a gameboy.  Get off my hard drive, jerk.			"

												I was so happy about to hear Two Brothers comes out on PC AND on steam but...Well i didnt know it comes out like ""this""I mean:-The standart Window (Game size) is not even as big as a Game Boy Sceen! Try that to play that on a HD Screen! (its Hell, trust me)- In a readme data (kinda), there stands it gives ""opinons to change the scaling of the window by pressing 1-9"" (or sort of). I did, nothing changed!- FULLscreen doesnt work! So you ""have to"" play it in a very f*ckin tiny window! This guys try to get srs if they like to make a retro game i guess...- You cant control the volume of the sounds AND BELIVE ME! YOU WISH YOU COULD!!- Also Wierd bugs sometimes that your Character wanders around ""Below"" the map he should walk on, yea. its like you walked under the map in the underground and the rest flys over you...Two Brothers, i saw a lot videos and i wished this game WHOULD playble but it isnt...you cant control the windowsizes and the standart size is nearly impossible to play on, it hurts really in your eyes if you try to long. The Music is really TO LOUD and you cant even change the volume or like and mostly wierd are the bugs in this game, it just ruins the feeling of  the maybe good game...Man i wish the ""Game"" whould be like the -TRAILERS- they showed.....

												Okay, I did try.  I love the idea of this game, but the execution was so buggy that it wasn't worth my time.  I can't change the graphics settings from the default Gameboy screen size, so I'm sitting inches from the giant TV I use as a monitor.  The gameplay isn't much to write home about.  I've only played ninety minutes and I had to check a guide twice to figure out where to go next.  In short, this game isn't fun, and I've got better ones to try.			"
