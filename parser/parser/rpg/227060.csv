												There is a lot of potential in this game, some interesting concepts, but poorly executed. I hope the developers see this. I want this game to be better. Don't pay full price, wait until its on special!!Pro's/Interesting features/positives:- Unified strategic-tactical zoom. I like using the mouse wheel to get a bigger picture.- Capturing enemy troops and making them slaves, and getting them to work/produce resources.- Storyboard and voice acting of Caeser- History lessons, fun facts in the tool tip pop ups.- Supply system and logistics. Its interesting to have to factor in the constant need for food. If only this was done better.- Supply: Getting resources around the map, rather than a phantom stockpile like in AOE2.- Supply lines, and interrupting them.- Morale of troops and enemies, routing. Idea done very well in Rome2: Total War, but half done here.- Taking hostages and sending them to other towns to guarantee public order.- Building camps at strategic points is good idea, but these are poorly done.- Seiging concepts are good - starve them out, drop their morale to zero and they surrender, or reduce the fortifications and overwhelm. I understandthe concepts but these are not clearly presented.Cons/Negatives/Feedback to Devs:-No multiplayer!- Confusion with the colour scheme. Zoomed in the Romans have green unit icons, but zoomed out, they are red figurines, and vice versa for the enemy/other factions. The faction colours are too similar.- There needs to be unique sounds to indicate an action happened. Unless you are closely watching everything in real time, the various drum beats mean nothing and blend in with the sound track.- There is no clear delineation between who is friend or foe until they start attacking you. There should be some colour system to indicate what your current diplomatic status is.- There is no clear indication of garrison or garrison strength. There is stacking under figurines on strategic map but these are not clear. Something better is needed, such as a flag.- ""Camp"" look fortified when built but are too easy to capture. There needs to be some visual cue that the camp is unguarded.- Supply lines are not clearly articulated. I want to hover mouse over line and see what the flow is, and what the rate of change is. I want to know the network, of where supplies are going, and how long to get there.- Diplomacy to way too simplistic. How is it can chose what treaty to have... can't the other side have a say?-How do I know the stats of an enemy asset? Wouldnt this be a mystery?- Faction flags are poorly done. These should clearly different from each other. Suggest and Icon.The use of figurines in general is poorly done. Its like trying recreate a board game, The figurines lack detail, need more colour differentiation and better indication of what their strength is.- Zoomed in Icons are too similar/ not easy enough to distinguish between unit types. More details needed on icons.- Resource problems... all the time... starving troops... swarming enemy... undefended settlements... no guidance from the tutorial, or manual. Its poorly presented.- No visual cues on stockpiles of resources at a settlement.- The icons indicating no food, poor morale, not in supply line, whatever the lightening symbol is etcare not clearly explained. Need a sound cue on whats going on. If voice acting is used some variety in expressions would be needed to avoid repitition (We're hungry!"" We haven't been paid!"" I cant get my goods to market!"" etc)- Needs clearer indication of when towns are requisitioned (rented!), who they are native to and that they are now under Roman control... otherwise it all looks Roman.- Requisitioning resources from allies means all workers in it disapear. Why can't I rent the resource and hire the workers too?The panels are too big and say too little.The figurines are too big and lack detail. Cities look the same zoomed out, but quite different zoomed in. Why do Gallic villages look like the Greek Acropolis??Combat system leaves a lot to be desired. Maybe I've been spoilt with RTW2... but seeing figures throwing javeline the wrong way in a seige is silly. No use of shield against missles.- Seeing slingers shoot through mountains to troops on a road on other side.- Castles look medieval... Gauls did not build such massive fortresses.- The range of units indication reticle is outrageously huge. A low key indication is needed.- Selecting units is too tricky. Suggest following conventions in other RTS.- Not enough detail in zoomed in unit icons. An inidcator bar on the left for something and on the right for something else would really help. This infor is on the unit detail panel but could better presented.- NSome features that could really improve gameplay: a technology system, unique resources,trade between factions, alliances where allies help, senate politics, disease/plague, civilians.Summary: If you get this, your patience will be tried, the learning curve steep, and the lack of expected niceties/features very fustrating. So much potential but it fell short by too far.This ambitious game has features that remind me of a number of games:- Morale like Total War, - Food like Caeser 3, - Zoom out like Supreme Commander, - Empire building like Civilisation, - Resource and supply like Knights and Merchants (and Settlers), - Building forts in strategic locations like AOE2,- Capturing forts/cities by attrition like 7 Kingdoms - Seasons and day/night like Empire Earth, - City capture like Rise of Nations, - Fog of war and figurines like Shogun Total War......but all of them did each of these concepts much much better, including games from 2001 (13 years ago) Its an ambitious game but it needs the budget and technical wizardry of the big gaming developer publishers. It especially needs sounds and visual cues, and to improve icon differentiation.Overall, 6/10. I'm glad I only bought this on a 75% off special. In its unrefined state, its not ready for full price. However if some changes were made, along with my feedback, this could be an excellent game. Don't pay full price. If you get it, prepare to be disapointed, but maybe you'll see the good side too. Its no-where near as good as the premium product of Rome 2 Total War, and is quite a different style of game, but it has some different features to keep you coming back.I hope the developers see this. I want this game to be better!			"

												Some time ago, on a steam sale I bought an unknown game by the name of hegmoney: Phillip of macadonia. A basic, rough little arcade RTS with some neat ideas. But despite its rough edges I ended up putting 110 hours into it because it was fun.So imagine my delight at seeing Hegmoney rome on a bundle star sale. Ther latest game from the same devs, but with all the rough edges smoothed out. Wow was ever I mistaken in thinking that. In fact this game is quite the opposite. The nice clean interface is gone, now its an eyesore of icons and walls of text boxes. The epic battles are gone, now you just end up with a mess of mobs brawling all over the place.  In fact its hard to find a mechanic they have not broken. The way my army eats, I can no longer put more than a hand full of units into the field as they end up starving to death. The econmy? No idea whats going on there as one minute I have hundreds of gold, the next I'm flat broke and my armies are rebelling. They have added the ability to requisition/build camps etc and upgrade bases, but with the broken economy I never get the chance. Oh and they added a very basic diplomacy function. Woot. But the real deal breaker is the bugs. They are the only legions you will find in this game. Units randomly vanishing (including Ceaser himself in one game), unit hot key assignments randomly change so you end up sending in the wrong uinits. Camera locking to the terrain forcing reloads, trigger points that don't trigger....and lag spikes and crashes. And often you need to click a unit multiple times before it will finally select, and often your units will not replensish as the game will give you the recruitment blocked message, even when there is nothing blocking it. Sure the devs can find the time to create DLC, but not time to fix this mess. They can even find the time to start making an entire new game for a kickstarter - but still can't find the time to fix this broken mess. The only pros I can think of, is the voice acting is generally good, and the music is also very fitting. Andf the mechanic to take hostages instead of having to garrison every town was nice.If you want to see this game done right, then grab hegemony gold. Same devs (tho hard to believe) but none of the issues, crashes or broken mechanics, and a very good game with many hours of game time. If you want Rome then get one of the excellent total war series. Luckily it was part of a bundle so I ended up with some good games, A shame this was not one of them.			"

								blxz covered it pretty well. A great strategy game that should have appeal to all levels of RTS players.I'd just add one thing though, Longbow's track record. This alone should be an important factor in your purchasing decision.Both Hegemony PoM and Hegemony Gold were supported and improved upon for many years following release, I have no doubt that Rome will see the same due care and attention. One of a small list of developers that do not send their games out in the wild and forget they exist beyond first week sales.Combine that with modding support built in from the go and we have here a game with potential to provide hundreds of hours of entertainment value for years to come.If Total War: Rome 2 left a sour taste, this will go a long way towards scratching the Roman itch.

												This game had great potential, however it was brought down by a lack of enthusiasm by the developers to make it into a polished product.The Good--- Some attention to historical detail.  The towns and cities throughout Gaul come with a small snippet of history about them.- Complex supply and recruitment system.  As you conquer more territories and resources, you must work them into your supply network in an efficient manner.- Sometimes challenging AI.The Bad -- - Optimization is poor to non-existent.  Even if you have a higher end machine that can run far more demanding games, odds are you will suffer from extreme lag.  - Very buggy and prone to crash.-  Small selection of recruitable units.-  Awkward and clunky unit command system.- No further fixes in sight.  The developers have stated that they have moved on to other projects, so if you are waiting for patches and fixes, you may have to move on as well.			"

												A great game. Don't expect this to be a total war clone. A lot of reviewers compare this to that series, but it is not. Battles are part of the fun but it is not the main objective. Keeping your supply line, linking up your cities, and making sure you don't run out of gold is what makes the game challenging. The map is interactive and exploring in this game is fun to do. I highly recomended it for a historical and stratagy game alternative.			"

								A fantastic game with oodles of potential so far in the beta phase. Given time to release more sandbox modes, complete the campaign and iron out any bugs this game has real potential to be one that will draw you back time and time again. Given the track record of the Longbow team I look forward to them delivering fully on all their promises and perhaps even throwing a few surprises in there for good measure. A must buy for those looking to expand beyond the more generic Rome Strategy games out there.			"

												I hope this review fairly examines both the qualities and flaws of Hegemony: Rome in equal measure. Most other reviewers seem to be firmly entrenched as die-hard supporters, or enraged that this isn't ""Rome: Total War 3.""Pros:-Surprising historical accuracy. I alt-tabbed to check wikipedia a few times and was always pleasantly surprised. Hegemony: Rome does a great job of putting you in Caesar's sandals.-Fantastic, seamless zoom-out world map. The world map is intuitive and looks exceptionally well. A tastefully done ""seamless zoom"" has been promised by strategy games for years and this one actually delivers.Cons:-General clumsiness in controlling units and the camera. Units also seem to alternate between odd rigidity and ending up locked in combat while seemingly doing nothing. The strange combat model ultimately makes it difficult to engage in the kind of tactical maneuvers you might expect from a game about Classical warfare.-Supply system that's heavy on micromanagement and light on strategic decisionmaking. The dilemmas and opportunity costs which should drive major decisions just don't exist here. Basically you're always trying to feed your legions in the field, and to do so you're required to individually create ""worker"" units, designate mines or fields for them to use, and then manually create supply routes to-and-from cities and outbuildings. There is also little UI in this regard - a list of trade routes sortable by destination/origin or some color coding options would help.Overall: 5/10. There appears to be no extra metagame choices offered by Hegemony: Rome's potentially interesting supply and resource systems. Instead we're left with a clumsy ""Warcraft:Rome edition"" that requires some mindless micromanagement on top of a stale combat system. I am looking forward to what extra patching and mods do to the game, but only the biggest strategy buffs should buy Hegemony: Rome in it's current state.			"

								If you have been disappointed by Rome II and its complete lack of challenge and how repetitive the game play is...well my dear fellow history nerd, search no more. Even at its early development stage Hegemony Rome: the rise of Caesar already shows veeeeeeeeeeeeery promissing features. This is a game that really satisfies the tactical,strategic and operational side of any strategy player. The graphs are better than before and there is even a variety of faces amongst soldiers.Thre are tons of civil nad military buildings that can be built and/or destroyd according to you strategy (i.e. bridges,forts)There is a huge variety of units and each one of them has its pros and consThe terrain is much more detailed and plays a much more importante role, you have to build bridges to cross certain rivers and certain mountain pass only allow for one of your units to fight at a time.The interface needs a little work but its already 10x than the previous installment, requiring less clicks while not being dumbed down.I am also very happy to see that the developers really care about the community and it is open for suggestions, unlike the other guys(CA,SEGA). There is a MODS tab which suggests taht the game will be moddable, which needless to say, is an awesome feature.In summary, do yourself a favor and buy this game.			"

												Hegemony's seamless tactical map is very much the series' trump card, and upon starting a campaign in the latest entry, Hegemony Rome: Rise of Caesar, it's immediately obvious why. Every single resource that you own, from the lowliest unit of captured slaves to your grandest city, is represented at ground level and as part of a strategic overview. Zoom out as far as possible and you can see all these points of interest as tokens on a parchment map spread across a desk in Caesar's war room. Which is great for an overall picture of your situation, but Hegemony cleverly mixes this omniscient strategic control with the ability to respond instantly to emerging threats on the front line.It's a clever system that avoids the clumsy disconnect between combat and a clunky tactical map that plagued Rome II. Here you've got total control, but also the smoothness of being able to respond instantly to developments on any scale. There's no stopping and starting, no waiting for loading screens or enemy turns. Just the grand plan.For a game about Julius Caesar, one of the pre-eminent battlefield geniuses of his day, it's a shame that Hegemony doesn't do the old ultraviolence particularly well. Expect very basic RTS fare, with most battles inevitably coming down to dry numbers rather than being decided by tactical trickery. The business of organising your force into an efficient formation is too clunky, lacking the clarity of, say, Total War's drag and drop approach.There's still a basic satisfaction to be found in massacring scores of the enemy with your elite troops, or crushing helpless infantry with a cavalry charge, but it's a much less cinematic and deep affair than I'd hoped for. I wasn't expecting Hollywood battles given the massive discrepancies in budget compared to similar war gaming titles, but a little more finesse wouldn't have gone amiss. To be fair, Hegemony isn't trying to ape the epic flourishes of Total War. While that series glories in the spectacle, the dust and blood and clash of war, Hegemony Rome is really a game about infrastructure and force organisation.The logistics and ruthless precision of a well-planned military campaign. The four-part campaign is designed to gently ease you into the game, teaching you the core systems one by one and slowly ramping up the stakes with each chapter. Based on Caesar's actual diaries of the Gaul campaign, it starts with his dismantling of the tribes at Bibracte and ends with his troops crossing the Rubicon back to Rome, taking you through various skirmishes, battles and periods of fortification and construction along the way.Once you’ve mastered the game's various intricacies via the campaign, you'll feel more comfortable diving in to the open sandbox mode, which puts you in charge of whatever faction you fancy and lets you decide for yourself how to conquer Gaul.Hegemony Rome’s quick, neat and easy approach to grand strategy puts impressive control in the player’s hands. The seamless and easy to navigate tactical map is a real strength, one that similar war games could do with taking note of. That said, despite commendable scope and some neat ideas, the meat and potatoes combat system and issues with the interface and AI decision-making slightly bog down the overall package.			"

Hegemony Rome: The Rise of Caesar is both a solid, fun game and a serious contender for the best 'Rome-based' RTS game in the last few years. Like the majority of others I consider the Total War: Rome franchise to be the benchmark for this genre, and despite the bugs and gameplay issues Rome II had, it got better after patching. The original Total War: Rome was fantastic regardless. It may not be fair to compare the two games considering this is technically an indie release, but I figure even newcomers to the RTS genre have heard of or played a Total War title and it's the most logical (and easiest) comparison.That said, the devs here didn't try to mimick Total War by redesigning or borrowing its good parts. In fact this game is nothing like Total War. Rather, Longbow Game Studios changed the focus entirely by making historical accuracy and in-depth resource management the two biggest components of Hegemony, and it works very well on top of the standard RTS framework. Hegemony is also far less daunting than Rome and Rome II. Players new to strategy games can jump into the campaign mode and start playing immediately*, but there's also enough substance to keep veteran RTS gamers engaged. The graphics are passable and run smoothly on the highest settings, and the cutscenes are just that - static scenes drawn with a ""comic book"" style to them. It's a nice break from the bombardment of massively rendered 3D action scenes that end up cheesy and unrealistic because of bad anti-aliasing and direction. The comic book art is also very mature, and there is plenty of violence and blood, which is a nice touch as well.That asterisk up there? It's for the biggest flaw in this game and (ironically) part of why this game is so easy to jump into: the tutorial system is lacking. You can jump right into this game as a new player and the tutorial will guide you, but you are going to have to learn a lot of the minute details by banging your head against the wall losing captured cities and dying often during the first couple hours. Even veteran RTS players will have to figure out some of the details by trial and error. The most glaring is the lack of explanation about hostages and captured city morale. After you understand it, it makes sense, but you will have to experiment a lot first. (Hint: move your hostages to far away cities. The game fails to mention that part.)Overall, this is a good game. Is it worth $30? Yeah, but probably only for Roman history fans and RTS fanboys in general. If you are brand new to RTS games you might want to wait until this goes on sale.[Update after a long, long break: They've patched it a few times and there's even a DLC out now, which shows me they do care about this game longterm. I'm about to play through again on Hard mode and am looking forward to it. If you read the early reviews about constant crashing, those issues seem to have vanished now. Keep that in mind when deciding on purchasing this.]			"

												First off: I really enjoyed Hegemony Gold: Wars of Ancient Greece. And that's part of the problem.Hegemony Rome tries to achieve more in some aspects, for example city building. Sadly those new features are nothing compared to the loss of depth and functionality, as this game isn't the same kind of 'open world' game as its predecessor, with its ultimate freedom.I pretty much only played the very first mission of the campaign. There were 2 parts of preparation, and I chose to go west first and not south. My choice triggered new tasks in the west and north, so I did those too. During a march that lead me very far north, I registered a lack of supplies and sent the majority of my troops back to the nearest city.What I didn't know: At the target I would have gained free supplies and I was expected to fight a huge battle there. Result: I wasted the triggered free food and naturally I lost the battle with my few units, that I did not send back. It was a disaster.Afterwards I went south beyond the Alps for more units, the second option from the tasks that I had been given at the beginning. So now I had sufficient troops, but what about food? As you might remember, food was the reason why I failed at the first place.So I tried to prepare for another full march north, but I never managed to gain enough of supplies by a mile. And yes, I connected the frontier city with other cities and set its stock demand on high. Yet it never went above 150 food in stock, which isn't even closely enough. Or in other words, it was a deadlock. Compared to the open world in Greece, you are now confronted with triggers all over. You have to follow a deisgned path and if your decisions differ even slightly from the idea the developers had in mind, it might mean the final end of your ambitions. If that happens already during the very first mission, I can't imagine how painful it might become later.Add many minor control and handling issues and you have a disappointing game.			"

												Hegemony Rome: The Rise of Caesar is the game I've been waiting for. This game combines the grand strategy of Total War, but the base building and tacticality of classic RTS games. Pros:1) Decent graphics, which I actually think fit the game perfectly.2) Easy unit control and building.3) Massive sandbox mode has a map of all Gaul, which is amazing.4) Genuinely challenging but fun strategy game, fit for newcomers and veterans.Cons:1) Some people might not like the graphics as much as I do.2) Massive learning curve which can be fun and extremely rewarding to get through.3) Some performance issues when zooming in quickly, but pass shortly. (might just be my PC)4) The 'Combat Locking' feature is something I could do without.5) As far as I know, there is no multiplayer whatsoever.Overall, 8.5/10 Should buy if you're bored with current RTS games, and should definetly buy if this game is on sale.

Early Access Review
								This game is still very rough in it's ""pre-release"" form.   This is a real-time game but not like other RTS.  It is a war/strategygame that is different from most.  If you are not familiar with the format, I sugest you buy ""Hegemony Gold Wars of ancient Greece"" .    It is a great game which will give you a better feel for the times and problems of warfare in those times than any other source.    I have struggled to finish the first two chapters of the story with many saves and crashes and reloads.   Even the tutorial portion is unfinished so being very familiar with ""Wars of Ancient Greece"" helps a lot.  Waiting for the next fixes and some more chapters....Chiyotay			"

												TL/DR: Mix of RTS and Total war that actually works. Also the frequent crashes many reviews mention(I had to set autosave to 5 minutes to avoid going insane) have been fixed in late October 2014, so consider this in your purchase evaluation.(!)Hegemony Rome: the Rise of Caesar is the Successor of Hegemony Gold: Wars of Ancient Greece which itself is sort of an Upgrade of Hegemony: Phillip of Macedon. All three Titles basically work the same so If you want to test the Game(or one of it's predecessors) any one of them(or a demo) will give you quite a good impression of what's going on. What's good about this game?1.) ... wait, you've read(or will read) other shorter/longer reviews, you saw the Trailer, you maybe even played Hegemony Gold. So I'm just going to skip this and go right to the bad things and you go figure out why I spent 100 Hours(jeez) on this game despite the bad points below, eventho I have like 200 other games in my steam account and a job that earns me enough money to buy said games ;) So what's bad? 1.) Unit variety. Gauls/Britons/Germans all have the same old: Skirmisher(guys with swords), Slinger, Javelineer, Spearman and Cavalry. Gauls also get Archers, Romans only get Legionaries(strongest unit). Some subfactions get some statbonuses but most factions are essencially the same. I liked the variation in Heg. Gold, where Macedon, Persia, Athens, Illyria, Sparta, Nomads, Thracians and gerneric Greeks all had different unit-sets. They are however working on this and enabeling modding, so I'm optimistic. 2.) The AI, while not particualry stupid*, has significant limits pertaining to it's inability to grasp the game, it does not train veterans, it builds buildings seemingly at random, it does not manage it's food supply properly etc. on the other hand this makes taking enemy cities less time consuming^^. 3.) The forum is dead. If you got a problem, just ask here on steam, it's more likely to attract the devs, or other players for that matter.4.) In the Campaign you command Kaisars Gallic Legions. A common quest reward are extra Legionary Cohor... Brigades. As you play a special Campaign faction(and not the regular Sandbox Romans) you cannot train them yourself, in turn you cannot disband them, sounds ok sofar. However, to replenish these troops(and your Uber Archer and Slingerunits) you need Roman Population. Now where would you find that? In roman cities. Now guess how many roman cities there are in Belgiu... Belgia. One. An average city can sustain 2-4 Brigades. In essence, unless you only use low morale Gallic troops you are going to spend most of your time waiting for your Capital to recover it's pop. yeesh. Having ""culturechange"" as a rare Questreward as in Heg. Gold would have prevented this. 5.) Workers/slaves cannot carry Food. Players of Heg. Gold will know why this is a bad thing, you essencially need to plonk down expensive camps everywhere so your troops don't die of starvation during a siege. That, or you upgrade your troops carry capactiy instead of Attack/Morale/Hitpoints/LOS/men per unit, and who wants that?6.) the Campaign ends with good old Cheese-R explaining his righteous struggle against the Senate and then whining a bit about his death. Something I find quite a remarkable thing to do for a corpse. Then again I find most non-rotting-related things quite remarkable if done by dead people. Also with the (horrible) intro movie showing him lead his legions over the Rubicon I would have at least expected a cliffhanger hinting to a sequel where he fights against the Senate, that or an optimistic but mysterious ending that incites young people to look up what happend to him on wikipedia just to discover his grim fate, that would have been neat, and cheaper.*it's actually pretty mean :(			"

												This is very good real-time strategy game with big focus on tactics (unit types, facing, flanking, upcoming - currently beta tree - ambush system) and logistics (need to connect assets, such as cities, mines, farms, woodcutters with land or water connections, through which food and wood is transported, and depending on length/difficulty of connection, there is tax - longer routes cost more in gold, but also have % of wood/food/gold production lost).Another part of logistics is recruits - each city has capped amount of recruits pool, which regenerates over time. Your units need to be in supply range of fort or city with land connection to their home city to be able to draw recruits to replace casualties (further from home city, slower the reinfoircements. You can change unit's home city, but (probably) only within other cities of the same tribe.Big part of the game is unit experience, which is what will keep you playing mostly.You are member of particular civilization and tribe. Your native cities are loyal, but any conquered cities need either garrison buildings, garrison, and/or hostages put somewhere else to prevent it from rebelling (don't worry it's not too complex and you don't need to pay constant attention to it). Conquering another nation can mean getting their wood, gold and food sources, their recruitment pool, but depending on their bonuses you get access to units with combat bonus of their native faction or terrain capability of that faction, or even to different unit types (if you conquer roman city as barbarian, you get access to roman legionaires, which have very different stats).There are some differences between nations/tribes, some have larger number of native cities, others have some bonuses (meelee/ranged combat bonus, terrain-specific unit capability on recruitment).Amount of unit types is not huge - skirmishers, spearmen, slingers, cavalry, javelinmen, archers for barbarians, additional infantry and cavalry of roman factions. After earning experience in battle (or small amount on recruitment with some building upgrades build) you can (and should) spend this on purchasing officers for that unit, up to four (non-detachable) officers of four levels plus (detachable) general. These can provide significant bonuses to offensive and defensive capabilities of unit, morale, logistics, terrain-passage, siege, scouting, and probably more bonuses(typically you'll want combat bonuses first for meelee units, ranged bonus for ranged units). Generals work same as officers, but can be detached and moved to another unit or to govern some city (not sure about effects of that, maybe is still work in progress).There is lot of content in the game already, and game is very good, although there are still things to be done (AI is good in handling some tasks but not so good with others). Good news is that developers are working actively on the game, and judging from support history from original Hegemony game (which was focused on Greece) they can be trusted to do so for years and years to come.Compared to original Hegemony, there is less variation in units, because it takes place largely in homogenic area of Gaul.

Early Access Review
								I started the game to have a quick look at it, next time I looked on the time was 4 hours later.If you like economic management paired up with some tactical combat this game is for you. If you do not know what I am talking about, give it a try. But if you want a game packed with action and excitement then you might be disappointed. Don't get me wrong, these things are still happening if you let them. You can pause at any time and play the game at your own very pace.It is still an unfinished game, so expect technical and gameplay issues; most importantly, read the ""Known Issues"" list in the main menu. The time you are beyond these problems the game turns out to be a lot of fun. You jump into Gaul as it is conquered by Cesar (a.k.a you). Mainly you focus on conquering and dealing with the threats the local tribes are representing, but you also have to keep you economy running. Otherwise your troops will not have enough to eat and receives serious penalties. That's about it, but you can do things a few different ways already.The tutorial is decent enough to tell you how you play, although some mechanics I did not understand up to a few hours into the game.Overall I just can recommend this game to players of strategy games, both realtime and turn-based. To FPS gamers this might be a bit boring, but whatever suits you :)			"

												I picked this up in early access due to my enjoyment of the Hegemony Gold game. It wasn't optimized then so I let it sit for a while. It is now decently polished, and optimized.The Hegemony series is in antithesis of the dominant form of RTS (Starcraft Style). It is a slow playing ballet that builds over hours where a handful of units can have a large impact and a single raid can cause problems for an unwary empire. The way supply and manpower are handled in this series is brilliant, creating a very thoughtful style of gameplay that I would love to see more often.The bigger your empire, the more difficult it is to protect it, and manage getting the needed food and manpower to the right place.The four story campaigns follow the career of Caesar in Gaul in exacting detail. You will invade Britain, you will cross the Rhine, and you will see your province torn apart by rebellion. By the end of it you will feel like you have conquered the place yourself, and maybe feel a little shell shocked at having to deal with pesky raiders constantly picking at your flanks.The game is by no means perfect. If you are not a patient gamer, or a thoughtful exploiter of gaming systems you may not enjoy it. The scope of the game might have been a little too ambitious for such a small studio, and it occasionally falls apart. It is slow to start, but that humble beginning only lets you appreciate the epic scope once you get there.Pros-Supply lines and manpower mechanics define how the game is played. Raids can be devastating, and concentrating an entire army in one place will often cause you to lose as you run out of food or your empire is picked apart by raiders.-New Experience System lets you specialize Legions, and even promote officers from veteran legions to lead others.-Flanking and positioning make an enormous difference.-You can built forts and bridges, and customize cities.Take it or Leave it-Siege warfare is brutal. Better plan it out.-Naval Warfare can be finicky-Not a lot of different varities of unit, however the differences become very meaningful as you learn how to use them,Cons-Slow to start-The supply mechanic is not for every gamer-Not as flashy as a AAA titleI will let it sit for a while longer then I'll try the sandbox campaign and some mods I think, then update my review. Good on you Longbow, I always hoped for another after Hegemony Gold and I am glad to see it.V,V,V			"

												This game hits the spot if you are interested in historical, detailed strategy. It is much less of an empire building game as, say, Total War's Campaign or Civilization, while also not quite as ""epic battle-centered"" as the Total War battles. Instead, it focuses more on the waging war in the ancient period as a whole, rather than just the battle. You're managing every aspect of campaigning. Keeping your units and cities provisioned through an extensive network of supply lines is crucial, and using natural borders of forests, mountains and rivers is important to maintain the safety of that very same network. Construct camps and bridges as resupply points or defenses. Take hostages to ensure the obedience of your subdued enemies. Keep your army in good morale. Promote officers and assign generals. Definitely don't get stuck in the Alps during winter, unless you want your troops to get snowed in and starve (I speak from experience :( ). Rather than focusing on just the battle itself, Hegemony Rome puts you in charge of ALL the decisions that a commander (such as Caesar) would have had to make whilst campaigning. All this on a truly gigantic map of Gaul (and some bits of Northern Italy, Southern Britain, Belgium and Switzerland) representing every major historic tribe and geographic feature.The game remains intuitive and attractive, however. Despite its scale, it remains overviewable through some rather unique design (zooming out from individual soldiers on terrain to miniatures on a parchment map).It also is absolutely unparalelled in its attention to historical detail, every city, faction and unit has a small in-game article of historical information that can be read. You could quite feasibly substitute this game for reading information on the Gallic Wars online.Hegemony Rome is quite different from any other strategy game out there. it is incredibly educative and detailed, while the basic game mechanics remain quite simple (though very different from other strategy games). If you are interested in history, and a detailed, accurate portrayal of what campaigning is like, this is the game for you.			"

								Due to this game beeing early access it is quite enjoyable to play. Though still quirky at some points (sometimes not enough feedback wether a unit is selected, units clip into each other, pathfinding still feels a little stupid, supplyline management) this game really  lets you dive right into it. It is well crafted mix between managing your cities and supplies and really fastpaced battleaction and I can highly recommend it to everyone that likes this kind of games.The first few hours are quite polished and I am looking forward how this game will improve throughout the development process. Down with the barbarii!Tip: You need to enhance the graficsettings, because their default values are the lowest possible ;)			"

												There are many great game out there were you fight battle. Although without a dought the best battle simulation games on the market are the total war series. The properly consider weather wind, moral, flanking supprise, shock terrain etc. But while the total war series is great for battles it is not much for simulating wars.Gone are the days where every battle can be won by overwealming a tiny kingdom. Gone are the days were you can march troops without a consern of supply. The hegemony series simulates war campaigns. Trust me ensuring troops are properly supplied can be a task, as the enemy is always trying to mess with your supplies.Unlike in most RTS games the player will not win by overwelming an opponent the will by flanking them on a grand scale. The game gives some nods to tactical battles, but the terrain tends to be too crowded to preform them properly. Everything in the world feels squashed together at times. Effects that would effect a grand compaign such as weather are not present.The game is lacking multiplayer. While I think a multiplayer match would have been a slow drag. I still think it would have been nice to have.Overall the game is worth a try. I appreciate a little variety in the game.			"

												I originally thought it would be a total war type game, just in real time.  It isn't, but it's an enjoyable game on its own.  The learning curve was not bad if you've played things like this before-I read a review complaining about the complexity pre-purchase, and may I say, that player was wrong.  There's a manual in steam for the game (I have not read it, didn't need to).  Link cities to share supplies, like food and wood, keep your troops in supply zones until needed, build forts to create supply zones in necessary locations.  You can check your spending budget and make cuts, but I have not found an overall happiness meter.  Each city has its own morale you can boost with troops and such, if it bottoms out you could lose it to rebels.Now that I'm done debunking that negitive review... the game is good.  Not great, not worth full price, but pick it up on an xmas sale or black friday.			"

								I love the direction this game is going in in terms of development.  Kinda wish there was a dedicated tutorial.  What is there is great but I personally prefer a seperate tutorial from game campaign.  I want to focus on story line and enjoy game play in the campaign.  Just a quirk of mine I guess.  That being said I love the graphics and smoth transition between objectives in the story line.  I'm typically a turn based strategy gamer but the methods used for this game flow are smooth and precise.  I have no problems keeping up and following the objectives.  I've yet to find anything I could call a problem.  It's fun, addictive and satisfies my thrill for strategy.  I strongly reccomend this game for any who love strategy, top line graphics, and excellent sound effects.  Maybe I haven't found it yet but would like to see some sort of replay on some of the battles for review and sharing.  It's headed in the right direction and I'm glad I bought it now.  Will have to get for a friend as well.			"

												Some good ideas in this game, poorly executed. It feels a bit like trying to control a bike with no handle bars, especially during the too-fast, too-light and ultimately C&C style combat. Mad clicking is the order of the day rather than any tactical thought.The heart of the game lies in resource management, but again there's not enough control available to the player and the resource allocation / movement seems semi random. All in all, for a fiver I don't feel robbed but this does look more like a tech demo than a finished product.I would only recommend at budget prices.			"

												With the mixed reviews on both Steam and Metacritic I was not expecting too much from this game. But it is surprisingly engrossing, with a slow-moving pace and almost hypnotic game play. There is a lot of emphasis on resources, the combat is ok but a bit dumbed down, and diplomacy seems almost non-existent. That said it is pretty satisfying to grow your empire. Game play seems to come down to gradually expanding your empire while avoiding over-extending, and very limited resources make every decision more difficult. Should you beef up your city defences or build a few new units? Invest in city buildings to build new unit types like Cavalry or invest in a marketplace to generate more income? There are lots of ways to play –raid enemy farms for resources, steal slaves from enemy posts, ambush enemy units etc, starve the enemy into submission etc.   The AI is pretty good, with the enemy launching attacks on your weak spots and retreating in the face of superior forces. There is a full fog of war so you never really know what is happening outside your territory.After playing the same sandbox scenario (as one of the Brittanic tribes) for some 30+ hours, and still being a long way from completion, I would have to say the game is starting to get a little predictable and formulaic. Position and strengthen your forces, capture enemy positions such as farms and mines, capture an enemy city, suppress revolt, recover from your losses, repeat and thus slowly grow your empire. That said it has been absorbing getting to this point, and the game has some nice touches - I can’t quite stop playing... yet. If you are a fan of Total War, Civilisation etc and this is on special offer then I would recommend it. Tips for new players: expand your realm slowly. The AI will hit you hard if you over-extend. Ships tend to sink in the winter months (put them in a city until spring). Upgrade cities to have the marketplace – cash is king in this game and is usually the main limiting factor to expansion. Capture enemy farms etc and send any remaining slaves back home to man your own farms etc. Capture enemy units and enslave the survivors. Captured slaves can be sent to a city and disbanded, adding to your own population to replenish your forces. If you lose a  unit, it is sent back to its home city where it will replenish. Mercenary units are useful, but do not replenish.  "

Apart from the UI, I would recommend… but why?Well! Are you looking for a visually stunning, history sim-style RTS? Was that yes?You’ve found the right game, get the Early Access now, and add your mark on the games design process, before it’s too late!LIKES:I’ll keep this short and simple:Graphics – STUNNING… the willow trees look like willow trees, need I say more?Sound – Does the job, not going blow you away, but better than a budget title by far!Mechanics – These are unique in my opinion, to this game, but the tutorial really helps you out here. Try not to get ahead of yourself; if you don’t then you’ll be rewarded at the right time for the right things. OH! and the ZOOMIE CAM! Oh how I love this game mechanic, your able to zoom right out from the battle field and you’ll actually be able to control the game from a map that’s based on a table, assumingly Caesars battle map in this tent/base, really well done here!fun? – draws you in, first of all with visuals but then by the historical facts it starts sharing with you along with a gameplay that is unique to itself, and finally by the pure attention to detail.DISLIKES:Afraid to say it, but games these days almost always have something to complain about, and that’s the UI. As its Early Access, then I hope this fixes.Oh you evil space consuming UI, thou art so frustratingly annoying!Why does thee need a map when thee has a speedy scrolling map thingy…. Bla bla blaYeah it’s a real shame, it suffocates you like those moments when a cat sticks its tail right in your face! The game is so well visually designed, so much so that I would really start being absorbed into the game and feel like I was a real general overlooking the battlefield, but I can’t help but notice the UI.Suffice to say I could go on for a while. I understand that someone has sat down and worked hard at creating this, so I appreciate that. However they want feedback and if this was improved it really would improve emersion, visual appeal and overall quality.OVERALL:As you can see there is only one thing that really bothers me about this title, and I hope in some ways that helps you decide what you are looking for, as the game is damn good, certainly playable (unlike most Early access titles) and a damn good educational journey into the past.If you love games of this style/genre, you will not be disappointed!APPROVED!

This game follows the military battles of Julius Caesar in which you act as the guiding hand of God moving his forces into the perfect (or poor) formations to get victories against the Gaullish and Germans.The game was not very well optimized for my AMD based video card.  On the second scenario it would crash fairly consistently after the battles got very large.  If you have an AMD video card, probably stay away from this title.It was fun and refreshing but unfortunately it looks like it exited early access a tad bit too early.  It's appropriate because it being in early access was basically a scam anyway.  The publisher of the game is owned by Kalypso Media (creators of Tropico) and this is just a somewhat clever way for them to have pre-orders of the game with higher sales.  The early access ONLY involved testing out the first campaign of the game, which is basically a demo.  Beyond the first campaign of the game there are a lot of problems with pacing, bugs, and gameplay.			"

Early Access Review
								I have high expectations from this game. I am a Roman enthisiast and play literally every game to do with Ancient History but more importantly than that, I have played their predeccesor that was based on the Ancient Greeks (More importantly Philip II of MAcedon) I have spent hours on their games and I understand that this game will take so much time to complete considering they are such a small company but overall I am impressed with what they have achieved so far and I am grateful they have given us early access to the game.For those who compare it with Rome II, I dismiss their reviews instantly as it is and always has been a completely different game. In addition, although this game has a few bugs and still needs a lot of improvement (I constantly get a CTD at a certain point in CHapter 1) I am completely confident that this company will sort these bugs out and sort out their tactical maneuvering (They have mastered that in their previous game, therefore, they will in subsequent updates of this game.)I thoroughly enjoy the story mode they have included within this game which is something new but apart from that, they still allow you to deviate from the 'main story line' and conquer at will (though quite restrictive in this early access.). What's more is that they have added a load of new features such as upgrading cities and units. To be honest, I was struck by the amount of upgrades they have actually included within the game! (I was only expecting a couple throughout). I understand people, especially people like me, who want complete historical accuracy in their Ancient games but in this game I take an acceptance of the fact that although their units are not a complete comparison to what they were in actual real life, these units are fun to play with.  I haven't got far into this game as it does not allow you to go that far but in conclusion, I am confident that this fairly good game will become a really really good game within time. I believe their next step would be to sort out all the current bugs that are within the game and go from there. If I am honest, if you want a complete game that allows you to play all the features I would not recommend this game, nor any early access game as you will be dissapointed, but if you are like me and have had experience with this company (Who do actualyl listen to your opinions!) and their games then I would definitely recommend it!PS - The campaign map looks excellent, the updated graphics are a bonus but they have made the map lok more 'filled' with all the new workers they have populating the area. I am also grateful for giving us a tremendous amount of cash! I cannot wait to start the real game in all its entirety! PSS - Sorry for this long unstructured review which probably will not help anyone. Enjoy! ~ Zeno			"

												This game is a decent enough strategy game, with very solid and well implemented mechanics. However, its gameplay very rapidly becomes repetitive, especially in the grand campaign, and somehow it manages to make an absolutely massive map encompassing the entirety of France and some parts of Italy, England, and the Lowlands feel small and congested. The campaign also disappointingly doesn't go onto Caesar's civil war after he's done with Gaul, which would've made for far more worthwhile DLCs than a couple of unit packs. The combat itself deserves a very specific mention as one of the few mechanical areas of this game that's actually bad. Legionaries break far too easily, and you can get crippling flank penalties from like two or three enemy troops bumping into the side of your formation.Ultimately, I don't recommend this game unless it's on sale. It's certainly worth buying and playing, but not at full price.			"

												I really loved the first game Hegemony Gold Wars of Ancient Greece. It started out rough and bare bones and over time the devs made it into something really awesome. So I bought this game and when it wasn't really ready I shelved it for a while and didn't think anything of it. I figured they'd fix it. Sad to say the game is not fixed. It's better but it still crashes a lot. The frame rate is terrible. It's not just that the frame rate is low but that it jumps from 50-60 fps to 10 fps when you scroll in and out or try to move around the map. The game play is heavily based around seamlessly scrolling and zooming the map so this is a major problem. (It's not my pc, I can run Rome 2 Total War and Fallout 4 on their highest settings with no problems). In between crashes and frame rate problems I think it's a good game. The little I was able to play was fun and challenging with some interesting mechanics. But it's not good enough to put up with the problems. Also, the dev has released Hegemony 3 which I gather fixes the problems in Hegemony Rome. That's not nice.  "

												A nice little strategy game. Videos and screenshots seem kinda cool but the real experience differs. It's rough around the edges with harsh controls that you need to spend some time to get a grip on. Also graphics could be better and the amount of performance needed for the full experience does not give the results one expects. It still needs work but it's a good alternative for those who cannot afford the total war franchise. It's strategy approach did  little for me and I stopped at 2 hours of gameplay because it gets kinda boring. Constant updates are made though so I am going to wait some time and then review this game again. To sum up so far it does not deserve its starting price. If you find during a sale you might be tempted but still wouldn't recommend it to classic strategy game aficionados.			"

												OK. First off... I would only recommend this game if you are into the history of Caesar. Don't get me wrong, it is a fun to play game, but has some drawbacks.-The game can be sluggish. You might want to reduce the graphics settings to get a smoother experience.-For one, the price is too high for this version of the game. I think too many improvements are needed to make it worth the price really.-The game is CLUMSY! at first. It deff. takes some getting used to. The zooming in and out of the map is nice, but it doesn't always transition very well. Clicking on units and cities take a lil precision with the mouse as well.-The tutaorial sux. It doesn't always guide you as to exactly what you need to do next. The little window that pops up explaining things (as in Total War series) kinda gets in the way of some info. Not sure how to close the window.-Graphics are ok, although somewhat dated.-Combat is very simple when compared to the Total War series. Although this is not always a bad thing.Has some nice features you do not see in other games. The integration of battle and campaign are done very well. Both are tied together on the same map... and things happen in real time. For example... while one of your legions is in desperate battle with enemy raiders, you can send more troops up from a different part of the map to help, or to engage another enemy. In otherwords... LOTS IS GOING ON AT ONCE!My advice if you get this game, TAKE YOUR TIME at first. Let the screens load, listen to the advice the AI gives you... don't get overwhelmed at the sudden influx of OBJECTIVES. Just navigate the screens as needed to get a grip on what is going on. It is not a game you can just jump in and start waging war.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is the next installment in the Hegemony series from Longbow Games. The Hegemony series has so far shown to be deeper than most zerg-rush RTS games. It forces the player to think tactically about more than just the troops being thrown at an enemy. I have to constantly evaluate my situation on multiple levels in order to triumph. This is not brought about from complex micromanagement systems, as seen in ot6her titles. It is simply an organic result of focusing on the main aspects of building an empire such as knowing an enemies strengths and weeknesses, dealing with supply issues, and utilizing the available resources wisely. Taken all together, Longbow games have made long lasting RTS games that continue to challenge and satisfy far beyond what I have found in other titles. How well historical fact is woven into the game only adds to my enjoyment. If you are still not convinced, I strongly reccomend trying the free demo for Hegemony Gold to get a taste of the franchise.			"

Early Access Review
								Having waited months for this games release its seems I'll have to wait a bit longer till the bugs are solved so I can start enjoying  it. After starting the campagn four times I simply got tired of my units becoming stuck or disapearing or the game crashing, having said that I did enjoy what I could play. The town development and the need for logging camps is a great improvement on the two previous Hegemony games as it allows towns to lose the feeling of sameness of the previous games. The biggest drawback is the same as the earlier games, the need to control everything. Caesar did delegate comand and the need to chase down every small band of raiders and repair and recapture every structure will lead to the same game fatigue of first two Hegemony games. Hopefully the creation of separate chapters to cover the entire campaign will prevent that.			"

												Overall, after 6 months and 300 hours of play, I'm very happy with this and would love to see some of the features of Rome added back into Gold, viz. supply lines and camps/forts,  requesitioning of allies' resources, mercenaries, building options and the build up/ distribution of resources. Also like the basic campaigns as a means of learning the game and then taking on the Steam achievements to make the tasks set even more challenging.Having some issues with older games now not loading (game crashes when I try to load them up) after updates are installed and Chapter 3 getting stuck once I start building warships and barring access to Britain. Also now having some graphics issues that prevent play at the 3D level without blurred views of the terrain and units.Like the new features that have come with the updates and the DLC adds some extra chrome. Looking forward to what's next in this chapter of the Hegemony series.			"

Well worth playingEven though the early access version is still quite rough around the edges I had a blast playing the first mission. Between organizing my different troops, supplying them with food and reinforcements I really felt like an ancient general. While upgrading my towns and establishing supply routes I especially liked how I constantly had to adapt to the ever growing borders my conquests led to.Is this game for me?If you like strategy titles but don't want to wade through those bland tables of raw data that you find in grand strategy titles Hegemony Rome: The Rise of Caesar will be your game. It is far less twitchy than most RTS titles but especially in larger battles the action can get intense.			"

												Probably one of the best strategy war games I have played in donkeys years.  I thought I was going to be playing a poor mans version of total war, but to be very frank with you it's a lot better than a total war game and simplified beautifully.  Ok the battles are not as visually stunning as total war and lack detailed unit management, but its not really a skirmish battle simulator.  This game is all about supply and logistics management and they have got it spot on.The AI is beautiful and attacks you in weak areas or cuts into supply lines if you fail to defend routes or knock out uprisings.  Every small victory on the map is hugely penile stimulating, however small victories can back fire if mis-managed.All I can say is buy this game and whip your slaves into shape for the love of Caesar and thy Gods.

												It's a great game.  A lot of the complaints I've seen from others are true, but they don't bother me.  I'd describe the game as a cross between Total War and Starcraft, and that is true in that it has RTS and strategic aspects, but that really doesn't do the game justice.   It's just massive.  I'm 9 hours into a campaign, and I'm about 25% finished.Things I love:1. The realistic complexity:  Walking your army through a small area without many farms may very well eat all their food and cause them to revolt.  Everything in the game has a cost/benefit, and the game designers clearly went to a great deal of effort to make the game feel authentic.2. It's addictive:  I find myself playing for 5 hours and still wanting to ""just finish this one thing"".3. The single player campaign:  It basically follows Caesar's accounts of his wars in Gaul.  If you've read his memoirs, you know the entire campaign because it pretty much follows it to the letter.  I was annoyed with the final fight with Vercingetorix.  I was expecting  massive attacks from all sides, but there was just a large army sent out from the city which I locked up in a choke point and took out with my archers with zero losses.4. The seemless transition between the strategic and tactical map.  No other game I've played has ever tried this.  They've truly pushed the genre on this one.  It took a while to get the hang of it, but it works very well.  Sometimes, it works too well.  Imagine trying to fight 4 ""Total War"" fights simultaneously.  This happens and it can be annoying.  On the other hand, this is only happening because I'm pushing 3 armies up through Gaul at the same time while they are also attacking my flank.  That's awesome.Complaints about the game:1.  It's too easy.  Granted, I've been playing these games forever, so I'm good, but after your troops get upgraded, they just roflstomp any opponents.  This is partly because the computer doesnt attack smartly and partly because the computer upgrades its units stupidly.  The computer is, however, persistant, and if you don't cover your flanks, for both your army and your cities, you will be punished.  The first hour of a map is difficult with limited resources.  After that, I've got so much gold, food, and wood that I don't even bother to optimize my cities.2.  Balance.  This is always difficult to do, and I realize that.  Getting experience for your archers is a pain, but once fully upgraded, archers with anything in front of them to tank just annihilate any opponent in about 2 seconds.  In fact, you really don't need anything tanking for your archers.  It's only a little helpful when you're in a 2v10 fight.3.  Crashes.  My games crash about once ever 3 hours.  However, Total War also crashes about once every 3 hours.  I just save a lot.All in all, I've played for 60 hours and I'm not ready to quit.    It's addictive, fun, and interesting.			"

												Honostly the game had me drawn in when i watched the first video of it, it focus's more on your empire, supplys, and keeping your border safe then out commanding your enemy but they dont let that slack either. Being able to have your battles with charging, flanking, and eventualy making your enemy route but it gives reason not to slaughter your enemy for thoes that march to fight you will work great in your mines and fields. This is a game i would recommed to sit and watch all videos for it as it is its own game in my opinion but still great on its own.			"

												I have not played the first Hegemony game, so i can not make comparisons on how good/bad this one is vs the first one. On the other hand, as someone who comes from the Total War series(started with Rome 1 back in 2004), i have to admit that at first i was quite skeptical about this game, for my surpirse however, Hegemony Rome turned out to be supperv! Sure the battles do not have the scale nor the complexity that Total War has, but the rest of the game is way ""supperior"" in many aspects, specially its depth and ""realism"" with features such as food rations and supply lines playing a big role.It's attention to historically correct facts and details is very impresive, it almost serves as an interactive history lesson.Deffinetly worth every peny in my opinion!

												This is copied and pasted from my reivew of Hegemony III, but the same applies to Rise of Caesar:The entire Hegemony franchise -- starting with Philip of Macedon through Rome: Rise of Caesar to Clash of the Ancients -- is sadly underappreciated, and it's hard to understand why. These are outstanding strategy games. If you enjoy Total War (I for one do; TW Rome II *eventually* turned into an excellent game with extensive patching), you absolutley should give Hegemony a try. The tactical combat is obviously less involved than Total War, but the strategic side is arguably deeper, with emphasis on things like logistics, change of seasons etc. The seamless transition between the strategic 'panned out map' view and the tactical 'zoomed in' view is lovely, and something TW doesn't offer. Makes for very fluid gameplay.The Hegemony games seem to go on sale pretty regularly, and even at the full $30 price ($20 in case of Rise of Caesar), they are *well* worth it (half the price of a AAA title, but in my opinion, every bit as polished than the big offerings of big studios). If you're interested in ancient world warfare. whether titles like AGEOD's Alea Jacta Est or CA's Total War Rome, do yourself a favor and take a chance on Hegemony. These are hidden gems of strategy gaming.			"

												I'm unsure whether I really like this game or not. It has an awesome concept and executes it okay. It really lacks contents like unit variety (though you can pay rather expensive DLCs for that), it has a too simplified economy that hurts it and the AI is just incredibly bad. That there is no Multiplayer, does not better the situation. But its a fun game, the main problem is you've learned everything in about 20seconds and you will beat it at the most possible difficulty on your first try with only minor problems.TL;DR buy it when its price has been slashed and you are looking for casual, easy, short fun			"

As a fan of generally turn based strategy games, I am sceptical about playing RT however found HR to be just the right mix to not be quite a build a base spam as C&C. The campaign is extremely lengthy which is good and bad. I did find it slightly long winded at first wanting to get on to sand box and do my own thing, but I could of done that at any point anyway!Could do with some more variety in unit types with possible building upgrades to attribute units such as in Total War. Would be also nice to be able to build forts and bridges in areas of user specific choosing and not saved map areas.Great game, only issue I find is having enough time to play it!			"

												Tutorial was a bit patchy initially- I clearly went ahead of what they were saying which left me wondering what on earth I had to do once I had conquered and trade linked the first city to Geneva. Eventually tutorial resumed but still left me confused as to who I should be attacking (I had maybe 5 units versus a lot more raiders/Helveti). Then got slaughtered after taking the 2nd city and crossing the bridge, so idk if it is meant the start this hard but I'm really not used to my whole army being whiped out then eventually wining the battle after waiting for long recruitment/travel time to defeat an army. :/ Game is slow to load, and laggy loading although this may in part be my lack of RAM. Seems like it could be fun with a better inro/tuturial to get yo used to controls and unique features, but asI've had it about 2 weeks now and only borthered to load it a few times it is hardly that addictive/fun. Hopefully the new hegemonies will be better as this is fairly old now. Glad I only paid £5 (incl. delivery) off amazon now rather than £15 from Steam. Potential glitch today- when crossing bridges my units seem to get stuck on bridge apart from 1 unit which gets through and is slaughtered :/			"

There are some grand strategy elements, but like the Hegemony games before this one, the AI doesn't do much besides defend itself from you. This means if you are wanting to conquer the world it is essentially the same 3 step process for the entire map.

												Still a little rough around the edges, but is turning out to be pretty fun. It was difficult to figure out some things because the tutorial... well... isn't much help.The battle animations are, frankly.. HORRIBLE. If you zoom in on a battle, most of the units are walking around like zombies... occasionally you will see one swing a sword or something. Good grief.. fix this please. It is just stupid looking!!They need to add the ability to cycle thru your units (like Civ) instead of having to hunt them down all the time to check up on them (if there is a way, I haven't discovered it yet). The UI is WAY TOO BIG! Make it scalable, please! If you have a few windows open, they take up half the screen!Since the game was just recently released, I hope some of the rough edges get smoothed out, and locating all your units becomes a bit easier.These complaints are not stopping me from enjoying the game, but it would make the game more enjoyable and immersive. My biggest complaint is the lack of tabbing to cycle thru all your units. Again, if there is a way, maybe someone will help me out...			"

												5.5/10 This game has a lot of potential. A tutorial would be super helpful as they kinda just throw you into the game and tell you how to do a few basic things. Now let me justify the 5.5/10. For me personally a 10/10 game in this genre are games like Heroes of might and magic II & III, and to say this is anywhere near this is an insult. HR - Rise of Caesar is missing things like a skirmish mode where theres a random map generation and the objective is to beat everyone else on the map, and you know what? It might have it but because of the zero guidance found within the game I have yet to find it. it's also missing that ""oomph factor"" it doesn't leave you pumped after you play it. You close the screen look at the clock and go ""really? I wasted that much time? I didn't even accomplish anything in the game!"" The zoom out to map feature is really cool and well done but it just doesn't make up for the rest of the game. Am I mad I bought it? Absolutely not, I got it on sale and for what I paid (I think it was like 80% off?) it was money welll spent. Full price though would have left me dissapointed and angry I spend the money. Buy this game on sale (like at least 50% off), don't pay full price.			"

												What! ive played almost 24 hours on this game and ive only owned it for about three days?? DO I LIKE IT YOU SAY?? HELLS TO THE YEAH I LIKE IT!! 8.8/10If you are a total war fan boy/gal like myself who every once and a while dabbles in the RTS world, then this is the game for you my friend!! Now i consider myself a hard on game rater. No i dont get hard rating games..... What i mean is if you rate something a 10/10 then it better be a perfect game, and you can almost always find a fault in a game. Great news though!! This game has very few!!! Actually really just one. Lack of unit varity and facton character. There are only about 5/6 different unit types in the game no matter which faction you play as. I would of liked to see a faction/ region unit. Like the Briton factions might have special archers while the Gual factions have good cav. Somthing like that. Besides that, I do love this game. They do a lot right, and for how ambious this game was they pulled it off. The lack of unit variety really makes you think about how to use what you've got. All and all great game. Now they just need to add multiplayer and they have made a wondifferful game!!!!			"

												I'd like to like this game. There are lots of good features. But then there are the bad ones, and they are frustrating enough to break the game for me. The supply lines for instance. And your so called allies will do nothing at all. Not even defend their own territory from raiders. So you'll have to hunt down every raider with cavalry. Though cavalry isn't strong enough to beat the unit, so you'll have to have a melee unit to beat the raiders, and then the cavalry to hunt them down. Unless they outrun the cavalry of course, which is a very real possibility. Then they'll just run outside the part of the map you are allowed to play on, reform and return later.You can also set an autopause when a raider is spotted. But that could be while they are standing idle outside the area you can go to, and the next notification you'll get is that they've CAPTURED a camp, not entered your area or attacked your camp. And then your supply lines are tattered, which of course is logical and a nice feature, but each time you set up the supply lines it feels like a very unneeded micromanagement. Some raiders will continuously enter your area near a city. So I built some walls and battlements and put a unit of archers in the city. Now the raiders will run to the city and then stand their while my archers pick them off one by one, then flee back to their territory, reform and repeat.Honestly, allies are the biggest problem I have with supply lines as well as I'm losing a majority of my goods when I transport stuff through their lands. And no, there is no possibility to break the alliance and annex their lands. And the description of the supply lines are that they go one way only for some unknown reason. Each line costs some gold to maintain, and each fort (which makes supply lines easier to manage) costs some gold as well. And even though everything is connected and you have a good surplus you can still get food shortages, and I don't know why or how to fix it. Well, remove some troops of course, but then you fix the symptoms and not the cause.Combat is too fast to become really interesting. You could flank the enemy with your cavalry, but oftenly it takes too long time and your legions will have won the day before the cavalry arrives. Even though I got the DLC, combat is fast, short, easy and boring. This is a lot of complaints, for a game that I think is pretty fun. It's just that it has/had the potential to be great. Upgrade system, town management and the zoomable map are all wonderful, but overall, I would not recommend this game. Sadly.			"

												I tried the game out again after buying it in a bundle a few years ago and I played a 6 hour campaign that saw my tribe hold the entirety of britanny. The only reason why I did not move into the rest France is because I got bored and the game becomes a repetetive 4X game. Don't raid just capture resource camps, siege military camps, siege cities, repeat repeat repeat.  Because its a real time game it is really slow so if you plan on conquering the world its going to take like a week in real time. Also the game doesn't help you manage your supply lines or recommened better routes. Its really not that big of a deal but you usually end up paying like 10 coins on a bad route. Buy on sale because theres a lot of tiny things that may make you regret buying.			"

With a supply system that other great strategy games sadly lack, gorgous landscapes and cities, intelligent AI (they'll flank you, make defences, raid undefended areas more than defended ones, and hire mercenaries to bolster their ranks) an in-built mod-manager, and some superb art, this game is one of the best I've seen come from an obscure company.

												Firstly, the game is still buggy and crashes.  I simply wouldn't recommend this game because the field isn't balanced.  The enemy will almost ways win one on one and you have to outnumber them.  If you are going up against one unit you need two.  For two units you need three units, despite them being experienced or not.  If you face six units you need at least eight or nine and the field becomes too tight for them to manuever properly.  Cities will rebellion against you even if you have hostages and five units which you will lose and having a 100% moral.  After all that i simply just didn't like the resource gathering.  I think it suppose to be realistic but it just doesn't work in making the game fun and allowing events to flow.  Money too is odd and what is up with sailing units?  Couldn't figure out why they immediately take damage as soon as they are on the water?  Anyways, don't waste your time or money...there are better games to be played.			"

								For first impressions this is pretty solid. While most sequels abandon their first game like a sinking ship and completely rebuild it from scratch or go nowhere with it like it lost the map, this game does neither. I really enjoyed Greece with many hours under my belt and I surprised to find it's been overtaken by its sequel. Rome keeps the usual experience from Greece and ups it entirely. If you’re fan of strategy give this a go. For a Beta you won’t be disappointed.			"

												Hegemony Rome is a spiritual successor of Hegemony Gold and as such has a lot of its features. The seamless map where strategic and tactical layers are fused together with smooth zooming that makes the gameplay quite enjoyable. In comparison to the old game its a lot easier to get income to support your troops since now you can build buildings and other city improvement where as before that was more dependent on the mines. Markets are essential for income. Walls are also a necessity. Forts nicely increase the supply radious so that you can expand faster then before and sustain your troops which is very authentic for roman times. Officer upgrades are also quite nice although maybe not as intuitive as one would expect. Small tip for people who don't know how to get food/wood/gold supply going. Capture a farm/mine/logging camp with troops or workers (slaves can't capture buildings - you capture the farm by left clicking on worker/troops and right clicking on farm) and then send slaves or workers in the farm/mine/logging camp (right click on farm). Left click on farm/mine/logging camp after you captured it and right click on city and voila your supply line is set up. The same applies for city to city supply lines (left select city + right click on the city you wan't to connect to). Its as easy as possible.The AI really depends on what kind of game you wan't to play and how you set it up in sandbox settings - don't just choose random. Playing as a roman faction (2 of them in sandbox) there is no certainty that you will win cause you have a legionary army. You have to flank the enemy and as such bring their morale down. Ah, morale one of the most important factors in this game. Watch out for food supplies when you attack or your troops will have low morale and break fast and then you will have problems getting more troops since your troops are dead and it takes time to get more recruited like in reality. One important feature of the game that needs to be used a lot in later game is active pause so that you can move your armies and assault different enemy cities, forts, etc. Afterall this is an rts game.People complaining about lack of diplomacy options - its the time of constant betrayal and warfare so its really not necessary to have sofisticated options especially since you sustain your economy yourself if you know what you are doing. Graphics - not really important to me as long the gameplay is good and I think that graphics that are in this game on a map of such grand scale (several times bigger then Rome 2 map) are quite good. Does the game have issues? Yes, there are several instances where crashes or some glitches occur but they are not very common and game breaking (autosave is implemented). At this point I still recommend saving as many times as you can. I know the company for a long time and I know that if there are issues in the game they will be patched out and the game improved but only if people send them dump files that they can actually find the issues !!!  It took a long time for Hegemony Phillip of Macedon to become Hegemony Gold: Wars of Ancient Greece and it had similar issues that Hegemony Rome has but were patched out at the end. Basically they are like Arcen games when it comes to improving and fixing their games.What I like about this game are interesting, realistic formation battles, city improvements that make game more user friendly in comparison to Hegemony Gold and realistic morale and supply system in comparison to other games in RTS genre where you have your armies magically march through the whole map without any supplies and without any morale issues.As famous idiom by Napoleon Bonaparte says: ""An army marches on its stomach.""Just one more thing if you are expecting Rome Total War game from this - its not a Total War game so don't expect something like that or you will be dissapointed - its an RTS game of never before seen scale so it might be too much for a lot of players. I would still recommend the game at full price and over Rome 2 Total War at any time.			"

												The game is great. The game can not be compared to Total War. With less manpower and budged a much better game was made compared to Total War. The strategy elements are classic, but very well done. The artwork is very appealing and great. I like the realistic and simple. One gets the feeling of a Roman general as Caesar. The soundtrack fits the game. He raises a good feel. The campaign is a lot of fun. The Roman realism in the game is also unique and great.I love this game. I am very sad. Unfortunately, the Kickstarter project for III failed. I hope so much that the third part is yet to come at some point. But at this time I will still enjoy the second part of many hours.			"

												Although I probably will never conquer the entirety of Gaul (because the map is massive - 6 hours just to conquer all of Briton), I will try! Other than some minor performance issues - not gamebreaking at all - my biggest gripe is that once you conquer a city, you can only ever recruit that old faction's recruits.  I just wish there was a way to 'convert' the populace to your faction.  Roman factions unit diversity is quite saddening too without the use of mercs or other faction's units.This game, although far from perfect, is very fun.  I look forward to Hegemony III.8.5/10EDIT: Heh, ironically I write this on the Ides of March.			"

												When I first heard of the release of hegemony Rome and saw the first gameplay videos it looked to be quite pomising. To the positive aspects first:It offers an immense world to be conquered and with simple scrolling your mouse you can overlook all that or your miniature settlers and don't ever have to deal with a loading screen.Also the historical informations either given in the campaign or for the city desciptions are quite nice and informative.But that's pretty much it.The graphics of my settler game from 2001 are better and that game also was more fun for the price it costed back than. So if you can snap hegemony on steam sale for a few bucks like I did then your money isn't wasted but spending 30€ on it is just waaaaayy overpriced.			"

												Let's start out positive. It's an attractive game with a wonderful map, some decent strategic options, a good basis for gameplay (it's a wonderful time period for war games) and has nice music. They did a great job with the historical setting and it has a complex recruitment/supply system that can take some time to master. There are a lot of things going for Hegemony Rome. It's also an exercise in futility and frustration.The logistics/supply system isn't well explained at all beyond how to link a city forward. There's no explanation of why this is important, how to do it well, how to link cities together and so forth. Building and promotions haven't been explained at all and I have no idea what they are. Needless to say, there's a learning curve with scant few resources from which to learn.I can get by that. I can't get by some of the gameplay. For instance, the second scenario requires you to take on 18 enemy units from Germany. There's no way my units can do this - they fold instantly and the TBS mechanics are awful so it's just a massive mob. Unlike the Total War games, this is just mob warfare. The real issue is trying to keep even half that many units in supply while raiders continually raid from areas of the map I'm not allowed to enter (and no, you can't station a unit at the entry point because there's no supply there), I've had one city mysteriously taken over by bandits TWICE with 2 of my units in the city and never any pop up that told me I was even being attacked.Those are all fundamental gameplay issues that have no business being in a final product. In one scenario we get balance issues, gameplay issues, UI issues...all rolled into one mess. Trying to untangle some of this might be possible but there's not even a manual. So about those concepts that aren't explained? You're screwed. That's not even mentioning the three crashes I encountered playing this battle.Come on, devs. You could have had a good product here. But you've got to do the polishing that's required. That means polishing the balance, providing the documentation needed by the player and fixing the bugs (rather than releasing new DLC).			"

												first of all let me thank longbow games for doing such an awsome job in my opinion. i have played hemegony greece over 3k hours and although theres things that could have made for better game playing overall i thoughrly enjoyed the game and history of that was brought into the play. hemogony rome , i was excited when rob told me that they were working on this game two years befor it came out, and i kept up with it on the forum (longbows forum) when it first came out it was open beta and it was rough but now its still in beta and this game people is a must have the game play is smooth now most bugs are fixed with the exception of a few ive found the graphics, hey! kudos to there graphic team wicked crazy graphics i love them longbow and company have done a very excellent job on this game, in my opinion, but the game still plays like the old hemogony greece, where other civs just attack your resources and thats one of the things i really didnt like about the game. i believe if longbow could make it where the other civs attack citys it would be alot more chalenging which for me is what i would prefer as i play on expert already. if longbow games would likesome ideas on how to do this take a look a civilization V another one of my favorite games that i play on expert as well . but if you like these type games as much as i do then i definitly recomend this game for everyone. thanks longbow games , and i hope everyone enjoys it as i do			"

But the base of the game is setting up supply routes and the battles are laggy and not immersive at all.. The game is extrmely confusing you have to build stuff and add new trade routes but thre is no build button that would let you build it and your armies are very sucky in the beginning and u have around 100 while the enemy has 200 some and keeps coming overall i'd wait for this to go on sale for 5 bucks or not buy it ever.

												I highly recommend this game. It's not as easy as it looks, but I'm sure I'll figure out why some towns randomly generate food and others don't. It's definitely pretty buggy, loads of crashes, but it did recently come out of early release. The launcher itself doesn't always work, so you may have to launch using the Launch32 file in the Steam files.Anyway back to the game. It's an amazing strategical game, and can prove a challenge for strategy veterans too. It's all about logistics and empire management, definitely something to keep you going for hours.. if it doesn't crash. Note: Do NOT Alt+Tab or manually save the game. This can cause crashes. When starting up, change the game to autosave every 5 minutes.			"

												Ok, I had this game since the early access, I played a bit from time to time. I bought the game based on the amazing gameplay and design of the previous game Hegemony: Gold. Hegemony: Rome however, since the release had many issues, including performance, pathfinding, formation and GUI. I did not like to review it in negative way until I see what the developers can do about those issue, and as today I can say it can be consider as a very good strategy game just like Hegemony: Gold. The basic design of Hegemony series is very creative and original, and for me it is the best historic RTS you can find on steam currently, it has the best supply system, seamless zoom and siege mechanism. For Hegemony: Rome specifically they added many great feature to the basic design of the Hegemony series, but did not change the basic formula extensively, for example the building and the upgrading of your city/ fort, the camps, and the bridges, plus the DLC of mercenary and ambush system. The only problem remains with Rome currently is the formation control, as it is not as good as the previous game yet, another issue is the terrains are very small, so big open field battles rarely happen.I would like to add that Longbow games are currently developing a new Hegemony game, taking into consideration the above issues. If you are new to Hegemony games, please download the DEMO of the Hegemony: Gold first, if you like it get this one. I totally recommend this game for any historic strategy games' fan.			"

								First of all, I understand the game is in-development. I am listing just a few things that I think are essential to playability.The interface in-game to me, isn't as good as it could be. The screen quickly becomes cluttered. There are too many scroll-activated menus in my opinion. Some of the UI is very smart, such as the town UI. I think repositionable windows such as a full-fledged units window, where you could select legions individualy and have the camera redirected to them, would fix lots of clutter and improve the flow of gameplay.For the time being, I'm going to wait for more updates, until the game becomes more playable. I think this game may be the solution to the currently dissapointing RTS games on the market today. "

												I would recommend, for newcomers and more seasoned RTS players. A fully zoomable map, historical units and .. adequate tactical gameplay make this an enjoyable title. I say adequate because the tactical stuff is really more point and click. You do have tactics but not Total War like. More like ""Watch Roman swing sword, watch Gaul swing sword, watch Gaul fall down"". Maybe I just have a crappy graphics card and i DO have it on low settings. Either way, the game is fun. There is supply and money management involved in this, so if you don't like the micro, maybe look at another title. Anyway, as a total war player for awhile now, I can say I liked it.			"

												My issue is not with the game itself but instead with the lack of support.I have seen many forums about receiving a copy of the game in a foreign language. Most of the people are stuck with a Russian only version. I however am stuck with a Korean version for some reason. I have watched the Dev’s release youtube video on how to change the language but it the option is simply not available, even after updated and restarted as suggested. The response thus far is “sorry if you got it from a 3rd party. We can’t help you”I purchased my copy from Steam.There seems to be no help from either the seller or development team on this infrequent but crippling issue.On top of that, the opening screen lags which is insane since my machine can easily handle Skyrim.I can’t imagine how bad it would be in game. Anyway, for those that can play, I hear it’s a good game. -=P "

												This is an OK game, if you've got $30 to spare. I can't recomend this game as it's basicly Rome Total War as only an RTS. Some of the machanics are good, some bad. Overall, the game is pretty simplistic (though not easy). It's just not emersive at all. I don't feel like Rome has much to do with this game. There's not enough unique units to feel like you're playing as Rome. All in all, if this is what your're interested in, just pick Rome 2: Total War. It's a much more imersive and comprehinsive game, now that's been patched to death.			"

Wanted to like this game after watching it for ages but very tierd of this title very quickly. Really wanted this to be the true path of what rome total war 2 could have been but its even worse.

												Although I was interested in this game from the start of its early stages, I found the end product to be a letdown. It’s a slightly upgraded version of 2003's Praetorian's by Pyro Studios. It boasts to be a refreshing change....with ""immersive history."" What you are get instead is:- Voice acting text boxes of dialog between generals) vaguely discussing the plot and movements.- 9 cookie cutter/inaccurate combat units, and 3 ""siege"" units, my favorite are ballista's and siege towers. Ballista's are built with siege equipment, but cannot be fired at cities, and siege towers which hold no troops, nor do any units graphically interact with them (they just sit there and give a bonus).- Graphically boring CIV IV environment-A storyline on rails with no chance of deviation or free will- Ridiculously boring, stupid, and predicable AI. An example of this is the games spawning of barbarians from inaccessible points on the map with almost stop-watch regularity....even though you have built a watchtower/camp defended with archers at their travel path that slaughter them instantly. The AI never stops, but you can’t NOT build it...because the barbarians will harass you supply lines. So it’s just a pointless stalemate.I could continue...but there is no point. There is a reason the trailer just has good music and ""cool"" roman monologue...because that’s the intro to the game...and it’s all downhill from there. "

The difference has immediately made feel itself during gameplay. Even if this is a good game under many aspects  like supply routes and real time elements, on the other side it's too limited under other like management of the battles, management of troops and city management.

Gather wood/gold/food, capture areas, and create a rather limited type of army types. (Very limited at that, approx 4 types of units per nation).I stopped playing this game once I found out that I coujld only make 4 types of units, and needed to conquer 95 percent of the map still.

												I bought this game when it was on sale for under ten dollars. I'm happy I didn't pay the asking price it wanted $32.99 and happy I waited. I'm starting too find a lot of indie games just don't measure up to what they say they show gamers. Hegemony is really boring and very linear game play. Its just click and attack and the side effect of having no food or wood after having twenty cities just do a cheat and your good too go. The campaign is deceiving when you want to play as Caesar too conquer your neighbours beside you and you will run out of food and resources. What's strange is you may have two hundred of each resource but building implementation goes on a hold.You can run threw the campaign as Caesar and ignore everything else around you to end game. There is no balance when trying to feed an army that only starves in a blink of an eye.			"

Early Access Review
								Has a lot of potential but there are a few things which make this a very clunky game at the moment.Firstly the dialog box is too big, as well as that information panel which pops up when you highlight something.  For a 32inch 1080p monitor I kind of expect a little more leg-room buts its all taken up with these boxes.Secondly the mouse scrolling is not very friendly.  I'm used to games with a static scroll rate, and find myself pushing my cursor way past the sides, which the game interprets as 'I want to scroll FASTER!!!'  Pretty annoying.A wider field of view would be helpful.Needs some extra work on the AI.  One of my legion units split up somehow and one side got attacked which made them all rally, even though they were a good distance apart.Also finding my attack/move orders are often denied because of inaccessible terrain.  Like if I click on a cliff face the units will deny my order.  Would be better if they went to the closest point possible instead of just rejecting the order.I'm going to say no to recommending this game, only because its just not ready, no-where near ready (and the developers told me to be critical).  Buy it if you like the genre but expect some frustration.			"

								I know it's in the early stages of the game, but i find every other time i try to load a save it takes me back to desktop and the game closes, or i can be playing the game quite happily, tab out then tab back in and it closes the game completely so i'm at the stage were i'm giving up for now, it needs more work doing to it			"

												I like this game a lot but it's become very repetitive. And once the Legios level up they are unstoppable so there's no challenge. I think this game would be better with a paper-scissors-rock units because I ignore all units but Legio. And maybe being able to build Legio in any city but they are really expensive. Because now I just use the other cities to feed units to the Legio cities. If I couldn't do that, the unit rebuild rate is so slow that the game wouldn't be fun. Could use some more tactical skill because right now it's just wait to replenish the units then crush any size city in front of me. Should be easier and necessary to starve a city.			"

												I've got a good idea for this game, you guys can make us stage Patrols that are controlled by the AI and follow the route we give it, I truly need this because I hit a tough spot in All Gual...(Hehehhehe I got into trouble from 3 differant areas and 2 differant factions, I only have 4 legions and very limited money, I need the patroling thing in order to pass that area without falling on my knees!)Game is very detailed, the animations still need some work, it's very lovely. Very much detail I'd say it's slightly better than Rome Total War II, still though. The animations man! The animations...			"

												Hegemony: Wars of Ancient Greece was a very nice game in the sense that it was bringing a lot of new ideas to the concept of RTS. Hegemony Rome is not that innovative. It is still a very good game but it is only a small incremental improvement to the first Hegemony (very small compared to how long we've waited for this new version). Plus a brand new campaign, and this point is not negligible since the campaigns are really one of the strong points of the Hegemony series, but this could also have been done under the form of a DLC. Longbow is a small company which seems to fight hard to survive and meet their deadlines, so they cannot always realise their promises and their dreams, they do however deserve some support.			"

												Bought all 3 Hegemony games. This would be the weakest of the 3, but still very enjoyable. It lacked the intensity of the naval combat from the original Hegemony Gold. That's the problem with continental Europe I guess. They didn't quite seem to work out how to fill that strategy gap. The map also felt a little restrictive in respect to trying to get your army to flank the enemy. Everything always felt like a head on car crash. I'm being picky as Hegemony Gold, the predecessor, was such an immense game.  The Ancients, the game after this, Is also really good. I would recommend buying this middle title as you'll get value for money from the amount of hours you'll put into it. After this amount of time, or if you wait for the steam sale, you'll get it real cheap.  "
