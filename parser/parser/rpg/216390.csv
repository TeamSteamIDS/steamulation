												Fallen Enchantress has been abandoned by the developers in favor of the standalone Legendary Heroes, a game which is a carbon copy of FE with the addition of some hero units, fixes, and some superfluous content. Instead of patching LE, Stardock decided to ditch it entirely in favor of grabbing even more money from its naive customers. Stardock may have tried to create some goodwill by offering FE owners a discount on the latest version of their infamously buggy IP, but the fact of the matter is that Fallen Enchantress is still a broken, abandoned mess that never got patched or updated to an acceptable level.I should probably mention that Fallen Enchantress is itself an ""improved"" paid update of another broken game, Elemental.Instead of being a sucker and supporting such horrible development habits, save your money and wait a few months for Age of Wonders III.

												As mentioned in other comments Fallen Enchantress has been abandoned by its developers Stardock and they created another standalone that is nothing more than a modded version of Fallen Enchantress. But this isn't the worst part. Fallen Enchantress is just a modded version of Elemental War of Magic the first game that they also abandoned to create another full game to pull full price out of there costomers for nothing more than what should be a DLC. This isn't the only game Stardock has done this with.  Every game they make that gets sequal are nothing more than the previous game with new features. lets take Sins of a solar empire for example, They actually made expansion Deplomacy and Entrenchment but 4 years later in 2012 they release Sins of a solar empire Rebellion and its nothing more than sins of a solar empire with the expansion plus a new one. It should have been nothing more than an expansion especially since most of the new fearture including the game and the DLC for it were created by the community on there mod page. Taking player made content adding it to there old game and calling it a new one is Pretty low but that is the way of Stardock. Customers be warned!			"

												First, I'd like to have a ""neutral"" rating - this game is too good, for all the things it does well, to have a negative rec. But it has two serious conceptual flaws, in my opinion, that I want to bring to light.First and most important, all the details you can keep an eye on make it slow like heck. If you play carefully, making sure that no unit is slacking, not rushing combat etc., there will be hours until you see who you're exactly opposed to. Even then, you're probably far from making anything but the most basic, generic units, available to anyone. Secondly, since it is all about (very) long term planning, you'll probably do well to start gathering all kinds of resources early on. However there's quite a lot of different resources, so it will take a lot of work to capture all the mines, farms, lairs, and that includes ones that you have no idea if they will ever see any use. In short - if you can't commit serious time to this game, there's just no sense trying it.			"

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE: (MUST READ)IT IS NOT A BAD GAME HOWEVER...Elemental: Fallen Enchantress has been technically abandoned by Stardock in favor of it's stand-alone expansion Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes. Said expansion contains the original game along with it's own added features and so as it stands, there is little to no reason to buy the base version of this game.If you're interested, take a look at the more positively reviewed Stand-alone expansion: “Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes”INTRODUCTION:Fallen Enchantress is a 4X turn-based strategy game that incorporates RPG elements into it's mechanic and a 'tactical map' combat mode best featured by the Heroes of Might and Magic series of games. This game was developed by Stardock whose notable works include Sins of a Solar Empire, Elemental: War of Magic and the Galactic Civilizations series.The players can choose to play one of the several factions or make their own where they then embark on a quest to conquer or rebuild the broken land. The game allows the player to create their own factions, hero / sovereign and troops which can be done by assigning armor sets, skills and abilities to each of them. It features an RPG element where the players can upgrade their hero's skills and equipment to improve their effectiveness in battle.PROS:+ Good special effects (I wish I can say the same for the models and art style though; See Cons)+ Ability to create your own unique Units / Troops+ Ability to equip, level up and even hire new heroes on the map+ Relatively large maps that rewards exploration with...+ Side quests, hero quests, powerful items and random encounters+ A lot of monsters to fight aside from the enemy factions+ Interesting new concept to the 4X genreCONS:- Very dated graphics and poor character models- Unimpressive attempt at cell-shaded textures- Balance issues- Performance issues (Players may encounter poor frame rates and crashes)- AI for the enemy factions is brain dead (It makes bad decisions and doesn't fully utilize the game's unit / troop creation mechanic)- Almost no replay value (Which came as a surprise because 4X games normally don't suffer from this problem)- Not a lot of item variation for its RPG elementsCONCLUSION:GOOD CONCEPT but POOR EXECUTION, the fact that this title has been technically dropped in favor of it's Stand-alone expansion means that I CANNOT RECOMMEND this game. I would have easily recommended this game when it first came out, but as it stands, there is no point in purchasing this title when you can just get it's stand-alone expansion for the same price.It was a good and promising new concept for the 4X genre. To be fair, I really did legitimately enjoy my first playthrough. Exploring the world, meeting the npc heroes, fighting bigger and nastier monsters, doing quests, customizing my own army and empire with my own designs and specifications were really the selling point for me. Despite all it's PROS however the fact that it's fun factor can last for only one campaign / playthrough is an unforgivable sin to be committed by a game in the 4X genre.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												This game tries so hard to be a cross of Civilization and Age of Wonders, and it utterly fails at its goal. The original Elemental was terrible, and Stardock actually recognized that. Their solution? Instead of fixing their ♥♥♥♥ for free, given that it was a liability that they created, they decided to try to sell the fixes for their problems as a 'standalone expansion', Fallen Enchantress.I usually find some worth in Age of Wonders-style games like this, but even now, so far after release, Fallen Enchantress is not complete. Age of Wonders, a fifteen year old game, had terrain modifiers in combat. Fallen Enchantress? Nope. Or even if it does, you can't tell - the UI doesn't make that information easily visible to you. It's sad to say, but Age of Wonders read the strategic map better when initializing combat - the field of battle was modeled after the hexes you and your opponents were on in the world map, and so terrain mattered as a result.In comparison? I tried restarting similar battle scenarios in FE several times. Instead of recognizing that the enemy would be attacking from across a river - a river that, in the world map, impedes your movement if you try to cross it - you get a pond. Over and over again. The game simply doesn't understand the strategic significance of a river.A pond, people. One that you can go around with ease. What's the point of setting your troops up by a river or on a hill if the game won't recognize the inherent advantages of doing such? Even worse, there's no terrain modifier from defending from a walled city. Instead, you just get a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ archers when you defend a city. It's not an adequate replacement for four walls and a gate at all. Your city archers can and will get wrecked.Oh, and Age of Wonders? It allowed you to have walls and gates when defending a city. You wanna garrison the town you're protecting and stick out a siege? No problem!Not to mention, the spells in this game are in every way less developed than they were in Age of Wonders. Christ on a stick, Stardock, were you TRYING to take features away?Don't buy this game. Stardock is trying so hard to make good games, but they're just refusing to admit when they need to change their guard. Whatever ♥♥♥♥♥♥ managers worked on Elemental must have worked on Fallen Enchantress too, because it's still terrible at what it's trying to accomplish.			"

												This is a great game for anyone who loves the whole nation building turn-based type of games such as the Civ series. However the touch I like is that you can make your own custom units and use them in your army of conquest. You can also recieve missions and oppitunities to gain powerful items for your heroes to use. The heroes are immortal, often being brought back to life at a nearby city, but all but your monarch gain a injury which impedes them and cannot be removed. They also need to rest for so many seasons before they are fit for duty.			"

The downside is that this version of the game is rather buggy and has alot of issues.  I havent had these issues with Legendary heroes though.  Also while on that note.  For the minor upgrade that Legandary Heroes is, it really doesn't justify it's price.  This game is just as fun if not moreso for a fraction of the price.  Just save often in case bugs occur.			"

												This game has an outstanding design. you can design race, hero and units and tailor a strategy around your own specificities.the graphics are subpar but they are not the selling point of the title.The execution however is not even worthy of a beta. mutiple freezes and crashes, unstable loadings, backstories that won't save, inneficient coloring, etc... the list is too long for a mere review. no matter how frustrating it is the game is still playable (thanks to it's auto-save feature and as long as you have enough time to endure the very long and numerous reload of the same session after each crash) and it's subtle design hints of what a great game it could have been if it had been finished. however it's not even an alpha and paying even one cent for such a crap is certainly what one could call a rip-off.I might add that selling a DLC for something that does not even exist in the first place is lifting the concept of shamelessness to new heights.

												It's hard to know where to start with this... If i had to pick just one game that i wished i hadn't bought, it would be this one! Firstly there is the extremely annoying need to create a Stardock account, which gives the impression that this company is more than a little delusional about their status in the realms of PC game devs. Stardock are certainly NOT one of the big names in the business and if you are in any doubt about this, just look at how basic and extremely low grade the whole business of setting up this necessary account looks and runs.So once that hurdle is over and done with, you finally get to the game. Almost immediately you are then overcome by the huge sense of ""WTF am i supposed to be doing??"" The tutorial teaches you virtually nothing, so not only does this leave you with HAVING to click on each and every icon to see what it does, but also having to pretty much click all over the screen as you realise that not everything that looks clickable is, and not everything that looks like mere background decoration is. This game is a messy travesty that looks and plays like a Beta version. It is a title that badly needs a tutorial that covers what you need to actually play the game. In it's current state it is almost showing contempt towards those who ARE trying to play it. Horrible!!			"

												A mixture of 4x turn-based strategy like ""Civilization"" with the RPG elements, namely, a heroes, who you can level with thousands of perks and items. Yeah, fantasy world as background, which gives us a strong urge to compare this game with the ""Heroes of Might and Magic"" or ""King's Bounty"". Well, in spirit it is much closer to the ""Spellforce"" series, but, yeah, in turn-based way.Overall, not a bad game to spend some time... A pleasure for eyes and mind, if you have a thing for turn-based strategies. Yet it is a waste of time and money, just because there exists a much more featured version of the same game, Fallen Enchantress Legendary Heroes. There you'll find achievements, steam cards, even some multiplayer challenge. Basically, the story is just the same as with Mount'n' Blade game, and its inheritor - Warband. You don't need to buy the first, because you'll see all the same stuff, but more and of better quality.So, I'll set my mark as 7.25/10, and thumb it down only because the game was turned down by the devs, in favor of standalone add-on ""Legendary Heroes"", which gets all following updates.

												Game has much potential, but it honestly feels empty.  Basically, you start with a champion then have to set-up a town somewhere close-by or not on the map.  Then  you need to build within this said town.  Your hero, that you can create and/or pick from a pre-made list will be running around fighting random monster packs and completing quests.  Now, this sounds like a lot to do but I find myself clicking the ""turn"" button most of the time, waiting for in my build que to complete like a building or unit.  These things take a VERY long time to do, although, they make it so you can auto end turn when there is nothing left to do, but sometimes can be annoying.  In general, if they added something or a few things to make this more, interesting?  Then I could give this a thumbs up, but as I said, it has potential but still feels beta-ish			"

												Bought this game on a whim and was really suprised how much fun it was.  Basically its a combination of civilization and an RPG as weird as that sounds.  Combat takes place in a top down grid and is turn based kind of like a final fantasy or any other JRPG.    On the world map you go around finding monsters to fight (or other people if you are at war) and you get xp and items.  You also use pioneers to found new cities to add to your production.  What is really cool though is the customization. You can make custom units, heroes, factions and maps.  This really adds to the games replayability and you can even do stuff like handicap your race to make the game more challenging.  The one big thing missing of course is multiplayer, but it is a really fun game and i'd recommend it to fans of civilization and rpg games (also wait for a sale to get it cheap if you can and you can get 50% off the expansion).

												How hard I would like to recommend this game, I can't. It's broken. It's bugged. It crashes. It takes a long time to get the hang off it and once you manage to linger close behind the opposition and even manage to almost bring one down, I expected to receive a message a kingdom has fallen. All I get everytime is a ""Fallen Enchantress has stopped working"". I got fed up with reloading, battling, not battling but they fell anyway by one of the others and then being thrown out of the game. Having got this far, I am so reluctant to start a new game with the possibility to crash again and again while waisting 15 hours to get anywhere, I finallly pressed the uninstall button. I suspect they put all their effort in the Legendary Heroes sequel and disregard their predecessors (Elemental and this one) for updates. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game with plenty of depth and the AI ain't bad either and it could be so much more. But as far as I am concerned, this is a broken and unattended game that shouldn't be on sale. Try buying their Legendary Heroes instead.			"

												So, the beginning of each game is fun - the world setup is relatively straight-forward and easily accomplished with default selections.  I decide on ""Easy"" difficulty to gently get myself into the game and enjoy a relatively relaxed time.  Then the game begins and I feel that old thrill of exploration that the Civilization series was SO good at stimulating.  I take a hero out with some armies in his group to explore, do questing, and find new civilizations.  My cities start to expand with pioneers and civic buildings.  I start to stockpile some armies in cities for defense.  I start to research many cool ideas in 3 different branches.And then it comes to a screeching halt.  My heroes can't find quests that they can do without getting wrecked.  There's no more room to expand and enemy cities are too tough to take on with the people I actually do have.So, I try to build up armies to take them on - and then I discover the Imperium!  A walled in ancient ruins that is ripe for exploration and conquering.  It takes me a long time of grinding units that die and get replaced to only die again.  Finally, I conquer all of the enemy in these ruins and decide to settle in there to complete the quest - and there's no place to put a city!  Turns out that if there's influence going into the Imperium (from a city or outpost, friend or enemy), there's no way to settle the Imperium and complete the quest.  So all of those resources, the mines, etc. that are available in the hard-fought territory of the Imperium?  COMPLETELY WASTED.It's around this point that all of the other AI are fed up with laughing at my terrible flailing and useless efforts and declare war.  So, they've been stockpiling armies and enhancements - and they've evidently had no problem with the harder quests out there and are outfitted far better than me.  They proceed to send stacks of 6 armies at each of my sad little cities and proceed to burn everything to the ground.And I proceed to uninstall the game and move on with my catalog of games.  Maybe Civilization....			"

												I wanted to keep this review simple, but the ""stand alone expansion"" made me feel like I had to update this.The game plays almost exactly like a fine-tuned Master of Magic. An ancient global strategy game for the DOS / Win95 era. Or if you prefer, Civilization with a magic twist. Unlike Master of Magic, and the older Civilization games, the level of customization in Fallen Enchantress is astounding. Individual units can be customized with both gear and abilities. Rulers can be customized similarly, and even factions are customizable. That said, there are a number of issues with this game. First, there's no multiplayer. Second, there's no map editor; non-campaign maps are always randomly generated. The AI doesn't deal with come units well (archers). Finally, the game gets some slowdown as the world fills up with cities and units.Pros:An updated global strategy game set in a fantasy era.Staggering amount of (optional) customization.Cons:No multiplayer.Random map generation.There is a power discrepancy for specific units (like archers), that may make the game too easy/difficult.Game suffers from slowdown as teh world becomes mroe heavily populated.It's still quite an amzing game in my opinion.EDIT:Alright, steam put Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes on sale. Primary reason I didn't pick it up earlier is because I felt the original was fine (it felt like a complete product). Anyway, here's some differences between FE and FE:LH:FE hero units are found scattered about the map and available to hire to the first faction appropriate ruler to pay them. FE:LH uses a fame system where you will be given a choice between two heroes when your fame reaches certain values.FE hero units get to choose from 3 abilities that are drawn from a relatively random pool. FE:LH has full skill trees, allowing you to pick up what you want (although the more powerful skills aren't available immedietely).Melee units in FE:LH feel like they have been buffed to be more useful; and the AI seems to better understand how to deal with archers.FE:LH also seems to have a larger pool of events and quests through paid DLC.To sum it up:FE:Legendary Heroes has a little more content and a little more polish than Fallen Enchantress, though Fallen Enchantress is still an excellent game.If you already own one, there's not much reason to buy the other. If I had to pick between the two, I would pick FE:Legendary Heroes, but only if the price gap was relatively small.			"

												At first blush, Fallen Enchantress is a fairly traditional 4X game set in a high fantasy gameworld.  And it certainly is something of a 4X game, but it's more of Civ meets the classical Heroes of Might and Magic than a pure 4X.  It offers a dynamic of champion leveling and equipment mechanics very reminiscent of a roleplaying game.  The game gels really well in that regard.Most of the gameplay mechanics are fairly familiar to fans of the 4X genre, including three different tech trees (for civilization, military, and magic upgrades), the standard progression and upgrading of buildings, and a familiar interface for the governance of your realm.  It does offer a level of customisation which is a little different, however, in the cities.  Each city building upgrade takes up a 'square' near the city, and certain specific buldings must be built on certain tiles.  The latter is familiar, but the former is a bit different to the Civilization series which popularised the 4X genre.  Most of the time, you can rely on the game's automatic placement of these buildings to be sensible, however if you want to micromanage, there is a setting that allows you to place them manually.  I feel this is a fairly strong addition actually, as it was gratifying to see the city expand and grow in a very visible manner.  It gives larger cities an appreciable sense of grandeur - and it also makes it easier to tell how your opponent is doing and what they're building.  Scouting is much more effective in the game as a result, then it would be otherwise.The champions and army combat is where the comparison to Heroes of Might and Magic comes in.  While you can just assemble normal armies without a champion like a normal 4X, armies can also be led by champions you can find on the world map and hire.  There are also quests you can find and complete on the world map, much like HoMM.  These champions can be equipped with special items you find, and also can buy items from cities.  These champions can be a definitive edge in the tactical combat, which again acts a lot like classical HoMM, though it has a fair bit more depth in the available spells, items, and the ability to create your unit types.  The influence is obvious, but the implementations of these elements works quite well in the context of the game and is executed well.The game allows a great deal of customisation, both in your initial hero (which acts as your sovereign), and in the ability to design individual units from the ground up.  You can customise the name, gender, equipment, and special abilities of the units available to you, and the game places no restrictions other than the traditional RPG fare of encumbrance, and of course having the available technology researched.Quests in the game piece together into a small overarching story for each map.  While the game is obviously not huge on the narrative, the quests offer a reasonable way to implement the narrative of the game into the game flow without interrupting the player constant.  It works pretty well, actually, though the game could use a stronger emphasis on it in my opinion.The AI varies in difficulty depending on settings, but the default AI offers a challenge without being overly so.  They do have a few quirks, including the occasional absolute violent streaks a.la. the memetic Gandhi from Civilization.  I might complain if it wasn't something of a genre staple, but all in all I felt challenged without being overwhelmed at the default settings, and the game offers a lot of ways to increase the challenge if you find that too easy.Visually, the game reminds me a lot of the original Spellforce in terms of the sort of 3D/2D sort of mesh you got there, although a lot more is modeled in Fallen Enchantress than is in Spellforce.  The aesthetic is aged, but well-crafted and it generally works alright if you can see past the low polycount of some of the army models (seeing as the game has to render a lot of them, the polycount was kept low.)  It looks and feels fairly good for a fantasy game, with enough of it's own touches to keep it from being simply generic.If there was one complaint I had in the theming of the game it's that the soundtrack and sound design is the one part of the game that is pretty generic, feeling almost a little uninspired in that regard.  Nothing terrible, just not particularly inspired and no real flair to it.All in all, a classic 4X/RPG hybrid well worth your money, if you can see past its flaws.Published: http://highlandarrow.com/index.php/reviews/35-nostalgia-train-fallen-enchantress "

												I forgot how terrible this game is. The opponent has unlimited units and money, PERIOD. They always come in the first 10 rounds with at least 5 units per army and there are usually 2 - 3 per civilization. If they found a city they instantly have another unit that can make a city and at minimum 2 units in the city!! Even though the army only had a settler and a combat unit!!  this game is the opitomy of s@#%			"

												This game deserves a lot higher score and rating than it has gotten. It is a must buy if you are into strategy and have patience to build and explore. I love the graphics, the gameplay, the factions, everything that this game has to offer. With very few and mostly minor glitches or bugs as my only complaint, it realy doesnt take any fun away from the game as some people have stated in their reviews of this game and it does not happen very often. I will state that this game is also very chalenging and that the difficulty is harder than you think. Do the tutorial, watch the videos, and choose the lowest difficulty at first, just to get an idea of the game before you plunge into a harger game.			"

												I gave this a good enough go (69 hours) that I believe I have a right to say it is not a good game. Everything about it feels derivative. The lore is childish. The implementation is weak: it is very difficult to control the combining and splitting of armies and units keep on taking the wrong route round or through a city or obstacle so that they lose the enemy they are chasing or get caught if it's the enemy chasing them.But worst of all, by far, is the story mode. The writing, as well as the story itself, is so atrociously feeble I can't believe they seriously thought it enhanced the package.There are much much better fantasy civs out there, such as Endless Legend. (I don't say it's the best but it's the one I tried most recently and it is incomparably better than this sorry effort).			"

I'll never know, which gives me the ability to review this version in it's own right. It's a fun game with lots of depth.  It's easy to get lost in the details, which is what I dig about 4x. There are bugs, but I encountered nothing game-breaking in my first  55 hour game.So if you're poor (like me), or you have a crappy PC (like me), you might be glad that this version is still available on Steam.

												When Warlock meets Civilization, baby born is called Fallen enchanteress. To all who want to play modern Master of Magic game kind, this game rules.Tutorial is integrated in-game as video. You choose avatar or create one new as your wishes, you build cities, you build armies, recruit Champions, to explore & conquer world. Avatar & Champions are like Heroes with strong skills, spells & abilities.All can be random & you can create your own maps, battle maps, spells... with workshop integradted in-game.Like Heroes of Might & Magic, fights are turn to turn based & need strategic management to win. A lot of quests to do give you many rewards.Cities management are close from Civilization except all buildings appear on map. Research tree is Civilization-like too. Zoom levels are strong.This game is only solo but it works nice. You can buy it safely.			"

												I bought this, the cheap version of FE.  I haven't played the 'standalone expansion'.  I like the game, and I think it's worth ten bucks.  Here's my take on some of the critical reviews and also my reasons for liking the game.The negative feedback seems to fall into four categories, listed here in order of popularity.  1) you can buy Legendary Heroes so why bother with this?  2) I'm mad at Stardock for re-releasing the revision as a standalone expansion.  3) it crashes a bunch and/or the Stardock login is a pain.   4) it plays weird. 1)  Sounds great.  Go right ahead. 2)  I am neutral.  I wasn't around when they did that.3)  I haven't had a single glitch occur.  It launches for me like any Steam game, no extra login or account needed.4)  Not sure what this refers to.  The game's style is a little old-fashioned.  It has more in common with the HoMM games than with Endless Legend, thematically.  It doesn't try to do innovative things with combat mechanics or character attributes.  What it does is try to be a complete and coherent fantasy 4x game with good RPG elements.  Enough of that.  My take on what is good about this game:  It provides a basic fantasy 4x experience, including mana nodes, city management, hero management, side-quests, magic items, cute but dangerous bears, and tactical turn-based battles.  It does this well, and some elements it does especially well.  Choices in city specializing are simpler yet more fun than some big, famous 4x games I could name.The graphics are nice.  They were outdated even when the game was first published.  But they're nice, slightly cartoony, done in good taste.  Best of all, the screens are not a jumble of colors and patterns that distract the player.   The UI is very responsive and doesn't overwhelm you with overdone, gaudy visuals.  You can make choices and process turns quickly in this game, even if your PC is outdated.This is a game to play if you like 4x, you like fantasy, and you're inclined to imagine a story behind the events and characters that you control.  It is old fashioned in that your personality as a player, and as expressed through your main character, remain yours.  Evil kings use death magic.  Good kings build apiaries to supply honey to the public.  No bizarre philosophical attitudes to deal with.  I care about stuff that's happening in the game.  I sit back and wonder if I should have my buddy the warrior start learning civic skills and become a city governor.  I'd have to replace him on the combat team but I sure would like a new governor.  Hmmm.  The game is good for exploration of its mechanics.  There's no reason to plow through a session at light speed.  Stop and smell the roses and...errr...the zombies.The intro scenario did get me frustrated.  The tutorial was fine, but there's this introductory game and it drove me bonkers with quests that I couldn't find the targets for.  Bad dog, very naughty.  No biscuit for you.The very best thing about Fallen Enchantress is it's the work of Derek Paxton, aka Kael, designer of the old Civ 4 Fall from Heaven mods.  If you enjoyed those, here's your chance to thank him with a ten-spot.  Or more than ten, if you buy the newer version I guess.  Long live King Kael, and may he write many more games for us  [raises tankard and drinks deeply].			"

												Game is plagued by crashes to desktop. While it is in fact fun to play the crashes interupt the gameplay to often especially considering the number of patches and versions of the game that are available. Stardock's quality has dropped greatly over the last few years. Avoid this game unless your willing to put up with re-launching the title every 20 mins or so. As for my system its perfectly stable 7-8 hours of Rome 2 Total War or Battlefield 3 etc. This is a game issue and one Stardock probably won't fix.			"

												If Warcraft 3 were a 4x, turn based strategy game, I think it would look a lot like this. I think I may be one of the few who actually prefer this game over the Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes standalone expansion, but, I don't like how Legendary Heroes' combat system works. However, Fallen Enchantress works great!  I'm completely addicted to this game and I haven't experienced a single bug. I do wish this had Steam achievements only because I've gotten used to getting them. A couple of things I've seen in other comments about this game are one: this game requires you to make a Stardock account. I don't understand why this is such a big deal; it only takes less than a minute and there's no waiting for Stardock to load before you play (unlike Ubisoft who is absolutely ridiculous). It's a one time deal that just registers the game with Stardock. And two: I've seen many people complain about bugs or the program crashing to the desktop. I haven't experienced any of these things. The worst thing that has happened was that the music stopped for a couple of minutes but then came back on. There hasn't been any other problems (and I don't really consider that a problem after playing some other games that I've purchased here). The only downsides, and these are minor to me, but I understand that it could be a deal breaker for others, is that there is no multiplayer at all. I usually enjoy single player only games, but this would be fun if I could occasionally connect with friends and play like Starcraft. Also, the graphics aren't the greatest, but they're not horrible either. This game does have a pretty steep learning curve but, once you've got that figured out, the game is incredible. As for replayability, you can custom create any map making every game feel like a brand new game. I highly recommend this game for people who enjoy turn based strategy games.			"

It was kind of like ""Hey we can make this better, screw it, start over, charge people again"". Some people defend this practice because they got FE:LH for free and they got FE for free too, all because they bought the abomination that was the original Elemental.			"

												It's a good game, fairly depth of gameplay and unit customization.However, this game has no epic cutscene, very little voice over and the last thing that really frustrated is the main scenario has only 3 stages.

												Pretty good 4x game; appears to be extremely complex at first glance, but a single playthrough will provide you with about 90% of what you need to play successfully (it's unlikely you will be scouring the internet for the complexity behind the math - it's simply not that kind of game.) There is more depth for those who want it (eg, customizing every unit you can create), but it isn't required to win. The AI seems a bit easy, but some of the monsters can be tough, if only for sheer health. My only real knock against the game is that I'm not a big fan of the graphics (not a deal-breaker for a 4x, but they could have been better.) The monsters look quite good, but the human(oid)s are pretty awful looking...it seems pretty much impossible to make a cool looking avatar. Your selection of faces tends towards either constipated or cow-eyed fool.In all, a worthy game, from the same people who created the superb Galactic Civilizations 2 (my pick for best 4x ever, and I have played a ton of them - only Alpha Centauri and Civ 4 come close.)(Oh, and just to clarify - I played this game almost exclusively with the downloaded version from Stardocks page, which you can get by using the key provided by Steam when you purchase it - I have more like 60 hours with the game as opposed to the few it shows on my profile.)

Every unit, i will repeat, EVERY UNIT can be completely customized down to their faces and eyes. The point of most of the matches is to go down the tech ladder to get more advanced weapons, and armor; even horses and wargs for your armies. Add to that the fact that the faction leaders are mostly heroes that you have created, and the deep, deep (sounding) lore the game has, and you will be playing it for years to come.			"

												I've played ""Elemental"" before and ""Fallen Enchantress"" both adds and removes things from it. Overall I liked the way it plays and I'm a huge fan of Turn-Based Strategy. The RPG elements in the game are well executed though perhaps lacking in the variety of equipment slightly...very slightly. My biggest complaint is that'd I'd like to see more options for each tier of weapons, but more importantly armor. Such as having leather, studded leather, hardened leather, and padded leather in the first tier all with their own strengths and weaknesses. Maybe have more specific conditions of equipment such as serrated, sharpened, dulled, rusty, master-crafted short sword instead of just ""short sword."" This is really just being nitpicky since I adore this game. I just love variety, and truly enjoy what this series does. I'd give it a 8.5/10.			"

For some reason, the in game account creation never worked, so I went to Stardock's site, and made on, then went to the game, signed in, and entered the prodcut key. However, this took me all of 5 minutes, and it was worth it in every sense. Imagine this game as a fantasy-styled Civilization. It may as well be called Sid Meijer's Fallen Enchantress. The graphics could use a bit of an update, but overall, the fun of the game comes not from conquering and establishing cities, but from completing various quests found on the board, and by making your own units and watching them pummel other units into oblivion.So, in short, if you like Civilization, quests, magic, and character customization, this is a must have.

												Surprisingly enjoyable 4x game. Waited a long time to get it and was put off by some of the negative reviews but i'm glad i got it now. I like the graphic style, it's got a good mix of strategy with RPG elements and being able to create your own units (giving them different traits, equipment etc) instead of churning out the usual generic soldiers is a nice touch. I've had none of the performance issues some people have mentioned, hasn't crashed at all. Good game.			"

												Just feels hollow and unfinished, like this is just an alpha. Then the developers have the audacity to up and abandon this game and make another one that as far as I can see - Is the exact same game with some UI changes and more than double the price. I don't reccomend this game. It's got some good concepts, but it just feels hollow and lifeless.			"

												It didn't take long for me to bore of this one. Seen it all before and other games do it better. Went right back to Warlock after about 30 minutes of this one cause Warlock does it much better. There is nothing in this game to keep one in it. All one can think is ""I would rather be playing Warlock or Civ 5 or Eador"" ...... and if those thoughts are running through your head .... the death toll sounds.			"

												Pretty good 4x game; appears to be extremely complex at first glance, but a single playthrough will provide you with about 90% of what you need to play successfully (it's unlikely you will be scouring the internet for the complexity behind the math - it's simply not that kind of game.) There is more depth for those who want it (eg, customizing every unit you can create), but it isn't required to win. The AI seems a bit easy, but some of the monsters can be tough, if only for sheer health. My only real knock against the game is that I'm not a big fan of the graphics (not a deal-breaker for a 4x, but they could have been better.) The monsters look quite good, but the human(oid)s are pretty awful looking...it seems pretty much impossible to make a cool looking avatar. Your selection of faces tends towards either constipated or cow-eyed fool.In all, a worthy game, from the same people who created the superb Galactic Civilizations 2 (my pick for best 4x ever, and I have played a ton of them - only Alpha Centauri and Civ 4 come close.)(Oh, and just to clarify - I played this game almost exclusively with the downloaded version from Stardocks page, which you can get by using the key provided by Steam when you purchase it - I have more like 60 hours with the game as opposed to the few it shows on my profile.)

In depth, good RPG mechanics, design your own troops exactly how you want them with equipment, magic items, perks, mounts etc.  Basic Turn based combat where units on the field act in inidividual initiative order is entertaining enough, but the campaign map is where it shines.

												Fallen Enchantress is a 4x reminiscent of old games like Warlords back in the early 90's. Like Civilization you have armies to build and defend your land with, cities to manage, factions to practive politics with, and technologies to learn. Unlike Civ this is a fantasy game and you have heroes to roam the land and do quests n whatnot with, spells to learn and use, battles to win, and loot to aquire.In the end I really like this game, but it has quirks.  For example the poor trading AI: I've traded the equivilent of some pottery tech for light proton cannon tech. It's either really dumb or just... bad. Whatever...One last point, you need more than 4gig of RAM for this game.  Sure, you can run it on 2, but if you have less than 8gig, then it will likely seem very buggy and glitchy.  It is a very graphically intensive game somehow.  I suppose you could point at clunky programing... whatever... just have 8gig minimum.			"

I'll probably get around to buying Legendary Heroes eventualy but I dont know how much point there is to buying it since I already like this one.   This game reminds me alot of Civilization with the city building and improving elements, but the combat is done on a seperate battle map and is turn based.  your leader will take part in battles personaly and so will any heroes you hire along the way to join you.  One thing that is great about the game is the random map generator will make the replay value very high as you get a different game every time you play.			"

												Is it Civilization V veiled in a fantasy theme? Yes. Is that a good idea? Absolutley.Fallen Enchantress has many, and I mean many, mechanics inspired by the Civ series and other resource management turn-based strategy games and still manages not to feel like a rip-off. While the game has numerous mechanics, they are all rather intuitive to anyone who has played this type of game before, which allows the developers to layer in a variety of additional elements without totally overwhelming new players. Some of the key differences here from Civ:You have a leader unit that can engage in combatCombat can be carried out manually in strategic turn based combat, or automatically (instantly) completed based on stats of the engaging armies, player's choice.Mana and strategic spells are included.Quests :DNow that I laid out the good, here is the bad. The characters from the lore seem kind of type-cast and fall into the stylistic vein of Magic: the Gathering (not necessarily bad, but certainly not new). I'm probably being an overcritical ♥♥♥♥ here, but everything about the lore seems like it has been beaten to death in other fantasy series, for instance the bad guys are all demonic slavers and witches, might be nice to mix it up a little. Also after playing for a rather long time, the path to victory, regardless of which victory you are aiming for, becomes a little too predictable and therefore easy. I think every Civ-like game deals with this problem to some extent, but it is not totally removed here. There can be some light buggy/jankiness with unit movement, but this happens forgivably rarely.Give it a shot!			"
