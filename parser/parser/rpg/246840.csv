												Oh man this game is an amazing classic! I loved playing this when I was a kid. This is the game which Torchlight is based off of and I was wondering why it didn't get any love from Steam. The Dungeon in this game is endless and it's procedurally generated. (if I remember correctly, it's been a long time.) It is defently worth the money. It does support 1920x1080 resolution. I suggest not tab alting while starting the game, it seems to not like it.			"

												Great ARPG.  I have found memories of playing this in 2005 and I purchased it again on steam.  It is the predecessor to Torchlight and Torchlight 2 and very similar.   I actually like the spell system better in this game.It had a problems on steam launch working on Win 7/8, but it has been fixed now and works perfectly.  You can play in 1920 x 1080 resolution too.Highly recommend this game.			"

												FATE is really good, particularly for a decade-old game. The graphics are simple, but cute and colorful. The music's cheerful. And the gameplay is a simple concept that really keeps you engaged. In my case, this definitely isn't nostalgia speaking, and I'm not looking at it through the rose-colored lenses of my childhood. I never played it, or any others in the series, until recently. And it's kind of impressive just how well this game has held up over time.The game's premise, borrowed liberally from the original Diablo, is a basic dungeon-crawler RPG. Each level of the dungeon is randomly generated and filled with items and monsters. Villagers in town will give you quests tied to specific levels, and you journey in and out of the dungeon as you complete your tasks. You can only take three quests at a time, and it's up to you whether you take the maximum on every level and explore every corridor, or rush through on your way to the final boss. As you complete quests and hack and slash your way through the dungeon's monsters, you gain experience, and leveling up allows you to increase your skills and stats in specific areas.  Looting dungeons gives you gold and items, and there are also several vendors in town who can sell you items, or perform various services. You can also earn money (and find rare items) by catching fish in the fishing holes found throughout the game.Got too much stuff to carry around in the dungeon? No problem. You'll have a pet, an un-killable companion that can also ferry your junk to town in exchange for gold. Your pet can also help fight enemies, but it will flee if its health gets too low and be no use in the fight. If the basic cat or dog isn't powerful enough, you can feed your pet fish in order to transform them into different monsters found in the game. If this sounds an awful lot like Torchlight, it's pretty evident that FATE was a huge influence on that game.There is a main story quest that is basically just a harder boss on some random level close to lvl 50. Since the levels are generated randomly, you could just keep playing by continuing down for thousands of levels. Even without the practically unending dungeon, randomly generated levels and a pretty big combination of skills and gear gives FATE almost infinite replayability. This is actually featured in the game well, since finishing the main quest allows you to create a ""descendant"" character. This new character can keep one ""heirloom"" item but begin his or her own adventure. It's especially cool that you can also import characters from FATE into the sequels as well, heirlooms and all.As an RPG, FATE is not terribly deep. But it is a lot of fun, and it's a great – if somewhat casual – way to blow off steam while crawling through maze-like dungeons and blasting or slashing your way through colorful mobs of creatures.

FATE, you were my childhood!FATE is a simply dungeon crawler - like Torchlight or Diablo - but less story (which isn't a problem). You have the task to create a character, choose your pet and go deeper and deeper into the dungeon.++ It is an old RPG, but better than some today!++ addictive++ can be played for hours and hours (explore different levels or just go fishing)++ you can go fishing!+ lots of little tasks, but everytime the same (kill that, find that, bring me that, etc.)+ loads of weapons, armor and spells!+ the monsters get bigger and stronger with every level/dungeon+ typical skilltree (strength, vitality, dexterity, magic)+ money is not really necessary+ easy achievements (except ""Fate Ensured"" - beat the endboss)Also FATE is not that perfect!- it's often the same...so I rushed the last 10 levels- play it on hard, the remaining is too easy- I don't like the sounds of the pets (they're too annoying)- the controls were a little bit tricky (in my opinion)- If you are fast, you are done with in 10 hours - but you can play further- Ok ok ok. This game is from 2005, so don't expect the next ""Crysis"".- the endboss is not everytime the same...it's a minus point, because I had a fckng bug - there are also dragons, but NO - it has to be a bug.You've reminded me of my childhood - FATE - and thanks for that.Buy it if you want to play an nice and old RPG!""Mr. Diablo? Mrs. Torchlight? Congratulation! It's a FATE!"": 8,5/10 "

												I love this game so much! Always used to play it until my XP died and I forgot my login on WildTangent, great to see it finally on Steam. Regardless of whether you guys have played Fate or not, get it. Probably the best dungeon crawler out there (in my opinion) :DEdit: I have seen many people saying that after around 3 hours, their game stops running for them. While I don't doubt that this is true, it has not happened for me and I've played nearly double that. I'm on Windows 7 Starter Edition (Came with my laptop). Hope this helped someone :)			"

												Modeled after the original Diablo, FATE managed to add its own unique spin to an already great foundation. FATE is the game that inspired Torchlight, and any fans will be able to see many similarities between the two. Despite being released in 2005, it still manages to hold its own against some of the newer games of its kind. I got it on sale for $1.99 and it was more than worth the purchase. Highly recommended to lovers of RPG dungeon crawlers.			"

												Isometric action-RPG dungeon crawler. A bridge between Diablo and Torchlight. Everything we have in the Torchlight we have because of this smooth project... And Fate itself is based mostly on the Diablo Hellfire best patterns.If you're familiar with the Torchlight (and I guess you are), then you'll know everything the Fate got from the first sight.Cartoon-styled graphics. Mild music, yet reminiscent to Matt Uelmen tracks. Very basic RPG elements but rich grinding system, making you constantly looking for more power-ups and new guns, which will be bigger and brighter... And many-many randomly generated levels (over 2 millions, and that's not a joke). Basically, you can keep playing in the Fate year by year and still be far from its depth (that's what Diablo 3 is only dreaming to be).Comparing FATE to all other ""Diablo killers"" and especially Diablo 3 itself may not be the best idea, though. While generally all those games, would that be the Diablo itself, Titan quest, Sacred (etc.) - have some story on the plate, you can't say same thing about FATE. It is so random in every point, that even the main quest is not stable, and will be procedurally generated and different for any player. You'll not get any background there but only the very basic: you have a town with some folks, half of them will be traders or item randomizers, while other half will be sending you on some irrelevant quests. And all the quests in the game will be like ""reach the level X and kill the monster Z"" or ""Bring me an item Y from level X"".Now, the main question: should you buy it? Yes.Point one: it is good for any dungeon crawler fan. Hardly FATE can take your heart now, with all new titles like Van Helsing or Bastion (or dozens of others), but still it provides a very solid gameplay. A lot of challenge awaits!Point two: even if you are not so deep in dungeon crawlers, but making numbers on Steam (would that be score of games in possession or achievement statistics, or both) - it is a good buy (especially with discount, of course). To make a gold on achievements, you'll probably need less than 5-6 hours.Finally, this game has very high valued cards, so you have a good chance to buy the game and even make some money back on top of it!Overall, it's not a hit or something you can't live without, but it's a very good pick. My mark 7.5/10			"

												It may not hold up to today's standards in terms of graphics or enemy/combat complexity, it can still hold it's own with only a tiny bit of nostagia.I first played Fate on my family's first family computer as it was included in the games folder at the time. When that computer finally died my siblings and I were really sad to see Fate go along with it.Finding this game again on Steam was like re-uniting with an old friend. Tears were shead. Many tears indeed.But now Fate doesn't work with Windows 10, so now it's like loosing a life long friend...Fate was the first video game I had ever played.Get it. And hope that it will be compatable with Windows 10 in the future.Edit: There is a fix, so that life long friend is still with us.Now only one question remains. Will YOU tempt Fate?			"

												This is a really cute little dungeon crawler. Although it is very very basic, it has a certain charm that gets you hooked straight away. You can only have three active quests at a time, which means you have to keep heading back to the main town to hand them in and collect new ones. This is a really good idea as it kind of forces some replayability on you by having to reclear some of the dungeon you have done before, but also enables you to clear your bags of loot you have collected. You can wrack up your gold very quickly which lets you pimp yourself out in some pretty epic gear by the end. I loved this game and will certainly keep it installed.			"

Plus, this would be my childhood game, and I was coming home from school, jumping into this very chair I am in right now, and playing this awesome game.Anyways, I really think it's worth the 5 bucks, 8 after the sale (Still worth it), so you should get it, jump into the dungeon, and defeat the godly monster.

												Fate has components that can be complex and some that are easily controlled. The graphics aren't entirely superb, but you have to remember that it is an older game. The quests are very simple minded- yet still you must be the appropriate level to complete them. I love having the pet. You watch them grow stronger throughout the game, just as you level they do too. Also, allowing to change them into other creatures really spices it up and adds a little variety to combat.I dislike the click to move aspect of the game because I very easily run into corners in the dungeon. Clicking and holding to attack is something that I have come to enjoy. I do not have to worry about pressing other buttons (unless you play part magician) and I also dont entirely have to aim. I played this game in my young childhood and never finished. Recently, I had been searching for it and I finally found it. Now, I also find that there is a second game to play! Yipee.			"

												Fate is a classic dungeon-crawler that was at one point almost the best RPG of the year (this opinion varies per big game-review company), the Combat is rather simple, all is easy to understand, but that doesn't stop a wild hoard of giant lava-worms from killing you.      This 'is' an early entry to the top-down dungeon-crawling RPG genre, so it can be pretty easy to come up with a strategy that makes you near invincible (still takes a bit of time to finish said strategy); the graphics are actually quite nice for 2005, and it supports Anti-Aliasing (probably like 2X MSAA at most, tho).I'd highly recommend this if: You're looking for a dungeon-crawler you can pick up and leave without feeling like you didn't make progress.

												Just as fun, and just as buggy, as the original. Great for nostalgia, and if it goes on good sale, worth picking up for a giggle. It's a mindless, perpetual randomly generating dungeon crawler. No storyline, no great mystery, just point and rapidly click mayhem.The UI can be counterintuitive, and fishing in town can net you legendary epics, even at level one. So be aware that this game dates from 2004-2005, and has serious game balance issues and a random loot engine that is much more random than most newer games.			"

												Let me start of by saying this was, and is, a great game. I discovered this game back in early 2007 and had fun on it, and I've spent nearly hundreds of hours playing this game as a kid, along side Runescape since it gave me its essence. Years later, I never forgot about this game and felt like playing it, again. I was excited to see it on Steam, and I decided to buy it.At the time, this game was fun and amazing. Today if you were to play it, it'd be meh if you played other later dungeon crawlers compared to this. This game doesn't have a set story, but you just go around doing quests for NPCs and you descend deeper into the dungeon. Once you beat the final boss, on the final dungeon, you can keep your current character or turn him into a hero and start the whole game over.			"

												A classic. I used to play it alot when I was a kind... It's a very well done dungeon crawler RPG, much like Diablo and Torchlight. It definetely shaped the future of this genre, games like Torchlight and Torchlight 2 havily taking inspiration from this game. It provides very good RPG elements and a never ending dungeon. It does not provide much story but that is not bad!I reccomend this game even if you played it before or not. It does not matter how old it is, it's still a fascinating game and a lot of fun to play.I was very happy and surprised yesterday when I saw it is availabile on Steam and I bough it immediately.I am playing it on Ubuntu through WINE and it works perfectly, if anyone is wondering. Just disable the Steam Overlay and don't try to Alt+Tab.PS: It supports modern screen resolutions and that is awesome for such an old game			"

												I've hit some difficult bosses (or maybe they were a gang of bosses).  The game lets you push right up to the edge of your comfort level and becomes interesting to manage.  Then if you die, Fate will let you respawn in 3 optional ways, which I usually pick the one with the least cost, and wind up several levels down and it's a big struggle to make it back to safety.This is a very casual game with infinite replay as all the dungeons are randomly generated.Also... FYI - this is an older game.  If you're looking for the latest, look at Torchlight.  I've played both, but being the cheapskate that I am, I figured the gameplay is identical between the two and I wasn't willing pay more than I had to for about the same experience.  YMMV - so choose wisely.Also most of my hours are from running a fishing script I wrote (which was a lot of fun to get it working successfully - and made some of the content more accessible for me without playing too much).

												I bought this game for fairly cheap with Undiscovered Realms for about 5 bucks.  Shortly after I got the email from steam telling me what I had just purchased.  I then make my way to my library and look at what I had played vast amounts on my old Windows XP Machine (named inexplicably Winda). I swiftly clicked install on both FATE and its expansion.  I quickly felt a breeze of nostalgia when the game finish installing and loaded up the menu screen.  Almost instantly the rudimentary character creation screen flashed upon the screen and reminded me of all my great characters, which were deleted when Winda died in a horrible HDD failure.  Slowly wiping away a small tear, I chose my pet and my head type.  It took a while to decide which difficulty level to start at.  Eventually, I chose the second hardest, Hero.  Eventually I made my mouse cursor over to the start button and the game loaded in quite well.  After the intro screen which spoke of a horrible monster on level 39.  ""So far so good,"" I thought, ""Better than Winda.""  Almost instinctively, My pet and I ran over to the dungeon entrance, in which I remembered to speak to the townsfolk for some quests and also to remember to buy a fishing rod eventually.  I finally descended into the dungeon and I was greeted by a familiar voice. After clearing the first floor with my axe, I decided it was time to go shopping.  I had already found a spear and some armor, so the only thing I did was stock up on potions and spell books.  I continued onward for many hours, until I felt like I killed many rats, and skeletons and it was time to expire and start a new game.Thank you for reading,I'm out. "

												This game is definitley Recommended from me... I used to play this game when I was a wee boy... so I guess you could say that I have a lot of Memories and Nolstagia.  However I do not like this game just because of that... this game has a very unqiue Medieval feel to it.  It has a very interesting Inventory UI (Which can be a bother at times but is still very inventive.)  It also has a range of different items and monsters (way to many to count!)  For the most part it seems that dungeon levels are infinte however I havent got very far yet!  This game also has a quest system which is used to gain Fame, Gold, Expierence which can be used to level up your character, and even in some cases Items, .  You also have a faithful compainion which can be a Cat or Dog depending on your preference.  They will aid in your efforts to kill Monsters and also cannot die!  You can also feed your pets fish, which will turn them into something fierce for a time.  You can also transform your pet into something permanelty (I dont know how to do this yet... but I will find out eventually.)  I quite like the idea of transforming your pet for if you are having a tough time and your normal trusty steed aint cuttin it, then you can turn him to a Unicorn or something!  The music is very pleasant and the narrators voice is pretty cool aswell.  The last thing I should mention is that... when you die there are some negative effects.  You will have to choose your fate!  And each choice you choose has a reprocussion like losing XP or Gold.  The one thing that bugs me about this game is that once you clear a Dungeon Level... there aren't any monsters that spawn in afterwards.  (What I mean is that, it would be nice that there would be a minimal amount of monsters that could still spawn so that you could level up over time without having to advance right away without having the recommended skills or power.)  Overall this game is really good, there isn't a lot of flaws with it...  I give it a 9.5 out of 10.			"

												FATE is A RPG dungeon crawler brought to you by the people at Wild Tanget. This game is A classic. Only thing that would make me love this game anymore is if it had multiplayer. The game centers around YOU be you Dicky Gobblkoque or John Doe. And unlike some games, this game only has ONE dungeon. With an infineite amount of levels of which new monsters come and they also increase in levels. These monsters change in variety from a basic slime to yetis. This game, although stable can have bugs every once in a while. One of which i had where my normal cursor stayed on the screen when i started the game. Not allowing me to click any options and FATE took over my computer. Forcing me to cold reboot. But once you are in the actual game, I doubt you will find any glitches. Like i said eariler the monsters level up the deeper into the dungeon you go. So playing on the harder difficulty like I do you can sometimes rush into A level you just can't handle. The spells in this game are extremely varied, sometime even pretty unique. From making monster your friends to attack other enemies, to poisonous clouds that drain the life from your (Not undead) Enemies. There is also a stamina system in the game. Because even heros get tired. This really is only to slow you down. Making it so you can't run forever so thats pretty bad. And one of the best parts... FISHING. Yes, the developers decided fishing would make a great part of their game. Fish can be used to turn your pet into magical ceatures. And fishing can also get some of the rarer items in the game. The quest system is your standard. ""Go kill this for me/get this for me and ill give you gold EXP and sometimes an item"" its not much to talk about but its worth a mention. And mage is the only extremly remarkable class, albiet the hardest one to really lift off on. So all in all, fate is a pretty good game. If you like dungeon crawlers then you will love this game without a doubt, if your not a fan of dungeon crawlers i still recommend it. You might just find an exception to your distaste.8/10			"

												This is one of those games that makes you wish Steam had three buttons for recommendation yes, no and 'neutral'.  Fate is your atypical dungeon crawler.  You get quests from the villagers that correspond to the dungeon lvl you are on with either a) kill boss X or b) gain item Y requests, with the vague goal of reaching lvl 50 and killing the main boss.-  There is no backstory to talk of and you don't get invested in what is going on with your character or the world around you-   Being an older game the graphics are dated obviously but this game is a classic so that can be forgiven-   Simple game with a very small learning curve.-   Not a bad bit of mindless fun but I would recommend its spiritual successor Torchlight for a more modern take on the dungeon crawler.

												I received FATE through a bundle that contained other games I was interested in getting, so I did not actively seek it out. However, I'm a huge fan of some RPGs, so I figured I would try out FATE. After all, I was obsessed with WildTangent back in the day. (Still hoping for a Steam version of Blackhawk Striker 2!)Sadly, FATE turned into a game that I do not wish to play. However, I would still recommend it, which is why I'm giving it a positive review.The best way for me to describe FATE is that it's a never-ending dungeon. Whereas other RPGs will have you encounter multiple dungeons alongside the main story or as side quests, FATE is simply one gigantic dungeon. There is little story here; it's all about becoming the most famous adventurer to conquer what lies beyond the Gate next to the town of Grove. There are quests that the villagers of Grove will give you, but they're simply ""Get back in that dungeon, to a specific level, and beat up this specific monster there. Get the item he drops and come back."" This furthers your progress with experience, gold, and fame. Way more focus on gameplay (see below) than story.The aesthetics are not Battlefield 4, but they completely match with the time period the game was developed in as well as in the style of RPG the game was going for. It's very much old-timey. However, don't let the graphics mislead you into thinking that this is one of the really difficult RPGs of old; it's actually quite easy to pick up and play when you get through the opening loading screens. I would have liked a tutorial or quick ""here's what you're doing and how you do it"" conversation with a tutorial NPC or something, but it's fine as it is.

												Basically, FATE was my childhood. My dad had a bunch of computers and there was one that had FATE pre-loaded onto it and I soon became obssessed. Even now I can't say this game is any less fun. Actually theres a bunch of stuff I'm learning now that I had no idea I could do before! I would recommend this game to any RPG fans who enjoy just owning mobs, leveling up, and becoming famous. It's a super fun game throughout it's entirety. So, if you have any extra cash this is a game I would get for sure.			"

												MUST READThis game is actually amazing and a cheaper version of ""Diablo"" but if you're gonna get it understand that it might just crash and never load again. On steam they can't fix it so they send you to the creaters(wild tanget) but those guys send you back to steam. If it crashes then you better say goodbye to the money you spent on it. Other than that this game is worth the money and it brings me back to when I was much younger sweeping through levels. 6/10			"

												I am casual RPG gamer, so I prefer RPGs that are easy to play and do not require me to learn to fence in real life just to win computer game :-D.I had found FATE game according to my taste. It is simple to set-up and to start, dungeons levels are easy to navigate, you can save and quit game at any time. The companion is quite nice touch, although I stick with spider at all times.After you finish all the missions, you can crawl deeper and deeper into dungeon, but it is same formula again and again. It works fine, but it is more about playing few levels once upon a time.I definitely recommend this game to all casual RPG gamers.			"

												Very minimalistic and incrdibly addictive gameplay is about all you can expect from this simplistic but surprisingly entertaining classic. The gameplay revolves around the simple tasks of going into dungeons to fight and coming back to town to meet with traders and fish, although that doesn't sound like much, the systems for all the tasks are so well crafted and fun that you don't really notice. The variety of enemies, spells, items and companions possible is extremely impressive for such a small game and although the gameplay is mostly similair it doesn't feel tedious at all because of ho fast paced and rewarding it's upgrade systems are, it has an excellent feeling of progression as you go along. It has little storyline, undeveloped characters, and a completely generic universe but if you're looking for a fun, low commitment game thn I highly recommend it.			"

												For a cheap price, this game is worth every penny.FATE is a charming little dungeon crawler, similar to those of the 90's and 80's. With a large amount of loot, satisfying leveling system and several other fun odds and ends. FATE is a time consuming game, perfect for those who want to brutally slaughter a few hours. The game is satisfying and addicting. However, the graphics are a bit dated, which means this plays well on almost any system. The sounds are a bit dated, but the fact that the saves are able to  be ported into the sequel is great news to those who grow attached to their character.			"

												10/10 Best time sink simulator for the price.Let me preface this by saying that I have put almost three full days of playtime into this game at time of writing, so I obviously like it.Fate is a Dungeon Crawler that came out in 2005, while the music is somewhat similar to that of Diablo, it does fit the setting and does aid with immersion quite well. The graphic are great for 2005 and can hold their own in a modern gaming market given recent events. (I am looking at you, AC Unity.)A very basic gist of the story is this: big bad monster in big bad dungeon. Adventurous hero of unknown origin and unremarkable (non-existant?) achievement must go and slay this baddie as s/he is clearly our last and greatest hope. So off you go with little more than a pointy stick and your trusty pet compainion to try and stomp a monster's teeth in.Every floor of the dungeon is random, in the sense that is a series of rooms with sporadic and often unyeildy connecting paths. As a whole, the entire dungeon has a nice and bumpy difficulty curve that, if you are strategic and don't mind some grinding, you can completely kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of.I think one of the drawbacks of this game is one key game mechanic in particular. I won't be disclosing which mechanic this is, as once you figure out why it is useful, you are going to abuse this machanic like you just found out the button combination to get free soda in the soda machine at the office. Once that happens, the game loses quite a bit of difficulty. One of many things that really makes up for this is another mechanic, Enchanting, which is really more of a gamble than the actual ""gambling"" mechanic. Another thing I really like about this game are the items obtainable and the playstyles available, FATE wholeheartedly supports the idea of having your cake and eating it too, though various stat selections on leveling up, you can do just about anything, or do everything if you really want to. This is great for me, because I am the type of person that if I get a massive '♥♥♥♥ you' sword, I want a second '♥♥♥♥ you' sword or a superpowered sheild of 'I don't give a ♥♥♥♥'. And the game lets you do that! And I love that about it.All in all, it is a great game if you are looking for something to introduce you to Dungeon Crawling, or if you are looking for something to eat up free time cheaply.			"

												I received FATE through a bundle that contained other games I was interested in getting, so I did not actively seek it out. However, I'm a huge fan of some RPGs, so I figured I would try out FATE. After all, I was obsessed with WildTangent back in the day. (Still hoping for a Steam version of Blackhawk Striker 2!)Sadly, FATE turned into a game that I do not wish to play. However, I would still recommend it, which is why I'm giving it a positive review.The best way for me to describe FATE is that it's a never-ending dungeon. Whereas other RPGs will have you encounter multiple dungeons alongside the main story or as side quests, FATE is simply one gigantic dungeon. There is little story here; it's all about becoming the most famous adventurer to conquer what lies beyond the Gate next to the town of Grove. There are quests that the villagers of Grove will give you, but they're simply ""Get back in that dungeon, to a specific level, and beat up this specific monster there. Get the item he drops and come back."" This furthers your progress with experience, gold, and fame. Way more focus on gameplay (see below) than story.The aesthetics are not Battlefield 4, but they completely match with the time period the game was developed in as well as in the style of RPG the game was going for. It's very much old-timey. However, don't let the graphics mislead you into thinking that this is one of the really difficult RPGs of old; it's actually quite easy to pick up and play when you get through the opening loading screens. I would have liked a tutorial or quick ""here's what you're doing and how you do it"" conversation with a tutorial NPC or something, but it's fine as it is. Level 1 of the dungeon is straightforward and pretty much sets the bar for what players should expect.Of note, however, is that there's a difficulty setting. I set it to Page, the easiest. So it might just be me. The hardest difficulty, Legend, might be what the veterans from old RPGs would like to start out at to really get a challenge. :PGameplay is interesting, to say the least.

												What a great dungeon crawler! I absolutely love it! First discovered Fate when I got my laptop a couple pf years ago and was looking for some fun games that were built-in with it. Fate was one of them and I fell in love with it. It reminded me of my beloved Diablo game I had a long time ago. Unfortunately, the demo ended soon and I was so upset that I couldn't play it anymore. When I saw it on Steam, I don't think I had ever been so excited. Especially because of the fact it was about 75% cheaper than buying it from the Tangent provider. This game is absolutely fun and the fun will last for a very long time. The dungeons are endless and the enemies get more and more challenging. The fishing is the best partbecause you have a chance at catching a rare item which you can sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars to the merchants and beocme rich. The graphics are great!I recommend this game 110% to anyone who is considering and willing to buy it! For $8, you will get your money's worth!			"

												Do you like copious amounts of dungeon crawling that never ends? Then Fate might be for you. I've clocked in over 50 hours on this game this past year and I really had no idea what the end game goal was. I got it into my head at some point that it would all be over at Level 100. There'd be this grand baddie that I'd face off with my minions in an epic battle and I'd prove victorious. When that never happened and I was at Level 103 I became suspicious. Turns out I just had to go to floor 51. I over shot my goal by 52 floors. That proves 2 things. One, I clearly wasn't informed of where I had to go and two, the game doesn't do a good job of informing you of your goal except at the very beginning. I would have never guessed that the old wizard at the entrance was who you needed to talk to to get your end goal. Unlike all the other town folk who have a big exclamation mark above their heads when they have quests for you the guy with the end quest was just chilling at the entrance so I never spoke to him every time I went to town. That's just poor informing on the game's part. Not to say that I didn't thoroughly enjoy this game and if I wasn't trying to complete the achievements, one of which I didn't get until I was somewhere around Level 100 I probably wouldn't have played for so long. This game is a grind but there's lots of loot and villagers supply you with endless quests for you to keep going and going and going. Weapons and armor are plentiful but I found item enhancements to help more than picking the weapon with the highest attack power. My favorite armor was one with a defense rating of 42 but it had a bunch of buffs that increased my damage by 40% and my dexterity by 70%. It also helped that it absorbed 9% of damage dealt. You'll also find out pretty quick that your starting animal is useless. Find fish to transform it as much as you can until you get one that you can live with. I particularly liked the Ebony Stalker. Summon spells are also your friend. I can't count how many times I was killed in seconds by mobs of enemies. So get yourself a Venomous Wyvern summon and always have 6 around you. They don't do much damage but they sure do come in handy when you want enemies to target something that isn't you.This is Duracell bunny of dungeon crawlers. That being said if you like Fate you'd love Torchlight. It's just like Fate only better and it has an actual story as a plausible reason for your dungeon crawling that comes to a clearly defined end.			"

This little dungeon crawler was always a pleasure to play, and when I found it on Steam a little while ago, I got major nostalgia and had to buy it. It's simple in a lot of ways, not entirely challenging until you start getting much deeper into the dungeons, and the quest system can be a little annoying with only being allowed to have a certain number of quests going at a time. Regardless, this game is pretty much a classic, and for its age, the graphics aren't bad at all.			"

You wouldnt think that was a game-making mechanic but I'm finding myself keeping my favorite fish on hand, spending a lot of time thinking about what eventual permanent change I'd like for him to undergo.The randomly generated dungeons keep from being repetitive by a very small view area and a lot of challenges - you think you're awesome mchero-sauce until you step too far into a big room and pull so many mobs that you run screaming into the darkness like a little pansy. The quests are a little annoying in that you have to pay attention to what level they're sending you to. You can only ""carry"" three quests in a go, so dont clutter up your journal with the one that will make you wait for three whole levels.It's a great little time killer. No story, no maps, no mess.

												   This is a really awesome game. I have loved the Fate series since my childhood, and I am also really happy to own this game on Steam. Fate is an really fun RPG/Dungeon crawler type of game that breathed new life into the games of it's genre. The music is beautiful, the voice acting is really cool, and the whole concept/storyline is beyond epic, and the graphics are good for a game of it's time.

												Before I begin this review, I'd like to note that I had never played this game before. Everything was new, and the only thing I knew about it was that it was an apparent classic that a streamer I watch occaisonally played once. So here I am with the steam version instead of the hard copy or the download from the old website. So, you're asking, what do I think of this game?It's pretty charming and entertaining even in 2016, 11 years after releaseIn case you couldn't tell, FATE is a dungeon crawler. Same routine, battle through different floors of this ""mysterious dungeon"" that happens to be the main heart for everything that lives and breathes. Everyone knows about this one dungeon, and everyone depends on it for a living. Everyone lives the dungeon, everyone breathes the dungeon, and your the hero who will fight through all 50 floors and blah blah blah... you get the routine.However, even though it may be mediocre, you can NEVER find a crawler like this these days. It's all about ""Pay 2 Win"" and ""Fighting angry robot sharks with chainsaws for hands"" and ""Swords that are bigger than the protagonist themselves."" Sadly, FATE may be one of the last of it's kind. For this, I can look over the mediocre-ness, because this is a classic, and I highly recommend it. You just can't find a game like this nowadays! =(			"

												This is one of my favourite games of all time. It is a simple dungeon crawler that is a bit older but is easy to get caught up in. It came as a either a demo or the full version on a pc i had a while ago and i played it all the time. So when i saw that it was on the steam market place and the sequel had just been put on, i was thrilled! Not to mention that it was on sale for around a dollar because the sequel was just put on the store. I'm not seeing it going on sale at anytime but even so, for 5 dollars i think it is an investment you will not regret. Now just to inform you if you are going to buy it, you might have problem with it starting up. If so it is easy to look on the disscusion page on the community page for the game. Their you will find many helpful guides to get your game running. In short, Get this game!!!			"

It'scontrols are a little bit weird at first, but once you get used to them (which is pretty quickly) then it works fine. The music sets the mood throughout the game, which helps with immersion. There are three paths you can take that are effective, which are the mage, ranger, and warrior, and they each work well enough. You have a pet who is infinitely helpful.

												Fate is a classic dungeon crawler that I have played for years before it came to steam. It is a fun game where you buy or find weapons and armour and fight ""creatures"" in the dungeon.

And another horde of Monsters got busted!This game is, well, it is a dungeon crawler and Action RPG (Diablo and some other titles might ring a note here). The game is dated, but still it comes as crisp and fresh as it goes. It has a lot of ""Kill this and that..."", ""Find xxx and bring it to me."" Quests running. Leveling and upgrading is quite easy. Why you should buy it? It's cute, it's quite intuitive gameplay and has a lot to offer just for the price attached to it. Sure, it isn't the best game, but then again it is doing a lot of stuff right and can be quite entertaining and addictive as well. And it gives you some insight about an easy interface, simplyfied skill trees and such things. I recomend this game, based on the fact that it is despite it's age still a good game to play.			"

												Pros- Has most of the good things about Diablo and Diablo II, though it's quite an obvious protege.- Gold is automatically picked up, yay.- Nice mindless game to play through if you're not looking for much variety.Neutral- Not too crazy about the art style, but it's not bad either.Cons- Generic dungeon crawling with quests on about every level. Kill this, retrieve item, return to town, repeat. There's no originality here.- The skill tree isn't very interesting, and isn't really a tree at all.- Dungeons are often needlessly filled with many dead ends, requiring a looottt of time to backtrack overall.- It's needlessly difficult to heal at the beginning for some reason; you generate not even one single hit point when out of combat and health potions aren't always easy to come by or buy early on.- The voice acting for when traps are sprung, etc. is a bit annoying, as well as low quality.- This game requires a lot of grinding to be able to defeat monsters; the yeti on levels 10 and 11 is way overpowered compared to the rest of the monsters leading up to that point, and the ogres starting on level 12 are sudden, too.- Magic casting is ridiculously slow at the beginning, almost comically so.- Incredibly repetitive content; the quests are for randomly generated items or to kill random beasts, and always just for a formulaic reward in experience, fame, and gold.- The sound effects are also very redundant; every single attack by an enemy has only their one designated sound effect, so enemies that attack quickly sound super annoying. The game is also too loud and ear-piercing even on a low sound effects volume.- There are many miscellaneous bugs with the game, such as my dog sometimes appearing over gaps where he cannot walk such as ascending and descending stairs, and the hitboxes for picking up items are some of the worst I've ever seen.Basically, I recommend this game only as a mindless bit of entertainment to play through. There's nothing very defining or special about it.			"

												This is a really good dungeon crawler to get into if you arent playing the Torchlight games at the moment. Gameplay is simple, story is simple, lots of weapons, spells, and armors to choose from. My pc is currently about 5 years old, it can play almost any game perfectly, but i recently upgraded my graphics card to an Nvidia Gforce 770 GTX, and I get random frame rate issues. This could be because the game isnt that well optimized, but for the price, its very worth it.			"

												So glad they added this, used to love this game and play it all the time! Its pretty cool but it's also for younger gamers. I'd say anyone below 13 could truly enjoy the game. I'm almost 18 and just wanted to get it simply because it reminds me of my childhood. It was on sale for 5 bucks so I said oh what the heck, and now I have it again. Truly fantastic.			"

												If you didn't play this game when you were a kid, you missed out. FATE is a classic dungeon game, packed full of bizzare creatures and fish that turn your dog or cat into glorious things like unicorns. It's cute and dark all at the same time, and it can be as challenging as you desire it to be. I love this game to death.			"

												Out of every game I played as a kid, I have no other to thank but the Fate franchise for turning me in to a gamer.After playing the first fate, it showed me at the young age of 5 that the vidoe game franchise is a gaint that can't be mesed with do to the big fan fallow ups with games like COD, Mario, Pokemon and many others have, and small games like fate that still have a great fallowing.For any one how likes RPG games or whants to play a great PC game from 2005(wow, ten years ago, I fell old) then I can't recommend any other game then Fate.Well....... Fate Undiscovered Realms, The Traitor Soul, and The Cursed King all have great things to them, but to me the first fate is all I need for nostalgia resons.(now if only they made a Fate 5)			"

												I'd been wanting to play this game for many years after first hearing about it back when it was new -- a Diablo clone during the action-rpg drought of much of the 2000s, with all these nice features like a permanent pet that can hold and sell your junk for you while you adventure?  Sounded awesome.Of course, much time passed and I ended up playing Torchlight and its sequel before this game.  And on that note, I can go ahead and give you the meat of the review:Torchlight is, simply put, a better version of this game.And yes, I know it's by the same guys and came before Torchlight -- but there's really no reason to play this instead; there's absolutely nothing that this game does better, or even as well, and they're quite succinctly the exact same game only with Torchlight being newer and more improved.  It's not like how they're both direct clones of Diablo 1 but that game has a unique atmosphere and gamefeel that makes it still very much worth playing separately; no, these games are *the exact same thing*, except Torchlight is better.Torchlight has classes; Fate does not.  Fate makes you play a generic character whose un-alterable starting stats are those of a warrior class, even though, for example, playing as a mage is very powerful.  Likewise, Torchlight has an actual skill tree system a la Diablo 2 whereas Fate has a flat page of skills of which no playstyle will ever need to put points into more than 3 or 4 max.Torchlight has a variety of visually luscious dungeon areas, a unique backdrop to each set of floors, whereas Fate hits you with a generic and unappealing handful of locales randomly chosen floor-by-floor.  Torchlight also offers enemies cohesive to the area at which you fight them to some degree whereas Fate throws a random mishmash of almost every enemy in the game in your direction each floor, with lower floors having you see a bit more larger stuff along with 'elite' and 'legendary' versions of the smaller stuff to make their HP pools monsterous; there is no rhyme or reason.Torchlight has a massive amount of powerful equipment to find and collect, offering you many build options and ways to increase your power, while Fate quickly makes you realize a simple and painful truth; farm the shops until you have the maximum gem slots possible in every piece of equipment, then farm the mage shop until you have the required amount of superior gems, asap.  There's your endgame equipment; if you're lucky enough to find higher-tier stuff later with the required sockets then good for you, but don't hold your breath.  And this goes for all playstyles.Torchlight has a defined endgame, final floor and final boss, and then a separate 'infinite' dungeon to test your skills if you want to keep playing.  Fate gives you a randomized boss monster on a random floor and then gives you the option to go deeper in the same dungeon for no real reason.  I will say that the 'descendant' system is interesting, but is it really worth it?  Oh sure, you can become insanely powerful and tear up the dungeons for hundreds of levels if you really want, but you've seen all the game has to offer by floor 20 or so max, and by the time you get to your final boss situated 2 or 3 times deeper than that you'll be well and truly done with the game.  Even the powerful endgame unique equipment that serves as the carrot-on-a-stick for many action-RPG players is a joke, here -- as far as I can tell, you can get *all* uniques even extremely early in the game via fishing holes, and though some seems tantalizing at first you quickly realize their benefits are still not comparable to a socketed, plain version of the same item; and while a socketed unique may be the ideal, good luck with that.  You'll never find them socketed already, and if you dare spend millions of gold at the enchanter in the tiny off-chance you'll get one added (when ideally you'd want 2 or more), you're liable to revert the item to a powerless piece of scrap.So all in all?  Yeah, no.  Skip it.  Play Diablo, Diablo 2, Diablo 3 (yes, Diablo 3), Titan Quest, Grim Dawn, Path of Exile, the Van Helsing games, and any other action-RPG before you think about this one.  And especially Torchlight.  Because it's literally the exact same game but better in every conceivable way.That being said, I am still going to check out the other Fate games and see if they're... fated... for better reviews.  Heh.  Haha... *cough*			"

												Oh my goodness. I can't believe I didn't see this game was on Steam. I LOVED This game as a kid. We got it with a whole lot of demos on a computer we bought a long time ago. The demo only lets you go to the 3rd floor of the Dungeon. Time for some personal backstory:It was some time around 2008. I was in Elementary School still. (4th grade I think). I didn't drink enough water on a daily basis, so my bladder got infected. I started to pee blood, so I motioned for my teacher to come out in the hallway while I tell her the embarrasing news. My Mom came and picked me up. We went to my doctor's office (It was sort of like a clinic. It's hard to explain).The doctor took me in, and told me I was going to have to get blood drawn which sent me into a panic. I had never had my blood drawn before, and I HATED needles (What kid doesn't?). So, the Doctor came in with this huge needle and stuck it into my arm. It hurt like crap. Afterwards I was really shaken up, and we ususally got toys or video games after we go to the doctors/dentists (I was into Legos at the time, so I got Lego sets for the dentist). That day, we drove to Walmart, and went to the PC games section.It felt good to pick up that game, and put it into the cart. My mom even let me get some candy on the way out. (Some sour candy. I LOVE sour candy). Of course, I couldn't play it right as I got home. Mom had to do the checking account. So, my brother and I went outside and we sat down on a matress that was sitting outside. (It was out in my Grandma's backyard. My grandma lives right next to us. I live on a farm, btw.)I rushed home soon, and heard that sweet sound the bank software makes when you log out; A really crunchy CHA-CHING!!! So, I sat down and put the disk into the computer. Like I said earleir, it was a long time ago and computers were super slow back in the day. So, I had to wait until the game finished installing.Finally! It finished! Oh, that sweet song that plays at the beginning. Captain O'Kane. That song captures the epicness of this game.The game is called Fate, you know that. You're a young adventurer with your Animal Companion (Dog or cat. You can change it later...). You arrive in the town of Grove, where the entrence to a large dungeon stand, beckoning the daring adventurers in.You start off basic. You don't have any armor, but you do have a hachet. (Axe). I'm going to do a walkthrough on my YouTube channel, so you can get the jist of the starting.You  can fish, too! So I recommend that you buy a fishing rod and fish to your heart's content. You can sell those fish or feed them to your pet. Each fish has different effects. Let's say you feed your pet a fish, and it turns them into a spider!! All the fish you get can turn your animal companion into a Dungeon Creature, but it will stay loyal to you and fight for you.You can chose what kind of skill you want to use. Personally I use the sword and shield the most, but I've used magic and bows too.It's good because you can use Magic and be a swordsman, or use magic and be an archer.  Magic, magic, magic.You can get quests from certain people around town. I strongly suggest you take the quests, because they pay off well.The main goal of the game is to find the boss of the Dungeon (It tells you at the beginning. It's always randomized too), and get rich!I haven't actually gotten that far, but I've been to floor 100 and beyond. Which is almost as good I guess.I STRONGLY recommend this game. It's a steal for $7.99 . I hope you liked this review of it, and be sure to find my channel on YouTube so you can watch gameplay of it, if you're not sure about it. Thanks for reading.			"

												9/10 Hack and slash rpg!Fun, addicting, and just plain fun! Have you played diablo 2? This game is very much like that, but it adds some things that make the hack and slash RPG better. Such things as a pet that sells stuff for you so you dont have to go back to the town when you inv full! A cool death system were you dont just respawn, you choose were and on what terms! And the best feature is that the game randomly generates almost everything! From the levels of the dungeon and quests to weapons and enemy stats! Even the games last boss is a random type of enemy on a random floor with random stats! The only con I found was that the quests are A bit rotuine, Kill X thing and get X item to bring back for X exp and X gold and X fame and sometimes a item.This game is a lot of fun and if you like rpgs, pick it up and have a GREAT time!9/10			"

												This is a game i played awhile back when i had a wild tangent account and got free coins, and i played it a ton. This game was really addicting, and one of my favorites, so when i find out it's on steam, i go crazy, i buy it, and play it for a bit, then stop, and forget about it, but then i pick it back up, play it a ton, then drop it again, for some reason, it wasn't as addicting as it was before, but probably because i have more than just 5 games like i did back then. I would recommend this to anybody that likes RPG's that have replayibiblity to it. Randomized dungeon every new game, many different item types so you can techniclly pick a class, and tons of quests that can played. I love this game, and always will.			"

I t let me play the first couple times (in a twenty four hour period) now I can't get online with steam...although every other site in available online, so it isn't my internet connection. How do I contact you with a problem?  I can't recommend this game or Steam unless this problem is fixed, although I shouldn't have to deal with problem with a decade old game, so I'm assuming the site has issues...			"

												It came free with my Windows 8 laptop, but it wasn't unlimited play, I had to have ""coins"" and I only got so many a week for free through developer and their little game window [rolls eyes]. Was really frustrating too, because it is actually a fun, addictive little game. So when I noticed a couple days ago that Steam had it, and that it was on sale because it is that time of the year, I jumped on it.I was playing Tl2 for the first time today, and noticed that it is VERY similar to that, there are some differences:-the character is a little chibi child looking thing, and you can only choose between a cat or a dog for a pet (BUT if you get lucky, you find a fish that can permanently change them, or just fish/buy fish that temporarily change them)-this is straight up dungeon crawling, no two games/levels are the same-no actual class picking BUT you can decide to specialize in a certain kind of weapon/magic-single player onlyJust like in Tl2, you can load your pet with things and send them to down to sell the stuff for you. Basic in game hot-buttons and controls are the same. This is basically a very simple, dungeon-crawling Tl2, if you will....but then, at the end of the day, MOST fantasy RPG are basically the same. This is a fun, simple, kinda cute little game, easy to pick up and play (and get lost in and loose track of the time >_< LOL) Great for anyone. I'd recommend, especially since the price is good, whether on sale or not.			"

												Oh FATE... It was one of the first, if not the first aRPG I've ever played! I used to love this game... After replaying it, I can tell i'm not impressed, there are many things done wrong, there are many bugs in this version and the translation is utterly terrible!Here's the list of issues with the game.1. Language locked to your System Language.Since I don't have Windows 7 Ultimate, it's impossible for me to change my game to english... I'm forced to play in French, which, I dislike to do, first of all. Also if you try to modify the language of the game by playing with files, you will most likely break it at some point and the game will just crash. Then, on top of that, the translation is really rubbish, nothing makes sense!2. The translation to french (and possibly the spanish one too) are bad.The names of the monsters or items are hilarious to look at, because they all look like ""Hammer of of fire of the the great Tahl bat"" and the likes...3. The voice acting is poor. (French)The english voice acting is fine, but the laughs and the quotes from the narrator in french are really cringe...4. Bugs.Well, first of all, if you launch the game and click anywhere during it's loading, it crashes your computer! It did that on 3 of my computers, all desktops. Pretty much, the game gets stuck with the in-game cursor + the computer mouse at the same time, everything you click does nothing and CTRL+ALT+DLT doesn't alt-tab you. You have to restart your computer!5. Broken achievement.Yep, the achievements for Large Chests is broken if you're game is not in english. It's impossible to get it, unless you modify game files. Boo!6. Looting issues.Items names are very hard to click on and they stack on top of each other, You always have your inventory clustered with junk you did not even want to loot because of that.7. Game Balance.Griffons dies in 2 hit, they're huge! However, rats summoned by a same level Vampire will tank more hits, what?Also, Yeti deals insane damage and are relatively tanky. Where some mobs deals less damage and dies in 2-3 hits.Melee + Shield is somewhat weak. You have to split your skill points in 1 type of weapon (for example swords), points in block and points in critical strike. For example, summoners or rangers, only have to put their points in 1 or 2 of them, so they're alot better in that aspect. And even for stat points! If you're a summoner, all into Vitality (and enough magic to cast your favorite summon), because nothing else is worth it. Ranger and melee though, you need 3 to 4 stats! You hit very rarely with melee or range unless you have lots of Dexterity and Attack(accuracy) on gear. Mages always hit, how fair.Also with melee, or range, you're stuck with mostly the same type of damage (slashing, piercing etc), since you have to spec into a certain kind of weapon. So if a monster resists 100% of it, good luck! But if you're a mage, no problem. Summoners have every types of summons and caster mages have Fire, Ice, Poison, Lightning spells with 0 penalty for using every elements, because all you need is ""Attack magic!"".8. Frame Rate issues.The Steam version has horrible frame rate issues! I've played FATE on multiple computers before and it always ran fluently, even on my Pentium III and on my cheap i5. But my gaming PC with an i5 that maxes out almost any games, lags as soon as there are 4-5 mobs on the screen... Were talking about 10-15 fps drops. So, scratch playing a summoner if you're unlucky enough to get this Frame Rate bug i'm having. I tried a few fixes, but nothing seemed to help.9. Gambling.Gambling in this game is... Poor. First of all, you get tons of stuff that you cannot even use, because they have very high requirements or requires alot of fame. Then you get bases that are still very weak later in the game. Also, the price sometimes doesn't seem to matter at all. I've bought items at 10,000 gold that were good and were cyan (the best before unique items) and I've bought items at 800,000 gold tags that were pruple (the worst kind of magic items) with an horrible stat (even negative stats!). It's like it's 100% random when you roll your item. You could pay 1 million gold and end up with an item that gives you -19% life and nothing else.I understand it's gambling, but this looks like a true random item generator.Overall, I like the game, but compared to Torchlight or pretty much any other aRPG, it's just a bit too unbalanced to be enjoyable. It's got broken achievements and bugs too. Looting is wonky and if you're computer is not in english, you just can't set the game to english, if you try to modify files, you will most likely break the game at some point.------------------------------------UPDATE: I've contacted their support and they refuse to fix it, they say it's Steam's fault when it's not.

												Who rembers sprinting home from school to play this until our parents kicked us off?I would spend countless hours of my childhood running fron dungeon to town, selling loot, slaying beasts, doing quests, gathering potions, fishing for rare items, enchanting weaopns, buying spells, and spawning monsters in the town (because I could thats why). The moment I saw this game I bought it. I had to.10/10 would rediscover the meaning childhood again.			"

												You can import your character to other Fate games. How cool is that? I purchased the Fate games during one of Steam's sales and I have finally gotten around to playing the series and I love these games. Game play is smooth and some of the best games I have played in a while. I love my dog Max, the music  is relaxing. Just a really good game.			"

												Hope you like rolling boulders up hills grinding with monotonous combat mechanics, because that's what the FATE games are all about.  Maybe they weren't that bad for their time, but there's no reason to play them anymore (assuming there ever was).  They get old quickly, and there's hardly anything to distinguish them from each other (they're so similar, I have no problem just copying and pasting the same review on each of the three that I own).  Moreover, there's nothing to distinguish them from the more recent Torchlight (not surprising, given that the Runic Games team includes ex-WildTangent devs), except Torchlight is better in every respect: better graphics, better combat, and better performance (despite being developed for Pentium systems, the FATE games still manage to overheat my Core 2 Duo gaming laptop even while running at 800x640 with minimal graphics quality).  Want to play a dungeon crawler?  Play Torchlight.  Already played Torchlight?  You're still probably better off replaying it, or playing its sequel (disclaimer: I have not).  If you really insist on getting a FATE game, I suggest starting with Cursed King, since it at least adds a little more character customization and a much-needed button to quickly swap weapon loadouts.

												The sad truth is, Torchlight has obsoleted this game.  It shouldn't come as a surprise.  The same lead developer, made several years later.  Torchlight expands upon many of the elements started in this game, and fixes a lot of the problems this game has.  Torchlight itself is not a perfect game, it does improve upon this one in nearly every aspect.Even ignoring the fact that a superior version of this game exists, this game is just not that fun.  It's very slow, particularly for an aRPG.  It relies on an old, clunky interface and mechanics (such as limits town portal and identify scrolls, etc.)  Yea, they were staples of the time, but we've moved beyond them.  And this review is taking place now, with the games and mechanics that exist today.I love old games.  Even ones that didn't age well.  But the ones I play generally make me want to KEEP playing them.  This game does not.  And in the end, that's what a recommendation comes down to.  So, no, I cannot recommend this game.			"

												Gameplay-wise it's good enough at being a hack'n'slash ARPG I suppose (it copies Diablo profoundly enough to comply with the genre's standards), some mechanics such as being able to have your pet sell your junk are pretty neat (saves you A LOT of town portals) but the absolute absence of any story or development is too mindnumbing for me to enjoy this.The only hint of an objective is a guy in town who reminds me that a boss awaits in level 46. Who's the boss? Why am I supposed to fight it? Silly me for wanting to know. It seems everything between starting a new game and facing the boss is just an endless stream of randomly generated (and thus painfully soulless) fetch quests that follow the exact same formula over and over. Not that much fun.Now I haven't really played much of this so I might be wrong and maybe some sort of a story kicks in later but even if that's the case it's still a rubbish design decision to give the player no sense of direction or motivation right away.Also the game looks dated (though some environments do look quite compelling) AND runs like a bottom, but that's really just a minor problem compared to the dullness.So while this is not a horrible game by any means, I can't really recommend it to anyone, maybe save for ARPG enthusiasts who want to try every game of the genre that ever came out.Just play Torchlight instead. I can't think of anything FATE does better.			"

												This is basically a mash-up of Din's Curse and Torchlight, with the dungeon structure from the former and the character system from the latter. Unfortunately, they seem to have forgot to add anything interesting to the game such as fun combat skills, dungeon interactables, or unique NPCs (several things I would have liked to see in a random dungeon crawler). Enemy variety is decent though, with a half-dozen different enemies every few dungeons.The game is competent and runs well but is mostly a grinder. I would recommend the aforementioned titles rather than this.			"

												A cute and adequate diablo clone but without the capacity for multiplayer -- which frankly is a standard of games like this ever since... well, Diablo. I got sucked in initially by it's subtle charm and my affinity for the genre, but frankly stayed with it to beat the game on a grudge. The loot system is flawed in that the majority of gear is unusable without certain stat requirements -- for example, to wear plate mail you'd literally have to win the game more than once, perhaps several times. That frankly is ludicrous, considering my character was literally defined as a hero of great reknown who was DRIPPING in strength-giving gear and focused on developing strength... what, is plate mail made of depleted uranium in this world? This is just one example... the vast majority of equipment you find or see in stores is reserved for people who (somehow) have the time and facination to remain on the hamster wheel. I hate-played this game just to see what was waiting for me when I finally beat the creature designated to be the target of my adventure... and it was the ""opportunity"" to start all over from the beginning. Bottom line - if you want to play a game like this play Diablo, or Titan Quest, or Path of Exile (which happens to be FREE!) -- those are ALL better games and finer examples of the genre. Barf. Oh, one last thing -- the difficulty scale on this game is literally offensive... it just multiplies (or divides, it would seem) monster hitpoints, and in the case of ""Hero"" difficulty (which I chose expecting a challenge, not a boring punishment) just makes monsters rapidly scale out of reach of being able to keep up with them. It won't make the monsters more challenging, but it WILL turn the entire game into button mashing the potion key while holding the attack button down. Also, most anti-climactic final battle ever -- it basically filled the screen with summons to the point the player cannot remain engaged to one target for more than an instant, making it literally impossible to swing more than three times at the same creature before dying. Luckily there is a (stupid) mechanic in the game that allows you to respawn exactly where you died at the loss of some xp and (mostly pointless) fame, so to beat the boss, (or anything for that matter) you merely need to swing twice before you die where you stand and keep coming back UNTIL you kill enough of the annoying summoners to face off with the boss, and if needed die numerous times to get him as well. Awful. Awful. Awful. If you played the game as a youngster and feel the need to retread this path somehow, be my guest. Those without the benefit of nostalgia have been warned.			"

												This is basically an outdated version of the first Torchlight game. Torchlight is better, in my opinion, in every way imaginable to this title. No offense to this game...it seems decent enough, and I can understand the need for a variety of games to play, but it's so much like Torchlight that I can't see a reason to play this instead. Like I said, I don't dislike the game, but since it's basically the same game but antiquated in comparison, get Torchlight instead if you want a game like this.			"

												Almost really good. The actual gameplay was fun. Simple hack 'n' smash through a dungeon, with customizability. And despite many ways to customize, it isn't complicated. Why the thumbs down? This is Bag Space - The Game. I spent more of my time doing inventory management than actually playing the darn game. Not only that, but while your pet is selling for you, tabbing out of the game to read news pauses the game so you can't multitask. It also doesn't have mods, so I can't just add bag space in easily. Seriously, the game-play is fun. The gearing is a bit annoying, but workable. Bloody hell the bag space issue though, ugh! Yes, the game is 10 years old. Yes, it clearly inspired Torchlight and was likely inspired by Diablo (which are both excellent). Still, I wanted to play a hack 'n' smash, not Bag Space. If you have the patience for that, you can snag this cheapish and get a pretty easy perfect game for your Steam profile though. Sorry, being 10 years old doesn't forgive the bag space nonsense.			"

												Fate is a nice game and all, and like many of the players here I have fond memories of playing it way back when, but it's hard to recommend it at full price to players new to game.The gameplay is pretty standard; left click to attack, right click to cast, you have health and mana, none of the spells will surprise you, and while there are quite a few different monsters, none of them really differ from each other. The ""plot"" is to kill a randomly generated monster on a random level with a lot of randomly generated side quests thrown in which sounds nice, but soon things will start repeating and it will begin feel more like a never-ending grind with no real goal.I'm not say it's a bad game, but for a bit more you'd be better off with its sucessor, Torchlight, which has pretty much the same mechanics but a better plot, a more refined feel and more variation in its monsters and items beyond slightly different stats.

												Fate is an awesome game in terms of its story line and the beautiful maps and characters, however, it stops there. Why? Because the game is ridiculously hard to even maintain a pace with. Its a dungeon crawler. At first it is a piece of cake but then as you start getting down lower in the dungeons you will start to get your ♥♥♥ handed to you on a regular basis due to the game sending armies of these creatures at you at the same time, and each time you get killed, you get three choices as to how you want to respawn. The first causes you to lose experience and they will drop you right back where you died. Unfortunately the enemies are still waiting for you and will proceed to gang up on you and beat you to dust where you will become angry and choose choice number two which takes some exp but spawns you on a nearby level. This nearby level could be either levels up, or down, from where you died. The problem with this is that as you make your way back to where you were, the levels are now loaded with powerful enemies, even if you already cleared them,  who will stomp you into mud in no time flat. You will get VERY ANGRY indeed at this game and I predict, unless you are the unusually stubborn type, that you will just leave and never come back again, OR, you will cheat and ruin the experience. See my guide on cheating in the steam version because NO ONE is gonna help you amongst these cry baby anti cheaters, lol. End of story. Money spent on a game that will ♥♥♥♥ you off. Same goes for all the sequels.			"

												Did I buy Torchlight again ?   ------Edit:  I know Torchligh came after.  I bought it first.   My point is about gaming experience and uniqueness of experience.  It's not like you're waiting for the next one to be released.  You can choose to spend on Fate, Fate Undiscovered realms, Torchlight I or Torchlight II.  Torchlight II has added game experience which makes it best.   The other three are almost identical, so if I'm going to choose one of them, it'll be Torchlight I because it has better achievements.   -----I bought this recently.  I had never played it previously.    I have played both Torchlight games.   This game and the first Torchlight could be clones of one another.   I honestly can't think of one thing that differs.   Get five attribute points to distribute per level up - check.  Get a skill point to apply to warrior skill, mage skill or ranged weapon skill - check.   Have a pet - check.  Can transform pet - check.  Use fish to transform pet - check.  Use portal scroll to navigate to most recent level and go down a level - check.   Gamble - check.   The game itself is good enough, but save yourself the money, go buy Torchlight II.  The latter Torchlight adds a dimension to the gameplay rather than simply grinding thru dungeon levels to satisfy arbitrary hack & slash quests.			"

												You should always beware of games that give out achievments far too early, its a bad habit for modern games, but actually worse for games, that can't think of any achievment other than ""ok lets give you something for doing the usual stuff that you will do in this game anyway.Horrible game honestly, I never played it before, but this..this is just bad, I mean its like a kid version of diablo, only worse.I mean Diablo came out 1996 thats almost 10 years prior, Diablo II came out  2000 and both games are simply better than this piece of garbage ever could be, there is no sense or rhyme, the graphics are disgusting the entire game seems to be the groundwork for torchlight, another horrible and useless game, if you ask me, simplistic in everything, no story arc, always the same quests, one town, one dungeon, is mindnumbingly stupid.I got this game in a bundle and I still feel ripped off.A game from 2005 should not look so ♥♥♥♥♥♥, I mean we had Age of empires 3, Guild wars or Battlefield 2 in the same year and even WoW with its purposfully cartoonish graphics looked better.Now I'm not one who usually complains about graphic, but when the entire game is ♥♥♥♥..♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics on top of it are just the cherry.

												What's the shallowest most pointless RPG you ever played? This makes that game look like Baldurs Gate.  It's cute, but really, there's only a tiny number of quests repeated endlessly.  It's dull repetitive shallow as a dried up puddle.   I can't think of a reason to carry on playing.1) Only 4 quests, endlessly repeated.2) There is no story arc, you just get a random boss to kill at the end.3) There is only one town4) There is only one dungeon5) There are only about 10 quest givers max.This may not matter to you, endless inventory management might be your idea of heaven. For me? Nah, uninstalled.This might have been ok, 15 years ago, but really unless this has some nostalgia trip value for you, don't bother.  There are many action RPG games that offer so much more. Go play Van Helsing or Torchlight or something			"

Randomized levels, plenty of weapons and items to suit anyone and possibly the inspiration for games like Torchlight 1 and 2 and maybe even Diablo (don't quote me on that last part). It's cheap, at around $5. And it runs on just about any computer.Problem is, though, where the Wild Tangent version allowed plenty of modding, this version does not. Also, a lot of complaints about it crashing often on the forums here. Finally, with the official forums closing come January, looking for extra help won't be easy.Final thoughts?

												This game is MY favorite dungeon crawler, ever. I played this when I was 10 and man was it the greatest game ever, nostalgia man. But enough remincing, obviously people want an idea what it is about. You play as a kid and his companion trying to make your ""fate"". The main idea is enter a dungeon with unknown dangers and make a name for yourself by coming out alive. It's a pretty simple concept really, but the execution was very, very, good. If you aren't one for old graphics and a more classic gameplay style then you might want to stay away from this one, but for $5 bucks you can't really go wrong. It should bring you hours of fun and enjoyment. If not you only lost $5 which isn't going to kill you. So get it, and besides, your friends will all be like dude what the hell is that; then you can say you are playing a classic.			"

												Fate is a wonderful classic that I myself have enjoyed many years ago. I played Fate when I was a kid and I love Fate today. you just cannot beat a randomly generated Fantasy RPG with many rougelike elements. It includes a variety of magical weaponry and armor which you can make even more magical with gems as long as you have the sockets. There are even gigantic, ferocious demons, dragons and monsters that you can fight and conquer which all lead up to the great and powerful beast that resides deep, deep down within the dungeon that you must kill once and for all.

PositivesYou can create your own characteryou can send your pet to town to sell items and still keep on making your way through the dungeon.you can test your fate with anvils, fate statues, and learning stones that come up randomly in the dungeons.Negativeafter a while, the music can get on ones nervesit comes in full screen onlyOverall it is a good dungeon crawler game that you can play for hours on end .

												Awesome game, very original. Reccomended to anyone who like RPGs and any other type. If you are thinking about it,   GET IT[/b] . This deal is actually about 2 bucks off the WildTAngent price. and 8 bucks, TOTALLY worth it. Something happened to me while i was fishing, I caught a Angelic Wand which was worth 255000. Every level is diffrent, no two levels are the same. It is a game that never ends, even after you complete the main quest (which I ahve not beat, but why would the game go ""you beat this The End.""?)Also, there are infinite levels of the dungeon. You could go to level 999999 if you wanted to. The levels are not premade, there is a system that levels up monsters for each level. So it gets forever harder "

												A simply fantastic game. This was the first video game I ever played, and will always remain in my mind one of the best dungeon crawlers around. The sequels were alright as well, though not as impacting as the original. If you haven't played or heard of this game, I can't recommend it enough.			"

												This game was created over 10 years ago and it still remains fun and magical to me. Modeled after the 1996 hit game Diablo, FATE is a single-player dungeon crawler filled with mystical items and monstrous creatures. The goal of the game is to reach the 50th floor of the dungeon and defeat an ultimate ""boss"" monster. Along the way, you will pick up many fun magical equipment and spells to aid you in your quest.If you enjoyed playing Torchlight or Diablo, you will definitely enjoy this game.			"

												As an old-school gamer it's hard to admit that this great game flew under my radar.TL: DR- Buy it.Imagine a mix between Diablo-style gameplay ( random generated dungeons) and the quirky look of a Link game.You have Fate!This game lets you mold and blend a character and his / her attributes / skills etc however you like. Want a Wizard that dual-welds swords? Want a pole-ax welding warrior that can casts fireballs? Almost ( as far as I can tell) any combo of character is possible. How is this possible? Well...patience..See, as you progress through the game, you can always go back and clear a level of the dungeon again. This is grindy yes, but allows for those players with the patience and resolve to make a truely badass character. If you want to play through without back-tracking that's possible too. You also have a ""pet""; and this pet fills the role of protecter and Mule very well. You can, apparently, upgrade your pet by feeding it but I've yet to get that far. Very fun game so far. I will update review as I make progress. I bought this game for $8, and it's cash well spent! Rivscore 88/ 100 "

												An excellent action RPG reminiscent of Sacred and Torchlight. The sole dungeon is very deep and will be different for each character and all the items have a degree of differentiation, for example one Small Shield might have a defense of 4 while another might have a defense of 6.The Steam integration is a little buggy and the pet A.I. leaves something to be desired but I would still recommend FATE to any classic RPG fans.

												Although this game's graphics are proof that this game is slightly dated, the RPG elements and randomly generated dungeons with billions of unique items to supplement your game experience fail to disappoint. In addition, gambling with Zim could either sink your cash with horrible purchases or make a huge profit off of great items. Unfortunately, the quests given by the townsfolk are often monotonous and repetitive when you reach the lower dungeon levels and the items you recieve after completion are often worse than ones you have equipped. Overall, even though this game is rather old, the classic RPG game stylings create a nostalgic feeling even when it gets monotonous.			"

												This game is for those who enjoy RPGs, but dislike the tangled complexity of others. This game is a great, down to earth RPG in it's own right, with a lot of variety and diversity in the game itself.I myself have tried Torchlight II and Path of Exile, but these games do not come even close to Fate's originality and uniqueness. Fate has always had a unique edge to it; this edge is hard to identify at first glance, but it is there.With this game,even if you queue in just five minutes here and there, you will almost always be making progress. It's that good.Try the game yourself, and you'll see that this claim is not void. You can get a free trial of the game from Wildtangent.			"

Now, as an adult, I'm playing it again and it's almost as amazing as I remember it. It really has stood the test of time as far as graphics and mechanics go, and the voice acting isn't bad at all. The music is nice and simple and the game is really good at giving a dark atmosphere when you're crawling around in the dungeon. Though it has a rather simple plot, it's still a very enjoyable game and if you have the money to spare and have been looking for a new dungeon-crawler type of game to play, definitely give this one a shot!

												Played it's demo before in my childhood but didn't manage to finish it. Don't be fool by my game time i played it like for more than 12 hours and finished it. Fate is a simple and old game, it's a really fun dungeon crawler game.The NPCs gives 1-3 level high quest depending on what dungeon level you are on, which is really convenient if you are heading to the main quest dungeon. The bad part about it is that once you've reach a dungeon level you can't get the quest in the dungeon you are in or any dungeon below your current dungeon you've explored, some quest have normal rewards but others have item rewards, but in this case you can manage the quest that you wanted to do even though it is limited.The monsters in every level is different and they have different types of attacks, if you're making a summoner build you are going to die... a lot... so its best to cover up your character weaknesses.One of the best part in this game is that you are able to turn your pet into a monster( not like slime, goblin or anything that has 2 hands and 2 legs) by feeding him fish, the fish you fed to your pet have a duration of how long your pet can be turned into a monster, you can turn your pet into a monster permanently if you want. And yes you can go fishing in the game in town or in the dungeon if you're lucky you can get rare items just by fishing.Finally the skills in the game, there is no skill perk trees just old fashion Str, Dex, Vit and Int. But instead of a skill tree you can spend points on Weapon skills, Critical strike, Spell cast time, Attack spell level, Defence spell level and Charm spell level. You can use magic too, you can choose to buy them from a NPCs or explore the dungeon for it.9/10 my childhood is complete			"

												Fate is a great game even though it is old. Yeah there are some hard bosses, but even though it's pretty tough in some levels. You do get three options when you die which is great because you don't have start all the way back to town. There are town portals which makes it easier when you are doing quest or need more potion. You can replay dungeons to get more gold or more experience points. If you are thinking about purchasing this game its higly recommend.			"

This game is a great, down to earth RPG in it's own right, with a lot of variety and diversity in the game itself.I myself have tried Torchlight II and Path of Exile, but these games do not come even close to Fate's originality and uniqueness.

												With FATE now arriving to Steam, I figured I should share how great of a game it is! This is the precursor to Torchlight and Torchlight II. It's a very simple loot-fest with a never-ending and randomly-generated dungeon. It's an awesome game, it's easy to pick up and put down, doesn't require a lot of commitment or effort and it's very enjoyable. It now even has 1920x1080 resolution, which I'm pretty sure was a thing of the future when it was originally released. Some people are complaining about bugs with the Steam version, I've never had a problem with that one or the WildTangent download. This game is a classic, and it deserves no less than what I'm giving it. Amazingly fun and simple game, and very nostalgic to me and I'm sure a lot of other people that grew up with this game. It has tons of weapons, multiple skills to learn, and a great system to build your character towards a desired style. If you want to be a wizard, upgrade magic and the multiple magic skill perks. If you want to be a warrior, you can upgrade the type of weapon you want to use as well as your strength and dexterity. Tons of different ways to play it that will keep it interesting despite the very simplistic gameplay.It has insane replay value as everything is randomized and there are hundreds of different ways to play through it. The main goal of the game is to traverse the dungeon doing tons of quests until you reach a certain level deep down which contains the main boss (it will take a long time to reach this level). Then you kill it and you're then allowed to retire (or continue down the dungeon for eternity if you so wish), which locks your current character, but passes down (and empowers) an heirloom of your choice. For example, if you get the best bow currently in the game, defeat the main boss with it and pass it down as you retire, you will be able to start a new character with this, now even MORE powerful bow. And so on...Nothing not to love about this game, despite it's simplicity and lack of variety when looking at it materialistically, the game is just so damn fun to play I still play it to this day, along with it's other three successors: The Undiscovered Realm, The Traitor Soul, and The Cursed King, which by the way are all just as good!

												I'm a youngin', which means that my childhood games are right around this era. At 20 years old, I still enjoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of the games I loved when I was 10. FATE is one of those games.The graphics may leave some to be desired, but are not horrible for its age. The gameplay is spot on. Feeding your pet, having the pet go to town and sell stuff for you is a really cool feature. Combat is wonderful, no matter what style. I play using spellcasting/dual wielding tactics. I summon minions to take on the extra trash and tank for me, buff my pet and myself, and melee the mobs. It's quite a blast :) The story is actually pretty damn cool. I highly reccomend this game for anyone. It's challenging on higher difficulty, and easy enough for little kids on the easier ones. It's just downright, good ol' semi-cute dungeon-crawly fun. For 8 bucks, you can't pass this up. It's definitely worth it to get the bundle, too. Hell, get all the sequels, they're all killer :)			"

It isn't over complicated and offers enough different activities that you don't get bored doing the same task over and over.

												With that feel of the height of those dungeon crawlers at it's finest, as it was in this case, FATE is quite the game to play. With various of modifications that can be done to the game which are compatible with the Steam version, this game has some kicks that can pull you back right in. Of course, the game has its shortcomings, such as some load times that can seem less tolerable at times as well as the limited character customization, but it is understandable as this game is more of a port than a remake.

												A somewhat difficult Dungeon Crawling RPG when you're not paying attention, FATE is a well aged game (both graphically and gameplay wise) that has been in my life since I was still a little kid. I've always enjoyed playing this game from time to time, but I'd always have to restart, so with this finally on Steam and my account, I no longer have to worry about such things! If you're going to get FATE, I'd suggest getting all four games as you'll be able to transfer your character from the previous game into the new game, which is a bit like Mass Effect. On top of that, get it off here (Steam), and play relax a bit as you play it on and off. Eventually, you will evovle into a very powerful hero and will be able to look back at all of the things you've gone through.			"

												Hey all,I recently tried to play FATE after upgrading to Windows 10, but was experiencing the ""Application error"" issue. The solution that worked for me was to start the game in window-mode and make sure that the window-width and -height (including the border) were small enough to fit inside the screen’s set resolution.To start the game in window-mode go to ""C:\ProgramData\WildTangent\FateSteam\Persistent"" on your computer, open the ""config.dat"" file with Notepad, and change “FULLSCREEN:1” to:FULLSCREEN:0Also, ensure that “WINDOWWIDTH” and “WINDOWHEIGHT” in the config file are set to something that will allow the application window, including the border, to fit within your screen resolution. For example my brother’s screen resolution is 1366x768, so we put our values at: WINDOWWIDTH:1366WINDOWHEIGHT:725For some reason, if the window is set to a size where even the border is to the outside of the screen, it creates a graphical issue where the gameplay is located in a small box to the left corner within the application window. I hope this helps someone else. Cheers!			"

Modeled after the 1996 hit game Diablo, FATE is a single-player dungeon crawler filled with mystical items and monstrous creatures. The goal of the game is to reach the 50th floor of the dungeon and defeat an ultimate ""boss"" monster. Along the way, you will pick up many fun magical equipment and spells to aid you in your quest.If you enjoyed playing Torchlight or Diablo, you will definitely enjoy this game.			"

												This game is absolutely amazing, in my opinion.  I haven't played it on Steam yet as I just purchased it on here, but I did play the game when WildTangent first released it.  The game is fun and fairly unique, and it is hugely replayable as the dungeon and quests are randomized every time.  I would recommend this game to everyone I know, especially at the low cost (and even more so with the game on sale).  A couple of tips to anyone playing for the first time: the first thing you should buy is a fishing rod (you can fish in the town and in the dungeon, and sell some of the stuff for a lot of money), and, if you don't want a floor to ""reset,"" leave at least on crate/urn/jar/whatever unbroken/unopened/unactivated or leave at least one enemy alive.

												A very enjoyable game to play, FATE really brings out a creepy and sometimes jumpscare inducing atmosphere from using different sounds, monsters, and the overall gameplay.  The game also has a fun adventure styled gameplay, with quests, puzzles, and the overall ""Have to go farther"" sort of feel with the dungeons.			"

												A dungeon delver with... tons of armor and weapons, gems you can socket to extra damage or defense, orcs in town that can retrieve the gems or remove the gems in your favorite weapon or armor, your choice of a cat or dog pet, fishing that will transform your pet into lots of tougher creatures, leveling up that allows you to customize your character's strength, dexterity, magic, and vitality to create the character that you want whether it's a warrior, mage, archer, tank, or dual-wielding rogue, and even a shady character in a side alley that will let you gamble for elite gear.Sound familiar?  It should because this was the game that preceeded Torchlight and Torchlight 2.Developed by Travis Baldree, who recently left Runic Games to start his own project, FATE seems simple enough to play, especially for action RPG fans who have Torchlight in their library.  Delve deeper and you soon find you will need to think about your choices.  Strength isn't just the catch-all for warriors, you'll need to add points to dexterity or you'll miss all of your swings.  Dexterity isn't the catch-all for rogues because the quests put you up against tough boss monsters who will likely kill you if you don't beef up your other stats.An interesting twist not present in the Torchlight games is the concept of fate.  When you get quests, you are told what piece of gear you will need to retrieve from the dungeon and what you'll receive in return.  Once you get the gear, you can choose to keep it or turn in the quest for your reward.  The problem is you know the stats of the gear in your hand but you won't know whether the reward has better stats unless you turn the quest in.  It's a little bit of a Monty Hall problem.  In addition, turning in quests give you fame and as you gain recognition, you will receive 'fate points' that allow you to specialize in specific skills.  These are very specific right down to the type of weapon (hammer, axe, sword, etc...) or the type of magic (attack, defense, charm) you are using.  So do you keep the gear and miss out on your fame or do you go for door number two?You may have had the chance to experience a trial version the game many years ago if you happened to get a HP computer.  It works just fine on my Windows 7 x64 system, and you no longer have to deal with Wildtangent's scammy client that tried to make you pay by the hour.  I also like the variation and weapons and armor.  Like Torchlight, you get so see your new gear close up as you leave.  It's as fun to play now as it was back then.  Buy it!			"

												I remember playing FATE for the first time many years ago. It is one of my favorite games. Graphics don't even begin to compare to today's new games, but the game is so much fun that it doesn't even matter. I can spend hours scaling the dungeons. It never gets old. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for hours of fun at a good price. In the Steam version, the cheat console is missing, probably because the game includes achievements and the cheats would make getting all the achievements way too easy. This can cause a problem if one specific bug is encountered... I haven't seen it yet in this version, but in the past, when I played FATE, I remember getting caught in between two objects in such a way that there's no way to move. When closing this game, it saves EVERYTHING, including your EXACT position. That means if you encounter this bug and then try to close the game, your character is forever locked in a place where he/she will never be able to move from again. With the ""cheat"" console, you could type something in to relocate your character. In this version, your only option would be to use the task manager to close the game without saving and revert to your last save point.As long as you don't make the fatal mistake of saving and closing the game in an effort to escape this bug (if it will ever even be encounted in the Steam version), this game is a brilliant, procedurally generated game that will never get old.

I am glad Fate came to steam. I played this game long ago when it first came out, it was nice to revisit the game now as an adult.   Overall, the game is decent. Granted its not anything amazing when compared to its predecessors... but back in the day it was quite something. The fun in this game comes from the complete randomness and endless play killing waves of monsters while progressing deeper and trying to get the best set of gear you can.  It does have its flaws. Item skill point requirements are not well balanced and can make gearing up early in the game quite difficult. Fishing is almost required to get well geared, and the fishing mechanic is a bit buggy causing you to fail the catch even if you clicked in time to catch it. Perhaps the worst feature however is the chance to completely loose all enchantment on your gear when enchanting, I would not advise enchanting anything that you wouldn't want to lose... because you very well might.   I would recommend the game to anyone, it is good for at least 2 playthroughs. I'm not sure its worth the $8 price tag, i picked it up on a sale for much cheaper.			"

FATE is a nice game to sit and relax to, also very good for killing down time no matter how much of it you have, though the only thing that bugged me in the game was the fishing part.

												Awesome game, very original. Reccomended to anyone who like RPGs and any other type. If you are thinking about it,   GET IT[/b] . This deal is actually about 2 bucks off the WildTAngent price. and 8 bucks, TOTALLY worth it. Something happened to me while i was fishing, I caught a Angelic Wand which was worth 255000. Every level is diffrent, no two levels are the same. It is a game that never ends, even after you complete the main quest (which I ahve not beat, but why would the game go ""you beat this The End.""?)Also, there are infinite levels of the dungeon. You could go to level 999999 if you wanted to. The levels are not premade, there is a system that levels up monsters for each level. So it gets forever harder "

												(IMPORTANT INFORMATION BELOW REVIEW)Used to play this all the time. Lost the CD, found it again on Steam, and had a blast.What you've got here is a decent Diablo clone with a ridiculous amount of depth. There's lots of customization in the way of attributes, skills, equipment, a pet, and magic, and the game constantly rewards your efforts by allowing you to improve more and more in each of these departments. It can get quite difficult and hectic at times (seriously, why must I fight more than 10 enemies at once), so if you don't like the idea of teleporting back to the town every five minutes, micromanaging your armor based on stat bonuses, or bringing up your inventory a million times in one battle, this probably isn't for you. If you can deal with all that, then get it, install it, and ready yourself for one awesome, yet often overlooked, game.-----Now then, be warned, this game has its share of problems. I ran into a few in-game bugs, but none of them really broke the game or made it easier or harder. More important than that, there is a serious issue of some Steam users not being able to run the game, and while WildTangent (the devs) have made an effort to address this problem, there is still a relevant portion of people who have bought the game and just had it sitting in their library since. It isn't always necessarily the same thing giving everyone this problem as well, so what works as a solution for one person may not work for you. I got it working after a few months, but if you want to play it and have any doubts about whether you can run it, you probably want to read the forums and see what people, for their specific cases, have done in the way of trying to fix the problem.

												So while I only have 11.8 hours total in this game, (and have 100%'d it in that time, for those achievement hunters out there) I probably sank HUNDREDS of hours into this same game under WildTangent's own distribution method 8-9 years ago. This is a pretty slow-paced, single-player lite version of Diablo, if you want a TL;DR of what to expect.If it's not obvious, the game was released in 2005, and even with that being said some of what it offers still holds up pretty well. FATE: Traitor Souls is probably worth picking up if you enjoyed this game at all.Side Note: This was probably one of my very first videogames, would work really well as a present to a kid, as it's super simple, really family-friendly, and easy enough mechanically that even a technologically impaired adult could get some good fun out of it.

												I imagine Fate was hailed as something great when it was new because it can be great fun. This said, its sparkle has since been tarnished by the fact that it has been superceded by the Torchlight games. If you like those lightweight hack n slash type games you will like this. I wouldn't class these as RPG's though. 64%			"

												Decent graphics for a game its age, and quite a lot of bang for your buck given its relatively low price tag. That said, the story is essentially non-existent and the gameplay is pretty shallow - you basically just run through randomly-generated dungeons killing hordes of monsters while completing meaningless quests. Gameplay follows a pretty simple formula:- Go to town. Buy gear. Get quests.- Go to dungeon. Kill monsters. Find loot. Complete quests.- Go back to town. Sell loot. Get quest rewards.And then you more or less just repeat until you get bored. It's pretty standard dungeon-crawler faire.Now, if you really like generic dungeon crawlers and are a big fan of the action/RPG genre, you'll probably have fun with this game, though you might be better off going with something like Titan Quest if you want a bit more depth.In sum, FATE is a good game to pick up if you're just looking for a simple dungeon-crawler to play. It won't be the greatest game you play all year, but it won't be the worst either. All things considered, it's worth the $7.99 price tag.			"

												This is a classic dungeon crawler. There's not much else to say besides it can be very addicting. You basically get what you expect- You explore dungeons, killing everything in your wake with your faithfully companion (either a cat or a dog, your choice) while completing quests (that are usually just monster bounties) for the townsfolk. The graphics have even aged fairly well.8/10			"

												I'm a youngin', which means that my childhood games are right around this era. At 20 years old, I still enjoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of the games I loved when I was 10. FATE is one of those games.The graphics may leave some to be desired, but are not horrible for its age. The gameplay is spot on. Feeding your pet, having the pet go to town and sell stuff for you is a really cool feature. Combat is wonderful, no matter what style. I play using spellcasting/dual wielding tactics. I summon minions to take on the extra trash and tank for me, buff my pet and myself, and melee the mobs. It's quite a blast :) The story is actually pretty damn cool. I highly reccomend this game for anyone. It's challenging on higher difficulty, and easy enough for little kids on the easier ones. It's just downright, good ol' semi-cute dungeon-crawly fun. For 8 bucks, you can't pass this up. It's definitely worth it to get the bundle, too. Hell, get all the sequels, they're all killer :)			"

												A somewhat difficult Dungeon Crawling RPG when you're not paying attention, FATE is a well aged game (both graphically and gameplay wise) that has been in my life since I was still a little kid. I've always enjoyed playing this game from time to time, but I'd always have to restart, so with this finally on Steam and my account, I no longer have to worry about such things! If you're going to get FATE, I'd suggest getting all four games as you'll be able to transfer your character from the previous game into the new game, which is a bit like Mass Effect. On top of that, get it off here (Steam), and play relax a bit as you play it on and off. Eventually, you will evovle into a very powerful hero and will be able to look back at all of the things you've gone through.			"

												(IMPORTANT INFORMATION BELOW REVIEW)Used to play this all the time. Lost the CD, found it again on Steam, and had a blast.What you've got here is a decent Diablo clone with a ridiculous amount of depth. There's lots of customization in the way of attributes, skills, equipment, a pet, and magic, and the game constantly rewards your efforts by allowing you to improve more and more in each of these departments. It can get quite difficult and hectic at times (seriously, why must I fight more than 10 enemies at once), so if you don't like the idea of teleporting back to the town every five minutes, micromanaging your armor based on stat bonuses, or bringing up your inventory a million times in one battle, this probably isn't for you. If you can deal with all that, then get it, install it, and ready yourself for one awesome, yet often overlooked, game.-----Now then, be warned, this game has its share of problems. I ran into a few in-game bugs, but none of them really broke the game or made it easier or harder. More important than that, there is a serious issue of some Steam users not being able to run the game, and while WildTangent (the devs) have made an effort to address this problem, there is still a relevant portion of people who have bought the game and just had it sitting in their library since. It isn't always necessarily the same thing giving everyone this problem as well, so what works as a solution for one person may not work for you. I got it working after a few months, but if you want to play it and have any doubts about whether you can run it, you probably want to read the forums and see what people, for their specific cases, have done in the way of trying to fix the problem.

												This game was basically my childhood, and is still fun and addictive. There are many, many hours of varied gameplay available and the graphics aren't even that bad for today (Just... don't expect much out of it. It's no Diablo III). It plays like a dungeon crawler should - very variably - and is NOT a walk in the park. Overall, here's what I'd say are the pros and cons.Pros:+Varied monsters+Varied weapons+Good graphics for the time period+Large amount of content+Difficulty scales well (Easy is actually easy, while hard is actually very hard)+No overpowered items or spells+A nice cartoony look+Very, very easy to mod with a little knowledge of Javascript and Photoshop or GimpCons:-Faces look kinda messed up, limited character appearance customization-Less than stellar translations (From what I hear... I do not speak French or Spanish fluently enough to try Fate in either)-Occasionally annoying sounds (I'm definitely talking about the cat or dog. I'd recommend getting a fish to permanently transform them as quickly as possible)-Point and click style can get boring-Some... creative names can come up for bosses and for items (Like ""Zulgthar's Holy Bec de Corbin of Spite"" or ""Og the Facesmasher"").-Lack of interesting spells (They're the pretty cut and dry ""Fireball"" spells, ""Summon ______"" spells, and ""Raise defense"" spells typical of this genre. The only really interesting ones are the meteor one and the one that turns enemies to your side.)-Not for everyone. There are free trials for this game - use them. Decide if you like it or not before buying. It is dated, after all.-No online multiplayer of any kind-Not many in-game settings options-A bit of a confusing fame system. (You get skill points to spend for becoming more famous)-Some logical fallacies (Fishing in lava)Overall, even though numerically there are more negatives, the positives far outweigh the negatives for this game. If you haven't given this classic a try, go ahead and get the demo then buy the full game if you like it. I know I did, and I know that I've sunken hundreds of thousands of hours into this immersive fantasy dungeon-crawler. (I just got it for Steam, though)			"

												This is a fun, casual game that calls back to Diablo and Dark Stone. More kid friendly than the demon-haunted, slaughterhouse theme of Diablo, but with very little storyline. You go into the dungeon, kill the monsters, gather swag, gain levels, and raise your reputation. One of the more clever aspects is how you can continue the game as a descendant of your initial character, creating a family line of adventurers. You can lean back in your chair and click your mouse to adventure without needing to get too wrapped up in why you're doing it.			"

												the closest thing to old fashioned Diablo on Steam, is FATE. FATE is your basic Hack And Slash game were loot is the main part of the gameplay. other then that, expect a LOT of enemies and a lot of tough ones too. inventory managment is key, but no fret! unlike Diablo FATE has a pet system that can take stuff to town and sell em for you. the game is fun, but it can also be hard at times. make sure to do as many quest's as possible as leveling up as much as possible is key to survival. i give it a 9/10. i recommend getting all the games in the series, as there all fun and get better in many ways.

												Fate is pretty decent.  It's an RPG that could be considered the father of Torchlight.  Made a few years earlier, it incorporates a number of things that Torchlight did, particularly the use of the pet as both a beast of burdon and as an ally which is transformable by fish.  It has randomly generated dungeons, which is always nice, and has been produced well.  That said, I am finding it a bit boring.  As a fighter specialising in swords, I've found most of the drops to be magic-geared, or aimed at axe-wielders.  I'd say about 95% of the drops are of no interest to me at all, and this tends to make hacking your way through the levels a bit monotonous.I'm also finding it annoying that it is all too easy to die in the game, especially if you're focusing on what's happening on-screen.  The warning that health is low seems to come too late, so you end up having to divide your attention between the fighting and supervising the health bar.  The pet also seems to spend about 50% of its time fleeing.My last moan is that the resolution doesn't seem adjustable, and I'm finding that I'd like to be able to zoom out a little more and with more detail - many of the characters seem rather large and chunky, as though this game was aimed at kids.All said though, the game is cheap enough, and I bought my copy during a sale.  If you like RPGs, give it a go.			"

												Pros-Randly generated everything, you'll have an insanely hard time finding the same item twice-A great art style, very stylized without requesting much of your machine's power-A more simplified version of other games in it's genreCons-Repetitive.  This is the only negative tihng I can think of, which is quite rare for me.  The gameplay can be of an extremely repetitive nature, so if you expect a brand new and unique challege each time you turn the game on, you're never going to get it, the game deals it's hand very early on.

												Pros:+ Classic, fun dungeon-crawling gameplay.+ Countless hours of gameplay.+ A hefty amount of replay value.Mehs (possible cons and possible pros):== It's pretty much a relic of a game. The graphics, animations, etc. fit with its original release date.== The dungeon crawler experience in general can get a bit repetitive after so many hours. It doesn't vary a whole lot.== It lacks any sort of co-op gameplay. I personally believe that would've been a fun addition to the Steam version of the game.== They removed cheat codes from the game. You can still edit data files to cheat, however. Look it up if you're interested.== You need a lot of spare time on your hands to actually beat the game. When I say a lot, I mean a sh*t load.Cons:- Distasteful use of a semi-permadeath mechanic. Dying can really break you in differentiating ways, such as losing all of your gold, your experience, your place in the dungeon, or your fame. Considering how frequently you can die on even normal mode, you may end up just dropping the game.			"

												Playing this game when it came out was mind-blowing to me. It was such an addicting Action-Adventure, RPG, and Dungeon Crawler that I feel it was a little ahead of its time. After about 10 years since the game was originally out, I saw that it was on Steam so I had to get it to relive on my memories and see if it aged well. Sure enough, it aged really well for me and I still  love playing this game no matter. This is a game I can spent hours on and never get bored playing it.			"

												This game is pretty much the inspiration for torchlight. Its a simple dungeon crawl with randomly generated dungeons and randomly generated quests.This game isn't really story heavy so if you are looking for that then this is a pass for you. If you enjoy grinding for gear and spells and love hunting down random bosses in dungeons then this is your game.No game has ever made me more excited to get a new spell or new piece of gear. A true classic			"

												This game was my first RPG. Actually, the demo of this game was my first RPG, and let me tell you I sunk hundreds of hours into the demo alone. You could probably find better games of this nature out today (some of the developers of this game went on to make Torchlight and Torchlight II), but if you don't mind an older dungeon crawler with an infinite amount of procedurally generated content (for dungeon levels, item names and stats; you won't find wonky No Man's Sky creations wandering the levels of the dungeon) to sink some time in to, I highly recommend this game. If you want to play a simple addicting game that doesnt require you learn all the ins and outs of ""damage per second"" and secondary ""elemental"" damage systems then this is what you're looking for. On the off chance that you're a parent looking for a game for their kid to play, maybe to start them on RPGs, this would be a good start, with lovable characters, cute pets, and nothing too frightening for young eyes this game is fantastic.

												Wow I never knew they had this on steam. Bought it and as soon as I hit play, the nostalgia kicked in.  This game may be old, but it sure as hell is one of the best of its kind to this day. You never get bored as nothing is ever the same in each playthrough. Every time you play, the dungeon floors are different, the monsters are different, the loot you get is different, and the quests you get is different. So many ways to build your character as well. Buy this if you like RPGs and dungeon crawlers. You won't be disappointed with this.			"

												The FATE series is starting to show its age a bit.  But was a blast to play in its day.  And it’s still worth checking out if you’re a fan of Diablo-clones.  FATE might especially interest fans of Diablo II and the Torchlight series, considering its huge influence on Torchlight, and how the original developer from Blizzard North who was behind Diablo II and the developer of FATE are also the same people who later co-founded Runic Games and made Torchlight.  Besides borrowing heavily from Diablo II, Torchlight also inherited many things from FATE such as its drily humorous narrator, fishing, and pets; and even how the user-interfaces for a lot of those things looked and worked.  You might still be able to see some traces of that influence in later games today, even in some of the leading games in the genre such as Diablo III.  For better or worse, FATE also seems to have influenced Torchlight’s lighthearted and cartoon-like style.  That design-choice might put off some players.  But it also makes FATE a perfect game with which to introduce younger players to Diablo-clones if you have kids.  Yet despite how child-friendly FATE looks, it’s also quite an expertly made and well-polished Action-RPG deep-down once you get into it.  It’s really no wonder it was so influential.  I’d still recommend it overall to any fan of the genre, young or old.  You also needn't worry about having to get the whole FATE series.  The sequels mostly just add some additional content and include previous content in them.  Other than that, they essentially share the same engine and mechanics, all feel like the same game.  So this review can be applied equally to the whole series.  I personally prefer the first FATE a bit over the sequels, just for my own nostalgic reasons.  But I’ve also enjoyed playing them all.  So if you’re new to FATE, I believe you’re good to jump into the series wherever you want.(Note:  This review also replaces a previous review I did for the FATE series.  It was a more mixed review just to alert buyers to a potential issue a lot of users and me experienced trying to get FATE games to run OK under Windows 10, even after trying many workarounds which had worked for other users.  But as near as I can tell, the FATE series no longer has that issue.  I also recently tested the whole series again to make sure of that before I updated my review here.  It all installs without a hitch and is working fine for me now.)			"

												I've played this game as a kid and I was debating buying it again becuase I thought it wouldn't hold up to memory. Hell was I oh so wrong! Fate is a game anybody can pick up and enjoy.  Sit for hours and enjoy it yourself or with friends. This game is simply amazing and for the price i definitely reccomend giving it a try. It's worth it or money back. I promise.			"
