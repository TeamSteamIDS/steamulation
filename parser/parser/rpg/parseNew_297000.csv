												Do not buy this version. I'll let everyone make their own assumptions after this short review without pointing fingers to who does what (hint/hint).I instantly got interested in this version hoping that somewhat refreshed visuals might make an old gem look more visually polished. I was wrong. The difference is almost unnoticable and due to the downside of having only Restoration of Erathia instead of full package of 2 expansions with additional castle, items and limitless map generator, this purchase is not worth even 1/3rd of the price of full game on good old games site - http://www.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition which costs twice less by default.DO not buy Steam version. Save Your money and conscience, get GOG version. A few pixels more, no achievements, but whole package.As this is only 3rd of the full game which has nothing new in that third, it cannot have score of more than just a 3rd of a game.  3/10			"

												NOT RECOMMENDED. This game is an awful tease - I'd bought it on pure nostalgia value, but at the end of the day I felt pretty crushed when I found that there are no expansions included, nor will there ever be. Essentially, Ubisoft couldn't get the source code for the expansion packs (disappointing) and declared that programming them again from scratch would be too much effort (understandable). The dealbreaker for me is that the complete edition with all expansions is available very cheaply on Good Old Games - there's no reason to buy this when the old version is cheaper and gives you more content. For what it's worth, the ""HD"" update is exactly what it says on the tin but it's not what you're hoping for. Pretty much all the sprites used to create the game were re-traced and more detail was added. I respect the work that must have taken, but at the end of the day it still looks like the game from the nineties that it is. You wanted the gameplay - the exact graphics are more-or-less irrelevant to me.			"

												DON'T BUY~5$ cheaper at GOG and you can get a free HD patch through a quick google search~Very buggy~Multiplayer is buggy and not worth buying this product~Also the 5$ cheaper version is the FULL game with all expansions, this is the vanilla game with NO EXPANSIONSIn short its a worse product, it MIGHT get patched later but honestly this feels like a pump and dump for some quick cash, dont expect it to get patched later			"

												While I absolutely love the original game, which I´ve played since the release, this HD remake is quite a disappointment for several reasons:1. The graphics look like they were only scaled up and smoothed out. Meaning parts look blurry, lacking in detail, and horrible black borders around characters. 2. The colours seem to have been oversaturated in the process, making your eyes tired and sting when looking at the screen.3. The animation is painful to watch. Agreed, the original animation was not beautiful or smooth, but I expected that the movements might have been smoothed out - Instead they are choppier and clumsier than ever.4. There is no random map feature... which is what made the original game playable for 16 years. 5. E...ver...y...thing... Is... So. Slow. I play Dragon Age 3 on the highest graphic settings without any issues, but this HOMM3 HD remake lags as if I was playing online with a 64kbps connection. 6. Features missing, like for example hotkeys. I´ve always played this game using hotkeys, but now they can´t be used.7. Online multiplayer doesn´t work. The multiplayer functionality is one of the main reasons I bought the game, as it is cumbersome to try and set up the kind of networks that the original one needs to work, but now it feels like I wasted 15 euros on this game. TL;DRAs I loved the original game to bits I obviously had very high hopes for this remake, and I am sad to say that this version does not live up to the original and is not worth the 15 euros it costs. My recommendation is to seek out the original game and play that instead.			"

												Ubisoft, the only reason why they're not the worse company in America (EA Games) is because: they're not based out of America. Here's the Pros and Cons of this ""new and improved version of Heroes III""Pros:- ""HD""- It's Heroes IIIWell that was easy.Cons:- ""HD"" only improves pixel quality, with no improvements to compatibility to its framerates it may look ""nice"" at a standstill but who cares about motionless, sub-par ""HD""- No Random Map Generator that Heroes III Complete has.- No Conflux Race that Heroes III Complete has.- More expensive than Heroes III Complete, and it doesn't even have Random Map Generator nor Conflux Race among Other things. (The 2 expansions)- Buggier. Who the hell remakes a game only to make it buggier? Seriously. WTF.- Crashes more often. Same as above.- No Random Map Generator. That's a big deal you know. Those who havn't had it just don't know how much they're missing.Ultimately, would I play Heroes of Might & Magic III - HD Edition? Nope. Waste of Money. Heroes of Might & Magic III Complete is 9/10 times better. I at least hoped they would have made the HD versions online playability better but.... Thanks Ubisoft, I don't know what I was expecting. Obviously something better than this piece of crap.Let me say this again. Ubisoft is charging you MORE for this ""HD"" version that is missing not one, but TWO expansions. It is BUGGIER, crashes MORE frequently, and again, they had the GALL to charge  more for it. I've been disapointed before; but, this takes the cake.			"

												I am old. My first PC game purchase ever was Heroes of Might and Magic III. A Windows 95 CD-Rom with an instruction book on real paper and my PC was not even met the requirements. It was an amazing experience. Little figures on a map searching for treasures and fighting monsters was something I only knew from table top games and now happened live on my 14"" CRT screen.A whole world opened for me and since then I was really addicted to the Fantasy Turn Based Strategy genre.Later played the Warlords series, the Age of Wonders series and the Disciples series.Almost 20 years later I still have Homm3 installed on my PC and now and then I even met people with the same experience from this game and we play hotseat together a whole night.I still own the original homm3 box, the Shadows of Magic boxed edition, the Collector's edition and the GOG version and when I don't have one available when I'm somewhere else I pirate it for a moment. I guess that's legal because I own the game in four different versions.All this years so many progress is made by the real fans of this series to make the 20 year old title even better. We have VCMI, HD mod, Hota and so much user created content now that it is almost impossible to make a new edtion better then what is available fromt the community.Maybe the biggest reason for me to play this game all this years without getting bored is that every map I play is different and unpredictable. This is because a generator creating a different map every play. IMO a must for every strategy/RPG/Adventure game on the market. I do not like scripted games, predictable games or story campaigns so much because after playing it one time I lost my interest to play the same map again. Also it keeps multiplayer fair because this way the map cannot be learned by players so nobody have advantage of knowing a map better then you.Now imagine the best book you ever read and imagine a cheap B movie producer turns your book into a bad movie. That is exactly what happened with this version of Homm3 for me. The menu's of the game did not have any overhaul and are not fit in my laptop screen resolution anymore while the original 20 year old game does. For every click I make in the menu I have to wait at least two seconds while in the original game I misclick because the interface is so fast.I don't see any progress in interface or menu artwork and it's so much slower then the original. I don't understand this.All content after the original game came out like the expansions, the user created content, the new factions, the thousands of maps/campaigns and even the RMG (random map generator) is not there. It's just the base game and even the base game on GOG have more content because it's at least updated with bugfixes afterwards.The unique selling point from Dotemu is the graphics overhaul and Í have to admit that it is very nice to see that someone spend so many hours creating better looking monsters and heroes for my favorite game of all time.The units are cleaner and less pixelated on higher resolutions now and that is not bad. But they do not try something original or different so it's not amazing or surprisingly good. Just ok. In the town screens and on the map I cannot see any difference with the original and because every click is so much slower then the original game for me it's not worth the graphic overhaul.I bought the game just to support the graphic artist and to have a voice on Steam to write my review.I don't like the remake of my favorite game is not the perfect remake I can imagine. A remake IMO can never be a downgrade of the original. If you don't have original code from expansions you have to wait more time to release while hiring people from the community to make the perfect game or just don't touch it.It looks like a quick project to make cashflow for the company instead of a soul project led by people dedicated to the Homm series. That's something bad. "

												The game itself is a timeless classic and deserves a million thumbs up. But as of NOW, and for THIS edition of the game..Conflux, powerful combo artifacts, new map locations, and the random map generator will be missed, but the prospect of a smooth(?) multiplayer environment, where you won't have to experience ""can't connect, timed out"" to a computer 5 metres away meaning you don't spend 30 minutes just trying to get everyone into the lobby and God forbid anyone disconnects during the 4 hour session... Worth. Or so I thought....We're missing LAN - the only reason I (and probably you too, if you ever buy this) got this edition is because windows no longer supports IPX and all the problems that came with trying to start a session on TCP/IP. But no UDP? Not a gameplay issue and we are expected to play via steam, but still..Also, multiplayer got a new problem. There is this previously unheard of 5~10 sec 'loading' period at the end of EVERY HUMAN PLAYER'S TURN, where all animations freeze and you can't do anything, kinda like the little unskippable tune you had to hear at the beginning of every turn during hot seat, just more insane with no workarounds (and that tune served a purpose, like kicking your friend out of the room before he spied on you - this doesn't) - I have no idea what the game is doing while it throws me an hourglass but it wasn't and shouldn't be there. Most of us do indeed alt+tab during opponent's turns, but early game this practically doubles turn cycles.Please tell me they're patching the hourglass thing. Or I might go back to giving it fifty tries to play the game the old way.			"

												Just to clear things up before you start reading: I've played the original Heroes of Might and Magic 3 for over 2500 hours.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Wow. Just wow.It feels like Ubisoft loves to mess with their customers. Maybe that's the reason they keep doing it over and over again. Or are they just trying to beat EA for being the worst company in the gaming industry?! I guess we'll never know...- No random map generator. Long term motivation? NOPE! (Yes, I know that there is a map generator available, but it's not the randomized one I'm talking about.)- One fraction is missing.- No LAN support.- Both DLC's/Addons are missing.- [Bug] You have to click for every single moving point of your heroes. Having (e.g.) 100 moving points available will result in 100 clicks you have to make. - [Bug] Beside that, the map will reposition itself after every single step, so you have to ""re-aim"" 100 times as well - ON EVERY HERO, ON EVERY SINGLE DAY.- Considering the before mentioned things the price tag of 14,99 € feels like a huge smack in the face (I paid 9,99 € for HoMM3 Complete, including 2 discs).+ Overall better graphics, although the ""old"" version wasn't looking that bad tbh.+ Support for high resolutions.The only thing that would make this game more ridiculous would've been the integration of Ubisoft's beloved 30 FPS cap to make the game look more ""cinematic"".Conclusion: I was hoping to finally get my hands on a visually more appealing version of Heroes of Might and Magic 3. and I got f'ed hard. I really don't recommend anyone to buy this, unless Ubisofts comes up with some updates.Thanks, Ubisoft.			"

												I want a refund.  I bought this game to experience a classic with better graphics and smoother updated gameplay.  What I received was less content than if I loaded up my old version of the game, glitchy gameplay(to the point where I cannot scroll right on the map, but have to click on the mini map to move right), and ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE IN GAME APPEARANCE.  How can you put an HD tag on a game THAT LOOKS NO DIFFERENT!  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT A BETTER LOOK AT YOUR FAVORITE OLD GAME.  THIS IS A SCAM!  THEY TOOK THE OLD GAME, TOOK AWAY CONTENT, AND CHARGED A PRETTY PENNY TO EXPLOIT PEOPLES NOSTALGIA.  Ubisoft should be ASHAMED.			"

You have full authority to remake a game, you could have added some extra maps, new heroes, new artifacts, new enemies, new creatures.......BUT NO! You only make it in a HD version and demand a high price for a game that is not even with the 2 expansions OR all the chronicles!Dont even buy this on sale, get it here: http://www.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition and get the whole game for 8.99. Sure it's not HD, but you won't notice it. If 3DO still existed, they would be so offended by this pathetic ""HD Edition"".Sometimes, graphics is not the only thing important.			"

												Many years have passed since I played Heroes of Might and Magic for the first time. I still can EASILY RECOMMEND HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC III COMPLETE but unfortunately I can't recommend the Heroes III HD because there are no expansions... It's just the overpriced and poorly remastered standard game and it's missing many contents for example:-no random map generator,-no campaign editor,-no conflux castle,-not so many scenarios,and much more...In the store there was written something about a ""new multiplayer lobby"". Yep, its possible to play online but you don't have the working lobby (atleast me and my friend couldn't get it to work). You just probably need the IP from the guy you want to play with. You can play online like this in standard non HD version too.10/10 for Original Heroes III,4/10 for HD remake of Heroes III...You should buy somewhere original Heroes III with all expansions for a cheap price instead of this one.

												I have no idea how they managed to do it, but leave it to Ubisoft not only ruin a great franchise, but somehow, take a great game, make very minor changes and still somehow, make it terrible. The Fps is a bit off, it stutters, it's annoying, it's ugly. I can run Rome 2 total war a lot better than this game it seems. Unskippable Ubisoft logo at the intro, like they are proud of it somehow, though that can be modified out of the game by changing the files in the game folder.The music, instead of continuing where it left off like in the original, restarts now everytime the music changes. Walking in a grass field, cue the beginning of the grass theme, go to a city, cue the beginning of the appropriate city music. Needless to say it gets very very annoying to hear the same part of the same song every few minutes. Always the beginning of the song, always. You never spend that much time looking at your city, or walking your hero, so you never really hear the whole song, only the beginning. I get the idea that listening to a song from the middle can be a bad idea, but when the music is constantly changing, the old style fade in and fade out, and starting where you left off just worked so much better and just felt so much more right. Pressing space to visit the location you are standing on got dropped out as well. If you take a wrong portal, you are forced to spend movement going out of the portal and back in. Same if you happen to end your turn and the week on a mill. No idea why they thought that was an ability that had to be removed. I have heard rumors that cheats work in multiplayer, I haven't checked it myself, had trouble playing online. It's not working as well as I hoped. The achievements are, to put it lightly, uninspired. There are no fun achievements to chase, as in Crusader Kings II or Europa Universalis. They are all like this: Beat this campaign, beat that campaign, beat this campaign. That's not really fun chasing those achievements, the campaigns may be fun to play, but the achievements are not even flavoring, they are just there so they could put ''Achievements'' in the description.  Was it absolutely impossible to have a achievement like ''Have every type of dragon in your army'' or ''Win a battle with only seven dwarfs''? Yes. Yes it was. That would have meant that they would actually had to put some work into the game.There... that's what's wrong with the base game. I know they didn't include the expansions, so i'm not complaining about that, since that was never advertised.In summary: It's lazy, it's buggy, it's bad. Ubisoft should just start working on games for tabloids and phones, because that is clearly what they want.			"

Second thing is price which is riddiculous for just base game with no expansion packs. If you dont care about improved graphics then just buy HoMM3 Complete from for example GOG.com. Your choice.Third. Game has quite high requirements( it's not a problem but still very unusual)In conclusion it's still good old HoMM with extra bit of better textures(i think difference is quite visible) but the price and problems with starting the game and lack of support for old mods might keep away hard fans of the series			"

												I bought this for the nostalgia factor. I wanted to see an updated version of a childhood classic. Instead the game is missing key parts, such as the random map generator. Is it playable? Sure. But sometimes I want a random map to play around with, not one of the premade scenarios.The graphical update is minimal, and honestly, laughable. Just a few changed monster designs and a quick polish to icons. you have to be looking for the differences to find them, it doesn't stand out. Its not worth the bullet point given to it in the product description.Will I play more of this? Yes, just so I can feel like I've gotten my money's worth out of it. But your money is better spent at GoG where you'll get the orignal game plus both expansions (which is what we're all looking for anyway). But I will say, it is fun having access to the map editor again.			"

												Guys, Guys, Guys. Hold up before you buy this.First of all, I LOVE this series. I grew up with it as a child, and I distinctly remember playing both heroes of m&m and heroes chronicles which I got when I was 4.When I saw this in steam, my heart leapt with joy! Not only could I relive some joyful childhood memories, but others could as well. This product didn't cut it. Its not so much the random map generator. If this game was finished and you were really that concerned about this aspect, you could have hit up gog.com for the full complete non hd version. That version still has a working map generator, and you could generate your maps, save them, and transfer them over to this game.You COULD possibly do this IF this game was FINISHED. Its not. Its missing both its add ons, which is a real dissapointment for me. It makes it so much less enjoyable; less enchanting than its original predecesor. It also makes it impossible to use the map generator or any maps you may have made as a kid using your original game copy (I have a original game of Heroes 3 on cd, and none of the maps I generate or make on that game copy work with this).While this game is hd, its not heroes 3. I recomend the following replacements:Heroes 3 complete edition: Located at gog.com. Just make an account and follow the steps, its not that hard. Comes with all add ons and random map gen.Also for the heck of it, Heroes Chronicles: mini game series based around heroes 3 which in my opinion gave a much more in dept storyline for people not invested in the history of heroes of might and magic to follow. Meaning, it starts you off with a charecter (Tarnum?), and you get to see his life play out from the beginning. Also located at gog.com. Only catch is that you may have to buy all of the games to get the full experience of Heroes 3 (landscape and castle/creature wise) and I dont currently know how much it costs.Sad that I have to give this a thumbs down but... well I cry because I care.

There are only about 25-40 scenarios, and half of the campaign is not in the game because the DLC's are missing. I don't recommend you to buy this game. Buy it on gog.com, cheaper and 100% better!

												Old version, nothing new, weird bugs (mostly audio tearing). HD looks like a photoshop filter instead of improving details. Colors look way too shiny. Its a gimmick to make 15 bucks, buy it on GOG and get more champaigns, more maps, more units, and the random generator - the things that we expect from HMM3.			"

												Don´t get fooled by this So called HD Edition. It is the same with less content and more bugs then the old one. No extra settings, no extra maps, NO EXPANSIONS. Just a big pile of NOT INCLUDED, NOT IMPROVED. You could just as well play the old one. The upscaled resolutions looks bad and destroys more then it helps.Ubisoft! Have you heard of the word EFFORT? Cuz in this piece of crap ReRelease there is NONE what so ever...And yes, it is true, this version contains more bugs the the old one.			"

Genre:Turn-based strategy.Gameplay:+No UPlay 3rd Party software needed/installed.-Multiplayer is DEAD or not working!+The original Complete Edition is the greatest turn-based game made in history, wonderfully made.+Extreemly fun & addicting resource finding thru a turn-based Fog of War exploration.+Basic & fun resource crafting.+Single hero play that leads battalions around the mythical world and into battle.+Hero controls battalions, their abilities & spells, and hero can cast spells as well in battle.+Most scenerios are Kingdom conquering objective, but there are other game-winning objectives in other scenarios. +Town barracks building & upgrading.+Large number of creatures & unique abilities.+Enjoyable Hexal-style battling.+Spellcasting tree with many spells to choose from.+Massive amount of gear & world items.+Multiple unique civilization factions to choose from.+Multiple scenarios in campaign mode.+Multiple AI factions can be played against in one game.+Original Complete Edition had random map generator making re-playability endless, this version does not include it!+Has Local Multiplayer Hotseat sharing same PC.Difficulty: +So many scenarios the range of difficulty is yours to choose from, making the game extremely enjoyable.+One of those games you can jump into and have very little of a learning curve, making it very fun!Replayablity:- 0/5 None.- This remake version is NOT worth playing at all due to reasons listed below.+ Original Complete Edition would be a 4/5 often replayability.Overall Rating:☆☆☆☆☆ 0/5 Stars - Skip.-This version has no expansion packs and missing big chunks that made the game great.-The fans (and new users) wanted only the original Complete Edition version with Steam multiplayer and tournament ladder stats - Ubisoft did NONE of these, making the game pointless, irrelevant and rubbish!-Here you have half a game and no multiplayer, and yet sold at a ripoff price!-Cheaper and Complete Edition avail. on GOG[www.gog.com] and you can play multiplayer thru the 'GameRanger' servers (along with epic games like 'Rise of the Witch King').-Alternative recommendation on Steam is the game 'Darkest Dungeon' which gameplay elements are inspired by this game and yet maintains it's own original identity. ----------For additional game reviews please visit: http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordOfDarkFlame/recommended/ "

												I will preface this by disclaiming I have been a huge fan of HoMM2 and HoMM3 since I first played the HoMM2 demo, before HoMM3 was originally released.For Singleplayer and LAN-Multiplayer, instead of this version I recommendHoMM3C = Heroes of Might and Magic: 3 Completeavailable at GOG.com drm-free and includes both official expansions (Armageddons Blade and Shadows of Death) for Heroes of Might and Magic 3. And you can find fantastic mods such as WoG ""Wake of Gods"" and HotA ""Horn of the Abyss"" to add further depth to your game.I have played HoMM3C for thousands of hours over the past 15 years.I have played (and spent countless hours attemping to play) HoMM3C over Hamachi(no longer works afaik) and GameRanger (very buggy for me, always had trouble).I purchased this version knowing it was just RoE without the expansions.The reason I wanted this was for the MULTIPLAYER on steamworks! FINALLY!!! (HD is nice too)But... There are so many problems...I do not completely agree with all the negative reviews, which seem to have come from those clueless about what they are actually buying. (Yes we know the EXPANSIONS NOT INCLUDED, they lost the source material apparently, which is a tragedy but you can't give this a bad review just for that when they tell you exactly that in the first place. Though I have to say I had hoped for a little better delivery on the multiplayer (which is the entire point of this version for me) and to a lesser extent the user interface (there is an HD-mod that is made for the old HoMM3C version which helped by adding buttons to transfer all items or units (except last 1) to another hero) and a button for purchasing ALL AVAILABLE TROOPS in a town.Cons:-Highly addicting gameplay that will absorb years of your life...-Bad reviews-Multiplayer requires port forwarding (come on, this is 2015...)-Multi-player is buggy, disconnects, cheats etc-DOES NOT INCLUDE TCP/IP LAN multiplayer (IS INCLUDED in HoMM3C version)-NO STEAM WORKSHOP-Missing all expansion content (known when announced, mods will help if developers allow)-No quick transfer/purchase buttons (I know this is only in the HD-mod, but get with the times)-Multi-display is buggy, I mouse right out of full screen mode, which minimizes instead of just scrolling across the map as I intended.Pros:-Highly addicting gameplay that will absorb years of your life!!!-Steamworks multiplayer-Hotseat multiplayer-Thousands of gameplay hours-HD graphics (supposedly 30000+ hours of retexturing)-Community modders converting expansion mapsHopes/dreams for the future:-NO PORT FORWARDING in multiplayer-Workshop support-Expansion content(community reverse-engingeered if it must be!)That said, I am still very much enjoying this game again. The lack of buttons to 1 click-transfer units/items or purchase all available troops are SORELY MISSED. So I will probably go back to the HoMM3C version with HD mod when not attempting to play multiplayer.I really want to give this a positive review, and will do so if they manage to fix the issues that plague multiplayer and user-interface.The ball is in your court development team!

It does not make you fall off your chair breathless.Multiplayer keeps crashing, and some game mechanics are odd. Spells in particular.A lot of content is missing.Instead of pleasing Ubisucks, buy the GOG complete version of this game. Then just add the community made HD mod.Costs about half the price, and you'll get so much more content.Either refund me so I can do the same, Ubisucks. Or add the expansions and fix the current issues. Until then I won't recommend this version of HOMM 3 to anyone.			"

												The biggest fail of all: no random map generator - that which kept so many of us fans playing for years and years. How can such an important part of the game be left out? Does Ubisoft have no idea what the fans have been doing all this time? Second place: having to click for each step that the hero takes. Is that a joke? It is made worse by the map being repositioned after each step, so we have to move the cursor again and again. Movement takes ages as a result and it seriously diminishes the enjoyement of the game. As far as I can tell, there is no option to change this in the options. Third place: no LAN function. This is what became apparant in just the first few minutes of playing the game. Who knows what else is wrong with this game...A waste of money, essentially.edit: fixed typo			"

												No random map generater, with no announced plans to even attempt to rebuild one. Regret pre-ordering it with all my heart, although this game was one of the foundations of my childhood, even the nostalgia doesnt make up for the massive let down this release was. I find it extremely hard that a team of lawyers, the size and quality that unisoft has, would have let the purchase go down without getting the source code for the DLCs along with the base game, pinned onto the fact that it obviously exists somewhere if somebody is still selling full copys of the game. Tl;dr Its not even worth the nostalgia.			"

If you try to make a HD version of an awesome (and nostalgic for most users) game, atleast put some more effort into it.			"

												It breaks my heart to give this game a negative rating, but Ubisoft has made another crap decision with the Heroes franchise.HOMM5 gave me some hope after 3DO and New World Computing tanked; the art style recalled the lightheartedness of Heroes 2, the town screens were gorgeous, and it seemed like they put a lot of thought and effort into building a new world for the franchise. Now, I'm starting to think it's actually because they have no respect for the old one.I grew up with HOMM 1 - 3; my parents still spend hours and hours every week enjoying the GOG version of Heroes 3, which includes the Armageddon's Blade and Shadow of Death expansions. As excited as I was for this re-release, after having actually taken it out for a test drive, I have to recommend the GOG version over this mess by quite a wide margin.Firstly, it's just the original game, with no expansions. That makes the current price tag a bit steep, considering what you get with the GOG package (which is also DRM-free and doesn't require a client to play). Secondly, every supposed ""improvement"" they've made comes at the cost of an established feature: Pressing the space bar no longer allows you to revisit locations atop which your selected hero is currently standing, for instance, and lots of other hotkey shortcuts are absent, as well. Gameplay is often jerky or strangely slow despite the high requirements for such an old game. Some in-game art has been poorly remastered and looks stark and out of place against unaltered backgrounds, creating an overal effect like someone lazily went through and applied Photoshop filters to existing elements. The multiplayer barely works, and then not very well. Perhaps most telling is the absence of the trademark random map generator, which was a highlight of the franchise and one of the things that continues to make HOMM3 playable decades later.I really played this re-release up to my family and friends, all of whom are fans of the series, but now I'm wishing I had my preorder money back. I feel like the game is not at all as advertised, much in the same way that Ubisoft failed to tell anyone that their proprietary U-play client was required to play Might & Magic X.Painful though it may be, file this ""HD remake"" in the garbage along with Heroes 6.

												Love this game very much and remember playing the original+expansions as they released.  The biggest problem of this game is that it's $15 for the very first game without either expansion included.  The ""HD"" isn't extremely noticable and certainly not another $15 worth especially since it doesn't come with the expansions.  Sadly i would not recommend this product to anyone, just look for the original ""Heroes 3 Complete"" (they use the complete picture for one of the adds kind of false advertising if you ask me) and buy that instead.  I would absolutely ammend this review in a more positive light if they add the expansions in a patch but for now it's not worth it unless you get it for less than $2.			"

												This game is Heroes 3 only with no expansions and som slight graphical changes, that looks pretty sweet atleast. The problem is that it is only the original game which makes it not worth it really. I am however convinced that adding the 2 expansions will revive this game to it´s fullest. The only problem is that there seems to be some sort of issue with the graphic engine and HD that makes the fps drop at times but it isn´t something that bothers me, it doesn´t happen very often.Unfortunantly it wouldn´t surprise me if ubisoft throw in the other dlcs with super ""HD graphics"" for another 14 euro each, cause thats the only reason splitting this game up like this, to milk as much money as possible, right?To summary this I would first like to point out that I really like the game a lot but considering the dlcs are missing and there is no random map generator it´s just Heroes 3, but less. Also the high price tag makes it a goof and even less worth it.Edit: To be honest the only reason I am playing this is since I already wasted 15 euro on it so I might aswell ""get my moneys worth"" out of it. You really should consider the old version instead.			"

												I do not recommend this game. The game looks nice, but the performance isn't as good as in the original one. It feels clumsy and it looks like there has been some parts of the animations removed. I especially enjoy the performance and the polishing in older games like this, but in this version i do not get the satisfaction of everything working perfectly. And also the fact that this doesn't have the expansions is a big minus. Sure, i knew it already when i was buying this game that there is only going to be the original game. But still it feels stupid that they did not include the expansions. I have always played this game with the expansions and now when playing without them, it feels like there are a lot of content missing. And what disgusts me, is the idea of the expansions coming later as dlc.I really wanted to like this because i have enjoyed so many hours playing the original one. But in a game like this, i don't feel that the most important thing is the good looking hd graphics. For me it is the game itself and how the game performs. In this state of the game i will continue playing my old copy and feeling sad that i wasted 15 euros for this.			"

But this HD Edition looks like they smoothed everything with 16x AA.The Unofficial HD Mod fixes many gameplay problems with the original game, including the mouse lag, which is not fixed on this Steam HD Edition.This is the most barebone Heroes 3 experience you get, with a new paintjob. I can't recommend this. Multiplayer doesn't work, the mouse lag, no random map generator. Really just get the Complete version from gog.com.

												I'll start by saying I'm a huge fan of the series. I own every HoMM and every expansion and DLC 1-7. That being said, I do not recommend the HD version of the game. My wife bought 2 copies so we could play together. Without a LAN feature (which was removed for this version) we were forced to play using the steam online mode, and after disconnecting a few seconds ino the game several times, even after forwarding all relevant ports, we swapped back to the Heroes 3 Complete from gog.com ($10 and includes all the expansion with no DRM).The HD graphics upgrades are nice, and are undeniably better then the original graphics, however, the new set of problems (crashes) and lack of several features present in the cheaper non-HD version do not allow me to give a pass for this game.If Ubisoft releases the expansions in HD, or heck, even just fixes the disconnecting issues then I may be able to change my recommendation.I do appreciate the effort to modernize such a great classic as Heroes of Might and Magic 3, it truly is a masterpiece of a game. Playing through the single player campaign in updated HD will surely be a treat when I get around to it, but don't expect the multiplayer feature to work well in this mode. At least not as of this writing. The hotseat feature still worked fine, however.			"

												This is a waste of money.I fail to see what's so ""HD"" about it. Everything looks the same to me. In fact, banners animation on Castle townhall is more smooth in the original. I guess the only ""HD"" about it is that the game runs on big resolutions and sprites are scaled (and retouched a little) accordingly. And no addons.Well - that's not enough. For me at least.Maybe they'll fix something in update, but I doubt it. I bet they'll rather make another ""HD trilogy"" or something.			"

												First off, this is not the complete edition of heroes 3.Which means no certain campaigns and most importantly, no random map creator.For someone who wants a quick, (or sometimes even long) balanced match, which has a new map everytime, this version is not recommend. The HD may be useful for high resolutions and windowed gaming, but it doesn't make a real difference visual-wise.So if you own the original complete edition on CDs or can somehow get it, do that. Ubisoft should not get too much money, especially not for this thing they're doing here.			"

												Wow, this is quite possibly the laziest, money grubbing re-release I've ever seen. I say money grubbing because the motivations behind rereleasing this very popular older game were NOT based on nostalgia or undertaken by anybody who cared about the game in the least. This game is NOT HD, there has been no effort in updating the graphics, and they did NOT release the complete edition of the game (meaning they want to grub more money for expansions later). This level of laziness and general disregard for the consumer in this re-released title should not go unnoticed. Whoever was in charge of releasing this game should be fired.TLDR: ♥♥♥♥♥♥ company releases update of game that is worse than the original. Do not buy and I want a refund.			"

												Been playing HOMM 3 on and off for 15 years now, still love it, even though it's a dated game, the core mechanics of it still gets me excited to this day. I mean, who wouldnt? Adventurous graphics, the amazing music composition is still better than most games I've ever played, it just gives the game more depth, it gives every scene - terrain, base and combat their own distinct feel to it. The GUI is very well made, especially compared to other games from its time period.But this HD edition just comes a bit short in my opinion, without the expansions this game just feels incomplete, the only reason I bought it is because it was on sale and I havent played all the way through the original campaign and I thought it could be fun to experience it in HD. And hopefully (call me naive) if enough people buy the game, they will finish what they started. Even though I wouldnt count on it, after all, it is Ubisoft that now owns this franchise, sadly.I see a lot of people complaining about no random map generator, the first thing that annyoed me was the simpler things like if you upgrade a dwelling in your base, you cant buy the non-upgraded creature from said dwelling anymore. This is because this was a feature first implemented in one of the the expansions. Not to mention that Conflux base is missing, and every custom game map from the expansions, which, I guess only makes the fact that no random map generator is present even more frustrating for people.In conclusion: Pick it up on sale if you want it, it's not worth the full pricetag. Otherwise just get HOMM3 Complete on gog.com, the graphics really does not feel that much greater to be honest. So I guess its a thumbs down on this remake - which I absolutley love...			"

												This game was the first one I have played on PC so seeing it on Steam made me HYYYYYYYYYPE. However, it is far away from what original game offered you.Enemies/Castles/Heroes: Poor, Conflux castle still not added after such a long time. Heroes - limited from the original one, enemies - same problem, will take me too long to tell how many Ubisoft did not include from the original game.Gameplay: I have that issue of enemies spawning in quite vast numbers randomly on the map. That leads to my heroes blocked out by hords of griffons(or any other creatures) which are preventing me from getting to key locations. There is still no random map option(where computer generates new map completely different to others, in case you have completed all the maps, which I have done in the past).Very lazy, can't say graphics(""HD EDITION"") make it different from the original version. Do not recomend, the only reason I bough it is because I love this tittle. Far far below from final gameof the Heroes of Might & Magic III.			"

Random various lags, especially when scrolling around. Space doesn't seem to retake water wheels, windmills, creature dwellings etc (tried like every button on my keyboard so feels like this is removed. Because of this scouting hero might get stuck in teleports and also you lose movement for nothing).No random scenario option for non-campaign games.As this version of the game sits, I strongly recommend playing non-HD version of HoMM3, until this works like a charm and expansions are also in HD.

												Let me start this by saying Heroes 3 with its expansions and other additions is one of my favorite games of all times. This game isnt it. It might keep you busy playing campaigns, skirmishes and doing steam achievements for a bit but its lacking what made this game great the expansions which add too much content to be excluded in this HD version of the game.I have played it over 50 hours and I havent had any issues or crashes, it works fine and looks very nice on my big screen, but it saddens me that I have to give this one a thumbs down since apparently they ""lost"" the source code for the expansions. Playing it full content with both expansions over the HD version will make you forget fast this one was ever released.			"

												This is barebones vanilla HoMM III, so for anyone who got used to all the improvements brought on by the add-ons and the excellent HD mod it's basically unplayable. The moment I pressed space to re-enter a structure and nothing happened I knew this was a pointless purchase.I'm not really upset about the lack of Conflux, this faction was hastily put together and hilariously op in most situations. But no AB and SoE means none of the best maps and no RMG. For more sp-oriented people there's also no additional campaigns, which were vastly superior to the ones from RoE (especially the AB campaigns are the peak of the series).Seriously, just buy the Complete edition, slap the HD mod on it (apart from increased resolutions it actually improves the game by adding some great functionality, like automatic force transfer between armies for example) and you'll have yourself a vastly superior game for a lower cost.I can only recommend HoMM III HD to people who want to replay the RoE campaigns and feel the urge to do it in ""HD"" that is strong enough to make them pay 15 Euros for it. In other words: I cannot recommend it to anyone.			"

I hope the other parts of this game come out, and we're not charged ridiculous amounts of money for them (but what are the chances of that) all I can say is that if my disk drive was working, I'd be playing this game on the original disk.

												Okay, I'm a very very Heroes 3 fan, I mean look at my icon ITS MONERE. And guess what's not included with the HD remake, oh I don't know.. MAYBE MONERE'S TOWN?!Cons FOR ITS PRICE:66% of campaign content.1 Less factionLess artifactsLess HeroesIf they do release the expansions, they'll probably charge for them too. I would really hate thatPros:Play it on a tablet!Screen is nicer than the HD edition, but its not a big differenceSteam multiplayer is easier to configureMeh:New sprites but same amount of animated frames, so not actually smoother visually because its still choppy.Same framerate cap meaning, not really a bad thing, but its not a good thing either.Achievements on steam?Doesnt work well with mods, I group this is meh, because many people don't know of the mods for the game, but there are some pretty awesome ones out there that can make the game even more fun which is kind of scary, because this game is amazing already.I'm not being biased because the conflux isn't in the game, what I am upset over, is that its more expensive for less content, and it's not just a little bit of content, it is actually about 50% content missing in comparison to the Complete version on GoG. I'm saying about 50% because if you play all the campaigns and every campaign is approximately 3 maps, you have 18 maps, with the expansions theres another 13 campaigns for 39 maps and you even get an extra town, see why its 50%? Heck, it's even more, I'm just being generous. On top of that for single scenario allows random generated maps, which make multiplyaer fun. Without random generated single scenarios multiplayer because different because you have to choose a premade map, that one of your friends know like the back of their hand and it creates unfair advantage.Now, for what the HD edition does offer some screen size changes and whether or not you want it on fullscreen or not, but the hd mod covers that, the only good thing is everything technically being stretched which makes the game more comfortable. I guess this does support tablet play which is nice on the go, I would play this on a tablet, but even then the expansions could have been released because its just more space at that point. Space on a tablet isnt an issue considering modern storage devices. The sprites are new and fresh in order to preserve the appeal to the game which is fine, its not amazing because the animations arent more fluid but I am impressed in how they buffered things without making them look like a different game. I guess steam makes multiplayer better, but you dont play with random people ever, this is a game of friends and betrayal and jolly cooperation.			"

It's almost as bad as Konami with their Silent Hill 2 and 3 remakes.Please, if you own the rights to a beloved franchise and plan on doing a remake; first, get people who love the source material. Second, make sure they know what they're doing. And third, give them enough time to make it good. Pretty please?The ordinary Complete edition is still the way to go, retail or on GOG.com.

												This game is FANTASTIC, but the port is aweful, read on:""HD"" means these are the same sprites - they upscaled them so they look less pixelated.For those who know the game well, please note:-does not include expansions :.~***does not come with a random map generator***~no extra maps~conflux seems to not be included/working+does include the map editor, easilly accessed on start upThere is no reason anyone should pay over 2$ for this port-garbage. Get HHM3 Complete game and enjoy the goodness (and a reasonable price) through  GOG [www.gog.com]   and using  Game Ranger [www.gameranger.com] to play with your friends PLUS, there are tons of lobbies set up on GRanger for the multiplayer experience (or to easilly play with your friends). Don't support a broken game!This is a really awesome game that I love dearly, but they really half-donkey'd this one guys.			"

												The game is good. Its one of the best games I ever played. But this HD remake has little to offer other than steam surportand easier multiplayer than the original Non-HD version. It actully lacks the originals Expansions! the old game can be modded to just as good HD as this and with the expansions. The old has more maps. Players has made way more custom maps for the Non-HD version. Only a few maps can be imported to the HD version exactly because the lack of expansions.. and the old game is far cheaper than this...In short, No. This game is not worth it over the Non-HD version.Dont buy this until the expansions comes IF they come.

												Pros:- The graphical update is really good overall. Most of the original sprites were faithfully redrawn and apart from a few missteps (some towns look like cheap 3D models on the adventure map, a few unit card backgrounds look like they were merely touched up with an upscale filter).- You can swtich between the updated and the original look.- The game itself is H3 Restoration of Erathia in its fully original form as it was released back in 1999... nostalgia!- There is an HDE mod which introduces some features from the expansions: you can revisit structures without moving your hero by pressing Space, if you also own the original H3 Complete you have access to the random map generator and expansion scenarios can be converted from the original game too.- Steam multiplayer functionality.Cons:- The game itself is H3 Restoration of Erathia in its fully original form as it was released back in 1999... and that means that you don't get the content from the two expansions (Armageddons Blade, The Shadow of Death) and Heroes Chronicles, the 8 episode campaign expansion. Overall you lose a lot of stuff compared to H3 Complete (around 70 campaign missions, countless scenarios, a lot of heroes and artfiacts), a game you can pick up for 10 bucks on GOG.- The sounds and the soundtrack were not remastered.- The pre-rendered cutscenes have a noticably lower quality than what you see in the original game.- The user interface of the original game was not improved in any shape or form. This is a letdown as the UI is fairly archaic compared to modern standards and you have access to a mod called HoMM3 HD for H3 Complete that not only adds widescreen functionality with XBRZ image scaling (nice, sharp image quality) but also expands the original UI a lot. Compared to H3 Complete with the HoMM3 HD mod installed the game is a chore to play sometimes because of this.- No extra content. This may seem like a weird one to appear among the negatives but it would have been nice to get something that is exclusive to the HD Edition, a new campaign for example.Overall this is a serviceable remaster that loses most of its appeal because of the missing content, the lackluster UI and the fact that the original version has a large community that spent almost two decades of improving and expanding an already fantastic game. If you really like the new graphics or you desperately want to play multiplayer through Steam then pick it up but under any other circumstance just steer clear of this release.			"

												I only got this game because it was one of my favourite games and it had online. But what i did not know is that this is not the complete version, with RMG. I hope the developers fix the multiplayer port forward thing so we dont have to port forward, and that we can host an online game without any problems.What i also hope they can do is have it so when you press shift and LMB it can split a monsters group in half; and ctrl +LMB to take a monster and have it split in 1's.I'd rate this game 6 so far.

												In a words, I am very dispointted with it.The reasons are:1. Note that this is the original HEROS3, no expensions are included. I am expecting a full experience in HD of the Heros. But a lot of the features are missing. 2. It feels very lagging, searously. I believe it is not THAT HD that byond my rig. It just need patching and fix. 3. No random map, no hotkey. It may overlapping with the first point. But Really????? Seriously???4.Multiplay never works. Maybe it is not integrated well into steam yet. Let's just see what THE UBISOFT who have destroyed the Assissins' creed with it's overgrew commercial ambitions would do next. So far I don't sugget to buy this game.			"

												Your Review system is quite strange?Most who don't really like the HD Version , because all the add ons are missing and other things, take their time to write a few sentences. Because most DO LIKE the original version. Most of the ""likers"" write a short text like :"" Childhood dreams"" bla bla but don't even check the game first. So that's why lately the game has more positive reviews than negative ones. I recommend to read the reviews to get a better opinion about the HD Version. I love this game but there can't be a propper reason why the add ons are still missing? So I wouldn't recoomend it at all. Sorry folks. "

												I have to agree with most people here and tell Ubisoft that i'm actually really dissapointed, i mean i can't stop loving this game no matter what! Like most people here (probably) this was one of the foundations that made me a gamer today! And has always been one of my favorite games throughout all my childhood! Me and my cousins would always play this even if we were at my familys house, or theirs! The only thing we wanted now when we are older and don't always have the chance to meet up and play like the old days! Is a multiplayer that let's us play against and with eachother without playing on the same PC, we tried Tunggle and Hamachi and other IP changing tools before this version came out to try multiplayer and have lan parties to play this. But always ended up playing on the same PC wich made us very dissapointed, and when i saw this was coming out, the first thing that came to my mind is that we could FINALLY, play together. 3 of us 4 cousins started playing the day this game got out, but was greatly dissapointed when THE only map we could play was ""Realm of Chaos (Allies)"" and that was it, and since we have ALL played every.single.scenario. On this game it was not exactly enlightning, and to see that it was NO random map generator made us really and i mean REALLY dissapointed! And to hear that they lost the expansions when they changed owners of this company... i mean what the F*ck that's a really LAME excuse, why wouldnt you just come out with a new expansion or something? I mean last time i checked Age of Empires got themselves a expansion on their new HD version so it's not impossible! So to sum this up if Ubisoft or anyone else didnt feel like reading this review. i just want to say, if the Heroes III Complete version available at GoG has a legit multiplayer, i'm going to refund these money i spent and buy that instead!

												This game is tough to review. It's an upgraded version of the original, which released back in 1999. I don't care to, and have never played H3 multiplayer, keep that in mind. I have never played the original vanilla game, instead I used a mod to make the game playable on modern computers, I'll get to that in a moment.The biggest pros are the new HD graphics, standard support for 1080p, and more than 64k colors.The biggest cons for the new HD version is that you could install a mod for the original game called 'HoMM3 HD' ( https://sites.google.com/site/heroes3hd/ ) which supported larger resolutions than the standard 800x600, 32-bit colors, and it added A LOT to the game, A LOT! You can imagine a mod being worked on for at least 5 years, has some great features. After you use the mod, it's hard to go back to the vanilla game and all of the mouse clicking involved with it.I'm not here to say this HD version sucks, it's a classic game. You can play random maps by loading pre-built RoE random maps generated with the original game (or downloaded online). There's a tablet version, but you could already play the original game on a tablet before. To me the only thing this game adds to the old game is updated graphics, and for me that's not that big of a deal, I would rather have the features from the HD mod instead of the graphics, so I'll stick to the old game until there's a mod for H3 HD.I'm also hating that I'm reviewing a game called ""Heroes of Might & Magic 3 HD"", but it should be called ""Heroes of Might & Magic 3 - Restoration of Erathia HD"" --- there's a big difference and I'm still sore about it.

												Not worth 15 EUR, no workshop, no mod compatibility, no classic DLC's...Not hating the game as it is my childhood game but the steam version sucks, the only reason I play it is becouse of the Online support, and of course it's HD.. but not worth the money, 6 EUR MAX.Edit:I only recommend you this steam version if you realy want to play it in HD and online without many problems. But if you don't mind the graphics just download it for free with all DLC's.			"

												Heroes of Might & Magic 3 is a beloved old classic. The heart of the game is preserved in this HD edition. However, some of its charm feels as though it has been stripped away and changed in a way which seems to disrespect the original developers, New World Computing. It feels kind of jarring seeing Ubisoft's branding all over it having played former versions with different brand intros.While I recommend HoMM3 to anyone interested in experiencing the old classic of fantasy strategy, I think going to GOG and getting the original Heroes of Might & Magic III: Complete, which includes two old expansion packs, offers a better experience.

												Regretfully have to say this is not worth the money, when many others point out that you can get a better, cheaper version on gog, and just use HD mods to improve it, this really is true. The game is a good game, but this version is not worth it when you can spend less, and get more elsewhere.			"

												Heroes of Might & and Magic III is a classic game which is loved by many including this reviewer. So imagine my disappointment when I realised that there is absolutely nothing new here. Actually, it is quite the opposite, whereas the original game has an extra faction (although that was unbalanced) and other expansion stuff, all that is gone now. Also, the AI seems MORE stupid than it's classic alternate. The only reason to buy this ""HD edition"" is if you want supported Multiplayer. The graphical HD aspect is frankly nothing special, just higher resolution and sharper textures than earlier. The old HoMM3 (abbreviation for the game's title) also has some impressive mods that the HD edition doesn't.Verdict:Stay away unless you want an officially supported multiplayer: the game on its own is a less extensive version of the original game.

If you have no access to your router settings you can not host a game. And even if you get that to work there are still a lot of connection problems in mutliplayer.

There are many other reasons why this is disappointing all of which are in the many other negative reviews.I would also like to point out that the reviews seem a little dodgey. All of the review from the 30th are negative but all of the reiews from the 29th are positive im wondering if ubisoft have got a load of people to leave positive reviews on this because i can't think of any other reasonable explanation.

												As much as I love Heroes of Might & Magic III I would not recommend this game. :(So yeah like every other homm3 fan I have been waiting for a HD remake for a very long time. When I found out that Ubisoft were releasing this title I was very excited and sceptical at the same time because it's Ubisoft. Anyway having played the game for a few hours here is a quick reviewGOOD:- Upscaled graphics- Multiplayer (I havent tried online yet but hotseat worked okay for me)- Nostalgia trip every timeBAD- The animations are the same and slow - Archangels still have butt wings!- The battle screen does not scale properly- No dlcSo all in all its basically the same game with nicer graphics. I feel like Ubisoft could have done a much better job. Oh well maybe this game will receive regular updates.  "

												Wait...16 years old game with a new facelift? Hell yeah! I will not tell you about how great the campaign of this game really is. I will not tell you about the fact that you will lose yourself as you build cities and level up your heroes through turn based combat. For me, the main characteristic of this game is its multiplayer capability. Play this game with or against your friends. Explore the world, build your cities and engage in combat. Even after all this years, game remains an immersive experience that could easily take over your life. You'll start dreaming about it, about its races and towns, about Ivor, your favourite Rampart hero with Elves speciality and Archery as a basic skill. 70+ hours of gameplay I spent playing this game tells how great Heroes of Might and Magic III really is. Buy it, play it and let this game take over your life for a bit.			"

With moat damage, conflux faction, all expansions, why give more money for this?Sure, it has a bit more pristine graphics and ""high res"" sprites, but lets be honest, if you are a fan of the heroes franchise and want to play this game, then graphics is the least of your concerns. Perhaps if this edition had all expansions and everything Heroes 3 can offer, I would reccomend it. But right now, when the competition offers more with less, why bother?			"

												Not the Complete edition of the game, which I assume will be sold at a later date as ""DLC"" and missing many basic features such as random maps, rather limiting the player to scenarios, since they didn't release the complete edition or add any basic features like that. Overall a pretty lazy reskin since they weren't willing to give us the whole game as well as basic features, not to mention the opening cinematic audio is scratchy and outdated, they didn't bother to clean the audio files which contributes to the fact that this does not feel like a game I would want to be playing in the modern era, maybe if they release the expansions for free and basic features I'll reopen this game.

												This HD remake is slightly dissapointing for a game that has actually aged pretty well. Specially considering that it only the base game (its 2 expansions notwitstanding)Only thing that is in true Widescreen resolutions is the main map, every other screen is in 4:3 with borders which is offsetting. And while the textures have been beautifully brought to HD, they are just redraws of the spritesheets, so they still have the same limited animations they had decades ago. The main menu is a great example of this (the angel's sword looks really rushed)They have recycled the cutscenes (which is the aspect of the game that has aged the worst, and they seriously needed a remake) which brings down the value of HD Edition.Personally, Im dont like when games are graphics > gameplay; but isn't the goals of HD Editions like this one to bring the graphics up-to-date to an already existing gameplay? (and a great one at that) I usually expect more when decisions  like just remastering the base game are taken into account. I would have passed it if it was Heroes 3 complete, but just Erathia... feels lazy. "

												Don't buy this game.I usually don't buy anything anymore from UBI as their support is **** and they don't give a damn about their customers + they only release game broken bugged games. Which they eventually patch halfway, if you're lucky.At this game, I didn't encounter any game breaking bugs however, and I bought it in the hopes of giving them a signal of what a heroes game should be like.Still, I never expected they'd be able to destroy such a glorious game.Positives: The graphics ==> good job. Though I prefer gameplay over graphics, H3 was beginning to look a bit old.Negative: Only scenario maps, missing factions, removed features, no random map generator...I can't even play a 1 vs 1 on a big map, no ""buy all"" creatures in towns, huge fps drop/2second freeze when the middle archer tower of a castle shoots when defending a keep (on an expensive gaming rig)...Don't buy it, they messed up again. If this is really UBI's doing again, don't think support will help you, don't waste you're time contacting them.It took them over 6 months to help me out on how to play H6 on my gaming rig, and I even had to find the solution on my own, as they failed to find it. When I posted the answer to the problem: They didn't even care.DO NOT BUY THIS, not worth the insane price tag.			"

I don't mind playing old games with low resolution as I grew up with them but this is bad - you get sometimes a picture or something which was redrawn but the rest is only scaled and running with bad framerate so it'll leave you with bad feeling and hurting eyes.In shor: just don't buy it.

												I can't seem to wrap my head around why the expansions were left out. But who am I kidding, I can't wrap my head around how countless Ubisoft games go through QA and still come out buggy!Old fans of the game and new players looking to try it out, I would not reccomend getting the HD version of the game.

												A premature release?An HD remake of this game is one of those ideas that sounds pretty nice, yet this product doesn't really come off as complete. More detailed hero portraits are nice, sure, but why are the town portraits more blurry than ever? Some UI updates? Nice, but it doesn't look good outside on the adveture map. The bold font choice for messages like the ones on the start of the scenarios is a bit hard to read as well.Entering the towns, they do look good, though. The sharper edges really come to their rights there. For creatures, the updates are very hit and miss: Pikemen, griffons and orcs come to mind as pretty bad updates. Goblins, ogres and black dragons look pretty amazing.In combat, the movement shadow comes with a grid you can't turn off, which I personally find offputting. Some animations seem more clunky and chopped up than before.All in all, not really worth the extra money, although it is really, really nice to play without that awful Conflux again. Like many others, I too would recommend buying the HoMM3 Complete Edition on good old games over this version.			"

												If you're looking for a fun, entertaining, multiplayer game, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The online lobby is steam friends only, there is no expansion, as it is not the complete game, and even playing with friends is broken. Want to have a free for all skirmish between you and some friends? TOO BAD. There's no random map option, so all you can do is play the scenarios, forcing computers into your game. On the other hand, if you were for some reason planning to pick this up soley for the single player campaign then still don't buy this game. It looks a little nicer yes, but it isn't worth supporting them for an incomplete game.			"

												This product gets my personal award for worst money waste of the year. I was really hyped about HD release and multiplayer support. I got the game and even played it for some time. Got bored pretty quickly, because original game is boring and imbalanced. It took me around 20 hours to come back to platinum edition and never open this one again.Only worth it for multiplayer. And even THAT is highly debatable.Avoid if you are new to the series. You can get platinum edition for half the price. This game doesn't need fancy textures to be playable.			"

Ubisoft dont care about the players or the games, just exploiting a beloved franchise-name to sell a few copies. You didnt even bother adding a button that turned on/off the mainmenu music.. You where even willies(sorry, my original word got censored) enough to only add this note _after_ the game was released and you got so bad reviews: (i checked)""Important note: Heroes III – HD Edition content is based on the original 1999 game: The Restoration of Erathia. ""The information on the game was so bad before the release that most customers didnt know they only got 1/3 of the game they expected. I looked on your website, steamsite and did a google-seach, but next to none info on what to expect.

												I was really looking forward to play this old classic  with the HD improvements, but so far it has been a huge letdown. For a HD version of the game, the graphics are hardly any better than on the old classic, the only improvement is being able to choose a higher resolution, which is possible to do with mods on with the complete edition from GoG.com. Unfortunatly the game does not run any better than the old version on newer machines, the game would often freeze for a split second when doing tasks with your hero like digging for the grail. Also since I have two monitors, the game would frequently bug out when scrolling towards my 2nd monitor, even when playing in fullscreen mode.Another big letdown was the fact that the HD Edition DID NOT include the 2 expansion packs The Shadow of Death and Armageddon's Blade, meaning you are losing out on a lot of already released content. The price of the HD Edition cannot be justified for how little it adds. You are better off buying the complete edition from GoG.com, saving some money in the process and having more content.			"

Map editor is included however.- Gameplay feels a little cluncky sometimes- No expansion packs includedI enjoy playing this version because it allows me to play online with my friends pretty easy but I wouldn't recommend this with original price to anyone. Go to gog.com and buy original game with expansions and download HD mod if you want to. The game itself is gold and I really appreciate the detail that has been done for the textures.			"

												I loved This game as a child, But this HD Version is lacking in a lot of ways.It lacks the 2 Expansions Packs/DLC/QAddons, Armagedons Blade & Shadow of Death. This is the first thing I noticed, and it annoys me to hell. Mostly because They added a lot of the Iconic features that HoMM is remembered for. Like: - Random Map Generator - Conflux, the town, heroes, and creatures - Compound Artifacts - Monolith Teleporters - The Four Non-Town Dragon Types, Crystal, Rust, Fairy and AzureThe only good this they add are - Stable Online Multiplayer - Better GraphicsThe HD sometimes bothers me even, because they made some changes to the characters. It annoys me. Not to mention that the Sprites glitch out and stand in the wrong locations sometimes! I play it in the Original Graphics half the time Because of that!Final Thought: Don't bother with this version. Unless Ubisoft Give us the Expansion packs for free, which they most likely wont, because they are horrible people and will try to suck out all the money that we have. So just go to GOG and get the Complete pack for a lot cheaper.			"

												I am a real Heroes of Might and Magic fan   I've played it since game 1 and I can say that this game is pretty sad.here is a short essay about what is wrong with this game.the fact that they removed certain traits to creatures which were made in the first place to balance the weaknesses and strengths of certain castles is sad.   { I am talking about how in the original heroes 3 Dragon flies ALWAYS applied the spell Weakness, and zombies applied Dirt on enemies which they attackes)this practically makes the Swamp Castle very weak in comparison to the other castles you can pick.the other letdowns are the fact that there is no DLC.why is that a letdown?  well that is because the DLC contains the 2 things which makes this 1 of the best playable game in it's genre.I'm talking about the  Map generator tool, and the Campaign Editor.   those 2 features literally have taken about 1000 hours from my life so far, since it is never-ending.th other fact is that the DLC holds the last playable castle type- Conflux.   which is the STRONGEST mage-castle in the game, it's far stronger than the Wizards limited Magic possibilities.also the fact that about 2/3rd of the random Artifacts trigger the event ''a leprechaun offers you to buy this item for bla bla bla bla''   makes it kinda boring.there used to be about 25/35 different triggers on random artifacts {if it weren't more) on the map. also, if they lost the data for the DLC,  is it then really that hard to buy another copy of the full edition for 10$  and extract the data from a regular game again?     or is that too much effort for them?leaving that all aside, you can see though that they reworked it a bit but it really is not worth the money.overall,  i'd recommend people to buy the original full version, as that one has much more possibilites than this one.the map editor is still pretty fun though.

												In the year of our lord 2015 I expected a lot more from a ""HD Edition"" of this gem, I was even optimistic for some new heroes or maps, enemies, items, something - not that the game itself wouldn't have been enough. Or so I thought at least. Because when the ""game itself"" means neither of the two expansions are included, nor are all of the chronicles, there being no random map generator, or a functional steam multiplayer, support for major mods, or LAN mode.. At least they added more bugs than there ever was in the original version, with a side dish of the ""Revised high-definition graphics"" that make the game lag noticeably more than any game released this year, with high end engine, played on ultra settings.Big thumbs up for the game itself, big thumbs down for this Ubisoft version.

Not having random map killed a huge part of the draw to the game possessed by the original. Why not release all the expansions on a game that is 15 years old? It doesn't even run as smooth as the original. A visual tune up with a lot of drawbacks. Honestly if you just visually tuned up the old game and made it multiplayer compatible with the steam interface through a lobby/match making system it would be worth the buy if not more. I think after Heroes 3 the series has been set up to fail. Refund would be greatly appreciated.			"

												This is the most painfull rip off I've lived in my whole game purches history. I could never imagine someone make such abomination and not introduce a random map generator in HOMM3. Shame and disgrace, and too bad that brilliant people like 3DO had to sell their masterpiece to garbage companies like Ubisoft and butcher the whole gaming system. Don't buy this game, it was the most frustrating 15EUR given to a game in my life. Ubisoft in their laziness didn't even made a decent multiplayer lobby room. It doesn't even work, you have to call a computerguy to set your router for it. Shame on you Ubisoft for this rippoff.			"

												Huge disappointment. I spent countless hours on this game as a child and I thought, in exchange for my hard earned £12 I would receive a HD remake [with hopefully a few tweeks than ""modernise"" the game], what I actually was given was the game I know and love, with everything I wanted taken away. Admittedly it is in HD, sadly the game itself is actually worse [in terms of gameplay and content] than something created 15 years ago. WHAT!?I never imagined I would be writing a negative review, especially considering how much I love this game, but this is dreadful. I put my faith in the HD remake, but in reality I should have bought the original again. If you're playing this because you love the random map generator, and exploring each faction then do not buy it. If you enjoy playing the campaign repeatedly and only want to do multiplayer [which I haven't tried] then this is probably for you. Hopefully ubisoft release the rest of the content at some point or at least explain why it has not been included. No doubt a HoMM3 DLC pack for £9.99 will be released in the coming months. Ergh :(			"

												I will preface this review by stating that this is not a bad game. It is NOT a bad game. In fact, this game is amazing, and if you have never played Heroes before this game is my suggestion as to where you should start the journey. The reason for my down vote is simply because I paid $17 for nostalgia and that's pretty much it. Granted the graphics are better, but they weren't ever truly terrible for what the game was, and I feel overall not much else was done for it. It does not include all content which only adds to further disappointment and unless you're playing against people of your skill level, multiplayer is a joke (if it even works). The only solution I can see to correct this problem is to release the other 50% of the game (yes, the additional content accounted for pretty much 50% of the game) for free to those who have currently purchased the game and to add the random map generation.Whilst I still enjoy playing the game it's disappointing to know how unfinished this rerelease is, especially when it is an obvious cash-grab rereleasing a game for today's desktops.

												Heroes of Might & Magic III HD Edition is an unfortunate waste of potential. Arguably still the best Heroes game out there the HD edition makes numerous touch-ups to portraits, units and the world map, combined with the ability to run at higher resolutions. This gives the games' timeless graphics an even more refined edge, which is, quite gorgeous. The problem is that the HD edition only spans the original game (Restoration of Erathia) and does not include both sizable expansions and the slew of addition Heroes Chronicles campaigns. The HD edition would have been an excellent opportunity for Ubisoft to bundle all of this content into one package for the first time.In the end you're simply better off using one of the excellent community HD mods. These allows you to enjoy all of Heroes III in a better resolution without being limited to just the basic game.			"

												Warning for Nostalgia seekers who are looking to play the game as it was in the original release: Ubisoft have made some changes that probably will not be to everyon's liking. Two good examples are that black dragons are no longer immune to magic, and dwarves are no longer magic resistant. Also, some of the old maps are missing. On the up side they did add some new maps. To me, a HoMM fan from the release of HoMM 1, this modified version feels dumbed down and less challenging. Battles will usually be determined by who has the most and the highest level monsters, and not who is best able to leverage their creature's assets better against their opponant's creature's weaknesses. That's because the advantages and disadvantage have all been nurfed to the point where there really isn't much difference between two differerent creatures of the same level.I wondered if perhaps my perceptions were just a matter of memory being distorted by the mists of time so I go out my old CD's and started up DOSBox and there it was, just as I remembered. BIG difference! Checkers vs. Chess. I thought that I might be able to soften the disapointment by copying over some of the maps which were left out,but instead i was in for another disappointment. The original files and all those user created maps from 1999 are incompatable with this version.All that said, I hesitatate to give it a thumbs down. For those who never knew the 1999 New World Computing version, this could be a fun, light strategy and tactics game minus all the minutia and micro-management of epic strategy games of the Europa Universalis genre. It weighs in lighter than  the Total War series too. If you want some strategy but its been a long, demanding day at work or school and your brain just wants to take it easy for the evening, this might be just the perfect thing.NOTE Since writing this review it has been brought to my attention by Steam user potmdehex that a mod has been released which will convert the old map format to the new format. This adds quite a bit more value to the game considering how many excellent user made maps are still floating around on the Internet, not to mention the fact that it makes the original official game map available again. Information regarding this mod can be found right here on Steam at the HD Edition forum at address: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001014053/recommended/297000?tscn=1463098014Again, many thanks to potmdehex for this welcome information (even if his name is a little <adgitive of your choice, either positive or negative>. Personally I take no position on it. I simply wish to offer my gratitude for the information).			"

												Me and my friends had issues with getting the network working for the original HoMM3 complete edition, so we thought the steam version might work better. Without even opening ports in the router, it just worked flawlessly like magic.Start the game, Choose Multiplayer, Online then just invite and it's working.If the original Heroes could work this easy, or if the mods somehow could alter the networking to work even nearly this easy, I would switch in a heartbeat!Because the HD, to me who is used to the old style, is crap. The Pikemen looks like they've got a helmet way to big for their head.I switch down from HD to Original ""low"" quality at start always.So if you're interested in the HD edition or just want a legal copy of HoMM3. Just download the HD mod online or buy the game on gog.com.If you want the game to work with friends online without having to use a lot of networking fixes and knowledge, then this game is for you.

												User experience is not updated at all. I mean it is cool that you updated graphics and multiplayer functionality but the problem is overall gameplay features. For example game is blocked during a sound effect. These tiny things definitely affect the gameplay and can be annoying in the long term. There is a fanmade HD mod that I've been playing for years and it fixes overall UX and gameplay screen is actually widened with more resolution instead of stretching. I expected such an improvement from this HD Edition. It's really strange that Russians were somehow able to greatly improve a closed source game by modding better than a company that has the source codes and resources to do so.			"

The graphics are better, sure. The sound is crystal clear (just like in the original) and the gameplay is the same (phew!). What DOES both- no. It doesn't bother me. It pisses me off. It doesn't include the DLCs. WHAT. THE. F***K.For 14,99 Euros I could get the original + the expansions and at least one more game on GOG. This is a ripoff. Don't buy THIS s**t.

So the short version:To get the HD Edition of the DLCs, you'll have to pay at least half the prace of this piece of s**t, 2 times. For 8,99 Euros, you get the complete collection, though not HD on GoG. But really, after 3 minutes, you'll start to see no difference between the older graphics and the newer ones, so why even bother. OH TYPICAL UBISOFT. That's why I stopped bothering with your s**t after Far Cry 3 (because it was in a Far Cry bundle, I mean how can you resist that? 3 games for the price of 1/2?).

 Rated this up but simultaneously giving my contribution for criticism, which is certainly justifiable. Heroes III is generally known as the most successful title of the series and might be the best turn-based strategy title as well. And why it shouldn't be - everything works like clockworks from rpg -elements to the unit balances. Among campaing there is a couple dozens mini scenarios which can be played with either AI or another player.For those few who are completly new with Heroes of Might and Magic here is some summary about the formula of the series. You start on some random map with a hero and a castle of your chosen faction. With your hero you go adventuring into world which is filled with artifacts, treasure and resources with which you are able to build structures and hire new units from your castle to fight creatures lurking on the map or another competing factions. Your hero also gathers experience with various ways to upgrade his/her skills and attributes going from being a novice to ultimate master of Might and/or Magic. The scenarios are usually won by defeating other factions, some boss hero or gathering x amount of resources.All these core elements are flawless in Heroes 3 and this HD version that also gives a slight graphical face lift for it. Excluding a couple very random bugs - everything works without problems on my Windows 10. However after all this years we could wait some wrapping up of this remastered title, but this is the where it let's people down. It doesn't include expansions The Shadow of Death or Armageddon's Blade which multiplied gameplay time, indroduced new units among brand new elemental-based faction 'Conflux' which is favorated by many players.I myself could actually turn a blind eye for this neglect but I understand that when there is a steak available the minced meat is going to be hard to swallow. Heroes 3 is available in other cloud stores in a version where expansions are included. They don't have HD on them but I surely would spend my dollar into some significant features instead of graphical details which I usually forget while playing this classic.In conclusion Heroes 3 HD is solid, mighty and magical turn-based strategy experience and could be recommented even in its normal price if it wouldn't enjoy reputation of missed opportunity. Definitely worth it with a minor price tag though. If Heroes 3 HD should (I've odd feeling it will) have expansions included in the future I hope that for the sake of fairness they could be purchased as free dlc.			"

												Heroes of might and magic 3 is a fantastic game, it's in fact my favorite game of all time. This HD revamp does that justice, however I cannot reccommend this game. Alot of people will mindlessly hate on this revamp because it wasn't what they were expecting. This is Heroes 3 vanilla, with no expansions something people were disappointed with. Ubisoft were very unclear regarding the expansions. Many people including myself were expecting them. Because this is only the vanilla game it's simply not worth the price. If you find this gem on sale, I would highly recommend you purchase it. TL;DR: It's without expansions and therefore not worth the price. Very good game if you find it on sale.			"

												I have always loved this series, sadly all the issues with MP on Heroes VI has lowered my overall rating on the series,so when i saw THIS refurnished edition i had to buy it out of nostalgia and the fact it was pre VI.BIG MISTAKE! if this is what they consider a good improvement they might aswell skip any future ""remakes"" ever!Feel i wasted money on something they ran through a toaster tbh.... it has the charm of the old original but it isn't really much improved in my opinion.I would rather have bought heroes 4 and 5 as they are originally than waste my money on this remake...5/10 and thats just cause it's heroes 3! +0.5 for the ""improvement"" soOverall 5.5/10 !

												As a huge fan of Heroes of Might and Magic III since the release I must say: This is just horrible - an outrage... gaaaar!!!Its not just the missing content. The game just is not ready for a release!Moats are buggy (dont deal damage), 'Space' doesn't work for re-active a object you are standing on, the animations are awefull, the 'new' high-res textures are without any love painted in a few minutes by the janitor, fonts have been changed in the after-fight box and and and...It took only one game to immediately un-install and never re-install it again.God bless GoG for have the old game...

												Even though that HD textures are great, but HD version of HoMM III already existed before this game was even re-released and I'd argue that its layout is even better than what you've tossed at us, Ubi. Moreover it doesn't support Armageddon's Blade and Shadow of Death.  Missing Conflux, unaligned creatures, random map generator, less item variety adds up to the unpopularity of H3HD.Essentialy you're asking 15$ just for the textures. If so then atleast allow to apply those textures to our already owned copies of HoMM.			"

If you are considering spending money on this, DON'T.It's missing a huge amount of content (expansion packs) and the HD version is just updated sprites.I got my old CD's from the early 2000s, installed the russian HD mod, and I have a far superior game.Do not spend money on this until all content is added. I bought the CD's for 10$ in like 1999 for the complete pack, they want 15$ on steam for a remake?This is not worth your money. Go to GOG and get it for like 9 bucks.			"

												Edit (switching to nagative...):I agree with many of the nagative reviews that this rerelease was just lazy. I hoped that it would get new players into the HoMM series (HoMM6 is not what a Heroes game should be). I wish this rerelease did a better job of proving the beauty of this game and the simple 2D style with an amazing system (check out spiderweb games). The nostalgia was worth it for me, but I don't know that I would buy another Ubisoft rerelease (or game as of late). It was your move Ubi, you had so many gamers intrigued and excited. Can you fix it?----The expansions are missing because the code was lost... which is understandable, but why no map generator? Otherwise it is still Heroes III and is worth it.  I have not tried multiplayer, but I have had very few issues with the campaigns/single player.(keep the music playing when rolling off of the main monitor please!!!)			"

												The game does not come with the original DLC/expansions, because according to the devs they cannot find the sourcecode, or something.. Which means that they wont be able to add them to the game at any point. And half the fun lies in the DLCs. So just don't even bother buying it. When it comes to the HD-part, it is ok, but nothing worth focusing on like the trailer seems to do. The multiplayer part is still quite sh@it. Should have improved it a lot for it beeing worth buying on steam, I think.Conclusion: Don't buy this one. Just buy the Complete Edition(or torrent it, if you preffer that). Why? Well it's got a lot more content, and its cheaper.			"

												The gameplay itself is one of the best in the series, with classic creatures and factions.  Basically Heroes 5 with better graphics.  However, the game is so buggy and the multiplayer experience is so dreadfully glitchy that it overshadows all the positives.  I've been a huge Heroes fan since the 90's, and this game is so terrible that I honestly feel that Ubisoft owes us our money back.  I've been trying for months now to play a single mulitplayer game online and haven't been able to complete ONE GAME due to a laundry list of bugs and connection issues, despite several patches by the inept programmers of the game.  Overall, good potential but shamefully unfinished.  Thanks Ubisoft.			"

												As a child i loved this game. I spent hours on it struggling through the easiest of campaigns level, hours in single scenarios i never finished and days playing with friends waiting for them to finish their round.So this should be really good right? No...Tho this is a decent remake of HoMM3 its not the remake we wanted. We wanted a remake of HoMM3 the complete edition with shadow of death and armageddons blade included. Instead we only get the restoration of Erathia which dosent give 2 additional full-length campaign on a more challenging level, tons of new single scenarios, the conflux faction and the random map generator (the latter should never be missed)So what they did was just taking the most basic version of the game, polished the graphics alittle and called it the day. Despite te fact that the expansion files got ""lost"" dosent help it muchAnd if you still crave this game, just buy the complete eiditon. Old game thats still gold			"

												I think HOMM III is one of the greatest games ever made, and it is no exaggeration when I say I've dumped thousands of hours into this game as a teenager. I've even bought the game four times (back in the days when discs had to be used and they'd get scratched or lost). I got this copy in a HOMM package for the Steam Summer Sale so I didn't actively seek out this game specifically because I already heard terrible things about it. Plus I have the GOOD version of HOMM III on GOG.I've played one campaign map in this HD remake so far and already the issues are staggering. immediately when I clicked during the opening FMV and the entire game just crashed.When you play at a high resolution, it gives a quarter of the screen this framing effect and the game freezes up constantly. It's especially annoying if it freezes up during a sound file because it will make this constant stuttering sound. Some stutters can last for several seconds and the biggest problem is that it happens CONSTANTLY. I mean it can happen a few times every in-game week, and it happens both in battles and on the world map. It was a thoroughly annoying experience just to play that one map, I wouldn't even touch on issues outside campaign mode. Stay away!			"

												Rating: 7/10  (Same amazing music and game, would be a 10 if it wasn't a sad remake).First of all, I've always loved Heroes of Might and Magic 3 since it first came out in 1999.  I give this game a thumbs up because it is great and if you haven't played the game it is worth the money.If you already own HOMM3, I wouldn't bother unless you're interested in slightly better graphics (or the few crappy achievements).  Remaking a game from 17 years ago HD and adding nothing new is a pretty pathetic joke.  The HD is nice, but I still even prefer the Wake of Gods (non-HD) version where things in the atmosphere move like the trees and bushes etc..The least they could of done was add a new campaign or some new maps or AT LEAST more than 13 Achievements and GOOD ONES?  I don't think I'm alone when I say I'd love to purchase a new expansion for HOMM3, not spend $15 on the same game.  Also the Netplay is a joke.  Luckily I got this in a Humble Bundle for a great deal.Pros:------- Nicer graphics, same amazing music and sounds- Has Achievements.....- This game is still awesomeCons:------- Nothing new besides a minor update in graphics- Can't hit space when on a tower/building etc. anymore (pretty lame when you go through a dungeon door/teleporter and have to dismiss your hero when a strong enemy is waiting on the other side)- Massive lack of new content and achievements- Disappointing if you already played/own HOMM3So UBISOFT, stop making new Heroes of Might and Magic games with prestine graphics that SUCK and start remaking some Heroes 3 expansions in which people will actually enjoy and buy!The end.

												I bought this game, because it's one of my favorites from my childhood. While the game itself is as good as ever, there's no expansions. There is absolutely no reason NOT to include expansions in this game. Hell, GOG-version has got expansions by default, you don't even need to install them separately, they're basically integrated in game. I remember Ubisoft saying something that they CAN'T add expansions for whatever reason, I'm not going to dig up the source for that.Like I said, the game itself is the same masterpiece as in 90s, but PLEASE, don't buy it here, buy it from GOG.com instead. They've got 100% everything from the game. Well, not HD but to be honest, it's not necessary and what I understan, there is some kind of HD mod if you really need it. For me, it wasn't HD and will never be (I toggled it off while playing this HD-version).			"

												Although i would agree with most of the reviews on this title i do not agree giving it a bad review just because it does not have the expansions to this game.  I have thousands of hours invested into the old series. I would notice something being amiss.I knew going into it that this was only Heroes 3 Restoration of Erathia. With that being said we should really be judging it for its HD elements and bugs/performance.The moats look different. It was the first thing i noticed other then cage of warlords in the fortress town now actually looks like a cage instead of a net.So yes there are some hd elements that are extremely noticable. Is it alot? No.Granted i have not put that much time into this remake yet so i may re-review it after the fact. But for right now i will give it a down vote only because i find this hard to believe that much time has been put into it to call it a HD remake. "

												The first impression is not the graphic but the sluggish movement. What's most disappointing is that it only contains the first compaign, no shadow of death, no blade of armagaddon though we the old players would regard the triology as a complete story of heroes 3. I'm pretty sure I won't waste money on any remaster of its compaign dlc or other stuff like this. The graphic doesn't make any difference as those claimed in game trailer and the resolution of a town remains the same as old one, with broader frame. It even makes this remaster worse than original one in game experience.			"

												It is good old Heroes III ... except, it's buggy and does not run on old systems.Personally, I recommend getting the original - old Heroes, with both addons (which are unavailable for this HD version). You can get those on GOG for similar price. As for HD ... you can install mod for the old version and you'll be able to view original game in high resolutions as well.Now, what this actual title gives you? I am not really sure. Original graphics, while low-res, they still look good, because it is a 2D game. You won't see much difference between old SD and new HD. Just a bit (really, A BIT) more detailed textures, nothing more. If you've played Heroes III Gold - forget about Conflux and upgraded Necro. It is highly probable, that game will brake at some point (I don't remember this happening EVER with the original. nether the base game or later with addons). Campaign maps are broken (but not to the unplayable level, just some bugs) - there are places, that you can not access (well you can, but only if you are lucky and have the ability to fly over obstacles on the map). The reason is just bad placement of environment elements on the map. Also, there is a map with two border towers without keymaker tents - again, you can't access areas blocked by those towers without very much luck (or cheat).If you are the fan of Heroes series and you can sleep without having all of it's releases - get it on sale (or maybe you can get it with the Heroes VII Deluxe? :)). If you just want to play one of the best (if not best) Heroes title - just get the original as you can get full game (i.e. with addons, which are really worth it) for similar price.			"

												Terrible! I dont remember this game being this bad. I dont remember random enemies that suddenly block your path that are tier 5-6 and hordes in the second week that you have to chance of killing. Computer is insanely hard and will destroy you within a month. I had to load a game and fight another hero, first time I won but then I lost my castle, so I reloaded it and the enemy kept fleeing with 1 enemy remaining so I couldnt get its item. Wow WASTE OF $7 BIG TIME last time I buy any game wheres my refund?			"

												I stupidly bought this a couple weeks ago when there were little to no reviews, and those that were on here were positive but not able to be viewed. Played for a bit, decided to revisit the campaigns (Oh hey, I don't remember it being only 3 when I played this a decade ago...), went to write a review later on cause stupid 5+ min play time required, and LOOKIE THAT! A SLEW OF NEGATIVES!I wish those had been there before I purchased, I'd have saved myself $5 and just gotten the GOG copy then and there. Do not buy this, do not feed Ubisoft.

You can't give this a negative review just because there isn't a Random map generator etc, you can't give it a positive review because it has HD graphics either.  You can however still have many hours of enjoyment of a classic game that will fill the armchair fantasy generals coffers with enjoyment.

												Ok, so I´m a pretty big HOMM III fan and I was superpsyched when I saw that they would realese a HD version.Pretty quickly I noticed some problems after I bought it.1. Many of the new textures are in my opinion uglier than the original ones.2. No random map generator.3. Not the entire game (no expansions) witch means no Conflux town among other things.4. Unstable, keeps crashing for me and I have a decent computer.5. Laggy. Wtf? This game is from 1999. Even with new textures how is this possible?6. Attacking units does not take any damage in the moats, what is up whit that?7. Got an ingame popup during battle telling me the hero felt the battle was uneaven and wanted to run away. (New thing, don´t like new things)Just buy the original game on gog instead and save yourself the terror of this turdblossom. Don´t know why I did not see this coming when Ubisoft was involved.My GPU: GeForce GTX 570My CPU: Intel Core i5-2500K 3,30GHz			"

												The thing is... if you loved the game before it went on Steam in it's HD remake, you're gonna love it again. Too bad it's cut of the expansions and some other stuff. I don't even get why. And it is sad for me especially, cause I used to play Conflux every time we had a hot seat session with my friends. But after all it's still Heroes. the game mechanics is more or less the same (even though ♥♥♥♥ whoever thought it's a good idea to have useless river around the castles!) and if you have friends to play with, you're gonna have a great time. Even after all these years. I remember our sessions from more then a decade ago, going on for hours. And since I own it on Steam, I started playing the campaign for the first time ever. Cause my friends have girlfriends and stuff. I didn't even notice the facelift it has. It's still Heroes. Buy it on sale. Or buy the Complete somewhere else			"

												Sure the Graphics are enhanced, but thats about it. No expansions, no enhanced mechanics, no Conflux, no various neautral mobs, no map generator and no added maps for that matter. I tried my best to give this old classic a chance on this platform, but alas I felt cheated. 15 dollars for a game I already had.This is just an effortless release by ubisoft to get that cash. dont fall for it as there are other various HD mods out there that brings you not only the expansions with all its features, but also an upgraded UI.They have also publically announced awhile ago that they will not add the expansions as there are no source codes or something. I dont know anything about that, but I believe that there is always a way to make things work, so I think thats just a bs excuse to half♥♥♥♥♥this release and its (non existing) future content.			"

												This is a tough one to recommend... on one hand, HD edition looks better and, as the single most important thing in this edition, online multiplayer through Steam. No more playing around with Hamachi, or Tunngle, or any other♥♥♥♥♥♥like that. Just create game, invite friend, and presto (although, on hindsight, the MP does suffer from occasional crashes, but I was at least able to finish couple of matches). However... as has been stated before, there are no other expansions included here. Its just the original game, and expensive at that. Why pay 15e for the original game with little better graphics and online MP, when you can buy the complete edition from GoG for 9e, which looks only bit worse, and can still work online with the aforementioned Hamachi/Tunngle♥♥♥♥♥♥like that (worse than Steam, yes, but it can still work)?If Ubisoft would add the other expansions to this edition, then yes. I'd recommend this as must-buy, without a doubt. However, most likely, even if the expansions get released, they'll be as paid DLC, for like 10e per piece or some♥♥♥♥♥♥like that.I'd say, stick with the complete edition on GoG. You get more bang for your buck with that.			"

												Man, I grew up playing this game. when I think of Turn Based Strategy games, this is what comes to mind. Sadly I don't reccomend this version of the game simply because you can get the original version for like $10 on GOG, and that version comes with all the expansions (which made the game infinitely playable with randomly generated maps and more races, artifacts, etc.). This is ONLY the Restoration of Erathia (the base game that originally came out). Come on, Ubisoft. Make my childhood come to life by adding all the expansions. I need this. YOU need this.			"

												This cash grab is cheaper and dirtier than an abo sloot in the Dreamtime. This remake actually had some potential as the game was very good in its day, but they ruined it by only releasing the base game (no expansions) and are charging 20 bucks for a very light touching up of graphics. Honestly, I love this game, but can't justify spending 20 bucks on this so called ""HD remake"", especially when you can buy the original game with all the extra content for a similar price.Ubisoft rips off their fans with dog cash grabs and broken promises much like the boongas cash grab taxpayers money for a living.

												Heroes of Might & Magic III is my favorite game of all time !As soon as the soundtrack starts I remember the time when I was small kid. I could play this game all day without knowing what I was doing, but somehow it was so much fun. It just reminds me of times where everything seemed to be easy and stressless,that's why I occasionally come and visit this game to relax.Truth be told this game is far from perfect and if you want to have the best experience go buy the Homm3 complete edition for 3$ or so. I just play this version for the HD part.			"

												I was nudged in the direction of writing a review thanks to a friend of mine (shoutout Ztanz) as i touched certain aspects which wasn't typically mentioned by others. I don't recommend people this specific product. I do recommend Homm3 in general. However, This version IS to be recommended to people that's never been playing Homm3 before, as it offers a smooth experience with multiplayer (a broader community as Gameranger is hosting different versions of the game which may or may NOT be compatible with the one you have) and it, obviously, got some nice edges to it. If you loved the older graphics, it's still available with the push of a button.This ""review"" will mention some features which is ""hidden"", both positive and negative. -This version offers a stable type of multiplayer solution imbedded in the game. When you enter the lobby, the game will prompt you to open 3 specific ports. This isn't necessarily required, as i've personally played several games via the games own MP function with friends which hasn't touched the ports/their router. -This version is actually having a very stable MP solution, and we've never experienced any DROPS in connection from any party while playing (3 people on different locations with solid Nordic internet provider) -The graphic is actually showing more than ""just boosted sprites"" when you look at certain features such as faces on heroes and creatures. Half of them look ♥♥♥♥ing insane due to insane-staring-eyes, but sharper edges makes things look pleasant.-The map editor in this is poor, more so for the lack of the well-loved obstacle brush which is available in the ""complete"" version which includes the expansions. I was told by a kind and well-informed gentleman in the community forum here on steam that the complete version map-editor actually is compatible with this product here on steam IF you during map editing in the other version ENABLE restoration of erathia as compatible - the map editor itself should help you out with verifying that in it's embedded tools.-The map editor IS functioning if you still want to create some more intense, smaller maps, however, which is a pleasant surprise to me-Streaming the game works great, and it's nothing to it. Very easy and smooth. Also a recommendation to stream for your friends while you play to allow for more fun during the turns.Again - i can't recommend someone pay 15 bucks for this game if you somehow already have a functioning version of it available, and if you're a veteran and tired of the vanilla. BUT i can recommend it for reasons presented above.On a sidenote: I suspect that we might actually see the other expansions delievered to us in a future, for free or for a few dollaz, from Ubisoft.  The lost sourcecode is probably not even true.Second sidenote: I own 3 different setups of the game, and i've lost countless others. My gametime must be 2000+			"

												Easilly worth the extra $5 for a good resolution on my modern gaming pc. Very pleased. Also been playing for days and havent encountered a single bug.EDIT:After a recent update the game can no longer open. It errors out and crashes immediately. I ended up buying the GOG version to play. It(being an original version) is missing tons of improvements of the remaster like simple windowed vs fullscreen, extra in-game options and steam multiplayer. It's a shame UBISOFT and the developer they had build the remaster screwed it up so bad. I'd much rather play the remaster if I could.To be honest I dont agree with the illiterates who cant read the title of this game and were shocked it didn't have all the expansions built in like the Heroes III Complete Edition does. The remaster's features are a huge improvement over the original and Android support is awesome. I wish i could go back to that instead of the GOG version i have now. Sadly it's just too buggy.			"

												I played Heroes 3 for the first time more than 15 years ago and it is still one and the only strategy game i love and play to this day. This HD re-release is still worth it, especially for the new-comers. The graphics are updated and re-drawn from scratch and it doesn't strain the eye as much as the old one and makes the game look gorgeous. The online play just works through steam (even invites through steam overlay work) and doesn't require any dance with a tambourine around the computer and TCP/IP Hamachi or Tunngle work-arounds. Yet it is a shame that this version of the game lacks of the expansions such as Armageddon's Blade and Shadow of Death which means it misses some multiplayer maps and the final kingdom called ""Conflux"" (which was one of my favorite).We can only hope that Ubisoft doesn't play lazy (even without the source code from NWC) and could just add the expansions by themselves (if fan's decrypted source code and managed to do fan-made expansions, why ubisoft can't rework the old ones?)Pros-Same Heroes III you love-Online play just works through steam-HD Resolutions and re-worked graphics-Music sounds much cleanerCons-No expansions and no Conflux castle-While in online play the game doesn't auto-expand when minimized, when it's your turn (old ones did)-When the game set to English language and the host of the online lobby is set to different (Russian for instance) the game dialogues and names are displayed with weird computer simbols.

												Heroes 3 is probably the most favorite game of mine and I spent days and weeks with it in the past. So the HD Edition looked promising to me. But it's only huge disappointment. Only new feature are new textures, which in my case (2560x1440 display) are  in combat mode still ugly. Game is not scaled for high resolution - you only see a realy small part of map as you saw long time ago on your CRT. On big screen everything is ridiculously huge. Also combat and castle view weren't scaled, so there are empty spaces on left a right side of a 16:9 screen. And both datadisks are missing.(I only focused on graphics, because that's the only new feature, game alone is still great;) )			"

												Remember a big company called 3DO,which somehow went broke couple years ago,leaving a series of great games. Heroes is one of them. Classic,as they say. Many others tried to fill its shoes and some of them did a fine job,but not you Ubisoft.I'm not gonna talk the stupid bugs and balancing here. As a 10 year old H3 player, I'm truly disappointed about Ubisoft's shameless behavior this time. I bought this so called HD version both in Steam and Apple Store just because I was almost thrilled when my friend told me that they were gonna put this on Steam. I had played the game with my friends on one PC when I was a child. It was a lovely memory. I was ready to pay whatever it would cost to feel that again but now,I believe free is too much for you,Ubisoft. You have no soul and no shame at all.As for the bugs and other stuff I'm pretty sure you can find out in other reviews.Oh I'm really forward to The Shadow of Death and Armageddon's Blade by the way. When you're done, just give me a price and I will be more than happy to shove it up your♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Still a great game without the expansion packs if you have never played before.  The HD graphics do make the game more fun.  A few bugs from the original but does not really impact the game that much. Hey please finish the expansion packs in HD and get them out!			"

												It's pretty much a scam, here are some pointers as to why it best describes this game:Game is LESS than the original complete edition, it's the same as the original VANILLA was. I expected there to be as much content as there was in the original, I mean, why wouldn't there be. Why would you buy a game with less content for more money. I would've been happy with a revamped complete edition: - There are no expansions in it, and most likely there never will be. This means, NO MAP EDITOR, which is the only thing I personally play. No new content, and infact, THERE IS MUCH LESS CONTENT. The original version is MUCH MUCH better. - The original version works great, even on windows 8.1, and you can download a free HD mod for it. Original version is MUCH better. - Issues with multiplayer, lots of reported bugs in MP and singleplayer. You can simply use a virtual LAN service and you can play MP even with really slow connections and old PC's. Original version is A LOT BETTER. - The original game, with ALL content, costs far less than a game with MUCH LESS CONTENT. The original game is much much better. - None of the problems with the original game, though none game breaking, have been improved upon. It's been 15 years, several mods have been made to take inspiration from. But nothing has been done to make this worthwhile. This game is worth less than a modder could have done for free.I think this pretty much sums it up. I don't know why anyone would make this type of a revamp. In 15 years one could presume there would be a lot of improvements. DO NOT BUY THIS, EVEN IF YOU REALLY FEEL LIKE GETTING IT. JUST GET THE ORIGINAL ONE AND RESIST THAT URGE TO GIVE IT A CHANCE.			"

												Could not load a previously saved game in multiplayer and could not window the game, had to be full screen.If there is a way around this I would like to know but the negative review remains due to making it poorly explained in game.Good graphics, if you even notice them, but poor polish especially with not including DLC, quick buttons, random map generator and other expansions. Overall pretty sloppy but I bought the game to support any further efforts to this legend of a title.			"

												Heroes of Might and Magic is a series I absolutely adore and have played from the beginning when they were a spin off from the Might and Magic games. Heroes 3 is seen by many of us fans as the best in series with a huge number of scenarios, campaigns and the ability to create and add more.The game itself is a good strong RTS where you build your bases, build your creature armies and develop your heroes. The real winning thing about the game for me was always the ability to win scenarios in several ways. Set in a solidly created fantasy setting, the writing and world building benefits from the years of writing in all the previous Might and Magic and Heroes games. Sadly, Heroes 4 onwards ignored all this previous world building with Ubisoft's psychotic need to make their own mark on a franchise. What it resulted in was pathetically poor writing and betrayal of fans.I'd recommend that anyone try Heroes 3, it's a truly awesome game.That said I CANNOT recommend this edition. Aside from it being a stripped down version of the full game, this edition is WAY too expensive. The HD video is not enough of an upgrade to justify fewer campaigns and scenarios or the higher price tag. Worse still, they've built in the ability to revert to the SD video/graphics. The problem is that the SD video is not representative of the original game. It looks like it's been designed simply to make people avoid just recommending or picking up the original game on GOG. It doesn't work though.If you want to try Heroes 3, and I highly recommend you do, go and buy it from another vendor. I'd suggest GOG. If you're a diehard steam fan though, perhaps we should all be asking Steam why they couldn't bring the originals to their store just like GOG have.			"

												I wont be bothering you with superlatives about HoMaM III from 3DO (new world computing) as we know it, lets just hear about this HD remakePro:+ HD textures looks cool+ also released for Ipad+ revertable old graphicsCon:- HoMaM III aged extremely well sadly for creators of this remake (graphics)- 15 euro for Restoration of Erathia only, that is 1/3 of original game, meanwhile you can buy complete game for 5 dollars on GoG and download HD patch for free from very dedicated community- Unofficial patch from said community also contains new castles, items, artifacts and such (Horn of Abyss), made so well you would not notice they are not the original crew- Some key functions are missing (example - when you are at building/temple/object/teleport, to use it again you must go backward one tile and go back, in complete edition you just pressed ""space"" key and hero reuse it again, why it is missing....)- Movement in combat is glitchy and feels like the game is lagging...Wasted potential what else to say, would I pay for new content with HD remake? Hell ye! But greedy Ubisoft just put their crap cherry on nostalgic cake and hope we will eat it just because it is our beloved HoMaM, they are far better alternatives than this overpriced ""remake"", I can not recommend this for any price, when free content delivers more than paid one...

For those who have ever played - this is a turn based strategy game that is quite challenging. You have to divide your energy between guarding castles and exploring. It's a real trick sometimes. If you like Civ, you will love this game. There are multiple campagnes that will take hours upon hours to complete even on the easiest setting.

Heroes of Might and Magic III HD is a retro game with the edges smoothed off. At least when it comes to its presentation.The beating heart of the game is still decidedly old fashioned, and a lick of paint and a few extra pixels here and there can't do anything to change that fact.If you're a fan of the series then you'll likely lap up this portable version, and look past the little quirks and nuances that new players might find annoying.If you've yet to play a Might and Magic game though, it's likely this one will leave you cold. The strategy RPG has moved on a good way since the game first came out, and it's starting to creak and groan under the strain.Heroic?The games sees you leading a hero through a map. There are areas to explore, loot to find, resources to nab, and strongholds to capture.Start a fight and the view switches from the map to a grid-based battlefield. Here you'll pit your soldiers against an enemy army in a turn-based battle to the death.Everything is controlled with taps, and the UI works reasonably well. It can be a little fiddly getting to grips with how everything works, and the two-finger-swipe scroll command feels a little cumbersome.But there's a meaty, in-depth tactical RPG underneath all the retro stylings.It can feel a little bland if you're not paying attention, but if you want to sink your teeth into settlement micro-management, resource gathering, and army-building, there's an awful lot here to grab your attention.Magic?It's unlikely that Heroes of Might and Magic III HD will snag itself a new audience. It's a bit too fiddly, a bit too clunky, and a bit too cruel to appeal to your average mobile player.But if you're a fan of the series this is a neatly realised, reasonably well polished port that should scratch an itch or two.

												This game or (HD) Version is really getting unfairly reviewed. I bought the game a week ago from♥♥♥♥♥for 4 euros. Me and a friend started playing it, and it was very easy to connect online and start playing together. The game worked flawless and the graphical changes are extremtly pleasureable to the eye. (We've played around 7 full games now)I played Homm3 when i was a kid, and I started again several years back. Though I've been playing casually once a month or something. However, for those who plays this game hardcore i understand you want random map generator. Though this will never bother someone who plays on a average or casual level.Yes, a playable race (Conflux) is missing, but honestly I personally haven't felt any difference at all.Well in a recent patch they updated so that you can join eachother with regular steam invite. But when you press multiplayer it says you have to open ports, so i did. But my friend tried hosting without opening ports and it worked just fine.

Hero can't enter mine/town/etc twice (if he's already stay on it) by 'Space' button.2. In the town you can't buy first level creatures, if theirs buildings were upgraded.3.

If you do not like Ubisoft of the Company or do not want to support it, I recommend the game when purchased by the GOG site of the original older version that works DosBox: the new computers. No need to Uplay to play this. Refferal! :3FIN:Paras sarjan versio mutta, edelleen räätälöitynä. Jos et pidä Ubisoft firmasta tai halua tukea sitä, suosittelen ostamana pelin GOG palvelusta alkuperäisen vanhemman version, joka toimii DosBox:sillä uusissa tietokoneissa. Ei tarvitse kuitenkaan Uplay:ta asentaa pelataksesi tätä. Suositteluni! :3			"

												This is the HANDS DOWN worst remake of a game ive ever seen, by faaaaaar.No random maps, no functioning MP and basicly every single function is broken. They fixed zero of the old problems with crashing and/or dropping players.. And to top it all off you cant play it with dual screens because then your cursor moves over to the other screen.. Because you cant configure a functioning full screen mode.1/10 - Destroys nostalgic value of the game. Go to GOG and get the OG there and have fun instead.

												There is not real reason to have this game, if you have a working copy or own the complete edition of Heroes of might and Magic 3, this game is defininetly not worth the fifteen dollars in it's current form. I would suggest looking up ""Heroes of Might and Magic 3 Horn of the Abyss"" for a better HD remake that is free if you have the complete HOMM III data. I would suggest waiting for a sale if you really want to play with online friends with it. But otherwise, don't get it.			"

												Yes, we all know that it lacks the AB & SoD campaigns. Ubisoft claims that when they went through New World Computings files they could not find the source codes for those. Simple. This is the first strategy game I have played ever in my life and for a game that was made near two decades ago it still beats most of the strategy games of today. HD resolution looks pretty legitimate, they did the best they could, as it seems.Pros:+Pretty good faction/creature design. Infact that this game paved the wave for most of the epic/fantasy games of the future both lore and visual-wise.+Soundtrack is awe inspiring. Feels epic and gritty when it needs to be.+A lot of options to lay a path to victory.+Online support (I have a couple of old friends who also used to play the game so we still throw some Online/LAN parties).+Campaign storyline is actually pretty good. Like Tolkien kind of good.Cons:-No AB or SoD campaigns as mentioned before. Sad.-If you are not familiar with the franchise or played the original game back in the day it might be very boring/unappaling to you visually compared to the alternatives you may have in 2017.-Fullprice is kind of too much to ask for, personally I grabbed it on a sale.-Number of maps for Co-op campaigns kind of falls short.Overall:Duckton of replay value, countless ""just one more turn""s, a lot of fun and intriguing if you have friends to play with and ofcourse nostalgia for the fans of the franchise. My vote might be a bit biased but after all; 8/10. Just because they do not have the DLCs I will not throw a tantrum. You should read before buying any product, including games. So if you do not stop whining Sandro the Great will throw your family into the Skeleton Transformer.			"

												Ever since I got a PC in 1990 I loved strategy games.Heroes of Might & Magic was amongst the few series that I have played most parts. Mostly because they're loyal to their fan base and stick to their main game play components:1. Turn based combat of fantasy creatures2. Turn based world map to explore and capture3. RPG-like development of your heroHeroes III is the oldest available remake of the series. I had to play it and wasn't disappointed. It's still as enthralling as it used to be 20 years ago. The balancing of various factions is great, with none being too weak or too overpowered.Of course the cinematics are of a different era, but I didn't pay much attention to them anyways. The story is still told quite well just playing the scenarios.			"

												What nostalgia! :DThis is the first PC-game that I have ever played (back in the golden days of early 90´s) and it hasn´t lost it´s glory even after all these years! HD edition looks great and you can still lose yourself in the game for hours at a time. Campains, enemies, strategies, adventures, exploring, battles and all the other so so so cool stuff that seems just perfect.The game has awesome music and so much to choose from, even if the playing in itself is quite simple, so it´s suitable game to any player who doesn´t play that much, and still you´ll find a nice challence even after playing it for longer and multiple times.5/5As an afterthought: I noticed that some players are dissapointed with the fact that the came is entirely the same as it was when it first came out. I myself, am only happy that I can play the very same game again. I personally would be dissapointed if the game had been altered or a lot of stuff added to it. Why chance the classic? If you want a different game, buy a different game.			"

												This is and alway will be such a great game... but HOMM III HD is an outright waste of money. If it was free it would be a waste of storage space for any of us who are fans of the game. No expansions, no map generator just makes no sense. If you never played this before ever well then this version may be good for you as you will not know better and it plays well but thats it. For any that played in the old days do not waste your money on this like i did. Get HOMM III Complete elsewhere then you will have the true game. IF i had really understood that this was just the vanilla version just never would have bought was my own fault I admit.			"

												Now, I know that if you're reading this review, you've probably read the other ones that blast the game for lack of expansions, map generator, the Conflux faction, etc. And yes, I admit that as a long-time HoMM3 player, the lack of those things did irk me as I have gotten used to their presence every time I'd play... However, you should not be buying this game for a full HoMM3 experience as that (unfortunately but truthully) was not what was advertised. All this is the base game with greatly improved visual quality. I will leave a positive review as this game does look indeed better than the regular verison of HoMM3, which is what was it said on the tin and what I expected, and I'm sure that most of us already have the regular complete versions as well as Wake of Gods, Horn of the Abyss and all sorts of things. The price is steep, though, so I advise you wait for a sale (you can pick it up at GamersGate.com for £3 right now) and simply play the GOG version for now.TL;DR  - newbies, go to gog.com and pick the complete version there. Veterens, buy this at a sale for a little eyecandy and achievements or just ignore it.			"

Suddenly it stopped mattering- this is *endgame* levels of game perfection, and every game after it has been an awkward attempt at reviving the magic of this classic masterpiece. Don't bother with 5, 6 or 7. Buy HoMM3, forget the 'good graphics', and play it for the gameplay. This game is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I feel like I'm making up for lost time every hour I play.			"

												You know, everyone is bashing HoMM 3 HD because of the lack of DLC and expansions that elevated the original from awesome to legendary... HOWEVER! Homm3 will always be the HoMM game to me. The HD format that they have come up with at Ubisoft is gorgeous, captivating, and still paints a picture full of Bone Dragons, Archangels, And Devils that is magical enough on a board game to make you feel like you are sitting at a table playing D&D again. The Ubisoft version of the game never claimed to have the expansions and it's a little bit irresponsible to assume that it would make the expansions right away or at all simply because they made a gold addition. Love this game! One of my favorites as a kid and serves as a wonderful sense of nostalgia now that I'm older. If you have never had experience with strategy or RPG games and you wanna learn how the mechanics work then I would definitely not recommend this game! It's a game more fit for your experienced RPG'r. It's a challenge in general but the chessboard format on the battle sequence simply makes the game much harder and we love it! Beautiful, magical, and just like back in the day; it's still challenging. Love it. Continue to do THIS with all of your remakes Steam and Ubisoft! This and AoE 2 are my two favorite old games to play on here!			"

												tl;dr: Entirely pointess - get the original and download the free HD mod.+ things look pretty and are large even at high resolutions+ that's ... pretty much it - doesn't include anything from the expansions. It's especially missing convenient mechanics like pressing space to re-enter a building. It's hard to go back to after playing Heroes 3 complete.- Doesn't add any kind of mechanical improvements over the original. No Steam cloud, no improved menus (e.g. No load/return to menu during battles which would REALLY have been a great addition). It's just lazy.But the main thing really is that the HoMM3 HD mod lets you play the game with both expansions, adds many great shortcuts (e.g. if you're moving the last stack off a hero, it will automatically leave 1 creature on that hero). Having played with the HD mod for so long, I REALLY miss those conveniences and it's hard to go back to this.The only situation where this version might be preferable is if you have a small, yet very high-resolution screen, in which case this game will look better. But even then, I wouldn't say it's worth it.			"

												Fantastic game! This is pure nostalgia in a great way. They say that you always remember the past with rose-tinted glasses, well here they have bolted them on! I replayed the entire campaign and it was amazingly done. Multiplayer is fun too with hot-seat. For everyone that remembers the game: buy it and play it again for just one more turn. For those who have never played it: Heroes is an amazing turn-based strategy game where you build your army, level your heroes, and gather your resources. With multiple difficulty settings and tons of custom scenarios it offers hours and hours of enjoyment!			"

												Okay so I wouldn`t call myself a pro at this game however I know know how to play this gameMy uncle who is a huge fan of the Might and Magic franchise showed this game to me like 2-3 years ago, I loved it.(He showed me the Heroes of Might and Magic Gold edition)Now that game I would play for hours with my brother in hot seat multiplayer games.The reason I bought this version was for a couple of reasons:It was in a bundle with Heroes V and Heroes V DLCIt was able to play online with steam friendsIt didn`t require a disc inserted So when I started playing, the game was Great and I loved it like I always did but it wasn`t until I replayed a map named Warlords, that I realised that the random map generator wasn`t a thing anymore now at first It didn`t bother me nd that was until I played it for like a fourth time, the map was just simply boring, same places for castles, same hills, mountains and other. However that is the only dissapointment I have had in this game.This game is Amazing like the rest of the Franchise			"

Playing it in the HD version seems so different, that even after lots of years since release, the game is still fun.			"

												Love HOMM3. Played 2 and 3 all my life. My advice is to go to GOG.com and pick up HOMM3 Compete. Then go get the HOMM3 HD mod and install that. You will fall in love with it all over again. Like when you select a building to recruit it is maxed out by default, so just hit buy. OR you can click the town icon in the bottom left and that gives you an option to buy all creatures in one go. Two heroes meet, there are ""transfer armies"" and ""transfer artifacts"" buttons now. I love it. The HD mod is amazing and it's a must have. I play in 1080p now and you can see so much of the map. Going back to the 800x600 feels restrictive now. If Ubisoft had any plans to release the expansions I'd say support them so we can get them, but they have said the source code is gone. So at this point, hit up GOG.com then get the HD mod. Have a blast reliving the rush you get when Orange comes up and takes your gold mine, and you swear you will wipe Orange from the history books for this attack upon your economy!			"

HEROES OF MIGHT & MAGIC III - HD EDITION REVIEWHeroes of Might & Magic III:Everyone agree that HOMM III is the best HOMM. Better than its ancestor and its succesor, even the HOMM VI itself. For me, HOMM III is my childhood memories. In early 2000 my uncle introduce this game to me, and in one week, I already addicted to this game and my childhood is full of fantasy about angels, devils, dragon, titan, behemoth, hydra, and many more.As the time goes by, I decided to play Campaign and finish the storyline, and I must say, the storyline especialy Shadow of Death and Armageddon Blade is not a cheap storyline like other fantasy adventure, the storyline much more like noveltry and its awesome.Almost ten years goes by after the last time I play HOMM III, in those ten years I was hoping that Ubisoft create new HOMM which is still awesome like HOMM III, and then I thought, ""why not a remake of this game with HD definition? this thing is famous nowdays""Heroes of Might & Magic III - HD Edition:And then here it comes the Return of the LegendsI was dissapoint at HOMM III - HD Edition in Steam's Review Page. So many people dissapoint with the graphic, some people still find the graphic hasn't changing. Well, at the first time I install and play HOMM III - HD Edition, I had a same thought, and then I open my old HOMM and make a comparasion, and Im impressed of how well the improvement actualy is. The problem was in our way of seeing. We grow up with a lot of games that make a lot of improvement in every year, so the classic game look so awful. I think this case is same like the Fallout 4 problemMy HopeI was grateful that I could play this game again in 2015 with a HD Remake.I hope that Ubisoft also make the Shadow of Blade and Armageddon Blade Edition.I dont care if its come as DLC for this Restoration of Erathia, or its come as diffrent game, I believe HOMM true fans will buy and play it, because Shadow of Blade and Armageddon Blade has a better storyline and game improvement.I also hoping that in someway, Ubisoft also included the Wake of God edition, eventhough it was a fan made. Im sure that if Ubisoft collaborate and make this Wake of God edition, the WOG edition will come out as a perfect Heroes Edition.My Rating for this Game:Much Childhood Memories! 9.5/10			"

												The best in the series and an all-round classic.HOMM3 continues to display it's perfection even decades after it's creation. Many turn based strategy games only wish they could be as big as this one is. What makes this game amazing is it's army and unit diversity, each being visually and tactically unique, effective and fun. The simple mechanics behind the game make it very easy to learn while keeping turns quick which really helps the flow of the game in multiplayer.While the campaign mode is great on it's own, one of the best things about HOMM3 is it's 8 player multiplayer and infinite supply of randomly generated or user created maps. This HOMM3 HD does not actually include the map generator itself, but there are workarounds to get it working with this and guides to download a large number of the maps online. Mutiplayer can be played over LAN, Online and even hot seat on the single PC (great for when friends visit).The largest downside to HOMM3 HD is the lack of HOMM3 expansions. After decades of playing with the expansions it feels like a decent chunk of the game is missing. Those who have never played the original would not notice the difference though and realistically, there isn't actually that much missing.The newer HOMM games could all learn a thing or two from this one. This game was never about how stunning it looked, it was all about how much content it had and how well it played. The game didn't need to sell the armies to you in DLC chunks, people got them mainly just for the campaign and story alone. The game is well optimized for performance, never crashed and was mostly bug free. The AI armies could use a little work but AI wasn't really that advanced back then.Overall this is a great remake of the original HOMM3 but it is not really necessary to enjoy the game, the main attractions are just the visual improvements and being easier to set up online play. Without the expansions you would need to weigh up if that is worth sacrificing the expansions additional content for.Things I really enjoy about this game:Well written lore and story.Army and unit diversity.Infinite supply of random/user generated maps.Not overly complicated. Turns are fast.Hero skill customisation options allow for different playstyles.RPG mechanics allow you to make your heroes stronger and alter thier combat focus as the game progresses.Perfectly optimized and near entirely bug free.Great multiplayer.Can play hotseat on a single PC.Things I really dislike about this game:The only thing I really dislike about this game is the lack of expansion content.

												Selamlar okuyucu. 16 yıldır usanmadan, utanmadan ve durmadan oynadığım kendi tabirimle bu hard core satranç oyununu sizlere naçizane anlatacağım. Hemen uzun mu uzun ama oyuna başlamadan önce bilmeniz gerekenleri özetlemeye çalıştığım incelememe geçelim.Oyunda seçebileceğiniz 8 kale var ve her kalenin kendine özgü kahramanları mevcut. Özgünlük sadece kahramanlar ile sınırli değil tabiki; mesela her kalenin kendine özgü müzikleri olması ve her kalenin kendine özgü stratejileri olması hatta o kalede ki her heronun bile ayrı ayrı stratejilere sahip olması.. Stratejilerden konu açılmışken bunlari HOMM3 Wiki' gibi mevcut yazili kaynaklardan ve ""bilmemne adamını youtube' den açayımda iki taktik öğreneyim"" diyebileceğiniz kaynaklar çok az maalesef. Sesli ve yazılı kaynaklardan bildiklerimi incelmenin en altına yazacağım. Bu arada linklerini verdiğim kaynakları çözebilmeniz için malesef orta seviye İngilizceye ihtiyacınız var. Lâkin İngilizcesi yetmeyen arkadaşlar için oyun yapısı gereği ona zaman ayırdığınız vakit yavaş yavaş size kendinisini anlatıyor. Tabi zaman zaman Google Translateye başvurmanız gerekebilir. Eh bu kadar çok bilinmesi gereken şey varken yapımcılar oyunun strateji kısmını karmaşık, oynanış kısmını ise olabildiğince basit tutmuşlar. 8 kalenin 8' i birden dengelenmiş ve oynanmaya hazır ve nazır. Kaleniz orada dursun arada bir yağmurdan, çamurdan korunun diye yapılmış tabiki de. Onu geliştirmeniz gerekiyor. Bu sayede her kaleye özgü mitolojik yaratıklarınızı elde edebilirsiniz. Evet birde yaratıklarınız var ve hepsi gerçekten mitoloji kitaplarındaki gerçek halleri ile tasfir edilmiş. Yaratıklarınızda kaleniz ve kahramanınız gibi geliştirilebiliyorlar. Lakin yaratıkların gelişimi 2 aşama ile sınırlandırılmış. Kahramanınız daha komplike bir gelişim sürecine sahip. Örneğin kahramanınız her level atladığına savaş ve haritayı keşfederken işine yarayacak pasif özellikler kazanır. Bu pasif özzelliklerden bazıları savaş alanlarında sıklıkla başvuracağınız büyülerinize aktif özellikler kazandırır. Özetlemek gerekirse kahramanınıza ve yaratıklarınıza analık ve babalık edeceksiniz. Oyun atmosferi, müzikleri, stratejileri ile tam bir Sıra-Tabanlı Strateji abidesi. Şayet hard core strateji oyunlarına açsanız, oyun sadace tuşlara basmak değil onun üzerine düşünmek gerek, sabretmek gerek, oyun bana birşeyler katmalı diyorsanız HOMM3' ü almalısınız. Afiyet olsun.İlgili sesli kaynak : https://www.youtube.com/user/martindzurenko/featuredİlgili yazılı kaynak : http://mightandmagic.wikia.com/wiki/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_III%3A_The_Restoration_of_ErathiaNot : Oyunun 1999' da çıkmış olan sürümü ve 2 ek paketli halini oynamak isterseniz gog.com' da Heroes of Might and Magic 3 Complete adıyla bulabilirsiniz.Sevgiler, saygilar.

												I chose this over the often favored GOG version because it was on sale for $3.75 and because the updated sprites do make it look better than a game from the 90s.  Videos don't do justice to how nice it looks for an older game.  Overall it's a very slick experience. I like it a lot better than the newer games like Heroes VI, which feel bloated, and I'm convinced it cheats by magically giving the AI units it can't possibly produce that fast.  The absence of a random map generator or expansions is not a deal breaker for me at all.  The map editor is still there,  and there is no end to the number of user maps you can find online.  Personally I find the campaigns to be childishly written, and I don't play them.  The real test of how great this game is would be that even my 10 year old son is hooked on it even though he could be playing more graphically advanced games.			"

												The old game, still awesome.As for the re-release, you all know what it is. A cash grab.With the vanilla games available with ALL the expansions for lower price than this, it's not really worth it to buy it, if younever played HoMM3. You should start with the complete series! But if you overplayed that to death already and want to try out this version... If you don't think it's too expensive, sure - get it. It is fun, it is nice.

												HoMM3 is one of my all-time favourite games. The HD version was a great excuse to play through it once again.If you've never played HoMM before, it's a perfectly paced, turn based strategy where every turn you accomplish something, and your next turn always has something tantalisingly out of reach leading to that ""just one more turn"" additiction. The mix of hero progression, town building, world exploration and army building is deeply satisfying and the combat mode plays like a chess puzzle of prioritising which threats to eliminate first.If you're a HoMM veteran then you probably already own the original on CD from 15 years ago. The HD version gives slightly cleaned up graphics, achievements and the convenience of Steam, but lacks the DLC and some other features. I personally didn't miss any of those features so I was very happy with my purchase.			"

												I really like that this masterpiece game has been remade in HD, bringing the classic back to the 2010's. I actually love that fact that this game was released on steam, due to my original CD-version not working anymore. Finally I can play this wonderful game again. The graphical retouching is of excellent quality, I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it.Yet, this HD-remake let me down. I was dumbfound when I realized that the expansions, and their features along with them, were not included in this remake. The scenarios provided by the game are enjoyable, but this HD-remake doesn't have the amazing replay value that the original game has, due to not having the ability to generate and play random maps - the mainstay multiplayer fun of the title, in my opinion.I have really mixed feelings about my purchase, after owning the HoM&M III Complete, as it feels very different without all the added content in the expansions. I will be 100% happy with this HD-remake after the expansions become available, and I really do hope they are being worked on.As the game stands of this moment, I would rate it 7/10, but has potential for a full 10/10 with the expansions.

												So this game has always been one of my fave's, ever since i was a kid we'd play this game and just see how far we could get. Which race to be this time and what warriors do we equip our main hero with? How do you battle tactically (use ranged and hold them off with melee and spells) or just aim for the toughest guys around?This game is great with it's many different play modes: scenarios, random maps, campaign and multiplayer.  Mostly the same actual gameplay however different kinda maps and objectives. There is also map editing, edit some maps or make entirely new ones :DSo this HD remake is pitching it as a whole new game, well not really, just HD rendered which I can't even tell on my current gaming screen, like I know it's supposed to be better and there is an option to turn on the old graphics, which of course turns it all fuzzy. The other added thing is the incorporated steam multiplayer which is very useful when trying to do games online.In summary a good game with many hours of gameplay, #3 in my opinion is better than all the rest, #5 comes the closest after that but the classic third is the best, I would fully reccommend purchasing for funs.

												This game has received alot of negative reviews because it is only the base game and does not include any DLC/expansions. This is true, but the base-game is still the same as it was (w/polished graphics), and is still in my opinion, the best Heroes of MnM game in the collection. However, because of its lack of any expansions, I do not recommend at full price. I waited and purchased it when it went on sale, and am thoroughly happy with the single player and hot-seat multiplayer modes. I cannot yet comment on the online multiplayer mode because I have yet to try it. In a nutshell, at the right sale price, this game is a must own if you enjoy any of the Heroes of MnM collection.

												It's a lot of fun. Just like how I remembered playing it all those years ago. The only real issue I've come across that I think is somewhat of a minor bug, is the lack of multiple game saves. It's about the only think I've come across that was somewhat annoying. the rest of it is exactly how I remembered the game from my childhood.			"

												I remember this as i was younger and enjoyed it then as i still do now. yes this isn't the full version and if you want it get it elsewhere. i'm not even going to bring ubisoft into this. there has been enough of that. if you like classic tile type games and you don't care about not getting everything. get this on sale or when its at humblebundle etc. they just had another might/magic bundle. i remembered when i first played this i sucked bad but over the years and my gaming experience grew i did much better this go around. sure i made a few mistakes still because i overestimated my enemy but meh. so yeah if you like a classic game. this is a good one.

												This game was my childhood, i remember that more than ten years ago i played this game a ton, and while it is completely faithful to that there are some things missing from it like the two expansion packs, while i have not played them when i was a kid i'd atleast like to play them. the graphics are what i remember them to be from my kid but in better pixel density, music is way better than i remember. my only issue is again, no expansions and no comunity workshop compatability. the workshop would be an amasing place to post multiplayer maps and get the big mods on there. Otherwise it's still a solid game that i'd reccomend getting if you don't have the physical copy to this game.			"

												Well, I knew when I got the game, that it's only RoE (The original H3), and I will not just scream about it missing the expansions,I played Heroes of Might and Magic III since it came out. The game itself is the best multyplayer turn based strategy I have ever played, NOTHING can replace it in this category. Hotseat with a friend, family, Hamachi match vs friends, some of the best gaming memories.The HD edition of H3 RoE is amazing I have to say, the HD lift gives the game a refreshing vibe, reliving your favorite TBS game feels great! Seeing this game wanted to be brought back to life made me want it on Steam since I saw it was announced, But...The lack of a proper multyplayer lobbyMissing 2 expansions which include many artifacts, heroes, monsters, game options, a castle..The ridicilous hardware requiermants (as a person with an avarage PC and an older laptop I have to point this out)I would still reccomend buying this game, it's worth the money, HOPEFULLY the developers will ""add"" Armageddons Blade and Shadow of Death either as DLC or a FREE UPDATE >>(IKR who am i kidding, ""free"" lel).I kinda still prefer teh GOG Complete version, because of the expansions. The developers of this game version need to step up, bring it to the next level, there are people who would buy this game version on Steam over the GoG version, if it met some of teh BASIC multyplayer features.""No matter who you choose, the other side will always call you a traitor""Cheers.

												Yes, I'm aware that the expansions are not included (that's not really their fault). Yes, I know there's an HD mod for the original version (in fact, I love it). Then why did I essentially buy Heroes III for the third time, giving Ubisoft, who has otherwise not treated this magnificent video game series with the respect it deserves, my not-so-hard-earned money? I've probably sunk more time into HoMM3 than any other game, and experiencing this brilliant game with high-resolution graphics is quite refreshing after playing it for well over a decade with sprites made for 800×600 screens. Unlike some other reviewers, I think DotEmu has actually done an excellent job upgrading the graphics (with a few minor exceptions). The gameplay is of course still there, as captivating and enjoyable as ever. The third instalment is the pinnacle of the series, and with the way games are made these days, there will probably never be anything quite like it again. I think this HD edition is the closest you'll ever get to a true 21st-century Heroes of Might and Magic game (not that Heroes IV is bad – it's just different), and that's worth getting, if you ask me.

												It's good fun if you are looking to play some heroes 3 and see it in a nice 1920x1080 res with a better looking world. I wish the frames per second were higher with the environment for a smoother experience. This version lacks all the expansions so it's basically the vanilla version. So if you're looking for Conflux or any of the expansions, look elsewhere. This is just for a little nostalgia which it does nicely. That's all I was looking for and I'm happy with it. I recommend this to heroes 3 fans who want to play casually.			"

The music and sound as well as movie playback is much improved over the original. The music in this game sounds effects are so good it will put most indie games to shame.Well worth the price and look foward to playing this classic retro previously made by 3DO not ubisoft.

If you have played and loved the original, you won't regret it. If you have never played HOMM but are looking for a challanging turn based strategy game, you will also love it.

Trying to build a singular army large enough to wipe out the enemy is good and all, but you also have to have many large armies to deal with multiple threats at once and have huge map awareness. This is great for the decerning ultimate task master. If you lack patcence with challenging (not impossible) games, then this is not the game for you.			"

												Very fun game. Played this a ton many years ago, and it was cool to play it again. However, if you already have the game on a disc don't bother buying the ""HD"" edition unless you really want to have the game on steam. Little to no visual performance increase, and the multiplayer is effectively useless. Tried playing coop with a friend after we both bought the new version, but you can't even see allies (or anything) when it's not your turn. So your friend gets into a battle, and you have to sit staring at a stationary map while you wait for them to finish. Should be able to see the battle at the very least.Still a great game though, just not much added by the HD Edition			"

												People seem to give this bad reviews, but it satisfied me.I wanted HoMMIII with Steam integration.This is HoMMIII with Steam integration.In regards to this only being the vanilla game, I also own it on GOG, and play the VCMI open source engine rewrite of this if I want more, but I was not expecting a ton out of an HD remake of a 16 year old turn based strategy game.It still has the same mechanics. It's still a time wasting game, in a good way.I got it for $7.49 which I think is fair.I do suggest you go buy the full version from GOG if you want the expansions and such, but the vanilla game is still a masterpiece. People complain of bugs, but I haven't experienced any so far. Granted I've only played about 7 hours at the time of writing this review, and haven't even attempted online play yet, but I don't think this game deserves such a bad rep, it's still enjoyable and nostalgic.I know this isn't a true review, but simply my thoughts on the game and how it compares to the original, but I still think this game was worth my money.

												It might not be cheap, but it's still a good remaster of a legendary game. This is an HD edition of the best game in this franchise and by looking at it this way I love it today as I loved it when it initially came out. I had real good time with this game , it took 85hrs gameplay to do all 13 achievements. I can only recommend for everyone who likes the Heroes franchise !!!!			"

												Opinions about HD edition of HEROES 3 are mixed, but i do think is a good buy. Many people will try to tell you that HD doesn't improve astethically, but I think they don't play game as often as I do, and I see monumental difference, i do played original version on HD modification, but it was still low res graphics, recreating sprites for such game is a monumental work and i can appriciate that as an example orc doesn't look like smeared puke. I have sat down and played it for hours, so playability is  untouched. Before with firends we had litereal RAGE after trying to play H3 online, using hamachi, gameranger, and other stuff, still there was disconnections and other bugs, now i am sending invite, and BAM! I am playing H3 with friends.But you should know this before buy:It is only base version of H3: Restoration of Erathia, so there are no features included in expansions such as:- Random Map - you need to download maps for RoE (but Map editor is included)- additional town: Conflux- additional Campaigns- Some tweaks in gameplay- More neutral creaturesStill Ubisoft had said that H3HD would be only base game because they only had source code for vanilla game, so everyone was informed about that. I don't know if it is catch to buy DLC or real thing, but I still appreciate the lifting.EDIT:- Also please mind that some great mods won't work with this version because they use content from expansions, mods such as WOG (in the wake of Gods), HOTA (Horn of the Abyss) and the project VCMI. ( for more information about mods refer to page http://heroescommunity.com/)Also this version seemed to have some bugs such as music in city starting over each time you enter, in normal version it would carry on despite what are you doing, so you don't hear same piece of song over and over. But ithere is nothing game breaking.If those bother you too much, and only want pure hotseat or single player experience by all means buy H3 complete with all features from GoodOldGames, because you will be dissapointed with this version, as you will miss great chunk of features in complete edition.That said although it doesn't feature expansion packs, it is still H3, great basis for refreshed expansion packs. It is still the same playability, but now with easier set up for multiplayer game, and i am looking forward for expansion pack recreated the same way. And I must go now, ONE MORE TURN...			"

												This is just the basic version of the game, without add-ons, so if you're looking for a ""complete edition"", then this isn't it.You might also be wondering about the ""HD"" tag, and in this respect there's not much of a difference relative to the original release. Modern resolutions are supported without making pixels as big as your hand, and that in itself is something, but the game doesn't look ""better"" per se.To me, the key question is whether or not this is a game worth playing, and to this question the answer is ""yes"". It's amazing how well HoMM3 has held up over the years. It's by no means a ""complex"" strategy game, since you're basically juggling a few reasources so as to maximise your long term output, and trying not to get outmaneuvered by the opponent. But there's surprising depth to the battle layer, with tons of tricks that you can learn (or, as in my case, remember) that will help you prevail in what may otherwise seem like unwinnable scenarios. Balancing this many units (eight factions times seven units times two variants, plus a number of ""neutral"" creatures) is hard, and I'm truly amazed, both as a player and as a professional designer, by how many tricks HoMM3 manages to pull off. There are a number of ""spiritual successors"", but none of the ones I've played is a match, design-wise.The levels, that is - campaign maps, are well thought out as well. You will be constantly second-guessing yourself about whether you should explore that forest path, or maybe stick closer to one of your castles in case an enemy emerges from the tunnels. The addition of a second, underground layer has made the game essentially three-dimensional and added much to its dynamism, if not complexity. As a result HoMM3 doesn't take long to wrap your head around, yet it does take some time to master. It's a masterful balance of accessibility and challenge.			"

												this is the best game in the heroes series. the graphics are amazing. if you are not happy with not having the expansions there is a site that you can go to to get the single player maps the 2 expansions added.http://heroescommunity.com/viewthread.php3?TID=41033    you want the link that says all AB/SOD maps for HD edtion. all of the maps that are downloaded from  that link are the single player maps that are added to the game from the 2 expansions all updated to work with this version of heroes. that link dose not come with any thing else from the expansions just the maps, but it is a start to getting the expansions in HD. trust me they do work i have played them. any fan of the hereos series should get this game. The reason the 2 expansions (shadow of death/ Armageddons blade) are not in this version and probably never will be is beacuse the original company that created the game(3DO/New World Computing) lost the source codes for the expansions. that being said the game is still fun with out the expansions, and if you use the link above you can still play the single player maps form the expansions just with out any of the buildings and creatures and the conflux town that the expansions added in.

												First a disclaimer: This is Heroes of Might and Magic III Restoration of Erathia only. At no point does the steam store disclose it being anything other or more than that. 3D0's completely inept handling of the franchise lost the source code for the expansions, so don't expect them. Which is a shame because of the campaigns and UI improvements, but I sure don't miss the Conflux. It is not Steam nor Ubisoft's responsability, whatever their other MANY failings, if you buy this game expecting the expansions because you didn't bother to read what you bought. You're no better than the people participating in early-access games and complaining about playing incomplete games.Second: For this lack of the expansions, this HD remake could be a bit cheaper.Other than that, this is what it says in the tin, Heroes III in high definition. Not the lazy upscalings of previous mods to the game, the models of all units and all art assets in the game were actually re-drawn into a higher resolution on top of the original designs. The game supports widescreen and the higher resolution means you can see more on the adventure map, which is a plus. The game's cinematics are still the same, though.Windows firewall only complained when I tried to start a multiplayer game, but once I allowed it the multiplayer worked for me without problem. The multiplayer suffers very little from the lack of expansions, only losing the Conflux and a few overpowered artifacts, which doesn't bother me, but might bother you.There is no random map, but there is a map editor and it works very well on the higher resolution.TL;DR - This is Restoration of Erathia only, LIKE ADVERTISED, if you think it is a crime against humanity to not include a couple of expansions that were LOST BY 3D0, feel free to not buy it.

There is beautiful art and fantastic music.However, there are only three original campaigns instead of 6. Furthermore, there are no extensions like the version from GoG. Those who wants a longer version of the game should definitely think twice which to buy.			"

The addition of HD graphics has made it feel not as dated.Regarding gameplay the overall balance of units is pretty good but I did find that using the fast combat option seemed to have quite a difference on the numbers of units lost in battles for the better. Generally I have found that an aggressive approach gives better results than slowly build up armies.To be honest I did not pay much attention to the plot. It does tie in the various scenarios but in my oppinion the gameplay is more interesting.The long and short of it is that if you are looking for a fairly simple turn based game  and not really worried about storylines this is worth a go.

												There's nothing wrong with it for what it is. People shouldn't bash the game because it lacks the two other expansion packs, they should be judging it on what this game, here on Steam, is and the functionality of it. I have the GOG version as well, which is the complete edition, but I still had some compatibility issues and random crashing, otherwise it was perfectly fine to play, but for me, I never really indulged in the expansion packs and played exclusively randomly generated maps, which is a feature the HD version lacks unfortunately for those people who don't also own the GOG version. If you do, then it's very simple to use the map editor for the complete edition (selecting only the base game) and enabling the RMG then saving it to the steam maps folder instead. This is what I've been doing and it works perfectly! So now I have everything I need: a working game - with so far (3 hours in) no crashes, HD graphics which are subtle but very nice, as well as widescreen resolution support. :D Without the RMG there's probably a lot less replayability, but for those without the GOG version installed as well, there are plenty of scenarios and the campaigns are really fun.

People shouldn't bash the game because it lacks the two other expansion packs, they should be judging it on what this game, here on Steam, is and the functionality of it. I have the GOG version as well, which is the complete edition, but I still had some compatibility issues and random crashing, otherwise it was perfectly fine to play, but for me, I never really indulged in the expansion packs and played exclusively randomly generated maps, which is a feature the HD version lacks unfortunately for those people who don't also own the GOG version. If you do, then it's very simple to use the map editor for the complete edition (selecting only the base game) and enabling the RMG then saving it to the steam maps folder instead. This is what I've been doing and it works perfectly! So now I have everything I need: a working game - with so far (3 hours in) no crashes, HD graphics which are subtle but very nice, as well as widescreen resolution support. :D Without the RMG there's probably a lot less replayability, but for those without the GOG version installed as well, there are plenty of scenarios and the campaigns are really fun.

												I have waited for this to be remade for a LONG time. I have about 300 hours + on the origonal game and played a lot of HoMM2 as well.I only payed $8 for it so imo it was worth a buy, ""HD Remake"" is a bit rich considering the changes are minimal, though people are saying they can't notice them they are there and there is new sounds ect.Only lame thing is no expansions (Yet) so there is't many maps in sigle senario.If you have never played a HoMM game from 3DO i'd give it a buy			"

												It is great for single player, better than I expected. This looks far better than the HD/high-res mod for WoGThe only problem is the multiplayer... if you are buying the game hoping for finding some multiplayer lobby's and play with randoms on the internet then forget it. And what's worse there is no play on LAN option, so you have stick to their online multiplayer which is user-hostile. It seems though you can get it to work to playe with your friends online. "

												I've never really had any of the expansions anyway, so I am used to just playing the same old version complete with the dumb AI and several other issues that where in the original. Basically, just plain old Heroes 3 with a new paint job, but I missed this game so much I cried watching the intro. I only got it for memory and multiplayer over the local network (Dont care much for Online play since no one usually is online anyways.) And no connection to Uplay. Yay! Just the way I like it. If you're looking for the complete series you won't find it here though...I just prefer getting games from a trusted source.			"

I would definitely recomend this game to anyone that likes turn based games and fantasy. The gist of the game if you haven't played before is controling your Hero, picking up treasures, exploring maps and battling masive armies with zounds of troops. Very fun even without the expansions. I hope that they add these and steam workshop at some point but the game is still really good.			"

												Graphics are WAY better, sux there is no expansions (Random Map Generator) you can use existing ROE maps, if you still have Heroes 3 complete you can create random maps there (make sure they are ROE) and copy it to the HD folder.If you play random a lot you can install H3Mtool http://steamcommunity.com/app/297000/discussions/0/604941528472210055/ and link it to your existing Heroes 3 Complete folder to have random maps created in H3 HD in game.If you need to purchase H3 complete (for random maps, or to play expansions once hooked), you can get it on  Good Old Games http://www.gog.com/ for cheap.Warning, once you play H3HD you won't be able to go back to the original!

												A very pleasant experience. When this game came out, I was very excited to relive the Heroes III story. For a game made in 1999, I think, the overall HD improvement is awesome considering the fact that everything from the original game was kept, including the maps, story, artefact and the graphic improvement is very noticeble. The HD is very noticeble with many of the game's units which look completely different, redesigned portraits, much better looking artefacts,hero interfaces effects and interface. Overall this game for me is 100% out of 100%. It was an excellent game to begin with and now it's even a better game, looking fantastically pleasant and it's affordable, so in my opinion it fits all the possible criteria. Everyone who is a fan of delicate little details added over this pleasant fantasy world will enjoy. A wonderful game and I hope there will be HD versions for the expansions too. Thank you Steam and Ubisoft. :). I love this game.Now, after 51.7 hours of playing I have finally finished it. Was completely worth it. I Feel so happy and acomplished. This game was the first complex game I played in my childhood and now I have finished it with the HD version. <3. I love it.			"

												Let me start by saying that there is a caveat to my recommendation of this game, but more on that in a minute. First, the game itself.Heroes 3 is, in my opinion, the best game of the series by a wide margin. It's tight, well-balanced, and offers lots of replay value with the map editor. If you've never played this game and you like strategy games, pick it up. You won't be sorry. Having it on steam makes it even easier to play with friends and, hopefully, will bring a good pool of custom maps from the community.That being said, this is only the base game. You can buy this PLUS two expansion sets for $10 on another website (the URL escapes me for the moment). This adds a new town type and a random map generator. Some people really like these features, I find them trivial. But it's still more stuff for less money. On the downside, you lose that steam compatibility aspect.So, do I recommend getting this? Yes. Do I think it's worth $15? No. If you're like me and $15 is chump change, get it anyway. If $15 is a lot of money for you or you can't justify spending more money on a game than it's worth, wait for a sale and get it 50% off or something. It's not like you'll have to wait long. Steam does them often enough.			"

												It looks nice, the ""HD Patch"" that you can get to make the standard game ""HD"" didn't even work for me. It's convenient on steam and the multiplayer works great if you aren't an idiot. Only downside is that the expansions aren't included but i don't care i hate Conflux. A little pricey though, wait for a sale so you don't have to give Ubisoft more money than you should. I got it on humble bundle. It's pretty good if you know what you are getting when you purchase it.			"

												Classic Game. Modern Price. The game works as it should. If you enjoyed it back in the day the game is the same with achievements and better resolution support. Sadly the aspect ratio is maintained as original and so leaves borders either side of the game window with a texture instead of making it actually fit the resolution. The expansions are NOT included. It is the base game.Some folk are being harsh because GOG has it cheaper with the expansions, but I don't rate other games based on how cheap they are somewhere else, that seems daft. Expansions missing aside, this is a better version of the game as it has online support. If you just want the main game, buy this version. If you want it all, don't.			"

												I almost did not buy this game from the bad reviews that everyone else was giving it because there was no random map generator and because the expansions are also not included in it. If you can get past these two points, the game is just as fun as it used to be. I remember playing this game when I was five years old. It is one of my absolute favorite games that has been released in my lifetime and I am so excited they released this. I have not had any issues involving the game crashing either, which I am very happy about since the Complete Edition (I believe is what it was called) always crashed on me when I played. In time, I hope Ubisoft releases the expansions to go along with the game, but until then I will enjoy having this reminder of my childhood.			"

												For the younger generations of gamers you might not quite grasp or appreciate the beauty that was HoMM3, however for me this game brings back Nostalgia not just in the gameplay but the reminscent LAN parties or the day spent playing a game with a friend on multiplayer hotseat while watching movies and enjoying yourself.  There is a beautiful simplicity to being able to both plot out your movements, use strategy in both how you build your towns, how you control your armies, and the combat system, but to also be able to do this while in a relaxed and casual atmosphere.Sure there is the downside that this game does not include all of the great expansions to HoMM3 and sure you can get those if you buy the complete game on GoG, but at the end of the day multiplayer through steam is just the easiest way to enjoy this game without any headaches and additional 3rd party software.  The random map generator may not be at your disposal here, but what is, is one of the best games ever made in it's original format, remastered with the same look and feel that we all loved, just with the ability to play it full screen with today's graphic standards.I absolutely love the game and welcome everyone to try it out, if you are ever looking for someone to play some multiplayer with I'll definitely be available for a game.

So Far. So So.(Should not exceed the price of HoMM 3 Complete particularly as it is a rather INCOMPLETE game)You don't get disappointed when you don't hold much anticipation before its release. Pros: It's still HoMM 3, the greatest TBS game i ever know. And finally there is a rather easier way to play with your friends across the universe :) Cons: Everything that contributes to make Ubisoft the stupidest company outside US :( More: Hopefully they are willing to constantly renew/allow mods, patches and updates  so as to expand and improve it...with the help from every HoMM & TBS lovers with or without a steam/playU/gog etc. account ^..^To be continued(when they add random map)........

												Hello.This will be my first review on steam. It will probably suck.Well then, HoMM3 -HD, great news for me, a long time HoMM player. I love that we will have our beloved ""3"" in HD and integrated with Steam and not those aweful modded versions.The thing you need to know before buying this is that you will get HoMM3 - Restoration of Erathia, wich is the vanilla ""Heroes 3"". Wich mean, Armageddons Blade and Shadow of Death is exluded. This re♥♥♥♥♥ in missing features such as random map maker, the town of Comflux and more.Having this in mind, I bought HoMM3 vanilla with HD, and I got HoMM3 vanilla with HD and with Steam services.I recommend this to any oldschool players of the earlier titles(HoMM 1-3 and perhaps no.5 as well, perhaps).I use it to play with my friends and to test my skill against random players, wich brings me to the best feature; The recommendation to speak english. Love it, more games should have this. Don't join my game named ""Ascension 6min timer"" and hit me with ""Я глупо России"" or ""Я присоединиться и играть да"".So to sum thing up. You get exactly what it says you buy. Does this make it a 10/10? Not sure. but definitly worth the low price.Peace.			"

No more having to user 3rd party client to play your friends and having to deal with bull♥♥♥♥♥♥port forwarding. Yes there has been bugs along the way but do your research guy! There constant patching, besides how many times has that old version crashed on us while playing.And for those BIT-CHERS out there if you spend 5min doing a google search you will find there is a Random map Generator OMG mind Blown! I still to this day play this game regularly, as soon as the game fired up I noticed a huge upgrade to the graphics keep in mind it’s an old game but they improved the sharpness, and smooth texturing of the colors. It almost seems like some of you were expecting a complete makeover. To sum this up it’s AWESOME to finally have an all-time favorite game supported through steam, but that’s just my opinion.Suck It up BIT-CHES!!			"

												Great HD remake which makes this classic game shine with visual glory for old and new fans alike. Gameplay is exactly as the original so no worries about anything being mucked up and toned down. Only disappointing thing is not having the two expansions included due to the code having been lost. Still HOMM III HD Edition has more then enough missions and maps to be enjoyed with even more endless replay value thanks to the graphical update.Enjoy and relax with a HD remake of a classic that is sure to deliever the gaming thrills and spills as only the HOMM series can. Oh and no extra steps about having to log into Uplay. Just start up steam in online or offline mode and your good to go. Thanks UbiSoft for that and for creating this HD remake to a fabulous game.

												Though there isn't much HD in the game, it's a Steam version, so you can play multiplayer easily without the use of additional software. And as for the expansions, they were not going to be included in the game, so stop whining about it. They may be added in the future, and to be honest, it's Restoration of Erathia that makes this game. All in all, a good addition to Steam. Now we need just HoMMs 1, 2 and 4.P.S. They could remove Might and Magic Heroes VI (MaMH6?) from Steam now that we have this beauty. :P			"

												Ignore the naysayers. As someone who plays his PC games on a 40"" screen, this HD version was necessary and greatly appreciated. Heroes III is one of my favourite games of all time, and easily my favourite strategy game. I've been playing it since I was 6 or 7 and never really stopped but in recent years, along with upgrading to bigger and higher reslolution screens, the games visuals increasingly looked pixellated and basically pretty damn ugly. I tried the unofficial HD mod but all that really did was increase the interface size and did very little for the actual textures themselves. Now with this HD version, the game looks beautiful and so it's as good as it's ever been.Are there flaws? Well yes. It doesn't include the expansions, the battles are still in 4:3 ratio (with borders) and a few of the repainted models look a bit derpy (I'm looking at you wood elves). But truly, this is a small price to pay for an old  game to look absolutely stunning. This breathes life in one of the best turn-based strategy games ever made. However I would appreciate it if Ubisoft added the expansions as DLC. And because of the price point I can see why people would rather just stick to the original version which you can get on GOG for a small fraction of the price of this HD version. My advice to you is to look at your monitor size. If it's 1080p and bigger than, say, 24"", then I recommend getting the HD version all day. Either way you can't really go wrong. Heroes III is still Heroes III.			"

												Hundreds of hours in on this game back when it was newer. Had a great time with it back then and it still holds its appeal now. I'm not sure if it is nostalgia speaking to me but, this game is still a good play through. I would pay anything under $15 CDN for this game.Let it be known that this game work spwerfectly for me but, I have seen a lot of people having trouble with multiplayer and single player. :SI still recommend this game. I know there are a lot of you people who like the older style gameplay. And this is a solid testament to that era.8/10			"

												This game defined a large portion of my childhood, I would watch my brothers and cousins play all day jumping between HoMM2 to 3. Soon enough I was absorbed into it as well. You can even make your own challenge maps (or surround yourself with friendly black dragons) I can not recommend this game enough. Quit reading this and just go buy this awesome game.10 out of 10, would go full Necro again-Ol' Salty Sandro			"

												This remake isn't for everybody, but it's a very good release for a certain set of players, which includes me. As everyone knows, only the Restoration of Erathia has been remastered. The expansions are not available. People who want to download and play custom maps are not going to want HoMM 3 HD Edition, because most custom maps require the expansions to play. So what exactly do I like about it?I've never been so devoted to playing any HoMM game that I spend all my time with it. I have a lot of other games I like to play. When I do feel like playing HoMM, I will pick a version and spend a few weeks or a few months playing with it. Then, I move on to the next game. So, I guess you could call me a ""casual"" HoMM player, and I only am interested in single player mode. By the time I finish all the campaigns in Restoration of Erathia, I am ready to move on to another game. So, I might as well enjoy the Restoration of Erathia campaign with the best available graphics and remastering.I also own the GoG.com complete version, with the HD mod. I find that I like the new HD version better, especially since it doesn't shrink the interface so small, and doesn't zoom out so far. I play on an 82"" television screen, and the remastered character sprites are noticeably sharper to me than in the HD mod on the GoG.com version. If I still feel like playing Blade of Armageddon and other expansions or downloaded custom maps after I finish Restoration of Erathia, I can move to the GoG.com with HD mod version and continue playing, although I will miss the improvements from the new HD version.It doesn't have to be an either-or between the two versions. It can be a both-and. I will use the new version to play Restoration of Erathia, and enjoy lighting up the achievements and having the Steam support. Then I will switch to the other version if I feel like continuing.I've had no problems with stability issues nor found any bugs, either.I think my $15 was well-spent. That's less than the price of a home-delivered pizza dinner, and I'm getting weeks worth of much-enjoyed entertainment hours out of it.			"

												Ok, so, I know I've only played the HD version for a short while, but bear in mind I have wasted thousands of hours on the original. Also at the time of writing this review it's on the latest Humble Bundle, so if you want a lot of Might and Magic, that's where to grab it -very- cheap, and it is definitely well worth it.I recommend this game.At the full price? No, definitely not. But on offer? Sure, why not. What are the noticeable differences?Models -are- better, I'm not sure if people are just wearing nostalgia-goggles but I can see a clear difference. Enough for me to see there was an improvement.Text is far clearer, overall It just looks... neater. More crisp, the entire game does. While some people like the looks of the original (as do I) I see nothing wrong with an updated version. And yes you can get HD packs with Mods, but some people might not trust mods, etc. Also, one thing I've seen throughout a boat-load of reviews is people complaining they took Conflux away (The elemental nation) those who think that clearly don't remember that faction was an Expansion. It was not in the original game, not even the creatures were if I recall correctly. I'm hoping they release the updated expansions though, that's when It'll be worth your hard-earned money. What is HoMM?Some people might have never even heard of this game, and most of the reviews I've seen are just pointing out the differences and not explaining what the actual game is.Heroes of Might and Magic III is a turn-based Fantasy strategy game. You play a faction of your choice (Or depending on the scenario a specific one) based on many different mythological fantasies.First up is the Castle. These are the humans of the game, based on high-fantasy humanity, Griffins, Pikemen, Swordsman, Knights, etc. Fairly basic, not too much fantasy there, but still a fun game.Fortress: This is a Swamp-based faction, such as Lizard men, Dragonfly, Gorgon and even Hydra. Most of these creatures all follow that theme.Dungeon: Pretty much what it says on the box. Beholders, Minotaur, Black Dragon, Beholders, Naga, the things you can expect in a higher-fantasy underground based faction.Rampart: The true 'high fantasy' faction, in my eyes. Dwarves, Elves, Unicorn, Centaur. These are the woodland creatures which are staple in nearly all high fantasy settings.Tower: This is the 'magical' faction, so to speak. Magi, Animated Golem, Gargoyles and Genie are the sort of units you'll expect from here.Necropolis: Much like the dungeon, it's self explanatory. Skeletons, Undead, Lich, Vampires, etc. The darkest of the factions focused on the risen dead.The game is played on an 'overhead map' where you control a hero with a certain set of movement, exploring the map and fighting monsters. Capturing things like Gold Mines and Crystal mines will generate those resources each turn (very valuable). The aim of the game is to simply beat your enemy in most scenarios. Although there are some specific campaign levels and scenarios where you have to achieve a certain objective, such as Kill X, take Y or find Z.Upon engaging an enemy you effectively zoom into a turn-based battlefield where your units are on one side and the enemy's are on the other. It's your job to command your troops (Each has specific health, attack, etc) and simply kill all the enemy (Unless they retreat)Each type of unit will stack into one group unless you split them and choose otherwise. (For example you can have a near unlimited amount of units in a single stack as long as they are the same troop, EG. 14 Swordsman) The way you recruit units is by going into your cities and Purchasing the required buildings. You may only build one a turn so you should think things through before you buy them. For example, the game revolves around a weekly/monthly system, where each turn is one day. At the start of the week you can buy a fresh set of recruited troops. So it's often best on the later days of the week to either buy a building that unlocks new troops, or purchase something that increases the amount of men you generate per week, such as the Griffon Bastion in the Castle faction (Generates extra griffon a week).In conclusion it's a fairly decent game, It has it's problems now as it also had it's problems then, is it worth the full price they're asking? No, not in my opinion. But if you can grab it on offer? Yeah, I'd say it's worth it. Even more so if you use Steam as your sole games platform. As stated at the top at the time of writing this review you can pick it, and many many more Might and Magic games up on the Humble Bundle.			"

												UBISOFT, don't be lazy and try to ""remaster"" Armageddon's Blade and Shadow of Death too.Now, the HD mod that many praises only gives you a zoom out on the whole screen to support higher resolutions and that's it. No changes to textures/sprites/bitmaps.  So it's hardly the same thing.This HD edition is based on vanilla Heroes III that has only one campaign, Restoration of Erathia. Also, Random Map Generator was added in Armageddon's Blade, along with other additions like Conflux town, more artifacts, etc.  I have GoG Complete version, even big box Heroes Complete Collection and I bought this too. It's a nice feeling to play the game that gave me so much wonderful memories. I've played the demo of this game for weeks even tho it was only one map with limited time.The only bad thing is that the chances are very slim for an HD edition for AB and SoD and maybe the price.  This is the same game that many of us played back in '99 so don't hate it because Ubisoft is involved.			"

												Okay, let's get the obvious criticism out of the way: you can buy HOMM 3 plus all expansion packs from GOG for $9.99, which is around £6-£7 depending on the exchange rate. The GOG pack comes with all expansions and adds the Conflux castle and lots of new creatures, and there is a fan-made HD mod that can bump the resolution up to 4000x4000 for picky players. In contrast, this remastered HD edition of HOMM 3 is just the base game, minus the 'random map' option in Single Player mode - so it seems like a lot less. I know all this. I agree with those saying it's a no-brainer in terms of cost: for ~£4 less you get more bang for your buck by buying the original versions from GOG. I have done so, and spent many, many, *many* hours cruising my way through Erathia with my boy Theodorus and our army of Iron Golems. But despite all of the above...I have to say, I really, really like Ubisoft's HD edition, because it looks absolutely gorgeous.  I've only played through half a scenario so far (you might say this is jumping the gun somewhat, but some of the negative reviews already posted are after less than 15 minutes of gameplay so I feel I'm allowed) but I've not encountered any bugs at all, other than the fact I had to prise myself away from the PC to make my dinner. The gameplay is as smooth as it was in the standard HOMM 3 (none of the jerky movements that shake me out of the action when I replay HOMM 2) but the graphics...look, they're not ""HD"" in the standard version of the word. But they are absolutely lovely and you can tell that a lot of love and effort has gone into the enhancements. Everything is so much clearer, and it adds a lot more character to the Hero portraits, Creature portraits and sprites. HOMM 3 does look sorta fuzzy next to them now! I'm currently playing as Tower, my all-time favourite faction in any Heroes game, and I feel like I'm seeing the Heroes and the Creatures all over again. They feel a lot more expressive. So...would I recommend it? Yes. I would. And I really hope that Ubisoft think about converting the expansion packs in future, because holy moly HD Crystal Dragons? Yes please. But!, full disclosure and all that, I only bought the game because it was £5.99 in the Steam sale and would recommend anyone looking to play it to wait until a) it's at a reduced price - at least in line with GOG - or b) Ubisoft add the expanions, if they ever do.Anyway, that's enough of that. There's a Stronghold castle across the way with my name on it.			"

												Okay, so all the negatives you've heard about this game are true.Calling it ""HD"" is a severe overstatement. It's less blurry. That's basically it. It's no remake. Yes, it has literally 1/3rd of the content of the Heroes III Complete pack, and doesn't have the all important random map generator (because it was added in one of the expansions).However! It is Heroes III, and it does look just fine in full screen 1080p. Is that worth $15 to you? Because it definitely is to me. I love Heroes III, and while I don't mind playing the old version, my eyes prefer this one.And let's be honest here. Even without the expansions, there's a TON of content included. Easily 100 hours of stuff. Eventually you'll run out, but by then you'll get your $15 worth.Definitely recommended, despite the flaws.			"

												You know what's really sad.. in 1999 3DO released Heroes of Might and Magic III. I played that game for _years_. Not only have I been playing it since I was around 9 years old, I've probably put thousands of hours into it altogether.That said, I have never seen a single bug. I'm not saying that they don't exist, but they sure as hell were not obvious. The game was so polished that to this day it remains the iconic and definitive version of the HOMM series.As we know, Ubisoft has done a remake of the game in HD. They claim to have repolished some 20k+ assets. I've played about 11 hours (according to steam) and in those 11 hours have noticed blatant, unacceptable, almost laughable bugs. Its so amazing what damage can be done to a product when the motive behind producing it is money, instead of the gratification of doing a good job and being proud of what you get to share with people.Example bugs:1. I went to move my battle dwarf, and instead of the battle dwarf moving sound, it played the death sound from an enemy unit I recently killed, _every_ _single_ _step_. And it wasn't just my dwarf! When the enemy moved his it played the same sound! Its as if the data got mixed up somehow. Maybe a dangling pointer? In any case, certainly no excuse for it considering the original never exposed an issue like that.2. These ""HD"" ground clutter sprites frequently bug out and cause the grid to be able to be highlighted and its color change to that of a valid state, as if you could move there. The old version correctly changed to the ""cannot move there"" cursor - every time.3. The game flat out stops when it receives WM_KILLFOCUS from the Windows message pump. Not ""stops rendering"" or ""stops audio"". I mean the game stops. It pauses everything. So you can't end your turn and do something else while the AI runs their turn. You can't even click on your castle and alt tab out to load a youtube video or something. Granted, not a bug, but totally unnecessary change.4.Arbitrary extremely weird glitches like a unit just jumping places for no reason and moving back. It just overall feels unpolished, untested, and unfinished. It was clearly released because after every single HOMM release since HOMM5, ubisoft has been flooded with comments from HOMM players expressing how far they have deviated from Heroes III and how they should just make that but updated. Well, Ubisoft did it. I still play it because the bugs aren't game breaking, its easy for me to run and keep game states, and its a good game that 3DO made. Its still fun despite the bugs! I feel like they took a group of intern artists for 6 months to do all the assets, and then a few engineers spent a couple months porting it over. Other than that, no love was given to the polish of the game. I get all happy when I load it up, but then just kind of frown inside and go ""..okay.. thanks for this I guess I'll take it.."" as I load up a map.			"

The only thing which doesn't reflect on the game would be the expansions and the random map generator. I would hope that this comes out within the year as some DLC.Old gamers get it and support the franchise.			"

												You know, most of the people here are giving this version a bad review, and I will have  an opinion in contrast  to them. Now, before you get on the hate wagon, hear me out. I am a diehard heroes fan, I have played them all since the begining and just want to state this. Heroes 3 is off course, my favorite, and I really wanted to see it in HD. For this , I am grateful to Ubisoft that they did it. I like the new sprites and the graphical overhaul , you really can tell the difference especially on a bigger screen. Yes I am aware of the comunity patch too- this version does look better  because of the updated models. Now, could they have done more on these money and gave us the expansions? Definately, and with this I agree with the general consensus, they are stretching it... I would recomend this game on a sale, definately. The HD graphics and sprites do look sweet, for a Heroes 3 fanboy like me it does worth it. I did pay 15 euros and I am happy with my purchase so far. It is a decent price I think for a HD remake - many say is to much, but in the end, it is the producer's work that they put value on -  (they could have included the expansions though-that's my biggest beef with Ubisoft). The GOG version, yes that is very good, I have that version too, I buyed this for the HD overhaul, and in this regard it has not dissapointed me.@Ubisoft- Guys, I have paid the full 15 euros price on Steam, no keys from other retailers, no sale. My only request to you is this: Please make Armageddon's Blade and Shadow of Death HD too and put a decent price tag on them. I will buy them if you do, and I am sure many Heroes fans will, despite their negative comments here on Steam.

												For the complainers: Please you guys complain on everything already and then I check out the total game play ""1.1hours"", play atleast 10hours before give this game a review. I know there are no expantions and no random map generator but Ubisoft spent like 30000hours of this. You guys have a chance to experience this game again, even thought you can get the complete version for 10euro and why not give the map editor a chance and make some own maps?BTW in my OPINION I can see a big diffrence in this HD version, I have the complete version on cd and then I comparing the old and new I see a big diffrence. I really hope they will release the expantions to the game but they problaby wont do thatBut buy it if you want to, I think it's worth it			"

												Many people complain about the lack of content, I understand that, but there is a explanation why that is...Ubisoft weren't the original developers of the game, so the source code (which is required for the expantion packs) is gone. Ubisoft only had the code for the base game, which they polished. I like what they managed to do, the game does have the updated feel to it. While I doubt this will happen, I hope ubisoft will re-write the code for the expantions, but if they don't- I don't see why the community cant implement the content trough mods. This review doesnt tell much about the gameplay of the game itself, so I might update the review someday, I just wanted to get the word out that the game aint as bad as people claim it to be- it just lacks the content everyone was used to have.

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. Many other people compare this to the expansions but the steam version does not claim it is the complete edition. The best part of the steam version is the ability to use the steam friends menu to join games. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play great game ether solo or with friends.			"

												Very fun is you like the turn-based games. HOWEVER the damage is RNG so if you don't pray to RNGesus you're going to lose. The expansions are not included, curious to see if they come along after. Added a new castle type and atrifacts, etc.If you enjoyed the original you will live this. If you are not a fan of the series, you probably shouldn't pick this up.			"

												Not sure about the hate for this remakeIn my experience it's not buggy, animation can be but all it requires is the combat animation speed to be increasedThis game is timeless and always will be, the HD lifting is superb and breathes life into a game that it borderline too graphically inferior to have a load of play time these days.Has never crashed or bugged out for me. Online works a treat and the expansions are unnecessary, only way to play this game is with the Archangel on the main title screen and him fighting the Devil on the loading screen, vintage!If there's one game from the early age of great computer games that deserves a HD remake it's this one. Way and always will be the greatest fantasy game ever made.Money well spend and would buy again, 10/10 "

												To all those saying this version doesn't have good graphics and the hd patch is the same they are completely wrong. I have both versions and this one has far superior graphics.What the unofficial hd patch does is blow the map portion up to 1920x1080 so it fills your screen. It doesn't increase the resolution of any of the assets, and probably most irritating to me, it doesn't rescale the UI to match the larger resolution. So yeah, you see a huge area of map all shrunk down, but all the icons and creatures and towns are tiny! I actually had to downsize my res to like 1400 something just so I could read the text without squinting.The HD remake here on steam is a ton better. It displays in 1920x1080 but it keeps the correct scaling of UI and creatures. And they look really nice, they have been touched up for this edition.So all these people complaining about price, really you get what you pay for sometimes, or wait for a sale. I got my copy of a humble bundle. Although I do understand missing the expansions, that could be a deal breaker. But just want to put to rest the idea that the hd patch is equal to this remake- it's not at all. This version is comfortable to play and definitely doesn't feel like a 15 year old game.			"

												Great game, it's so good to play it online without problems. There are many trolls and haters on internet. I apreciate Ubisoft efforts to make Heroes 3 come back to life, with new players and community.The graphics look great, support for widescreen/resolutions it's great, working multiplayer it's great.Heroes 3 Complete from GoG don't work good on x64 systems (Windows 7+), don't work good with multiplayer (even with Hamachi).I'm just waiting to Ubisoft release the expansions (recriate it?).

Haven't had a single problem with it, so the others whinging clearly need to learn how to PC.- No FPS stutter at all, must be tough having a PC that can't run a 15 year old game.- While no RMG, you still have the map editor so can still run custom game types.- Graphic enhancements are noticeable. - Developers have said they were working on getting the expansions sorted, why cry?There is no reason to not buy this through steam, unless you're cheap. The game runs flawless, just get a real PC.			"

												--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------DONT BELIEVE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here is why:1. Most of them are complains about the missing addons   - They don't have the source code, so no DLC-stuff going on   - They told everyone in the first place that the addons are not included   (you can't judge a company for giving you exactly, what they promised you)   - Complains about missing faction and map-generator are invalid too,      because they are content from the addons2. ""They didn't add actual features to the game""   - We all know that Ubisoft would have f*cked it up, if they did ;)   - It's a freakin HD-Version, dafuq did you expect?3. ""It only shows the left upper corner of the game""   - Disable the scaling of your screen and you're fine. Or change compatibility options for this specific .exe4. ""It only has 30 fps""   - SERIOUSLY?!?! Is there ANY argument, that is more irrelevant than that?   (Since when did we start playing games, because of fps? Do you need 60 fps to play chess?!)5. ""There is no LAN-support""   - That's true, but hey, you have Steam.If you bought the game, without knowing that the addons (and all of their features [obviously]) are not included...well...then it's really your own fault. Please don't criticise the developers/publishers when you were too lazy to read, what you want to buy there.PLUS=> There are hundreds of fan-made maps on the internet and they are ALL compatible with this game No need for random maps. I mean these random maps were...meh...in the original, weren't they?The game is, what they promised us. It looks wonderful in HD and is compatible with higher resolutions andaspect ratios. Is it worth the price? That's yours to decide^^ <cough> Steam-Sales </cough>EDIT:I recieved more feedback on this review than I expected and I think I should clarify some things since I was in an angry mood, when wrote the above lines.I played and enjoyed Heroes of Might & Magic III since my childhood and I started playing it once again with the addons some time ago. I am not going to tell you that one version is better than the other, the simple reason for this is, that it depends on personal preferences which one to go with. When I was young I didn't have a random map generator, even better, I played the same map over and over again with my friends (Realm of Chaos) and I assure you it was great fun.It is in fact very unfortunate that they lost the source code of the addons. I would be angry too, if they sold the addons later as DLCs, but I am sure they would have implemented them if they could.For me, The Restoration of Erathia is the heart and the soul of this game and I am very happy to see it shining with better texture quality :) The price might be discussable, I give you that, but in the end it depends on what you want.If you feel that the random maps (even though I didn't really like them, because they are...well...generic) are essential for the game or that you cannot enjoy this masterpiece without Conflux, the neutral creatures the artifacts and let us not forget the mod-addons ""Wake of Gods"" and ""Horn of the Abyss"" than feel free to buy the GoG-Version.I personnaly can live without the addons and mods (btw. I didn't like Conflux. I want to see ""Forge"". I mean this is a Science-Fantasy-Universe after all, as we saw in Might & Magic VI ""The Mandate of Heaven"", which you should play too). I only want a more beautiful version of the original and that is, what I got. Is that enough for you? Maybe not, but I am not the one to judge that. Have fun playing what ever version you want <3			"

												Don't listen to the negative reviews.  If you can read the store page, you know that the game doesn't come with the expansions, and therefore, have no right to create a reivew complaining about the lack there of.The HD edition plays very well.  Online multiplayer works great.  The community is already going to work to fill in the gaps that Ubisoft left; there's already a random map generator utility.  Users will create mods that add the expansion content and the mods from the original Heroes 3 game eventually, so just wait on the purchase if you can't live without those.			"

												This is a welcome HD update of the best Might n' Magic of the bunch.  Might be me, but I think it looks much better than the GOG version with the HD mod.  It sounds better, too.  Yes, it's the original Restoration of Erathia game with no expansions, which is somewhat disappointing.  I haven't experienced any problems so far, but I don't play multiplayer.  Comes with a map editor, too, so hopefully we'll soon see some community-made maps.Not perfect, but a solid recommendation. I hope this release rekindles interest in this great old game!			"

It was made to be single player and a game takes quite a long time to play, and that is with the computer taking 5 seconds for his turns.Don't let all the negative review detur you from buying this game, all of them enjoyed it back in 1999.

												BEFORE YOU JUDGE, READ! Thank you :)I have been reading quite some reviews now, and as far as i can see, none of them recommends this game. I can agree with most of them, since i am a HUGE Heroes 3 fan, I have played it for as long as I can remember, and it's a shame to se content lost. For example the random map generator that everybody loves, and just admit it, it could not have been hard to just add it. But I have also read alot of reviews saying that there is a lot of bugs and clitches, but me and two of my friends have been playing for some hours and no one of us has experienced that, the game itself runs flawless, over the internet. Though it's true that I prefer the gameplay of Heroes 3 Complete I think that this is a step in the right direction. I highly recommend this for people who havn't played the game before, and I do enjoy the graphical changes. What I really hope for is that Ubisoft can see all these reviews and add all the features that we all miss, and add the expansions for free, and they will se many of those red thumbs turn green. But just remeber, doing this was better then doing nothing, because going via Steam secures a future for the game.			"

Look at the title. It is the normal game. The diffrents:- 1 town. Conflux its called. (The Element Castle)- Random map button- Some campains+ Multplayer ONLINE over Steam. How great is that? At the old days you needed a freaking cable from 1 computer to another. Isn't great that you can now do it wireless, over the internet?!+ HD TexturesThey said it was because they lost the souce code for the complete edition (An ekstra castle, campains and random map generator) You paid for the first version of the game, and here you have it. If you are so mad (because you think you do not get the full game) Then buy the Complete Edition. Or hope Ubisoft will recreate the source codes and make the Element Castle and the Campains as a DLC :)I hope you understand the diffrents now and know why.			"

												A rerelease of a great classic. Sadly the GOG version contains more content for cheaper. I read somewhere that they only got the RoE code from NWC, but GOG has the complete edition, so I'd have to guess there are legal issues as to why they didn't include AB or SoD. The game is definitely crisper, but given that the GOG version exists, the price is far too much for the content you get. I only recommend it if you're a scrub like me and need to own every Heroes product.			"

												The game is great, the music is great, the gameplay itself is great. What isn't great is how Ubisoft are going to be money hungry bastar()ds and probably ask for more money for the expansions of this game. Because it is just the base game. It could be a lot worse. I recommend this game, despite it's big flaws. It's a really great game if you ignore all the Ubisoft laziness and half arsed release of the best Heroes game ever made.Also first time launching this game through its launcher. Ubisoft logo popped up. Immediately I wanted to erase that from my screen to keep it out of my head. AVG pops up and thinks the launcher is a virus. Through my frantic pressing of buttons to get away from Ubisoft, I accidentally said yes to removing the file. Thanks Ubi, you guys had to put your logo and got me to remove the game launcher.  I can start the game normally now, but out of ALL the cutscenes and logos when you start it, only the Ubisoft one is unmissable. I suppose they need it though, because if they disappeared one day no one would actually miss these money hungry hippos. Here's hoping that they will finish the god damn game without getting us to pay more money. Yeah right. Like Ubisoft would ever be kind to the community.EDIT: Censors should only censor one fricken word. Change Ubisoft to ******* pls.			"

Devs responded and I hope They will integrate Workshop for this game and let same community who kept this GEM of the game alive, keep it alive so future COD and LOL generation gamers see what a real video game looks like. Even if they don't like it atleast give us older guys just a have a little more fun before every game gets COD like. So Far I Don't Recommend this game, Thought there is nothing wrong with it  little bug now and there but devs promissed to fix it as soon as possible but what game had a bugless first day relese .  And Fix The Multyplay .. THIS IS THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT THIS GAME SO I DON'T HAVE TO PORT FOWARD / GET RANDOM DCS becouse of using virtual lan programs like hamachi  or  tunngle IT STATES STEAM SUPPORT. YOU GOT ENOUGH MONEY 2 BUY A SERVER FOR A GAME THAT WAS MADE 15 YEARS AGO.So for all thoes negative comments about ""GAME IS MISSING EXPANSIONS OMGDASGJASGKSAJG... They never promised Expansions and If you wanna play ANY expansion map Click here Beta RMG and EXPANSIONS MAPS Pros	  Good Graphic Nostalgia Feels Community doing devs job (PC MASTER RACE MDFKA) Cons	 too expensive for half done jobno Workshoponly few achivmentsThey Need to Fix MultyplayTHIS REV was made +1 day after relese  so I Will update as time passesTLDR:Wait for steam sale and Workshop /Mods			"

												as a huge fan of the original game I expected a lot from this game. the first time I launched it and started a game was to play my default choice which is obviously the Random Map feature.I was REALLY disappointed to see the lack of this option in the game which caused me almost instantly to feel I was ripped off (as I think this is the most important feature made and is essential!).so I started the campaign playing through the first mission I was getting the feeling that the implementation is not as smooth as i'd like it to be (the game is lagging, softwarish speaking, as the hardware is not the bottleneck here) some buildings look like they could use a little bit more of an ""artist touch"" as many of the renewed elements got.I expected Ubisoft to push the extra mile and deliver the ""Complete"" edition and was kinda disappointed to see that this was only ""The Restoration of Erathia"".In the options there is an option to pick ""SD"" or ""HD"" editions while playing, the SD edition changes everything to original (like icons, downgrading the resolution of things, etc) but its way more blurry than the original game and could use some tuning to be more real.nevertheless I think the game did not lose its Magic in the process which is a big deal because the modern gaming industry giants tend to mess things up for money (I would not be surprised to see a ""DLC"" for a Random map feature, ""Armageddon's Blade"", ""The Shadow of Death"", maybe even ""In the Wake of Gods"", ""Horn of The Abyss"" [but thats  never gonna happen])edit: formatting			"

												I have played this game for literally thousands of hours over the years, and I am happy to say that it is just as much fun now as I was decades ago. Many series connoisseurs consider this one to be the best, and when it comes to fluidity, ease of play and sheer addictiveness, they may be right. A fantasy world bursting with diversity just waiting to be explored paired with quick, satisfying turn-based strategic battles make this one a winner.This HD version is just what you would expect: sharp, cleaned-up graphics with very little else changed. Be aware that the game has not been optimized for widescreen, so you will see large bars on the left and right of the screen keeping it in its original aspect ratio. Also be aware that you are only getting the original Heroes III release with this and NOT the expansions, Armageddon's Blade and Shadow of Death, the former of which introduces an entire new faction and many units as well as thousands of hours of campaign fun. If you want that, you will have to get Heroes III Complete, available from a number of other reputable sellers.In summary, if you have never played Heroes III before, want to give it a try and insist on HD visuals, pick this one up. I would not recommend it to those who already have Heroes III Complete, as the graphics upgrade is very small and does not make much of a difference to the experience, at least to me. If you prefer content over a small graphics boost, consider purchasing Heroes III Complete, which is a much greater experience on many levels and is available for this same price or less.			"

												Played this a lot with my friends recently, and I have to say, the hassle with gameranger is gone now with the online support which makes me more motivated to actually bother playing it again. I have little to no trouble at all with any bugs like people seem to keep mentioning. And everyone who is saying ""But there is no random map generator!"" That may be true, but if you do have the original HoMM 3  that map creator has that feature, and you just make sure to make a Restoration of Erathia map and save the files into HoMM 3 HD map folder, I've done this and it works just fine.No there is no expansions available, but from what I heard and understand that was never announced to even be added with this game remake, if anyone actually bought it before reading up on that then it's on you, I'd strongly recommend this to anyone who has time to kill and don't want to deal with the whole Gameranger crap.And obviously I can't speak for everyone about the bugs, I guess I'm fortunate and Ubisoft will have to fix this cause I do agree that the price is indeed quite ridiculous for not having the expansions and the bugs people seem to have.But all in all, I'd recommend this game to anyone still.

												Lets put this straight. This is only Restoration of Erathia, so no AB content, no SoD content. But lets forget about it for a while.I was around 7 or 8 years old when my sister gave me heroes 3. I still remember amazement that came with buying first Magog, succesful completion of Key to Victory, cheating (yes, i did it! for some time). It became my favourite game immediately. And now, it came back. With a bit of diffrence.Title says it's HD. To be honest, I haven't noticed much change at first - some units had more details, everything looked a bith more smooth - but devs allowed players to decide if they want to see the game in HD or as it was when it firstly came out. And then, you can see how much they did. Job well done. Apart of graphics, nothing has been changed in game mechanics - and bless the devs. So if you are H3 Veteran, and would love to see RoE in new clothes - buy it. If you have only heard of H3 - buying this game would be the best you could do - you just wouldn't miss Addons content - game is great even without them. One thing i'd love to know - will addons be relased? And will they be free, or (knowing Ubi) relased as paid DLCs?			"

												Same problem with Dark Souls 2.Too much expectatations.Which reasults in this flaming, don't get me wrong, some of the points in the negative review are fully valid. But being a fan of Heroes III I can safely say the gameplay has not been touched at all.Much of the features are still the same which I am glad to see and it does make me feel all nostalgic.But the price of it is too much to an average person......unless you're like me, whose a die-hard fan. All in all, it's a pretty decnt classic to have on steam but for the price I suggest you wait till it drops before even considering. "

												I'm a big fan of the Heroes of Might and Magic series (i own all 6 Boxed) and Honestly I'm not surprised that Ubisoft screwed with their fans once again. Not only is there barely any content, the game looks more like HoMM V. Truly I didnt expect Ubisoft being able to screw something this good up.*AFTER PLAYING MY FIRST MATCH*Okay, the game is running very nicely, It dosent look much better but there is definitely a improvement. (You can see that using the HD/SD option in the Pause Menu)Do i miss the maps that i have in the HoMM III Complete? A bit but it shouldn't be a problem and they will be able to play in the HD Remake in a short period of time.NOTE: There already are ways to transfer maps on the forumsI'd say its worth the 12 GBP that i've paid, im happy so far and i hope they introduce the Steam Workshop to this game, it will benefit the game and community greatly.

												I've had zero problems with the game. At the time of writing I've played two full games of multiplayer and I've yet to notice any of the ""many glitches"" mentioned here. I knew what I was buying; an HD-edition of the vanilla Heroes 3. Some people still seem to expect content from the expansions, and that puzzles me. Ubisoft was very open about the content you would be purchasing.If you want the better deal, go buy the complete edition on GoG.com. No question about it. If you, however, want to support the franchise in an attempt to motivate Ubisoft into fleshing out any upcoming titles, then I recommend buying this game. Vanilla Heroes 3 is still fantastic.			"

												Do not listen to idiots, who complain that this is not a version with Expansions - from the get-go Ubisoft said it will only be a HD version of Restoration of Erathia and Expansions will be released later on. People also do not understand what HD Edition means: the game is being RESTORED form it's original version, not build from scratch, so they can't do magic and transform it to today's graphic standards. Remember, it's a seventeen years old game. They still did a far better job than guys with Age of Empires II. The workmanship's solid and game looks more fresh, while playing in higher resolutions. What's good:Classic HOMM3 in all it's gloryHotseat as fun as seventeen years agoWhat needs work:Online playing (game can get hicups or crash) Can sometimes be glitchy on certain computers (works smoothly on my laptop, but tends to crash on my older home pc)			"

												disregard pretty much every negative review on here. Everyone is all upset about the game only including the original base game. It never stated that it included anything else, you shouldn't negatively review a product because it doesn't have something it never said it hadThey are also upset that it didn't include a map generator, kinda understand, and it'd be nice if they brought it back, howeverRandom Map Generator SUCKED, always has, always will, what keeps Heroes 3, map wise, alive, is people making maps, not just playing horrible generated maps that are unbalanced and unimaganitive. There IS a map maker in this game, if you want to play custom maps, make your own. If you don't want to make your own, go download the hundreds if not thousands of custom maps out there. They STILL WORK with this HD version (i just tested)Now, there's really only one major thing this game needs, steamworks workshop. I TRUELY believe that if this game had a workshop, for people to show and make available their maps they make, it would be immensely better. Though considering previous maps do work and any map maker can put their map out there on some other website, it's not manditory, it would just bring things together a bit more			"

												I played the original with my friend all the time when I was little. Some of the addons/dlc's are not in this, but this is a version where I can play it on steam without having to torrent the game to be able to play this. If you have the regular game on a disk, then I recommend sticking to that but I like playing this game either way. Also, Ubisoft, if they are still considering updating this game will probably add the random map generator and also the dlc's but don't get your hopes up if you expect to have a full HD game. Still one of my favourite old games 7/10 , could add more to make this more complete but still a good game.			"

												It's a fresh breeze of the same old but looking slightly better. Nostalgic. I can only recommend this for people like me who used to play this in their childhood with their childhood friend. It has an online option so it's a good excuse to do something again with your childhood friend that you might not see so often anymore due to studying or whatever.If you do not mind at all for graphics, go play the old hom3 without worry of missing anything. You might think ""What did they improve at all?"" but the creatures and towns and noticeably better than the original version.If you cannot play without the expansions, go play the old hom3 without worry of missing anything. I for one played before the expansions and they mean very little to me, so I do not miss them.The price is abit steep, but it's about as expensive as going to the cinema with two people. So hey, that sort of justified it for me. But that's my opinion. Just buy this for nostalgic purposes with a friend.Be warned though, sometimes the game just drops a player, I'm not sure exactly why or when but it does. In my opinion the game could definetly use some more polishing besides the art like being able to play your turns at the same time, which is not possible.This barely made it to recommendable, just for the purpose of nostalgia with a friend including a fresh breeze in the way of the game's art.

												(This review reflects the game itself, be it purchased in 1999 or now. It does not cover the actions of, or my opinions on Ubisoft)Heroes of Might & Magic III is nothing short of magnificent.It is the one game I always come back to, and always install on every computer I own. Since its release in 1999 it quickly became a family favorite, and to this day we still start up large hot seat games at family gatherings (though we rarely finish them). I have sunk countless hours into this game, and I am still not bored with it. I am still excited by exploring the map, I still love the artwork and unique factions, and the music still inspires awe and wonder. As a result I was certainly excited to see it on Steam. Heads up though, this is version does not yet have the expansions, but will offer multiplayer support! ---------Everything about this game works exceptionaly well. -Despite being near 16 years old the aesthetic of the game is still very beautiful and appealing. Which makes exploring maps and playing your favorite factions that much more enjoyable.- The Factions are well balanced and delightfully unique. Each having their own awesome theme and excellent musical scores. Despite haveing played it for so long I am still somewhat of a casual player, so if you talked with some of the pros they could better critique the faction ballance. But I do know enough to say this: To Hell with Conflux! Oh, and I love Fortress and Castle dearly!- The Music is fantastic. Every biome, faction, and item on the map has its own music or soudbyte which plays on or in proximity to the location. As your hero moves across the map the music and ambient sound changes to fit your location. This promotes a wonderful atmosphere while exploring, and makes for a very enjoyable experience. Each of the factions have their own score crafted for them to fit their themes, and in a text review, I will not be able to do them justice. If you want a taste then I suggest that you briefly look up the theme music for Fortress (my favorite), Stronghold, and Necropolis. I should mention before ending this note that the music was the work of Paul Romero who I salute for his dedication and hardwork which made Heroes III that much better!-The game mechanics and overall design is solid and intuitive. I have introduced the game to many friends and all of them took the game quickly. It was built upon the framework set up in Heroes 1 and 2, and it refined the system found in those games. It is clear that a lot of thought went into crafting this title.-----------------I adore this game. Everything about it is as close to flawless as anygame can aspire to be. I would like to think it is a labor of love, and it really shows. And for those who are lead to doubt by its age, it aged well. To this day there is little I could criticize as a result of the passing of time. The Music is fantastic, and the art is still beautiful.I understand that I may not have articulated my thoughts very well, so let me end with this point. The HOMM series is approacing seven titles now. And Heroes III is still considered by the grand majority of fans to be the undisputed champion. Most of the other games are also quite good, but they just cannot quite compare to the greatness achieved by Heroes III. It has almost become something of a problem for later releases in the series. Despite their own merits and achievments, the other games are still measured against Heroes III, and as a result are judged by it. But I do recommend you give the other games a try as well.Heroes III is the Titan of the Heroes series, and for good reason. It is a masterpiece, and still stands amongst the greatest turn based stradegy games ever made.Long Live the King!			"

Honest review, as a HOMM3 fan, I enjoy this and the graphics are really nice, everything looks crisp and it runs pretty well.Apart from not being able to speed up the mouse speed in the game. I'd recommend this to anyone who want's the old HOMM3 experience along with upgraded graphics and without the hassle of hamachi and game ranger to play multiplayer.I'm fairly happy with the looks of the game, lack of scenarios is a little annoying (the same as base game) if they ever come out with the DLC's , it would be worth it 100%.

												My thoughts... Pros: 1. The game looks heaps better! 2. Multi Player function works very well! (easy to create a game and then invite friends from your steam friends list)3. Save games, connectivity is good Cons:1. Does not come with expansion (no extra maps, no Conflux, no random map generator) 2. $16.95 is a little too pricey for what you get3. Slight delay when ending turn and when completing combat I am having fun on this game and so would recommend it. I think the majority of people, including me to a degree expected more completeness. I am really hoping they include more maps/the expansion. It would really suck if we had to buy downloadable content. I am having fun playing this classic childhood game			"

												Read People. It even says: ""Important note: Heroes III – HD Edition content is based on the original 1999 game: The Restoration of Erathia"" under ""About This Game""It doesn't say Heroes of Might and Magic III Complete does it? It says original Restoration of Erathia. Stop giving negative reviews because you can't even make the effort to see that it's not complete.Anyway it is a great game and the HD uplift does make the game look lovley. The turn based style and battling are great and can entertain hours on end. Now it isn't complete so $15 is kind of a lot. The game has decent depth, but seeing how you can buy the complete version that has 2 full expansions at GOG for $10 it makes this game not seem worth the buy. If you're a die hard fan like me, you'll get it anyway. If you're on the fence, you should wait for a sale. It's good enough for me to vote positive, but Ubisoft should release the expansion packs, and the random map generator.Pretty much, if you have the complete version, you may want to give this port a pass. If you're new, starting with this is a good decision. The HD does look nice though, and at least they kept the map editor!			"

												Right let me give everyone an Insight on The HD Edition and the Orignal becaused I owned the classic game back in the day and I brought The Heroes Of Might & Magic Collection which has all the Heroes games with DLC all the way up to Heroes V sometime ago. Let me just start with this, Yes Ubisoft is doing very poorly right now due to their last years Overhyped games. This is actaully the first good thing they have done in awhile, releasing Heroes 3, the one Heroes game most who played it loved, They know that people loved this game that why they are releasing it now, because they took heavy hits last year.However I bare you some bad news and this is all from my fond memory when I used to play Heroes 3 without it's DLC, The Orignal without DLC never even have A Map Maker, only with Later DLC it did. so with that chances are their will be DLC not free however.On the other hand you maybe thinking ""Oh I can just get the Orignal or Collecters and play that on my Computer"" good luck with that, you see the old game even with Collecters (Which I own currently) chances are you may expreance Crashes quite often due to the age of the game and it has not been Optimized for newer computers. HD fixs those problems, hence why I brought it, not to mencion play the game with another Heroes fan that loved this game as a kid.So in Summary, chances are there maybe DLC ""Maybe"" not like the DLC gave you Map Maker, A New Faction to play with, More Heroes and more Creatures. If you are a fan of Heroes Of Might And Magic I would still recomend it get it still if you want to play it again without crashes and with Friends. It's still the Heroes Game I remembered back in the day.			"

												Not sure why everyone is ♥♥♥♥♥ing about lack of expansion content (random map generator, press space bar to re-enter, conflux) when it was made well known that this version would not include expansion. I played through one single scenario so far and really didn't experience any major issues. It's the same great game (without expansions) that it ever was with some updated graphics. I haven't tried out multiplayer yet, and I hear some complaints, but I'm hoping it works as well as single player did for me since it is one of the reasons I bought it rather than just sticking with the old version.The only complaint I have so far is that the bottom resource bar looks really goofy with all the extra room on the left now. Not sure what the best way to go about fixing this would be though, maybe some extra info like income and daily resource intake or some stats like creatures raised/killed, or something like that.

												I've played this game since it was first released and yes this may not feel like the original, But i really don't care. Its on steam and its playable and thats what i wanted. I believe it says hd not complete so stop complaining. Of the expansions i really only wanted armageddon's blade.Map generator i can live with out half the maps it made i found where just unplayable i prefer fan made maps anyway release a map pack for it charge $15 for it. Cod games can do it.I'm very happy they didn't change much on original.Buy on gog they say why would I I'm invested in steam.(i want to play all my games at the same place)I can just buy heroes 3 complete on ebay which i did i have 4 copies of heroes 3 complete. Im just happy EA never had it... I want alpha centuari on steam or even red alert 1 or 2. EA Sigh......Just be happy its still around :)About game so far while playing:- Mouse cursor laggy in HD. SD is fine.- Display of play screen is off centre.- Blah can't seem to re-vist mines, creature dwelling etc... with spacebar.- Overall display is better. Creatures, towns etc.- AI appears the same.- Multiplayer for me is buggy ''out of sync with players who join my games'' but can join others fine at moment.- Game has not crashed yet for any reason.(Homm3 Complete crashed alot in multiplayer for me)			"

												Update:  I changed my review from negative to positive after 2 hours of play.  You can see the old review below.  The music is the same between original and HD release.  There are 4 combat soundtracks, and 3 is the annoying one.  It isn't that annoying if the sound is turned down some.  Once I had similar sound levels between computers, they sounded identical.  While I haven't seen all units yet, the only one that I consider worse than the original is the pikeman.  The rest seem fine to me.Here is the old review:This is my first impression after playing for 20 minutes.  I have a KVM setup so I can switch between the old version on a Windows XP machine, and the new version on Windows 7, viewing both on the same monitor.My first impression was positive.  The initial screens looked better and more crisp.  The color palette is the same, bright colors that made the original artwork charming.  I then navigated to the combat screen, and that is where I went to a negative rating for the game.  The art for the pikeman was pretty bad.  The archer was ok, and I didn't notice anything glaringly bad about the enemies I was facing.What I found really annoying was the combat music.  On the original version, the music had deeper tones and a good pace.  On the new version, it was this annoying high pitched instrument (flute maybe?).  The pace seemed slightly faster too, making me feel agitated.  Considering that you hear the combat music over and over in this game, bad music can get very annoying.  I am trying to decide if the newer graphics are worth the bad music.  I think my initial feeling is that I would rather play the original.On the positive, this is supported for Windows 7, so if my XP machine dies, at least I have an option to continue playing it.P.S.  The intro video did not appear updated.  I am not surprised, as it would have been a major undertaking for little value.			"

												With all the nay sayers, I have to post. This game redefined the the genre when it came out so many years ago and I am pleased to see it come back out again. With the edition of online multiplayer, the game can be enjoyed more openly then with thew original hot seat or LAN. And to everyone saying it's missing content and needs the expansions, stop telling people to not buy. If people don't buy, they wont want to release the expansions. This is a classic of the genre and I am very happy to see it come back. :)			"

												I will write this review because of all those negative reviews. I RECOMMEND THIS GAME. All my memories of Heroes 3 are in this game and beautiful HD graphics. If you are a fan of the series and enjoy this game when it first came out BUY THIS ! Too all those who write about this game and say it's a rip of !-From the start NO ONE TOLD YOU this will have the expansions with it. This is the FIRST heroes of Might and Magic 3 that was first launched and called Restoration of Erathia.-This game had ONLY the map editor and NO Random map generator. That was made from a community and was called Wake of Gods (YES that is NOT official expansion for the Heroes 3)-multiplayer works fine like I saw it.-The extra faction named Conflux (The Elementals) was from the expansion Arageddon's Blade and so it's not in this game.-Every extra senario was added with each of the expansion you added in the game (it was called EXPANTIONS not DLC like everyone is calling it.)So for those who think if you want to buy it or not. This game is exacly what you think it is. The first edition of Heroes of Might and Magic 3 like it was when it first launched. No expansion is in this pack so don't ♥♥♥♥♥ about it like everyone else does. So think positive about this and if you want remade HD graphics the take this and enjoy nostalgia.			"

Sadly the Random Mag Generator for some very **cked up reason isnt on it! seriously?! how hard it is?!However looking into some of the forums i found that using an old mag editor and generating the maps then moving them into the steam game directory works fine, its a bloody hassle but hey! at least i can game online properly with my bro who is half way round the worlddespite the horrific lapse is judgement from the developers regarding the random maps they did an amazing job re-drawing and rendoring all the old graphics! well played lads! still gets an very big thumbs up from me "

												I get a lot of people are disappointed but in all fairness most of the cons are things you could have easily noticed before you bought it. I knew the new textures were a shady deal, I knew this was to milk more people for money and I still enjoyed it. If for nothing else - for the achievements. Multiplayer does work for me with some slight tinkering. And it's already successfully converted one of my friends into the franchise. I would recommend getting the full version as well, but all in all money well spent for me.			"

												Summary:The product description was clear and explicit, hence I knew what to expect and my expectations were pleasantly met. The Erathia base game is pretty much the same as the Complete eddition, aside from small few things. The most important things missing are: unit hotkeys (most people won't notice), artifact combination (happens rarely anyway), 1 town (the worst one at that, but beautfull), random map generator (not for long, as someone is making one), a few other heroes, and a few units), and obviously the campaign, but that's not why you're getting this game anyway. The multiplayer works well, but you do need to go to Firewall and add exception rule for 3 ports (given in the manual of the game that you can find on steam). Overall, the product is an 8/10.PRO:-Most of the stuff works well, the game has slight lag but you probably won't notice it.-MULTIPLAYER :D-Price is alrightCON:-They could have just made the campaign withing a month or 2 tops... (this might come if the game sells well though)-slight lag, and slight things missing compared to complete eddition is a slight pain point-MULTIPLAYER: No ladder??? Also, 8 people can join a 4 player game, and the game doesn't always load on first or even 2nd try... Given that I run powerful rig with fast internet, next to the servers, i shouldn't be experiencing problems, hence we can tell that the problems stem from the poor software or servers (probably software..., duh...)-No replay function, nothing new what so ever.... THe graphics look slightly improved, but I'd rather see stable multiplayer and a rehall of the game without changing any of the gameplay features...DESCISION:Buy if you enjoy multiplayer with random people. DO NOT buy if you're expecting it to be perfect or if you're not a fan of HoMM 3 series because this is not a good representation of the potential that this game carries.			"

												I was aware of the deal on GoG and missing expansions but I gladly paid initial price just to be able to add this old jewel to my steam library...Even ""bad"" Heroes 3 would still be pretty good compared to the successors.They scraped what they could from an old game (allegedyl there were some issues with source code for expansions),refreshed the graphics,added minor multiplayer features and those laughable achievements.Which is just bare minnimum so you can say that they made something new and didn't ruin an old game too much.Welcome to the modern economic era,where everything more than required minimum is obsolete.Ubisoft just did what they do best...earn money.

												Great game.Used to play this game a lot growing up, it's nice to see the updated textures and little bit of polish here and there.Great buy for the amount of work that went into restoring it.Outside of the artwork, everything feels the same.I'd really like to see workshop support added, to be able to make full use of the map editor.I'm sure i'll be firing this up every once in a while to get my fix.Multiplayer works great, just make sure your Steam ports are forwarded.

												This game delivers eveything that is promised, at no point was it mentioned that the dlc was included. The game looks amzing, all origional maps are there and the game runs smoothly. While sadly the random map generator is no longer there, it is still possible to create your own maps and alter the already existing one. This game is a classic and is always worth the money; even without the dlc. 10/10 would recommend.			"

												*Edit*I feel it would be dishonest not to mention that I eventually (like a year later) purchased the GOG version of the game along with Hereos Chronicles. It is not because this was a bad HD touch-up. It is due to me wanting to play Hereos but, since I was kind of alone on it, I needed the campaigns to have some fun. This version really has no campaigns to work with so I went with the GOG version and played a ton of that. Side note: Hereos Chronicles is fantastic. I absolutely love this series. They are a little bit easier than I would like, but the story is just oozing charm. They are also quite long! GET THESE.I stand by that this was a good HD remake. The sprite touch-ups are wonderful. However, if you play strategy games solo, you might just want to go for the GOG version. IF you do.... check out Chronicles! I wish I could buy that lot again.*Edit Over*I loved this game. I loved it all my life. When I was a little child up to right now, I have been playing this game for decades. When I saw this was coming to steam, I bought it instantly. For those who say ""blah blah go to gog and buy it there and better..."", sure... you go buy it there. I want it here on steam, so I can play with my friends, not on gog.Okay, onto the review. To start with, the graphics got an interesting update! The castles (towns) look fantastic. They have a nice touch up and makes it look much better. The individual sprites also look nice! They do have a new look to them, but it is not bad. I was expecting to hate this but it turned out I actually like it! The combat screen looks nice and everything has a decent touch up. However, if you do not like the graphical changes, you can select the original graphics in the menu inside game. This will change it back to what you remember as from over a decade ago.What about the music and sounds? Did they mess up the fantastic composition of Paul Romero? No they did not! It is still the same great music you have heard for more than the last decade from many JVC games.Does the multiplayer work? YES! It does! It is easy and you do not have to type in IP adresses anymore. It can be a tad bit sluggish at times, but it is definitely livable and stable. All in all, I definitely think this game was worth 15$. In fact I would buy it again. There is no where near enough JVC games on steam. In fact, MM10 added MM6, and Homm3 was just released- these are the only JVC games on steam that I know of. This game is the pinnacle of turn based strategy games. I am certain others will love it too.New graphic rating- 9/10, I loved 90% of the changes and having the option to go back to old settings anytime I want sold it for me.Sound/Music- 10/10, no changes here, but there needed to be none. I loved these tracks and I would hate to see them get changed. I am relieved that this did not happen.Online- 8/10, It can be a little sluggish but it is all good. No more IPs, No more trouble playing with friends. Gameplay- 10/10, Thankfully unchanged and perfect the way it is.Content- 6/10, No expansion, missing map generator and Conflux, as well as various artifacts and creatures. All of this you can live without, but hopefully this gets patched in. If it does, I will come back and edit this section off.  Overall this game revival gets an 8.5/10. Definitely worth your money. I can already tell that I will spend hundreds of hours playing this whenever I get free time.			"

												Timeless classic! And now I can play it again with updated graphics?  I'm in!  Big Time! Not sure what the haters are talking about. For $15, this is a great value. If they offer more content later via DLC, I'll buy that too!I only wish that other publishers would give other old classics like Master of Orion 2, and X-Com this same treatment.			"

												I really can't see any problem with this remake, the things that are missing are the random maps and the conflux faction (which is not a big loss). Neither I nor my friend had any problems when we played online, it all worked flawlessly, so I would recommend it, sure you can get a complete version on GOG, but that doesn't include a handy friendslist where you can invite your friends from.It's good, trust me, I'm white.

												Heroes of Might & Magic III was pretty much my childhood, I spent countless hours in that game.This new HD remake is absolutely fantastic, it's a shame it doesn't include the two expansion packs but it was explained why on their website for Heroes VII. Now I can enjoy Heroes III with a pretty new skin and without the distortion that you get when playing the original on HD screens.Fantastic game, it is (In every aspect other than the uplifted artwork) exactly the same as the original and therefore just as fun. If you liked the original there is no possible way that you could not like this (Unless you're a whiny prick who doesn't appreciate what's here and only concentrates on the two expansions that are not present. Like 99% of the reviews)Would absolutely recommend.			"

In fact it was said it is just original game. Yes I would like to get my hands on expansions too but that does not mean it is bad product. The game is still exellent as always and new graphics etc are done well. People who truly like the original game will like this for sure. Also I hope they will add all the expansions as well.			"

												Ahh I remember the sweet days where I would sit for hours on end playing Homam with my friends, my brothers and even my dad once in a while. This is truly a nostalgic trip. Now let us go to this HD Remake.Now tomorrow me and my friend is going to play this non stop trough the whole night but I played just for 10 minutes to see that everything was working so on.My reaction is.What did you expect seriously atleast 60% of the negative reviews are mad because they did not get the expansion pack.  So to clearify you buy the original Heroes of might and magic 3 in HD nothign more nothing less.Now when we get that out the way time for pros and cons!Pros:- Very strategic and it allows for countless of strategic movements- Becomes smother in HD - Fun multiplayer- Fun singleplayer campaign.- Has the same feelig as the original game- NO MORE HAMACHI!!!!!Cons:- Multiplayer and single player matches restricted to scenarios (aka you need to play on preset maps with preset amount of players) Ps: Crimson clover I highly recommend.- Multiplayer = you need friends to play with (might work with Steam but in the original it was boring to play against random opponents)Half Cons: (Things not included in the orignal game but they could have done now):- Expansions (probably they will come) - Non scenario Multi and single player- The lobby music to the game is as in the orignal one far to loud so you have to go into the mixer and change it because you can not change that stuff unless you are in a a game otherwise.In all and all. It was the game I payed for. It would have been nice if they would have done something extra for the return of the hd remake but I can not be to cranky about it.8/10 (10/10 if you include my nostalgic rush that feels like I am on crack)Buy the game!

												Beautiful relifting. I especially like the fact that they decided to keep the old graphics and make them switchable with F2. The comparison between SD and HD is clear, but what I'm most content about is being able to play it full screen without losing graphics quality. It's a pity the expansions and the random map generator are missing, but hopefully they will consider adding them even though the source code is lost. Gameplay hasn't changed at all, thankfully. It remains the masterpiece it was before, but with better looking sprites and Steamworks integration. A great gift for the old fans.			"

												This is a game that I haven't played in over a decade, and I was so happy to see it come out on steam.So this is only the restoration of erathia; and many people have said that they were hugely disappointed and gave the game a thumbs down because of two expanisions missing. However I am confident that they will be coming out as DLCs soon (as per usual). This is a game I love, the HD graphics are nice, and a friendly addition to the game. I would recommend this to many current and up-to-date Heroes of Might and Magic Fans, and others who enjoyed games such as the early fallout games, and Baulder's Gate.			"

												Just like the good old Heroes 3, although there is no Conflux in this version. Probably available as a DLC for 20 bucks soon, Ubisoft style :DActually i dont understand why everybody is crying about it, okay they removed the random maps, but they sucked anyways imo. And Conflux was OP as ♥♥♥♥, so im pretty happy that it isnt in the game. They promised the original game remade, and thats what they did.Loved the original, and this version is practically the original, they changed nothing. Online play works which is the most important part for me so i can play with some old friends.Of course you can get it cheaper anywhere else with all the Add-Ons in nonHD, but then you have the problem in the multiplayer with different versions, tried it a lot over the last years, and the multiplayer over Steam Network is just awesome.Recommended			"

												I RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!I have seen that most people are upset about the game not coming with the expansions, but it says ""Heroes® of Might & Magic® III"". It does not say anything about coming out with the expansions.The game quality is very good and playing in HD is great.This is by far one of my most favourite games of all time. The game is the same as the old heroes 3 (Just in HD) that I enjoyed when I was younger.For all the people that enjoyed the game to the fullest when it was released many years ago, this game is for you.And who knows maybe they will bring out the expansions on DLC in the future.$14 for a game is nothing, this game is well worth it's price.It does have multi-player, single player scenarios and the campaign.

												First rule of preordering any game (everyone should know this by now) RESEARCH THE GAME BEFORE YOU PREORDER IT! Because I did my research I knew going into this that the expansions (seriously, DLC was not a thing in the 90s, they are called expansions folks) are NOT included in this release. This includes the bonus faction, minor rule changes (moats doing damage for example) as well as the random map generator.All of that said, I got exactly what I paid for: an HD remake of the classic HoMM3. I'd like to eventually get the expansions for this version and will gladly pay for them if they are released as dlc anytime in the future. Till then I am perfectly happy reliving my memories of when I bought this game for my old Pentium 2 machine back in 99 when it came out. Yes, I do recommend this if you're looking for only the base game. If you want everything and the updated graphics aren't important to you then I'd recommend going to gog.com and getting their version that does include everything the original release had plus the expansions.

												I am not an HoMM3 veteran. To my regret I did not play this game when released because at that time I was probably playing Civilization II or III and the fantasy setting turned me off a little. I discovered HoMM3 just a couple of years ago and fell in love with it instantly. I had the feeling that this is the_perfect_game if anything like that exits. Of course, I purchased the GOG complete version.Having said that, I love this HD edition. Not being an old HoMM3 player I don't feel the sadness and despair other people here are feeling regarding the lack of expansion packs. I think it's a great addition to my collection and I will surely spend many hours playing this because gameplay is as awesome as ever. And I am even buying the iPad version also released today.Very recommended.			"

												Shame on the people who are giving this game a negative review.  If anything, why not give it a positive review?  Have more buyers come...  Get them to love the game, just as we (at least, I hope we...) all do.  This is a game of epic proportions.  It is what defined the Turn-Based Strategy Game genre, setting a benchmark that even the creators of this game could not compete with.  This ALSO goes for Ubisoft.Anyways.... Countless hours have been lost on this game.  It is a masterpiece.  The atmospheric, mood setting music is amongst one of the greatest soundtracks of all time.  Each song matches the scenario, or faction.  The action is immense, with key spells, strategic placement and utilization of units allowing you to sweep a Shadow of Death across the land (ho-ho), and powerful artifacts shape your hero into the god that they will eventually become. Please buy this game.  Should you have a love for turn based games, strategy games, or simply fantasy games... This is one that will stay in your heart for years, just as this game has done to me for over 14 years.  Cheers.  10/10, hands down one of my favourite games of all time.			"

												It is Restoration of Erathia. It was only advertised as Restoration of Erathia. Only the base game.It is missing a considerable amount of content due to not coming with the expansions, which Ubi/DotEmu warned of since the  first announcement. It is missing a random map generator, and  a whole lot of nice things. Such as the Conflux faction.But it is still Heroes 3. It is still a FANTASTIC game. It still looks like♥♥♥♥♥ but it is painted-over♥♥♥♥♥ It still has the bad art direction that the original version had.It does not have all the content the GOG version has. But it is still a fantastic title. It is still Heroes 3, and thus it is still a hell of a game. I hope that  this  (or the tablet versions) lead to more people discovering this absolutely fantastic title. I mean, it does look a little bit shinier. If you squint.			"

												As much as I HATE ubisoft, i'm very, very happy this game is on steam. It's THE BEST game of my childhood. It's a cool remake, with really nice HD looking graphics. Too bad it doesn't have the other expansions, but it was already explained thousands of times why they're not here, and if people don't get it, it's their problem. It's a must-buy for anyone who loved this game back in the days. It's also cool that this has steam multiplayer :D.P.S stfu about gog. it sucks			"

												Well, once visting this game AGAIN (like the rest of you) nostalgia  says ""yes!"" but logic says ""wellll..."" Ubi has continued to stain might and magic name ever since they bought the rights, with creating a new universe even though they had the scripts for the next few games from NWC. This game however on release has some.. 'features' i rather do not enjoy.first of all, once you upgrade a dwelling, you can't buy the 1st monsters. this is a large factor when you are low on gold, and cannot afford the upgaded version. ""HD"" is a way to put it.. maybe ""differant"" would be a better way to fraze it? some things look stretched or like they have new detail in them that wasnt there before, making them not the same item. now, on this next one, i am not 100% sure on, but i belive the view is smaller here than it was one HoMM complete. maybe that's just the 'HD mod' talking. this is simply RoE, not SoD or AB! buyer beware!Let's look at the good things now- has multiplayer on steam (even if it is much more limited). - still has map editor! hooray for community!- you can see how long you haven't been sleeping thanks to steam keeping track of those pesky hours...- available on tablets for those long care rides when you're 3-hour PC battery life doesnt cut it.- it's heroes! play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game already!I can only hope they release some sort or patching tools so modders unlike myself can add SoD and such to make the gamplay more rich. with all this information, i suggest buying the game, but not for $15 USD. $10 at most.

												I got home after eight hours of college today. I thought I was going to get a bunch of homework done.Then I found out that H3HD had been released.Never had I been so wrong.(The serious part)Yes, this is ONLY the Restoration of Erathia. This is only the first release of Heroes of Might and Magic 3. I bought it knowing that the expansions (Shadow of Death and Armageddeon's Blade) were not included. The game plays the same as the Heroes of Might and Magic 3: Restoration of Erathia. It is the same game that I played in 1999, 16ish years ago.In my honest opinion, I was really excited to see it remade. I am glad to see studios update the graphics and multiplayer capabilities of a classic game that I loved.			"

												This was one of my first reasons to buy a pc back in 1998, great that theres now a hd edition. I own the the complete homm3 pack, and the vanilla versions, but they tend to crash after a few hours :PSo it is grand, that I can play this now withought interruptions, but there have been made many bad decisions.The royal griffins dont look majestic at all, as if they got their food cut, angel wings dont look like wings, etc. And there are still many of the original bugs, like the gloves in the cave in The Mandate of Heaven, which cant be picked up and stuff like that. seemingly nothing in the code has been altered except the graphics. Which is.. sad, actually. I found all of the bugs of the previous nonHD edition. The animation of the champions charging in looks like glitching and the teeth and lower jaw of 80% of the creatures look dislocated. If there were a rating with up to 10 stars, I would give this high definitioning (=P) 3 stars. Many of the models now look plump (necropolis, for instance) like in Homm4.			"

												If you are new to Heroes of Might and Magic III, then the first thing to note is this game is well over 15 years old and as such it doesn't have a lot of the niceties that you'll find in games made in the last 10 years. This edition is solely one designed to make the game play nicer with modern operating systems, and increase the visual fidelity of the assets. If you are an old hand at HOMM games, then HOMM III HD Edition is just how you remember it, but with a nice lick of paint. The lack of the expansion packs does hurt a little, but for a walk down memory lane it serves the purpose excellently. It's hard to recommend this game to people who have played newer turn based strategy games before this, there is a lot more manual calculations for determining how much damage you'll do a troop and the subsquent counter attacks, and the information you'll want takes a lot more effort to track down. If I was playing HOMM III in any kind of serious way I'd definitely have a pen and paper ready for notes. The best example of this is when you mouse over units, you need to right click to get a static screen of statistics when many modern games will calculate win/loss ratios for you by simply mousing over an enemy unit. I do recommend this game, to people who have fond memories of playing the original and to the new folks who get to see a game which paved the way for so many others, without all the hassles this normally entails with getting older programs to work on newer hardware/OS'es. But be warned, the years have not been kind as far as the interface is concerned.  "

This is a strategy game that also has an element of luck involved. It does take a good amount of time so make sure you set aside a number of hours for this game. I find this game most fun to play with others, but it's a little tricky to figure out how to get the setup you want with multiple players.

												Heroes of might and magic 3 is very much worth playing, however I cannot think of a single reason to buy this version instead of the original which is still for sale and playable on modern computers. Too many core features are left out of this version, and the original is also much less expensive.I think that they should not have released in this state, with missing features and nothing new to offer. I hope that ubisoft revisits this and provides either a free update or dlc including the material that they left out, and perhaps some new material as well. I bet old and new Heroes fans alike would go bananas over steam workshop support or an all new expansion for the game. The reason the expansions are not included, I have heard, is due to the source code being lost. However with more money and time they could have rewritten that source code or reverse engineered it from the old game. There is money left on the table Ubisoft. I have plenty of money that I want to spend on a proper rerelease of Heroes 3; It is the pinnacle of the heroes series in my eyes. I hope you think so too and give this a revisit. Until then this remains a dissapointment.			"

												Ubisoft team is lazy, unprofessional and just downright laughable but the community is forever, and if you check the steam forums someone already posted a huge patch that adds in the random map generator, the unlimited FPS unlock, and wait for... converted all the expansion maps to Restoration of Erathia format after that, my Heroes 3 HD experince was complete now as if the game is worth buying... F**k yes it yes updated resolution, new sprites (no more blurry icons) and playing this old but gold game on a 3440X1440 ultra wide monitor i feel incredible definitely worth buying in a sale or through a gray market seller (it's about 5$) a very things worthy to mention: the online componant hasn't changed one bit, you're still required to forward ports (unf**king believable on the scale of unprofessionality from Ubijunk) after that you can either access online lobbies, or play with your friends in a party there is no conflux faction, a lot of ""on the road unique neutral creatures"" are missing though does it change the experince? not much to be honest i'm a heaven/castle player through and through and i don't really mind this small change the story-mode difficulty was really nerfed so now every joe with decent strategy skills can finish it also Quick-comabt is MUCH better than it was originally (now it's actually reliable and precise like Heroes 5) so to sum things up: a lot of content is missing, you have to do manual work to restore parts of it HD resolutions and HD textures (although some are lazely made) Steam achivements smart Quick-combat and i'm not sure about the cloud sync but i've tested it with the heroes 3 complete HD mod and this the HD does upscale the resolution but not the assets so you'll have tiny elements on a huge screen and it's just an eyesore if you have a vanilla 1080P monitor i'ed say go for the G0G version instead since it doesn't look THAT bad on a 1920X1080but anything higher than that it looks really godawful the GOG site also offers the Heroes chronicles campaigns (8 campaigns with voice acting and a few CGI scenes, highly recommended to might and magic veterans) if you just want some fun time with Heroes of might and magic 3 on higher resolutions then this is the best version if you're a graphics enthusiast like me			"

I do recommend owning this game in general, so if you dont have it, wait for a sale and get it. If you have working original version with expansion sets, stick to that one.			"

												Heroes of might and magic 3 is very much worth playing, however I cannot think of a single reason to buy this version instead of the original which is still for sale and playable on modern computers. Too many core features are left out of this version, and the original is also much less expensive.I think that they should not have released in this state, with missing features and nothing new to offer. I hope that ubisoft revisits this and provides either a free update or dlc including the material that they left out, and perhaps some new material as well. I bet old and new Heroes fans alike would go bananas over steam workshop support or an all new expansion for the game. The reason the expansions are not included, I have heard, is due to the source code being lost. However with more money and time they could have rewritten that source code or reverse engineered it from the old game. There is money left on the table Ubisoft. I have plenty of money that I want to spend on a proper rerelease of Heroes 3; It is the pinnacle of the heroes series in my eyes. I hope you think so too and give this a revisit. Until then this remains a dissapointment.			"

												I had so much fun playing this game with my sisters when I was young, so maybe I find it so enjoyable due to nostalgia, but if you like a good strategy game and have time to spare, then this is a good game to try. This is a strategy game that also has an element of luck involved. It does take a good amount of time so make sure you set aside a number of hours for this game. I find this game most fun to play with others, but it's a little tricky to figure out how to get the setup you want with multiple players. All in all this game gets a big thumbs up from me, it's not perfect but I love it.			"

												For me, all Heroes of Might and Magic games have 4 things in common:1 - they are serious time burners (the actual hour meter here is heavily misleading, during the years I have spent hundreds of hours with II III and IV, each)2 - despite the countless hours I've never finished all the main missions3 - I re-started playing from the beginning, either because of epic HDD failures, outdated systems or fancy new releases.4 - I have box sets of the initial releases (for all the old Windows) as well as digital downloads @ Steam and uPlay that work on contemporary machinesIn my opinion, HoMM is the definite turn-based fantasy game*. The actual part III is probably the nicest of all of them with its fine cartoon-esque GFX, atmosphere, the balance and game mechanics, still without going too deep into it (the following part IV did it). It follows the well-designed path of the first two games while seriously expanding / refining them on all sides. It was a little gem of a game back in 1999 when it came out and it's most probably one of the best balanced turn-based strategies ever created, in any genre.You can find an ample of fantasy creatures and magic and rather flat good vs evil (or evil vs good) storyline but story is not really important here: the way of creating it, is. Surely you're not new to turn-based strategy games if you reached here. Heroes III is great for one, a solid and stylistic game that stood the test of time without change.Among the series, IV is my fav as it is the deepest of all of them but III is really close behind. If you're a fan of fantasy and turn-based strategies you can't really go wrong with it. Absolutely recommended.*King's Bounty is a serious runner-up			"

What it lacks in graphical splendor it more than makes up for in the diversity of its playable factions and its mythology inspired army of creatures. Memorable music and a simple to use map editor easily make ""HoMM3"" the #1 in the entire series.Also, it's (now) from Ubisoft, but no need for Uplay. That alone should make this worth your while.

												I recomend this game to anyone who loves fanatsy and strategy. It's a simple as that. This game offers incredible charm and delight for players who like to spend hour after hour immersed in a tactical turn based wonderland. The sounds and score of this game will be fondly remembered for the rest of your days as it orchastrates magic into your imagination. The experience of playing this hallmark in original form is truly a boon for you the gamer as it keeps the game as it was meant to be enjoyed. One of the highlights of my gaming history.			"

												Ubisoft team is lazy, unprofessional and just downright laughable but the community is forever, and if you check the steam forums someone already posted a huge patch that adds in the random map generator, the unlimited FPS unlock, and wait for... converted all the expansion maps to Restoration of Erathia format after that, my Heroes 3 HD experince was complete now as if the game is worth buying... F**k yes it yes updated resolution, new sprites (no more blurry icons) and playing this old but gold game on a 3440X1440 ultra wide monitor i feel incredible definitely worth buying in a sale or through a gray market seller (it's about 5$) a very things worthy to mention: the online componant hasn't changed one bit, you're still required to forward ports (unf**king believable on the scale of unprofessionality from Ubijunk) after that you can either access online lobbies, or play with your friends in a party there is no conflux faction, a lot of ""on the road unique neutral creatures"" are missing though does it change the experince? not much to be honest i'm a heaven/castle player through and through and i don't really mind this small change the story-mode difficulty was really nerfed so now every joe with decent strategy skills can finish it also Quick-comabt is MUCH better than it was originally (now it's actually reliable and precise like Heroes 5) so to sum things up: a lot of content is missing, you have to do manual work to restore parts of it HD resolutions and HD textures (although some are lazely made) Steam achivements smart Quick-combat and i'm not sure about the cloud sync but i've tested it with the heroes 3 complete HD mod and this the HD does upscale the resolution but not the assets so you'll have tiny elements on a huge screen and it's just an eyesore if you have a vanilla 1080P monitor i'ed say go for the G0G version instead since it doesn't look THAT bad on a 1920X1080but anything higher than that it looks really godawful the GOG site also offers the Heroes chronicles campaigns (8 campaigns with voice acting and a few CGI scenes, highly recommended to might and magic veterans) if you just want some fun time with Heroes of might and magic 3 on higher resolutions then this is the best version if you're a graphics enthusiast like me			"

The fact alone that a game released in 1999 was remstered to HD and released again in 2015 speeks for itself. There were a lots of ""expansions packs"" (aka DLCs) released for this game, but unfortunately their source code was lost and they didnt make it to this release.If you are true Heroes of Might and Magic fan, and you missed this title, you should definitely check it out !

Some functions from the original game are not implemented and there are no expansions aviable. The price is rather high. I do recommend owning this game in general, so if you dont have it, wait for a sale and get it. If you have working original version with expansion sets, stick to that one.			"

The upside to playing this version is that it does run smoothly on Win 10 (I've encountered no issues in the amount of time i've been playing, no crashes, no slow down, etc.) Definitely enjoy this style of HoMM, and am glad that the remaster was released to help out to run, as I do occasionally have issues with HoMM II and I occasionally.

												Heroes of Might and Magic 3 in my opinion is best in the series with the fifth installement coming second. and drags me in few times a year for a couple of games. this HD release lacks both expansions (Armagedons Blade and Shadow of Death) which is quite a let down as they add a lot of important features like random maps or artifact merger and the campaign. veterans usually choose regular release +HD mod to get everything, but this release has remastere creature sprites and their animations do look more fluent. it could be an entry point for newcomers as it is not as graphically old as first and second parts and does offer more more addictive gameplay than the latest installments though they would need to keep in my that the expansions will not be coming as according to the devs who release this hd version, the source code for the expansions is not availbe			"

												EN: Heroes are great, but with new graphics better.Developers have increased the resolution of 2 times, drew pictures of creatures and animation (though sometimes a little poddergivaet).NOTE: DotEmu based his Heroes III Restoration of Erathia - the first of the add-ons, and there was not: the random card purchases usually exist in the improvement of the construction, the protection of resource objects, etc. It was in the following two additions, but the developers have written the code on them is lost, but that's another story ...Yes, well redrawn, but they are not completely fulfilled their task reissue - the correction of errors. Bugs on the horizon for some time did not appear, but those rare that were in the original and not corrected, such as to non-damage to the city moat, high prices on the black market, the spell flight - bumping into the castle with guards but without the hero could fight with his copy of the hero and others. And, the price is unreasonable, a maximum of $ 5, anyone would agree.If you are a fan of Heroes this reissue you like.But personally, I'm glad about one of the best strategies to remember.RU: Герои великолепны, а с новой графикой еще лучше. <br>Разработчики увеличили разрешение в 2 раза, нарисовали картинки существ и их анимацию (хоть и местами немного поддергивающая).<br>ОБРАТИТЕ ВНИМАНИЕ: DotEmu взял за основу Герои III Возрождение Эрафии - первое из дополнений и там не было: генератора случайных карт, покупки обычного существа в улучшеной постройке, охраны ресурсодобывающих объектов и т.д. Все это было в двух следующих дополнениях, но разработчики писали что код от них был утерян, но это уже другая история... <br>Да, перерисовали хорошо, но они не до конца выполнили свою задачу переиздания - исправление ошибок. Багов на горизонте некоторое время не появлялось, но те редкостные что были в оригинале так и не поправили, вроде ненаносящего урона ров города, завышенные цены на черном рынке, заклинание полет - налетев на замок с охраной но без героя можно было драться со своей копией героя и другие. И еще, цена неразумная, максимум 5 $, любой бы согласился.<br>Если ты фанат Героев то это переиздание вам понравится. <br>Но лично я рад что об одной из лучших стратегий вспомнили.			"

												Heroes of might and magic 3 is very much worth playing, however I cannot think of a single reason to buy this version instead of the original which is still for sale and playable on modern computers. Too many core features are left out of this version, and the original is also much less expensive.I think that they should not have released in this state, with missing features and nothing new to offer. I hope that ubisoft revisits this and provides either a free update or dlc including the material that they left out, and perhaps some new material as well. I bet old and new Heroes fans alike would go bananas over steam workshop support or an all new expansion for the game. The reason the expansions are not included, I have heard, is due to the source code being lost. However with more money and time they could have rewritten that source code or reverse engineered it from the old game. There is money left on the table Ubisoft. I have plenty of money that I want to spend on a proper rerelease of Heroes 3; It is the pinnacle of the heroes series in my eyes. I hope you think so too and give this a revisit. Until then this remains a dissapointment.			"

But has one big plus - allow you to play on big resolutions. I would be nice if Ubisoft release extensions and Heroes of Might & Magic II remastering.			"

												I owned the complete version of Heroes of Might and Magic III, that is to say the one that includes both expansions.I hoped, or more acuratly never thought that an upgraded version would not contain them. The more fool me.As a standalone game, I can find no actual difference between this version and my old CD, save the lack of expansion.Save yourself the money, get the original, this is no different.

												If you can't get your hands on the original version of this game, this one can tide you over for now. Although the HD graphics arn't very HD, none of the expansions are included, and some moats don't work, this is still a fantastic game.			"

												vanilla homm3 is not that bad, because it doesnt include the conflux which was the most moronic and worst designed town in homm3 complete.Unfortunately in vanilla, you can't buy non-upgraded unit anyomore once you upgrade your building, I really hate that.oh also 2 more things :the armorer skill does not increase damage from ennemy turret in this hd version. So apparently they fixed the bug.the best resolution to use in my opinion is 1280*960 (it's the highest resolution at 4/3) "

												This game : GoldThe HD Edition : GarbageI am disappointed to do not found the extension of this game for the price you pay it.It's really a bad point.But in anyway, this game as been part of my childhood, and I still really really like it nowadays.Even if the game is a little bit expensive, it's worth it. This is just a classic of the strategy-tray like games, and if you are a true fan of them, you NEED this game.I totally recommend it.			"

												This is great. It's been updated from the original to just be all around better. I'm super psyched that I now get to play it whenever I want. Totally worth the purchase. I played this with my brothers all the time, it just reminds me of how many games we played and how much fun we always had. I haven't had any problems with it yet so it's great.			"

												This is the most addictive game I've ever played! It blends the perfect ratio of turn based strategy and role playing game. I love how you can play at your own pace, which is perfect for those with ADD or OCD. The Campaigns are epic and provide plenty of hours of game play, but there's plenty of single scenarios you can play by yourself, or on multiplayer mode; not to mention the fact that you can create custom scenarios			"

												I haven't played the original Heroes III, because I was very young back then and couldn't understand how to do anything in the townscreen. As a result, I do not have any experience in what the original game was like. Although the HD Edition, this game, doesn't have a random map generatior, I still enjoy it, especially when I can create my own maps. The gameplay is fun, as it always has been, and I will continue to enjoy this game. It is such a shame that Ubisoft destroyed the series with their lack of commitment to Heroes 6 and 7, as I have always been a fan of the Heroes franchise, ever since I can remember, but at least I will always have Heroes 3-5.

												I loved the Original, I spend so many night with friends plaxing the game in hot seat sessions. Hours flying by and everyone so engaged with the game that we never noticed. I feared the Remaster would be a bad idea, cause the game would probably not stand the test of time, but actually the game is still as fun as before, but the graphics are crisp and this makes the game actually really better. I see myself spending again, hours and hours with this game. Now I just need to connect with my friends scattered aournd the globe, to play some old school hot seat sessions!!!			"

												They had a killer sale when 7 was launched, basically you bought 7 and get this for free. So I cant complain too much, but do not buy this game, even more so when you can go to gog and buy the complete edition of heroes 3. Heroes 3 is not worth it if its just the vanilla.			"

												If you enjoyed this game when it came out 20 years ago, you will be very pleased with this HD version. Beware, it does not come with any expansions. Neverthless, number 3 remains the best in the HOMM series. Put it on your wishlist and wait for the occasional price drop. I purchased mine for 50% off. Definitely worth the price.			"
