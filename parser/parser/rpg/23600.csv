												A really cool action RPG, while the graphics suck it maeks up for that with some unique features. Namely quests in this game are dynamic: take to long to rescue someone, and they die. Leave a dungeon boss alone? They'll start an uprising. leave that alone? It'll keep getting wrose untill there's an attack on the town. On top of that, the whole time all of this is happening, you're actively competeing for control of the town with several other clans, that you can trade, form alliances with, or declare war on.I highly reccomended tihs for people who like games like Titans Quest or Torchlight 2, but want something with a few unique tricks up it's sleeve.

												This precursor to Din's Curse is by no means a simpler game. A bit more rough around the edges perhaps, but the take on party based ARPG gameplay is completely unique. Your party competes with other groups for control over the town. You have all manner of diplomatic tools and victory conditions support alliance wins. All of this takes place in a sweet, if obviously tile based, procedurally generated world, with Soldak's great dynamic questing system. All the other groups are out in this world too, competing to complete the same quests. Groups you are at war with can be fought in the world as well. Indeed the most common path to victory involves crushing the other groups. In order to do this effectively you'll need to recruit your allies carefully, and then see to their development. You also have a hall of your own, where you can post powerful monsters as guards, enshrine relics to give your group bonuses and also build a library of tomes which grants further bonuses. If you have the patience to learn this game's juggling act, you'll find one of the most unique takes on ARPGs around with its surprisingly deep strategic element.			"

												Depths of Peril is a very unique Arpg in the similar vein of Diablo but with a townbuilding/diplomacy/economic twist. Basically you assume the role of a guild leader and fulfill quests and defeat enemies in order to level up and bring glory to your faction. As you progress you recruit new members and get better equipement. During this you can engage into diplomacy with other prominent factions. Trading, Alliances and War are options at your disposal to carefully plan your path to dominance. There are many other smaller mechanics at play but this pretty much sums it up.The rpg elements are solid although the combat and UI can feel a bit wonky, it could have used some polish but it's functional and works. The diplomacy and faction management works quite well and it all fits together nicely.I recommend this game if you really like Arpgs with a unique twist to them. But beware this game might feel a bit clunky and outdated.			"

												It's an indie Diablo-alike with multiple factions each sending their own heroes out into the wilderness to do the quests.  You're not just trying to level your character, you're trying to take over your town from up to seven rivals.  It's a little rough around the edges, but it brings some fun, interesting ideas to a very well-known formula.			"

												Depths of Peril is an ARPG filled to the brim with unique ideas. From the premise of the game, where clans fight and adventure simultaneously for control of the region, to the randomly generated and adequately customizable game worlds. However, unique ideas alone cannot make a good game, and it is in the execution where Depths of Peril falls flat on its face. It isn't completely without merit, though, and I encourage anybody interested in making an ARPG of their own to at least take a look at the game, for the same idea in fully funded and capable hands is easily a recipe for success.Unlike most other ARPGs, Depths of Peril doesn't contain a single game world that you advance through linearly; instead a new world can be generated for any of your characters to play in at any time. Each world has a number of 'covenants' (guilds of adventurers) that you can fight or ally with in an attempt to control the world. When only you and any allies you may have are the only ones remaining, the world is ""complete"". This world style allows the game to stay relatively fresh, but severely hampers the compelling story and exciting set boss fights common to others in the genre.Depths of Peril manages to be like other ARPGs in many ways, though not all of them are positive. Quests in the world are randomly generated, often requiring you to kill enemies or find and rescue an NPC who you may then recruit to help you, two things which are also far too common in the genre. Also like other ARPGs, Depths of Peril suffers from some relatively uninteresting skills, few classes to choose from, all the flaws of random loot generation, and more.The worlds themselves are uninspired and bland. The graphics are, as you can probably see from the screenshots and video available, not good, especially by today's standards. Even worse than that is how areas of each world will be literally squares of land with nothing separating them other than a small wall of some sort and a break in the wall to walk through. I'm not sure what kinds of forests and plains are perfectly square, but Depths of Peril has them in spades.The most unique part of the game is, however, its strong point. Competing with other convenants for control is interesting and exciting, especially if you crank the difficulty enough for them to be a significant challenge (and cranking the difficulty up can easily be done). Attacking other covenants, however, is about as boring as can be, unfortunately; each covenant has a crystal that acts as a respawn and teleport point for its members, and you must destroy it to defeat the covenant. What that leads to is you and your covenant wailing on the crystal for a long time while killing the infinitely respawning enemies until the crystal eventually dies. For what could have been an amazing, potentially game-making mechanic, it's disappointing.Probably the most disappointing part is the lack of multiplayer. It could be an amazing game to play with (and against) friends, possibily even enough to make me recommend it, but it's sadly not there.A perfectly square field of unrealized potential is what Depths of Peril is, and you'll find numerous fields just like it if you choose to play it. While it has unique ideas, ideas alone are not enough for me to recommend buying it over other ARPGs.			"

												I wanted to like this game.  It was even fun at first.  The first thing I really made it a point to understand is that this is an older game from an independent developer.  A lot of other people have pointed out that it is unpolished, but I don't know if that is the correct word for it.  It is extremely polished.  It's also somewhat primitive.The concept is kind of neat, and it does play a lot like Diablo II.  The difference being that Diablo II is a more fluid experience.  I can overlook that, though, if the game has certain other cool aspects.  The problem is, it really doesn't.The whole goal of the game is to defeate the other ""factions"".  That seems kind of silly to me given the fact that the town seems to be constantly under seige in a hostile environment.  I mean, you can't leave town without getting attacked by MOBs, so the goal seems a little bit unrealistic.  It's a game, though, so I can even get over that.The problem, as I see it, is that other than the goal of the game being different, it really doesn't offer anything new.  In fact, I will go out on a limb and say that it's like Diablo II took a step backwards.  The leveling in the game, which is one of the most important aspects of any game, is really lackluster.  Inventory management is extremely difficult to the point where I was guessing which items would be better for my character.  Finally, the actual dungeons are horrible.  This is the one area where the graphics are really a let down.  It's too much work to try to see what is going on in the dungeon let alone trying to explore every nook and cranny.Essentially, this game involves getting quests and ""solving"" them.  Back and forth.  Wilderness to town.  That's about it.  And then when your house gets attacked, you have to drop whatever you are doing to go defend it.  There really is no political intrigue involved.  You can trade with the other houses, and that's the only way to raise your relationships with them.  All of that is for naught, though, because the end goal is to destroy them anyway.  I'd give this game about a 4 on a 10 scale.  If you want a loot based dungeon crawler, Diablo II is a better option.  The contestation between houses adds nothing to the game whatsoever.  In fact, I think it's a distraction.			"

												A Diablo clone with a twist: You are not alone... You start off with 2-5 other clans of heroes all fighting for the same power you seek. Use diplomacy, bribary, or conquest to outmatch the other clans all the while keeping the many monsters from growing out of check. That's right the monsters will group up if left alone and become more and more difficult if not defeated.  Easily moddable game if you can make you way around .cfg files personally I made the game have 10x more monsters and most of the skills strike multiple targets but its brutal on a weaker PC.			"

												A nice indie RPG; but not a typical one. You actually have a set of guilds in a town, defending it against monsters around. You only end the game by uniting or defeating all the guilds, a real twist on typical RPG stories :)You don't always work together, you have guild infights, trading, diplomacy, all very light and fun! (and also terrifying and tough at times; they are comparable to your power). You also build up your own guild with new members and monster guards. It is deep enough for some real replay value even if the combat isn't complicated and the graphics not stellar, and the levelling system and loot (of which good items are rare) seem to be balanced. Worth a play if you enjoy the demo!			"

												Here's the deal: picture diablo with a dynamic world. The bosses want more power, and send minions to build power in different parts of the world. So, if you don't kill a boss quick, the boss spawns new bosses. And sometimes those bosses fight. So, you better actually do your job as an adventurer or you will find yourself in an impossible situation.Don't be scared about them, though, because there are other guilds trying to fulfill each quest. The problem is, they're competing with your guild for control of the town. You can make them allies or enemies, but you have to choose and be ready to fight them at the drop of a hat.In other words, this is Diablo with a dynamic, random world. It's awesome.			"

												A hack'n slash similar to games like Diablo, but with a twist - you get to lead a very tiny faction and compete against other factions. The game is basically smashing enemies in real-time, returning to a village to complete quests and take some new, buy new equipment, and which is something unusual for this type of a game, use diplomacy or violence against other factions (which are run by AI pretending to be other ""players""). However, the factions are very underdeveloped - just single NPCs (or a player) and some hirelings. The game has a good idea, but doesn't take it far enough. In addition, the combat system is very average and in the end there isn't really any reason not to just (re)play more interesting hack'n slashes like Diablo or Sacred. I don't really recommend this game, but you might want to check an available demo.			"

												I just purchased got a steam sale discount for a lot of games. Big titles. Xcom 2. Indie titles. The games I kept are, ori and the blind forest, and depths of peril. Depths of peril, much like dins quest, and drox - is a multitool of a ARPG game. Clumsy looking animations, no achievement points. Yet adapable, repeatable, and customizible. It has a lot of dynamic stuff happening in real time, and it creates something that feels a bit like a mmorpg with the competing forces. You can really fine tune the experience on top of that.Loots good. Skills solid. And i enjoy the oversatured yet simplistic look of the game quite a bit. It's an odd graphics engine yet it still managed to be advanced in the areas that count the most (world shadows, dense randomly generated landscape, etc)9/10			"

For more reviews and gameplay videos by Morgoth, check out the profile or the Twitch channel at twitch.tv/morgoth0221BEFORE you read my negative review on this game, please go check out Din's Curse if you're thinking about buying Depths of Peril.  Same engine, same developer, same idea, infinitely better execution.  Din's Curse is worth your money. Depths of Peril is not.  Simple as that.My original review for this game was positive but after spending a little more time with it, I just cannot recommend it.  The graphics are pretty poor for any time period and unexcusable for even 7 years ago, when the game was developed.  The combat is mildy interesting but is plagued by a variety of skills that have some of the blandest activation sequences I've ever seen in a game.  The enemies are repetitive, and overly numerous as they seem to respawn indefinitely, and the quests are extremely generic offering little to no background as to why you are doing what you are doing.  The only reason the quests appear to exist is for experience and not for plot or dialogue of which there is almost none on some quests.  One of the first quests you can get is to kill 9 pixies.  What on earth did these poor pixies do to deserve such a horrific response as raiding their area and murdering 9 of them?  You will never find out because there is no explanation.Everything exists in the game to accomodate what I think the developers put a little too much focus on, and that is the competition with the other covenants.  Once again, I am mildy interested in this area.  I suppose it's kind of cool that you can form treaties and make trades with these other covenants to keep them happy, but there isn't enough depth even in this area to keep it interesting for long.  I quickly found it to be more of a chore to constantly remind myself that I have to pay ""tribute"" to these other covenants or they're going to visit my house and slaughter my life crystal.And perhaps the main reason why I changed my recommendation to a negative review is the fact that there is no slow down time in this game.  Personally, I like to check out stats and equipment very often in ARPGs and hang around town and just relax and that is non-existent in this game.  Every second that you spend going through your inventory, is time that is wasted due to other covenants never slowing down and always gaining influence and power.  Want to sit back and relax with a fun, interesting ARPG?  Then this is not the game for you.Score: 4/10			"

You can build relationships with the other guilds or go to war with them.  You can kill those you are at war with wherever you find them.  Even in the streets of town.  Befriend or eliminate all other guilds to win, but you can keep running quests and play without other guilds.  Enemies can show up in town and make things interesting.  Great stat, skill, and item system. Really outdated graphics.  Money is very valuable in this game unlike most hack and slash RPG's.

												This game is weird. It has a really old RPG feel to it like something that might have existed in the early 90's and it feels like it might be a decent game to play if you had some friends that owned it as well. It's very much orientated towards multiplayer, you can play it single player with bots but the AI is horrific and you can just respawn a million times and attack the bots bases and you'll eventually kill them all.I'm sure there's people out there that this game would very much appeal to, but it feels like it's a niche market game for multiplayer arpg pvp players.It has a bunch of diplomacy aspects built into it, where you can buy friendship and all kinds of stuff but it all falls apart because of the huge design flaws because the game gives you what seems like unlimited respawns at your own base.This is a big issue because everyones bases are literally right beside each other. They're houses in a tiny village and if you destroy the other guys base then you kill the guy. Other than building up enough power to destroy someones base in the first place, there is absolutely no real reason to not just storm everyones bases constantly until they die.I got 2 and a half hours out of this, I finished it more than once.

												Great Dungeon-Siege type game with tons of different monsters and areas to explore, and lots of loot to find.			"

												This game looks like ♥♥♥, but it's a surprisingly thorough and fun RPG with some civ style diplomacy thrown in.			"

												Game is good and fun! If you are one of those prople who must have all the flashy graphic's this may not be for you but if you like something different in game play give it a try. I mean hey if you are a modder and like to mod games you can do that with this game and din's curse.			"

												Diablo and Civilizations ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ love child. Less than fantastic graphics, control scheme can be a little clunky (combat targetting mainly), but it's actually rather good. You keep your character through different campaigns of playing against rival houses, steadily levelling up and improving your character, hirelings, and house bonuses. Like the Civs style games, you can win either through diplomacy (allying with houses through adventuring, trade, etc) or though military might (crushing all who stand before you), but naturally it's more of a mixture of both.

												This is a diablo clone clashed with civilization's diplomacy system.It's decently fun aside from the stale animations, lack of character variety (There are four types that look the exact same in any form, aside from armor) and a seeming lack of replay value, in that the exact same zones occur in the exact same order all the time. There's very little variance.It's worth buying if it's on sale, but I wouldn't drop money on it.			"

												Solidly built, which doesn't suck up too much time. Fun and has some nice mechanics.Could do with multiplayer, coopagainst the AI would make this game last a lot longer.Worth playing if you want a casual distraction, suitable for younger children too.			"
