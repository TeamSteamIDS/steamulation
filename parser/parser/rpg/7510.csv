												Does anyone remember the reputation this game got back in the days when it was released?! Well playing it now I think most reviews were....kinda harsh. Everyone was in teh DMC and God of War fan train back there and comparisons will not bring justince to X-Blades. So what is X-Blades?It`s a nice stylish spectacle fighter with a unique aesthetic back in those days, a great soundtrack and tight controls (the thing that most games like this lacked back then). Combos are the backbone of every spectacle fighter and here we have something...unique. Other than switching weapons here you can enchant your weapons with elemental damage so you can`t blame the game for not having 200 swords and another 100 firearms. Chaining attacks is fast and easy and the animations are superbe sincerely and the leves are also detailed and intriguing (even the arena style ones) giving the battles a nice atmosphere. I don`t know what to say about the game which was not said back in the original reviews but....it`s a great game actualy. Not as hard as most spectacle fighters but FUN. And that is the key word here: FUN! It`s fun to kill hundreds of demons with twin blades in over the top stylish combat sequnces.			"

												I really don't understand people moaning so much on this one. What's so wrong in a lightning fast half-naked sexy anime girl slicing hundreds of monsters with 2 deadly blades and overpowered magic attacks? You don't always need a deep and clever story to enjoy a game. Sometimes it's about fun. I fired it up 'just to try' yesterday, not bothering even to get my gamepad from the drawer. An hour later I realized that I need to wake up and get to work in 5 hours. I haven't noticed anything wrong with controls. The simplicity of the gameplay feels pleasingly relaxing, the visuals are very good and the heavy metal soundtrack is just great. Somehow I don't mind that it's repeatitive. Maybe because I remember the days of the original Settlers II when listening to the same MIDI track for hours didn't bother anyone. I bought it with a -90% coupon and I consider it a wonderful bargain. Honestly, I would happily pay a full price for this one.			"

												This game is better than it's reputation. Perhaps the fact that i have missed all those genre defining classics has made me look through the faults of this game because faults it does have: pacing, messy combat (at least in the beginning), Annoying main character with a fake 'i am the best' -attitude. Story is easily forgotten. could not exactly figure it out even when end credits rolled. Beginning is best described as confusing. Jumping, hacking and slashing and some shooting and then a nasty feeling that surely there is more underneath the combat mechanics hood than this? Combat is early especially bad if you like the flow system from modern Batman games. Well forget that. There will be flow allright but you will reach that level of competence much later by getting upgrades and combining them in combat. Read that Bestiary when it updates. it really is worth your time as it directly tells what you are up against. Until then keep collecting those fragments and all the soulds you can find hidden in statues and clay pots. You will need them - literally millions of them. Luckily basic moves cost only some thousands that can be collected easily. Game is often offered in bundles very cheaply - i do recommend checking it out and giving it some time before deciding. It is quite satisfying to be able to easily trash a multitude of different types of enemies. Just be warned that the game really only shines once you start getting a good list of element powers and learn which move/element works on what.			"

												I played the demo for Blades of Time, and I thought it was pretty good, so I bought it in a bundle and bought this with a 90% coupon I got for free.  To be honest, my expectations were low--X-Blades has a pretty poor reputation from what I've read, so it couldn't really go anywhere but up.  It took me nine hours to beat the game though I could've cut it down if I wasn't stuck in one portion.X-Blades is the story of a young woman in a skimpy outfit destroying statues and vases while slaughtering scores of monsters and critters.  I guess I'd classify it as a beat-em-up of sorts, the kind where the game will seal off an exit and you have to deplete a health bar on the bottom of the screen with enough monster death to continue.  Or maybe you have to find these monster generators and destroy all of them AND kill all of the monsters in the area to continue.  Combat is fairly simple, as you attack with your gunblades with slashes or shooting at distant enemies.  There's a Rage meter that rises with damage dealt and taken, which falls with time or when casting spells, as it's kinda like an MP bar in a way.  You gain Souls from enemies you butcher and the things you destroy, which you spend on learning new spells or getting in a quick anytime heal or Rage boost.  Battles are largely repetitive barring the boss battles.  You usually have enemies spawn in over a series of waves and you destroy them, or do the same with the monster generators, and then you get a Level Complete and you're free to explore the stages for artifact pieces to power up your attacks or other goodies.  All while staring at your character's ♥♥♥...I'm sorry, where was I?  There really aren't any puzzles to solve again barring some of the boss fights, and you typically get a bestiary update that tells you pretty much how to beat the foe.  This is the first game I've played where the bestiary updates BEFORE you kill something, but it's a handy hint system kinda thing.  For things the game did right...there's a pretty big variety of spells to spend your Souls on.  Granted there aren't many effects, but they are at least somewhat different.  Earthquake can't hit foes in the air, Ray of Light works best on darkness-aligned creatures, and Lightning Range is a kickass chain lightning spell.  There are only four quickslots for spells but you can call up the menu and cast a spell there if you have enough Rage, to make use of a few combos or to use something you don't have bound.  The music is a bit repetitive, being pretty heavy on the rock side during battles, but it kinda grew on me to be honest.  Even the title theme sounded bad...at first.  It's tolerable now, though I don't have to listen to it very much.  And the manual is written entirely in-character, which I realize is corny as hell but I kinda liked it.  There's also a results screen at the end of each stage so you can at least see if you missed any artifact pieces or are going for 100% completeness or something.  And you can go right back to the previous stage if you want, but no stage-select feature here, unfortunately.As for what I didn't like, some of the controls kinda bothered me.  There was a section I was stuck on that required crossing a chasm or fall to my death, and more than a few times did I accidentally dodge-roll right off a ledge when I meant to jump.  Dying in this game means you start the stage all over.  Did you get a Level Complete and die?  Too bad, start all over!  And this happened to me a few times.  Thankfully that section was optional and this game has no platforming sections like that anywhere else...and you get to keep all of the Souls you had already, so that's some consolation.  Another thing was that the battles were rarely fun and felt like grinding more than anything.  Even when you knew how to kill something, some things just took forever to die, and I hate attrition wars like that.  I did kinda like the game, but at no point did I really tell myself, ""boy, this game is fun!"" I honestly bought it just to see how bad it was, and it was cheap, so no major loss to me.  So I'm not recommending this.  I try to be patient with games, even ones that are said to be outright bad.  This one...it's okay, I guess, but I wouldn't recommend this to anybody, or really most people.  It's a rough game, it's trying quite a bit, and while I haven't played the games this gets compared to, it's largely mediocre and probably ""a poor man's"" version of those games at best.  The game likely will be remembered more for the outfit the protagonist wears than the content of the game, but all in all, it's not a bad game.  Just not one I'd see myself coming back to anytime soon.			"

												While not being a great game, it isn’t a complete waste, nor as bad as people make it out to be.The bad:-A completely boring, badly written story, that is completely throwaway, but thankfully doesn’t hinder you too often or too much.-Some enemies can be annoying beyond belief, mostly the flying ones and enemies you need to shoot with a special power.-A lot of throwaway attacks.-Repetitive. Slashing and shooting enemies from start to finish.-Below average boss fights that aren’t always explained well.The good:-Gameplay is decently fun, and it feels relatively good.-Graphics aren’t overly high-fidelity, but they still have a nice cartoonish look for them and are appealing to the eyes.-And yes, the main protagonist’s looks will probably carry this game for a lot of people.So taking everything in account, the game is nowhere as bad as people often make it out to be. Is it repetitive? Yes, very. Does it have huge mechanical faults? Yes, and you will notice them immediately if you have played any better games of this type. But if you just want a mediocre hack-and-slash with little variety and can ignore some faults and the absence of a proper story, the gameplay and its protagonist (as well as her behind) might be enough to keep you invested and entertained. If you can’t overlook some of those bigger faults, and solid gameplay and aesthetics aren’t enough to convince you to spend money on it, you might want to give it a pass. Otherwise, this is a solid little time-sinker for fans of the genre which I recommend buying at any sale.			"

												X-Blades greatest flaw is its redundancy. Enemies, environments and actions will all be extremely familiar territory by the end of the adventure. This isn't helped by the fact that the first portion of X-Blades is spent working your way through arenas in the light of day, then turning around working your way back through those arenas in the evening. It's a serious copout on the part of the developers to not create new architecture and instead relight the same areas. A copout that should not go unnoticed. What's Good:- The game offers a nice challenge- Does a great job at encourging a variety of approaches in battle- Plenty of upgrades to purchase- Rewarding collectibles- Good variety gunplay- The heavy role magic plays in combatWhat's Not-So-Good:- Battles can be repetitive- Lack of variety in music- Uneven difficulty in boss battles (ridiculously easy final boss)- A few visual errorsWhat's Bad:- Overly sensitive movement controls - ^ Unresponsive aerial movements- Very poor storytelling- ZERO character development- Pointless levels- Penatlizing players for buying life refills with very little alternatives- Lack of variety in sword comboIn all, there are certain aspects of X-blades that are well developed while there are many others that are not. Depending on your level of tolerance, it can be a decent experience.			"

												If I had to describe the game in one word, it would be an unflattering ""Competent"". The game brings nothing new to the table, nothing innovative, nothing exciting and different. It's formulaic and is merely competent at the formula. The main attraction seems to be the near nudity of the main character, the clothes go to a level of lunacy most games of this visual style don't, and the weapons are simplistic and uninspired. You get a pair of gunblades and you either slash your way through wave after wave of enemies, or shoot them, or mix it up and do both. You will learn some new abilities by finding artifact pieces which add new skills for shooting things and hitting them with swords. The artifacts are arguably essential, as they unlock combos and more combos are useful, so you'll have to hunt these things down to have an alternative to clicking one of the two mouse buttons repeatedly. As long as you can crank the resolution up on your display, the controls are fine, if amazingly uninspired. If you have to use a lower resolution for performance the mouse becomes unplayably twitchy and fast. My one complaint would be that the entire game is one formula. You enter an area and fight off some sort of boss monster. You fight either a boss, waves of smaller enemies, atatck stationary things until the bar is depleted and things stop spawning; then you kill the remaining ones and get to move onto the next area where you repeat the process. Sometimes you'll have it easier and have to run through an area avoiding arguably simple obstacles with dodge, or running through a puzzle of blades. Those would be a lot easier if the game explained the controls well, but following the game exactly results in dodge and other moves being wildly inconsistent to do. There is nothing inspired or amazing about this game, but it's a hack and slash. If you like just hitting things with swords, it does it just well enough that i can't say I recommend avoiding the game. It's not terribly good, but it can be enjoyable enough if very repetitive. I would not play the game again after completion unless achievements were added or some other incentive, as it is the game is acceptable enough to get a playthrough and then be left alone.			"

												Not bad for a hack and slash game, but it's not worth full price. Shame you can't hit the little enemies with your swords, you have to shoot them. I found the normal mode to be difficult which stopped me dead in my tracks on one of the levels. The forward+jump button isn't functioning properly, she just wants to jump float, so I can't progress past the falling blades level. The music is nice though, especially the main title theme. If you can get it for really cheap and don't mind the repetitive feeling then I recommend it, if not, don't bother.			"

												X blades was a pretty okay game. I actually enjoyed playing it but I had my frustrated moments in the game.The graphics were pretty nice, and Ayumi herself was appealing to the player's eye. The effects and the environment was also astonishing.The battle system and mechanism where good enough, but slightly difficult as it was easy to get hit during the heat of a battle.I was not too fond about the artifact upgrade system. finding 3 pieces to upgrade your battle was great, but I did not like the fact that you could only have a maximum lvl of 3 when there were more artifacts out there to find.The music in the game was something I really liked. They did a good job on finding the right elements suitable for the moments in the game.The story is pretty poor, and the visual acting of the infants were pretty bad.In conclusion, this game is something I would recommend to you if you love hack n' slash and anime.

												Sometimes I wish I didn't get crap like this in bundles so I wouldn't be tempted to play it. Then I play it anyway and wonder why I didn't listen to myself.If you're really into button mashing, have I got the game for you. This game is all about slamming on the attack button against fodder enemies (combos are for wimps) until your rage (read: mana) meter is filled up enough to use the earthquake ability you unlock during the tutorial to kill them all and then use whatever rage you have left after that to spam whatever other ability the boss you're fighting is weak to. Of course, they have so much health that it'll still take several minutes, but you also have just as much, and they telegraph their attacks so much that it's impossible to die unless you walk away from the computer. The only time that pattern was not repeated before I stopped playing was in an area without a boss, and then it was just button mash to kill lots of enemies without a boss instead.It's like they realized they'd made a game that was only 90 minutes long and kind of sucked (yes, other stuff sucks, like the lockon picking the wrong thing most of the time, the camera being a little flaky, every single animation in the air being totally wonky and waaaaaay too slow/floaty, including jumping and the earthquake attack you'll be constantly using, frightening amounts of lens flare/bloom...), so they added an extra zero to the end of the health of everything. There are absolutely much worse games out there, but there aren't a lot of games that feel more tedious.If you really want to run around with no pants on, take your pants off right now. You have my permission. No matter where you are and no matter what happens, it'll be more fun than the game.			"

												Alright. When I started writing more reviews, I told myself that I should do so after finishing the game. But this here. This game. I... can't wait until I've finished this mess before I write down what exactly I think of X-Blades.You see, the game suffers from three big R's. Repetition, Recycling, and Redundancy. How so?RedundancyFor a start, you'll be spammed - SPAMMED, I tell you - with the same enemy type in one of the mind-numbingly short levels for minutes. You better have a durable thumb (or forefinger, depending on wether you play this with a controller or keyboard and mouse), because you'll have to spam back attacks to control those monster hordes. And it's not really entertaining at all. This will go on for every single level. Even the boss battles. You'll be swarmed by mobs.RepetitionIt's not bad enough that the level design is already redundant with the endless monster hordes. Oh no, it gets worse. Because every single level will be the same. Bit of running around, bit of smashing things, button mashing, next level. Rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat. I last for about 2 or so levels per sitting. I just can't do much more because it's so incredibly badly made.RecyclingOh dear. They did not. - Hell yes, they did.See, it's not bad to use a level again at a later point in time, in maybe slightly altered form, to give the game a nice little looping back. But X-Blades takes it to a sadly very, very lazy extreme. See... you go through the whole dungeon twice. At day and at night. The exact. Same. Rooms. And you do the exact. Same. Thing. Again.For a game which claims to be of the Hack and Slash genre, X-Blades does a terrible job at introducing something which makes it stand out in the genre. The claims of the reviews that X-Blades is anywhere near as good as DMC is preposterous, even ridiculous. You better check out Metacritic first, and maybe a gameplay video on Youtube. Also, you should probably search for something superior to this.Even if the game is a bit over 5 years old, this is no excuse at being so utterly terrible. 2009 brought us Overlord II, Dragon Age Origins, and Batman Arkham Asylum.Think about this.THINK ABOUT IT.And keep your hands away from X-Blades.Oh, in a slightly belated addition: I didn't talk about the gameplay, story, and any of that, did I now? Well. If any of it had been good, I miiiight have forgiven the triple-R offense of the game. But sadly, nothing noteworthy of a story to be found here.The gameplay and controls feel stiff and rather ininspired. I played with an X-Box 360 Controller for Windows, and, bad as that is, I sometimes didn't notice the controller had lost power and disconnected from the receiver. It took me several seconds to even bother to check the controller at times, since X-Blades's controls have the tendency to feel a little sticky, at least to me.Next, I'd like to talk about the music briefly. Sadly, the tracks are repetitive, and the in-game music was much too loud for my taste. I had to reduce it to near silence to be able to enjoy the music even remotely. That being said, it was most of the times highly unfitting for the current mood of the game, or at least what I perceived to actually be the intended mood. A tense moment was completely shot to pieces by much too heavy and fast-paced rock music (double offense for the track being the bad, generic kind), and the rest of the time, the music wasn't really adding anything for me. In fact, it felt more like background noise of the obnoxious kind.Tiny little excourse to the voice-acting - there actually is some in the game! For some reason, even though I selected English as language, the voice-acting was in German... and... meh. MEH. Sorry, but it really, really destroyed the game even more. The voices didn't fit, they sounded uninspired, and the bickering back and forth between Ayumi and the dark wolf boss thingy was painfully childish and immature. Unnecessary, in other words.Oh, right, the story. To be honest, since I don't plan on finishing the game (yeah... there's only so much mind-numbing stupidity I can deal with), I have nooo idea what the story is about. And even as I read up on it, it seems like it is all over the place. Something of an artifact, someone being possessed, getting repossessed, un-possessed... whatever. I have no idea. I really don't.Maybe I should also add something about the character design. Good? Good. Or rather, bad. See, there are sexy heroines in tight, short outfits, and then there's Ayumi. I actually felt horribly uncomfortable with her. She looks much too young to wear little more than straps passing as an excuse for clothes. I don't view her as sexy. She has some adorable about her, and that makes things really awkward really fast. Add to that the uninspired childish bickering mentioned in the voice-acting paragraph of the review, and it gets really, really, REALLY awkward and weird.So, with that added to the already terribly done R's... nope. Not looking any good here, X-Blades. I'm going to play Alice: Madness Returns next, to have some really good Hack and Slash.			"

												I won't go much into the looks of character, the game has really good graphics for the year it came out and the effects are really good. The combat is repetitive and to upgrade your stuff you need hell lots of kills, however I enjoy hack-n-slash with freakin' amazing music in combat and this game did its job with this one. Boss fights are going to take some time for you to figure out how to fight them and I enjoyed it. The level design is really good, but in general you don't have much choice to wander around and discover new stuff. All in all 3/5.			"

												So if you are looking for amazing action game with a lot of fighting, then X-Blades is exactly a game for you.You play as Ayumi, A beautiful Bounty hunter. You are wandering on an island, killing monsters, collecting their souls and buying new spells or upgrading them with those souls. Don't forget to collect shards to learn new moves. And then start killing even more monsters and defeating a lots of bosses. One thing what I don't like on this game are monsters. You are actually fighting the same monsters over and over again and rarely you will be able to fight a new monster. Yes and this jumping... When game thinks you are stuck, you will start jumping and it always thinks that you are stuck when you need to get out from a corner, but you won't be able because you will start jumping and fireballs will start knocking you down again and again.However bosses that's something else. Some bosses are completely ressistant to some magic element, others spawns annoying monsters over and over again and the last ones uses these monster to make themselves immortal. And that's what makes this game challenging.Yes and there are two ending so do your decisions very carefully if you want to get a good ending.			"

												I decided to get this game for the sole reason to entertain myself and well the cheap price sort pushed me forward aswell as it was on sale. Currently I am sattisfied as it really helps with bordem, as it is a fun for a hack and slash. Howerver there are a few issues with it that I started noticing the more i got into the game and played for a longer period it gets extremly repetitive but if you play for a short while here and there you should be fine. The other ones are almost insignificat and you'll only notice them if you try to look so i wont bother saying them.I would recomend it getting it especcialy when its on sale. "

												X-blades tells a tale of a brash treasure hunter, Ayumi, whose lack of caution brings her trouble when she steals an artifact from a temple. After experiencing the effects of the artifact's curse, the protagonist is somehow transported onto the beach of some ruins and from there she makes her way through the ruins. After three to four hours of playing, I have dropped the game as I haven't seen much good in what I have experienced.First, the voice of the protagonist is kind of grating in a bratty way. I think the intent for the character was for her to be absolutely sure of her abilities, as in ""I'm the greatest treasure hunter in the world,"" but the voice doesn't pair well with Ayumi who shows disregard for caution. Instead of exuding confidence, when she publically makes this claim, it makes her come off as an immature kid which makes it hard to take her seriously. Maybe she gets better later in the story, but the rest of the game isn't good enough to compel me to continue.Second, the basic aerial sword combat is unsatisfying. While on the ground, her swinging of her sword and contacting enemies feels alright. Her jumping, however, is very floaty which makes air combat strange to execute against aerial monsters. It is difficult to quickly determine how many hits that are launched are actually damaging the enemies or whether she's just floating and waving her swords around, especially when the camera angle is not facing the enemies. Considering that swordplay against enemies is the main way of building up a rage meter that is used for launching spells, improvement in this would have made a major contribution in making the game better.This lackluster air sword combat then ties into her heavy dependence on long-ranged skills and guns to attack aerial monsters. The problem is that the pistols take at least a few shots to bring down one enemy, assuming that the enemy isn't an elemental type that's immune to physical damage, and spells require rage to use, which builds up very slowly when using her guns. Ayumi can technically charge up rage while standing still and pressing the appropriate button but then she becomes an easier target for enemies. Not only that, but rage depletes over time, so she can build up rage for a short moment and then have to flee, whereupon she starts to lose rage. The alternative way is to get hit by enemies which allows her to quickly build range and launch spells but then she can only take so much damage before she dies. I think the frustration with this is a bit evident based on how having an unsatisfying air sword combat results in having to rely on long-range attacks that most of the time can be equally disappointing. Now having a poor air sword combat and long-range attacks would not be as big of a deal if there were few aerial monsters. Unfortunately, these type of enemies occur quite frequently and very commonly in groups which makes them the most annoying enemies to deal with. Elemental aerial types are even worse if there are more than a few of them, especially if the player didn't purchase the correct spells to deal with their elemental weakness.Another part that bothered me is the pricing of the spells and its related issues. To purchase spells, Ayumi has to collect souls, either by defeating enemies or destroying destructible objects such as statues, and she can earn spells at a faster rate by continuously hitting enemies with her swords without taking damage whereupon a multiplier with its value dependent on the number of attacks successfully executed. The beginning spells seem to be priced reasonably, but after the first few purchases, the pricing seem to sky rocket all over the place and with each spell purchase the subsequent spell can cost on the scale of ten times more. So how does this become a problem?  If a player commits to buying some pricy spells, it can bite them back when facing off against a mini-boss or boss who can be defeated much easier with spells that weren't purchased.  The player might not even be good enough and will die repeatedly, and if the person is only relying on auto-save for his game, he's going to be respawning and repeatedly fighting the same boss because the game loads from the beginning of the level. And the soul multiplier? That is actually useful against enemies on the ground but pretty much useless against aerial enemies who are more likely to get a hit onto a Ayumi every time she attempts air combat.Lastly, the plot is too haphazard.  The plot starts off relatively well with background on the main character and the disaster she gets herself into for taking the artifact, but after entering the ruins on the beach, it feels like it falls on the wayside as the game transitions into a repetition of entering a level, wiping the enemies, and going onto the next level. Cutscenes occasionally occur but the transitions into them are abrupt. There is a lack of continuity which makes if feel like plot points are suddenly tacked on to give a semblance of a story and that is disappointing given the start of the game.Having said all of the negatives, there are a few positives that can be said about this game. The environments are interesting and well-varied. They're not particularly sophisticated in level design but are nice to look at and show the ambition of the developer in terms of environmental design. Although stylistically different, the cutscenes are great and fluid, showing off the anime style very well. The game looks great, but I wish the rest of the game matched the style of the cutscenes although I imagine that would be hard to pull off.  Ayumi's AOE spells are satisfying to use as they give a distinct visual impact when execute, in contrast to the lackluster basic combat.Overall, I can't really recommend the game unless you're a huge fan of the hack-and-slash genre and are scraping the bottom of the barrel. You're much better off playing the spiritual successor, Blades of Time, which improves on all aspects of the game. "

												Despite finding quite a few things that proved substantially irritating at different moments, the battle-heavy action does indeed scratch an itch.A scantily clad woman with two blades and lots and lots of monsters, that sounds like an entertaining game, but turns out to be a laborious task. It's fun for a while. But once you realize that there is nothing more to the game than fighting huge amounts of monsters in similar looking areas, it becomes annoyingly repetitive.X-Blades may prove a pleasant enough distraction for hack-and-slash gamers thirsty for something new.Overall despite a lead character that isn't the most likeable we've come across and some pretty repetitive gameplay, X-Blades still manages to be decent fun.

												X-Blades is a very hard game to review. It's a mixed bag of great ideas with somewhat poor execution. Visually environments look stunning but there is no cohesive artstyle. Menus and graphical effects really cheapen the games look. Animations are far too simple, bland and don't feel rewarding when you land a combo or hit. This is something that is crucial to the success of a hack and slash game. There is no audio-visual feedback and there are times where your attacks will miss easy stationary targetsI bring up these issues because with a more cohesive artstyle and an animation overhaul X-Blades could have become a cult favorite. The gameplay itself is standard. It's a level based hack and slash game with slight free-roaming elements as you swap between areas. Most levels involve hoardes of enemies rushing at you, but unlike in other games such as dynasty warriors, the lack of feedback or spectacle make things teadious quickly. Some bosses and enemies require special strategies but have no visual way of iterating that to the player. This forces you to read the in game hints on the pause menu.X-Blades has a lot of small gameplay issues, but the problems above are the big dissapointments. It could have been a good game with annoying faults but is left utterly medicore with so much wasted potential.			"

												The game might look good at times, but there's just not much to see here. Aumi looks out of place. She's a tomb raider straight out of a Japanese anime with a clueless bubblegum personality that its difficult to get behind. Which is a funny thing to say considering its her ♥♥♥ you'll be looking at for 99% of the game. Its just out there... always.The core of this game is combat with bad controls. You have your typical run, jump, guns, slash and magic to combat hordes of enemies. You get a rage meter that fills up so you can use magic and you get a lock on system that has difficulty locking on. The camera is pretty poor cumbersome and I'd prefer if it followed you instead of being required to swing it around everywhere you go. The protagonist Aumi can run at incredible speeds, but when she jumps she virtually stops and just jumps straight up. But there is a nifty double jump that seems useless when coupled with the poor camera.The enemies are excessive, the boss fights are just hordes of enemies with no end in sight. Each boss has an energy bar made of steel. The game really boils down to slash until you're surrounded by enemies. You've done so much slashing that its time to use earthquake to kill everything around you. Rinse and repeat. Sure there are some enemies that require specific magic or skills to kill, but its just not enough compared to enemy swarms.The game feels rushed, but I think the game devs know that you've done this all before with better games, so they flood you with it. Please skip this game, there are better games out there like Devil May Cry. Hopefully they'll perfect the combat and controls and come back with a better game.			"

												X-Blades is a mediocre hack and slash title which suffers from repetitive gameplay.You play as Ayumi, a confident treasure hunter who would rather fly solo than share the loot with her teammates. She finds a map leading her to ancient ruins in the hope of finding an artifact of incredible power. The story is very brief is mostly just there to glue the levels together. Immediately apparent is Ayumi's eye-catching appearance (with jiggle physics) in an attempt to sell through sex-appeal and honestly, it's why I played the game in the first place. Just know that it's a budget title beforehand and don't set your expectations too high.One of the main criticisms I have is with the game's structure over the course of its 40 levels. It can be broken up into 2 parts: the first 20 levels taking place in the daytime and latter 20 being the same levels but only in the evening. The second-half isn't an exact copy of the first but you'll definitely get a sense of déjà-vu as you backtrack through most of the same rooms again only with a darker color change and different monsters to kill.Using your twin gunswords, Ayumi can slash, shoot and use magic to vanquish foes. This rewards you with 'souls' which is used as currency to purchase new attacks, abilities, spells, damage upgrades etc. You can only have 4 magic abilities active at any one time but they can be swapped around during gameplay. Magic usage is dependent on your rage bar which is filled either by hitting enemies or getting hit yourself.  Strategy is involved as certain enemies can only be defeated by using certain attacks e.g. fire magic against ice enemies or a monster is only weak against guns. You'll know which attacks are effective because the game has a bestiary which sometimes updates before fighting a monster. Sadly the occasions which you have to use specific tactics to kill enemies are quite rare that most of the time the basic attack and starter magic skill 'earthquake' sufficiently clears the level. Large magic skills also plays a short animation before every use, which can get old quickly. Where the combat does shine though is in its boss battles as they require slightly different tactics than the usual normal mobs.How standard gameplay works is like this: you'll enter a level and a red bar will appear at the bottom right of your screen. You will be locked into that level while waves of enemies spawn around you. Defeating them will reduce the bar and once it's empty, the level is cleared and you're free to explore or progress to the next stage. Rinse and repeat. There are a couple of platforming rooms without combat but these are few and far between. The game will throw hordes of enemies at you and a few stages towards the end were very frantic with seemingly endless amount of enemies. Couple this with the button-mashing gameplay and it can get monotonous.There are collectables in the game as the end of each level shows a stats screen which details valuables/artifacts and objects destroyed. Often times I found myself clearing a level of monsters and then proceeding to slash and shoot every statue and pot in sight to get 100% level completion. They award souls and rare price discounts on skill upgrades while artifacts power up your attacks. Also there was strange hit detection when hunting for breakable items, on many occasions my sword attacks did nothing at point blank range until I moved around to find the sweet spot. Hit feedback is another issue as swinging your swords through enemies feels like you're just sliding through them and while being surrounded all the time, it can be difficult to notice you're even getting hit unless you break away from the hypnotizing button-mashing to look at your health bar. The double-jump button timing can be very short and you end up unintentionally performing a single jump, falling short of your goal and sometimes leading to death. It too relies on spamming the button to execute consistently.The game is very short lasting around 4-5 hours. After completion, there are incentives to start a 2nd playthrough with an unlockable 'Pro' difficulty and bonus costumes which provide additional abilities. There are also multiple endings which are triggered by what skills you've learned by the end of the game.Graphics-wise, the game exceeded my expectation for a budget title with decent textures and a beautiful, vivid color palette considering the time of original release (Oniblade in 2007). The game looked good in motion with all the combat spell effects and godrays in 60fps. Despite this, the game isn't demanding and runs well on low-end hardware, Windows 10 and is fully compatible with an Xbox 360 controller. No crashes throughout my experience either.While fighting, an instrumental soundtrack of rocking guitars will play which helps you feel like a badass as you slaughter hundreds of monsters. During some moments, the game will switch to an orchestral score to give that epic battle feeling. Music and sound effects were generally good except that the guns lacked a sense of lethality to them.Overall, the game has the essence of Devil May Cry but the level design and core gameplay do little to provide a satisfying experience among the monotony of killing rooms of enemies over and over again. The combat is fast and responsive however it devolves into spamming X and the same magic skills.Usually a cute girl is enough to carry me through a game but unfortunately this wasn't the case in X-Blades. Dat ♥♥♥ though...Mmm...			"

												Eeeeeeeeeehhhhhhh. Anime ♥♥♥ simulator. Let's see here.Gameplay: 8/10. I enjoyed the combat a lot, combining a couple of skills together to create awesome results against large hordes of enemies was probably the best aspect of the game. The movement with a mouse and keyboard was very fluid and easy to control for me, but I had to take motion blur off in the graphic settings because that really hurt my head and eyes after a while. The game ran perfectly on my poor laptop, so I guess specs aren't to worry about at all. One more thing; grinding got a little boring later on in the game, but it was nothing I didn't want to do.Music: 0/10. Muted.Aesthetics: 8/10. Looked pretty nice, even on lowest graphics, and the player character had hardly any clothes on. Could have done with a few more enemies though, got pretty tired of seeing the same few faces.Story: 3/10. (Spoiler warning) In short; Ayumi, the main character, heads out to some ruins she'd be searching for for a while. It just throws you straight into that, which takes away a lot of potential for some decent plot. After touching some darkness ball in the ruins, you get a curse. Later, you get rid of the curse from some light ball. The final boss fight is against a possessed version of some dude you meet a few times (5 times isn't a bad estimate) and when you kill him, it plays some dramatic scene where Ayumi cries and says stuff like 'wish I did not have to do this blah blah' and it's laughably bad.Probably worth playing for a couple of hours.

												This is a poorly designed, shallow game.There is a ""good"" and ""bad"" ending, but the deciding point happens about 6 minutes into the game and is never explained. If you learn ""dark"" magic - which is introduced early on, requires very few xp, and is NOT introduced next to ""light"" magic, you are locked into the ""bad"" ending which is basically a game over screen after you finish the game, even if you never actually use said magic. Really really really stupid design.The fighting is pure button mashing. Enemies have zero AI, they just run at you, stop and attack. Certain enemies can only be killed by certain magic, but nothing requires any sort of skill or strategy. Once you get rapid fire pistols and an AOE spell, all combat is stupidly easy and mindless.All fights are extremely long and boring, either due to bosses with extremely long health bars or because each wave of enemies involves killing literally hundreds of them, over and over.Graphics are reasonably good, but environments are very repetitive.Voice acting is repetitive.The main character is a very unlikeable, snide ♥♥♥♥♥ and the 2 other voiced characters have no discernable personalities.The only memorable thing about this game is that the main character is wearing a thong.

												On the plus side there are boob physics and you can stare at your character's ♥♥♥ barely covered by a g-string thong. Other than that, this game feels too easy. The controls for mouse and keyboard feel wonky, but you auto aim your pistols, and you have a basic hack and slash attack. Whenever you use a special move or jump, you slow down a bit, otherwise you're going ♥♥♥♥ing Sonic Speed Run level fast. The story is kind of ridiculous, but at least the annoying voice acting matches the character.It's not good.2/10 Blades			"

												Picked this game up as part of a bundle figured I'd give it a go, I figured I'd get a game with a good story and subpar battle system. I wasn't expecting a elegent fast paced battle system with awesome techniques and inspired abilities, and an okay-ish storyline. As someone who tends to play mostly RPG games for their in depth storylines I'm very surprised to say that this game doesn't need a good storyline (although it would be nice) because the battle mechanics alone make the game worth playing.

												Just look at the cover art, and if you're not interested then, you never will be.If however you are like me, and prefer a nice booty to look at while playing something mindless, this game will keep you entertained for sure! The music is great, the artstyle is amazing if you like that sorta thing, and the combat is over-the-top and plentiful.There also seems to be a story trying to get out there, but it's pretty much negligable, as all it does is set up the boss fights (barely), and gives Ayumi a reason for being, and staying, where she is.Great play for a mindless weekend!

												If you understand opposites (ice and fire, light and dark) then congrats, you're qualified to beat this game easily.  That enemy is red, shoot it with a blue spell!  The game sells itself as anime-esque, but the closest this gets is your 3rd person perspective of the main character who is wearing pretty much nothing but a thong and... climbing rope shibari?  Voice acting is terrible, combat is incredibly repetitive (you will spam the same few spells over and over once you realize that they do factors of ten more damage than your weapons), enemies come from about four stock models with different flair, boss fights are a joke, etc. etc. etc.If you get this game in a bundle and are a game dev yourself, take the two hours to beat it.  There's some stuff in here that could have been great and just suffered incredibly poor execution.  If you pay full price for this game... then you obviously didn't read this or any other review anyway.			"

												You play a girl, and you can see her butt!The gameplay is fun and all, but the whole thing needs SO MUCH work on polish. The environment gets dull after a while. You actually have to play through several levels twice. Not in a back tracking kind of way. Just the same levels again, but different enemies. That ♥♥♥, though!!10/10 WOULD BANG.It's like Devil may cry, or God of War, but the hit detection, collision detection, idle animations, and overall environment needs work. Also, her face could use some work. She's got a 10/10 ♥♥♥, but her face is so boring. her expression never changes, unless in cut scene. Seems like a petty complaint, but after all the work they did on her ♥♥♥, you'd think they'd do some work on her face too. She's just so boring to look at.The voice acting is SOOOOOO TERRIBLE! Apparently, this isn't a japanese game, so there's no Japanese dialogue option.That ♥♥♥, though! 10/10, would eat off of.I don't understand why her skin looks orange, though. Her skin look brown in cut scene, but it looks orange in game. Oh, but I said the collision needs work. Her feet and walk animation works well with the collision. You can totally get her to stand on a rock and do a Captain Morgan pose.Also, her ♥♥♥ is out of this world!10/10; would motor boat.I got it onsale for $2. Best $2 I ever spent?Well, almost. I once bought a kingsized icecream Twix bar for $2. THAT wasn't even the best $2 ever. But it was good.But atleast this game has good assets.HAHA! ASSets! Because she's got nice ♥♥♥!Her butt is the only thing about this game that was done well.			"

												This game is bad... like really bad... decided to give it a try after i played blades of time (a sequel which is kinda ok), but:- combat is boring and pretty repetitive- looks like you can only kill some enemies or bosses with certain spells? (which you need to charge up rage to use and spam the damn spells)- the attack animations are horrible (enemies barely telegraph their atks because it doesn't even look like an attack)- bad level design (basicaly each level was an arena with some respawning monsters)- not even going to talk about the history.....so, give blades of time a chance if it is cheap, but forget about this and save your time.

												Before I say anything else, I'm just going to say that instead of playing this game, you should get Blades of Time instead and play that. It is basically this, but actually good.The first thing about this game is that it is SUPER buggy. It is so buggy that it detracts from the gameplay. Sometimes you are just jumping up and down infinitely when you are just walking forward or not even pressing any buttons and its really annoying. Another thing is that this game is broken sometimes. By that I mean that this game essentially became unplayable at certain points due to poor level design. Within the first 10 minutes of gameplay, the game had already locked itself and I couldn't advance on. I needed to beat this ice monster and both the entrance and exit were blocked. Except the fact is that I didn't have any fire moves like they wanted me to have and I didn't have enough souls to buy the fire move. Now WTF is that? 10 mins in and you couldn't program for a lack of souls? There was actually no possible way for me to move on other than reloading the game completely. Aside from that, the movement blur was really distracting and it was way excessive compared to Blades of Time.If the gameplay and bugs weren't so bad, I probably would have liked this game because I actually liked the environment crafting and design for the most part. The graphics weren't that bad for its style of game and the music was pretty good for the game.This game is basically a buggy and worse version of Blades of Time, which is actually really fun and good. I cannot recommend this game, but I do recommend that everyone play Blades of Time instead.Rating: 6.8/10Recommend Price: Under $1			"

What you would like about this game+ Let's all admit it, you only clicked on this game because of the cover box.+ It does support high resolution screens (for an old 2009 game, that's good!).+ Perform well on my PC ( max framerate with max settings on 780 GeForce 2k Monitor)What you would dislike- Bad cutscenes that reminds you of the early 3d 90s stuff.- Generic soundtrack with no theme put into it.- The main character has an extreme annoying teenagish attittude that might just throw you off even before the tutorial level.- Bad Camera.- Confusing targeting system.- Your sword goes inside an enemy yet you arent sure if you hit them or not.- No indication if you're being hit or not.- The intro before the menu screen is confusing.- Power spells are spammable, making less need for sword combat sometimes.- Not sure if there are combos.- The first boss is laughable.- Long tidious healthbar for bosses/mini-bosses. Battle does not seem to shift in difficulty, you just keep repeating the same strategy.- No motivation to complete the story objective. Even the game turned the ""artifact"" into ♥♥♥♥ as soon as I grabbed it, literaly.- Cutscenes appear immeditaly when you complete an objective, meaning if you were bashing buttons on enemies or a boss then you will definitaly skip it by mistake.- Jumping is stiff and landing or colliding is glitchy.- Her backside did not attract me enough to sit throught the second level.VerdictThis is a below the average game in term of story and production value. I made it into the 3rd level I suppose (the one after the 1st boss battle) and I was kept attacking endless spawn of 2 enemy types; a crab-like creature and big bugs. It was really boring because crab creatures were un-hit-able with my sword since they were smaller than me. Then when I killed all the crabs, the big bugs were spawinging each time I kill one, making it really a long tiresome task. Then my character died because I had no idea the bugs were able to hit me (it didnt seem I was being hit nor any indicator on screen flashed to let me know I was being hit). I closed the game because I did not want to repeat that process AGAIN. I probably won't finish this game ever.			"

												Went into this not expecting much. Having a lot of fun so far though. It's something I'm going to casually play and I don't expect more than that. Got what makes a lot of good games: tight controls, good looking main character, unique enemies, dynamic combat, and a neat soundtrack which feels kind of nostalgic (this part is pretty subjective). Dunno about the story so far, but I'm sure it's not going to ""wow"" anyone.Low expectations, low disappointment. Gonna keep playing and may update review accordingly			"

												A classic action game. I would say the combat system is quite great though the damage animation is not quite obvious. The boss fight is challenging. Even if you are veteran of action games, you may still get 1~2 death for every fight (or maybe because of my poor skills?)Well you keep killing bunches of enemies and destroy objects to earn souls for learning new skills. Skills animiation is not outstanding but acceptable as it is a 2009-published game.The most significant drawback of this game is the repetitive killing of enemies and bosses. At first you may enjoy some videos for introduction but later on you eliminate waves and waves of enemies to complete a level and further to the next scene.I haven't completed the game so it is hard to say if there will be improvements in later levels. Overall, the combat system is alright but you may get bored easily after playing for 1~2 levels. For me, I will still complete this game but not that fast because I get bored so quickly. Still recommend to you if you are action game addict but you should get this game with more than 80% off discount.			"

												It can become a little repetative, and when you are navigating along the map it's easy to get confused and go back to previous levels (Enemies spawn again in previous levels so you might not notice right away that you are going backwards) so pay attention to what the levels are called. The higher level abilities are fun and have a cool cutscene before they are activated but near the finale of the game all you end up doing is spam high level abilities so the cutscene quickly becomes annoying. Music is top notch, voice acting and script is a mediocre, enemy AI is basic.  Fan service is top notch though ^^. Definitely worth it if you get it on sale, not worth buying at full price though.

												This game has an anime type feel to it. Guys who are interested in anime girls exposing lots of skin will like it. The cutscenese are anime sytle. Most of the game has a redish tint to it because of a majority of dust/desert feel levels. The sun exposure can get a little annoying so be prepard to toy with lighting. The game is also more of a button mashing game. While they all seem like downfalls, over-all it's not a terrible game. It all depends on what hte player likes in a game. The story isn't the best but none-the-less it's a story. If the game was offered at a discounted price of 5 or less I would say its worth a play.			"

												Recommended if you like the cheesy hack n' slash games of the yesteryears. If you're looking for something more serious, go play Devil May Cry or something.Also, it recently got an update to remove the old DRM (which was activating the game via TopWare's servers), which is nice, since there was a limit on how many times you could activate it before contacing customer support. It impresses me how some publishers/developers like these go out of their way to make sure their older games are still playable to this very day, and we surely need more of them.			"

Its fast fun with lots of upgrades and secrets. The voice acting isn't very good, but G-String heroes and dodgy voices aside. It is a genuinely fun experience and it will hold you for many hours that you won't regret.

												Nice hack and slash game. For its age still looking pretty good (yes this first came out more than ten years ago). The game rewards exploration if you find all the emblem parts your weapons and skills visibly change (nothing groundbreaking but still nice detail) and you can even find new armour if you search a bit (sure there are three armours in total but ayumi look good in all of them :).Yes controlls are pretty clunky in comparison to newer titles but its still very well playable.Story is strange to say the least with two diferent endings but honestly not bad... main character is selfish and reckless version of Lara Croft with dual swords with built in guns :)Soundtrack is pretty darn epic with main menu theme being Golden Despite (try google it)Magic is pretty straightforward like throw a fireball... Enchant your swords with light magic... cause earthquakes and so on yet theres not that many games that let you clear whole room with one huge blast these days (use black magic with causion it might cost you more than you would like to pay).Well as you probably guessed by now i like this game... i liked it since it first came out when i was a kid so yes i recommend at least giving it a chance dont expect monster hunters fancy telegraphing bosses or dmcs endless combo chaining but if you catch this in some nice sale for 5 bucks its totaly worth the try.

I myself am acquainted with old visuals and have grown very fond of this particularly because of its rigid graphics and textures. By playing this game, it gives my brain a break from the freakishly new realistic AAA games out there. The gaming world is evolving so fast that I cannot keep up with the advancements; hence I linger behind and give this dead game my time worth playing. Many people complain that this game is too repetitive. I am a human with daily routines that are in fact, highly repetitive. It’s a fact that we humans are repetitive. So I am used to the repetition. It’s not painfully repetitive, the game does throw you something new to fight, new items to obtain and with the new items you can fight new bosses, with different environments. Granted it’s a low budget game so they recycled most of gameplay from time to time, but this just helps you grind your way to get those new items you’ve been saving up for. The soundtrack is amazing, no other words for that. I did not care about the storyline so much because this game is just pure stress relief. The story is average, simply when I play this game; you got to be in the mood for killing. I’m sorry; you just can’t expect to play this game for just the story.    Many people prefer devil may cry over this game. This is because DmC is way polished, but I couldn’t be bothered to play DmC, so playing blades of time has been such a cheap experience you got to play for yourself. My rating:  7.98/10 so that’s 79.8% as a personal metacritic score.   It is an underrated gem in my opinion, which will soon grow to become a cult classic in years to come.			"

												A decent hack and slash, I suppose. Tons of upgrades, performance was quick and controls were responsive. The scenery was nice, excluding the main protagonist. Her hair physics were wacky, and the ""waist to hip"" ratio was beyond what I'd call attractive. Starting tutorial was quick and got me into the game nicely. It would have been nice to progress quicker, though... seemed too many of the same enemies were thrown at me just to eat up playtime. overall, a recommend, but just marginally so			"

												Its very hard to enjoy this game. enemies barely flinch at attacks, theres no indication you're taking damage, the combat feels tedious, and you have to buy your dodge ability which is downright useless. You can get crowded by enemies easily and the weapons you have feel so underpowered.			"

Battles can be a bit repetitive, with the use of the same spells over and over again, but the games not overly long and there is some legitimate though needed to figure out some of the battles.

												one of best hack-n-slash games for my taste ever. no annoying animations, no bothering with some awfully yadda, yadda prolonged story. just heavy metal and ultra fast hacking.although, game did all to take fun out of it self and it is up to player to make it challenging. no pro level at start, where hard is not really challenging, too easy healing/rage which can simply be bought at any time. on pro without regeneration you can litteraly die in seconds, on normal you could stand still for minutes which kinda makes it.... mehit's probably aquired taste, but as far as mine goes... pro without healing and regeneration is better than any pill to calm my nerves and let go			"

												I had hopes for this game but it seems it's just another dull hack and slash game with poor mechanics, unsatisfying combat and usually everywhere already seen skills. Additionally, the voice acting is pretty sh*tty, level design is basic and the gameplay overall is repetitive. Each time they just shove a horde of enemies to fight you over and over.3/10Adding a half naked female protagonist won't save this game. "

												I just end this game and i am not amused.GraphicsLocations are not bad. Sometimes ruins are even pretty. I can't say this about models and animations. I know that X-blades it's 7 years old game, but PS2 have games with better animation. And cutscenes look very awkard.SoundI can't say anything good and anything bad about music and sounds. They exist and just it. GameplayIt's boring! Sometimes i had fun, but only sometimes. More often i feel boredom. Game haven't to much combos, so you mashing buttons most of the time and spaming spells. All boss fights based on spaming magic into bad guy. So poorly.StoryIt's awkard like cutscenes. Game doesn't say anything about world, ruins and characters. Plot is just excuse to killing monsters.Summary4/10. It's weak game, but isn't very bad. If you have free code and lust for killing hundreds of monsters, you could try it, but i don't recommend to buy X-Blades.			"

The storylinne seems rather generic, MOST of the enemies tend to have various oddities to them that make some much harder to fight than others while others are too easy to fight. It lacks a balance for the battle.  The level up system is also a bit similar. Only real difference is a female character.The voice acting is nice but the dialog is rather cringy. The music is alright, menu music was great while in game varied from ""really..?"" to ""it's alright.""The game itself is rather short, can be completed in around two hours on one sit through after getting a grasp of how the weird battle system works.If you want to buy the game, go for it but I wouldn't pay full price for it, it's not worth the full $10 being asked for.

												Whilst I got this game through a contest on /v/, it's surprisingly entertaining. That is, once you get past the slippery controls, mentally handicapped AI, shotty animations, shotty hit detections, broken map system, incredibly bland as well as douchey characters, and 'Pleb' tier story telling. To start off, the tutorials in the beginning of the game are very vague, which left me trying to figure out just wth I was doing. For the controls, it is tight for the most part, but half of the time when you try to perform a double jump, Ayumi will fail to do so despite pressing the right buttons. As for the goal? Find it and get to it, once you've defeated all the enemies. Half way through the game, it gives you no indication as where to go and the broken map didn't help either. The music on the other hand was fairly decent, reminding me of ""Sonic Adventure's"" soundtrack. While some tracks where bland, the fighting music is where the soundtrack really shines. Upbeat and hard driven, the fighting music really gets you in the mood to slash some baddies, although I'm fairly certain they stole some of the riffs from various artists.Anyways, if you enjoy animu babes and gunblades, then this game is for you.

Although some combos are very hard to use with keyboard and mouse so I would recommend using xbox controller if you have one lying around.			"

												Bright, attractive game, with lots of charm, but there is such a thing as going too far with clothing, or lack of it, and this game does that. It’s difficult to ignore since you spend all your time staring at Ayumi’s g-string. That aside, the game is an old-school fighter. It’s not a very good one either. The main problem is that it’s just too repetitive. The backgrounds, the fighting, it all just gets boring very quickly.  Recommended? Certainly not at the current price, no.

												X-blades is a fun actioner with a female protagonist and gamepad support that works well.  The action is arena based, you have to clear the location before moving on to the next.  Thier are powerups for your character and definetly some strategy in combat other than simple button mashing.  The graphics look nice although somewhat dated and the gameplay is smooth.  I really like some of the cutscenes and the game definetly has a sense of over the top style.  It doese get repetative and some areas are reused (day/night) but its fun if you like frantic actioners.			"

												So... wow. Let's say you took Tomb Raider, then dumped liquified Final Fantasy all over it, and sucked all the talent out of the voice cast and all the clothes off the female lead, and then made the combat remarkably repetitive. Congratulations! You've got X-Blades. 2/5			"

												This feels like it was an okay premise for a game that was never finished.  The combat has no weight to it, the story is perfunctory at best, and you will essentially be locked in an arena fighting the same monsters over and over with your poor combat mechanics until you're able to move on to the next round.  The visuals are flashy on your character and combat moves, but you're going to see the same enemy models over and over, and little to no details were put into the environments.  I think the studio shows promise, but their next title will need a lot more work if they want a product to catch on.			"

												I've known a few professional reviewers mark this down because of the character in this game, but that is a personal preference. If you wish to see a blonde anime girl's bottom poking out her shorts for a whole game, that is fine, not something I will down mark it for.What is bad about this game however is the fact that for something based centrally on combat it feels lightweight and spammy. The character's main combo is not really a combo, she just waves the same two moves over and over with no movement penalties, the guns feel like peashooters and the enemies simply swarm far past the point of where the battles could be considered entertaining.In a market where the Devil May Cry series and more modern games like Metal Gear Rising exist, this is a rather hollow and bland experience. If you do want to look at a 3d model of an anime girl in a fan service context, try something like Dead or Alive as that at least has a half competent game under the skin.			"

												I absolutely loved Blades of Time so I bought this, its predecessor, but this really doesn't measure up. What I loved so much in Blades of time was the gloriously fun and intuitive combat but this game has rubbish, awkward combat with clunky fighting animations and difficult button sequences for special moves. The level design is disappointing, in each area then have to kill waves of enemies till it unlocks the door to the next area. To make some boss fights more difficult they are invulnerable to all but one arbitrary colour of magic. Of the reviews I have seen this game is heavily slated but it is not that bad. Don't get me wrong this is not a good game but it isn't as terrible as most of the reviews suggest, there is still some fun to be had here. If you are contemplating this game I'd get advocate getting Blades of Time instead it is massively better than this. I wouldn't really recommend getting this but I also wouldn't tell you to run for the hills if you are considering it.			"

												I had originally made a review prior to this one, but only half of the readers found it helpful. I thought maybe I had given the game an unnecessarily harsh time. Therefore, I played this game for an additional 15 minutes, just to see if it truly was as bad as I had initially thought. The one thing I have found out after this, is that I wasn't harsh enough. I went past the first boss battle, and more or less everything about this game is so bad, I hate myself for having paid 20¢ for it.The controls are horrid, and the tutorials don't show you how to use the game's features, but leaves you to find out for yourself. The targeting system is crude, and the only way to dodge is to target someone while trying to rotate the camera. Have you seen the main protagonist in this game? I mean, it's not like I'm not heterosexual, but I'm definitely not a pedophile. She looks like she's 14, maybe 15 years old. I'm usually an atheist, but, Jesus Christ.If you like this game, I won't judge you, but I'm removing this from my account and I'm never touching it again, If I can avoid it.

Button smashing is useless.+ Nice set of skills.+ Pure Hack N Slash.

												Okay, let me start with saying this game is alright. The graphics are good (But really, who's looking at the graphics when your camera is always behind the heroine? Hint, hint.), the controls are alright but are better when using an controller, and the soundtrack is amazing. Now on to the bad things. The backstory really isn't explored much, pretty much being told through a timeline feature, and the game doesn't really give you hints on how to beat some enemies. I spent five minutes trying to kill one enemy, only to find out I had to look in the bestiary section to find out it was weak to fire. Really? Couldn't have had it come up before the fight or even during it after two minutes passed? But, I digress. Overall, not a bad game. Would I go out of my way to buy this? Maybe. If it wasn't for the seventy-five percent off coupon I got for crafting a badge, I might never have gotten this. "

												I wish there was a star system for reviewing but this particular title leaves a lot to be desired.While the art style is appealing. The sound track is good. The voice acting is actually very good. The story while tries to be interesting, it most assuredly falls short of expectationThe game mechanics are clusmy. The controls are touchy. Doing simple platforming feels like a chore.I felt like I was constantly mashing the attack button with no real diversity.There are special abilities but are only useful when being mobbed.Transition to a new area, button mashing, transition to another area, button mashing.Rinse and repeat for pretty much the entire game.I would give this title 2.5/5 stars Not terrible, but not greatI bought it on sale. I probably would not blow the $19.99 given the choice.			"

												I should have listened to all the negative reviews, then again I bought it on sale so I'm only out a buck. I laughed at all the ""I bought it for the PLOT!"" jokes in the reviews and laughed with that in mind when I installed the game. Needless to say I didn't expect much going into the game and still, somehow, the game still managed to let me down. I couldn't make it through 30 mins of gameplay. Combat was repetitive, lackluster, and completely disengaging. The story as it was presented was a loose concept void of any actual narrative quality. If you are 11-14 years old (or of a similar mindset), are only interested in a skantily clad, over-sexualized female protagonist and don't mind heightened levels of mind numbingly repetitive gameplay, I would recommend waiting for this game to go on sale. If I'm ever in the mood for mind numbing repetitive clicking I'll go back to cookie clicker, at least the story is better.			"

												Cathartic, but it gets boring fast. Also, the game feels more like a beta than an actual final release. Some arenas have waaaaaaaay too many enemies which, at certain points, aren't even much of a challenge anymore and it just drags on and on. It has a couple of interesting boss fights (namely, one interesting boss fight) and that's about it.I'd only recommend it to people who would enjoy mashing the X button with the occasional right bumper.

Felt annoyed at replaying stages in Devil May Cry 4? Replay EVERY STAGE IN THE GAME twice or more (as the same character!) in X-Blades. Tiny enemies who duck under your attack range? We got it. Enemies who are immune to all but one weapon/your main weapon, with no tells? We got that! Infinitely spawning enemies unless you kill the right one? We got that too!

												I've heard horrible things about this game and the critics were right.Got to the first boss and got his life bar down to zero. Then my character dies in a cut-scene, with a menu following, showing how many things I collected during the stage and a prompt at the bottom saying ""Press any button to CONTINUE"". If there somehow is a special way of defeating the boss, except for taking his life bar down to zero, I'm sure there would be a message saying ""Press any button to START OVER"".So I pressed a button to CONTINUE the game, returning me to the Main Menu, with another option for Continue, which leaves me having to fight the same boss again.Repeat until bored to death. 0/10			"

												In X-Blades, the player takes on the role of the enchanting heroine Ayumi, who survives a breathtaking dance of blades through the Hordes of Darkness. The long-haired beautiful anime, with her pistol blades and mind-blowing leaps, whirls and swirls from one fantastic level to the next.The long-haired beautiful anime. THE LONG-HAIRED BEAUTIFUL ANIME.If you wish to subject yourself to a painfully boring, poorly voice-acted, shitasticly character designed, game from six years ago, this is the game for you. I bought this most likely over a year ago with a 90% off coupon and the recent release of cards has finally made the purchase almost worthy. Now the game has an even less monetary loss seeing as it provides no entertainment value from you continuing to repeatedly press one button and occasionally press another.			"

												The premise of this game is completely bland and ♥♥♥♥. The main character of this game is basically a 2-D cutout of what a manchild assumes is a girl. He then took this cutout, and slapped some huge-♥♥♥ 3-D ♥♥♥♥ and a fat ♥♥♥ onto it. Remove most of the clothes, trample on any semblence of a personality and character traits, and slap a copy-paste canned ""snarky attitude"" and you have what this game attempts to be. A huge pile of ♥♥♥♥.Everything about this game is worse than a pile of ♥♥♥♥. Especially the main character. Nothing about her is likable. In fact, nothing about her really even stands out at all. She's basically just there to be a vehicle for what attempts to be a plot. The creators of the game decided, for whatever reason, that if the game couldn't be good, then everything about the game should be ♥♥♥♥.I have a hard time accepting that this was accidentally a bad game. It just really is that bad. I have a feeling that if anything about this game was redeemable, maybe I could appreciate it. I even went out of my way to try and like the main character. But I couldn't. There was not a single thing that I could find about her that was interesting. Well, besides the fact that it was incredibly interesting how ♥♥♥♥ she was.A bad game for bad people.

												Okay, you are looking at the game on steam, see it's a beat 'em up, it looks kinda interesting (You know you want that half naked chick with swords), and you are thinking ""should I try it?""Here's a simple answer: No.Seriously, unless it's -80% you shouldn't even consider.The game is extremely repetive, and dull. The game pretty much rides on the whole ""here's a girl (with the classic idiot blonde feel) in skimpy clothes, please buy."" The combat is very simple, you just smash that attack button, and things die. And just because it wouldn't be fun to just slash everything down, the game throws literally a hundred flying creatures at you, that you simply have to ""shoot"" with your miserable guns, while strafing and browsing reddit on your second monitor or something. Oh and each time you use a proper spell, everything stops and you get to watch the same freaking cutscene, boss fights at best are 50% of watching the same spell cutscene, 40% hacking stuff up for rage to use it, 10% getting hit by something and waiting for your great agile heroine to recover from the nudge.The combat is so bad that it makes me want to cry, there's no story to speak of, the voice acting is horrible imo, and plaftorming/puzzles = jumping over spikes in a small room that just go around in the same pattern for 5 minutes. Not worth your time. The only thing I could give any credit for, is the soundtrack, which too gets old when the same song plays for the 5th time.			"

												In X-Blades you take on the role of a rather sexy, half naked anime girl, who kicks monsters assess. It sounds rathere appealing, but I didn't really feel that awe as a jumped into the game.The problems started as soon as I started the first level, you rome about a bit and then you find yourself spamming left click as monsters come in your way. And then there iss the problem with the UI, it gets to the point when your are forced to use magic spells to kill the monster(s) that surround you. By doing this you have to literally pause the game and click the spell you want to use, and it is a hit or miss on whether you hit the target or not.Overall, I think that you should no be drawn into this game because of a sexy, half naked anime girl, and you may possibly break a finger by the amount of times you have to mash the attack button. This hack and slash game is not worth your money, I'm just glad I got a 90% off coupon for the game.Rowan :)			"

												Okay, my first review was not really telling much.Anyway after playing it for 10 hours i can tell more about the game.I'll start with the parts that suck.The most important thing that sucks is story, it's really ♥♥♥♥ing stupid and there is no point behind anything, but when there is point behind something, it's a stupid point. graphic of characters sucks, it looks very old and lazily done.After critising the most important, the story, i can however still recommend the game with conditions: You don't ♥♥♥♥ing care about the story and just want hack and slash.The main character ayumi is very ♥♥♥♥ing super mega ultra strong, you have flashy swords which pierce like hell, you can set yourself alight and get inhuman speed, well everything is inhuman but this mod is even more inhumaner :D. You get to fight variours monster, there are realy dozens of them. In some levels you will get to fight army of 1000 monsters, and in some levels a boss fight. Boss fights are interesting, there always are adds so it's never 1v1 and you don't just hit them like stupid. Bosses have immunity to some sort of attacks and are vulnerable to the other sorts. In the game you have a bestiary, it's like a notepad where it says a brief information about everything you will ever meet. There you can find what weakeneses they have. But game does not only has fights, in some levels you have to avoid traps, nothing is bothering you, just an entire place wants to kill you and you just need to NOT DIE. :D That's it.			"

There's little to anything resembling a ""puzzle"" and the platforming is laughable at best.If you know what you're getting into, the game is okay if you want to just kill a few minutes with mindless hack-n-slash with some magic cobbled in.At times, it feels like an unfinished game that just got stitched together into a barely playable form factor.Granted, it's not terrible, but it's not good either. It's okay and if you don't expect more from it than what it is, you'll get in a few hours worth of mindless entertainment out of it before you get bored and put it down.So if it's on sale, and you want senseless hack-n-slash, with all skipable cut-scenes, and you don't mind a girl in skipy clothing, it's alright. Just not something I'd ever give as a gift to someone.			"

												It's not really that good... From the time I gave this game (5 hours) it kept me wanting to grind to unlock the next moveset but it really wasn't fun at all. Most of all your attacks are like wacking the enimes with bread sticks, they don't show much knockback or anything really. The game has a really annoying story and mainly I skipped through it. The game plays out like so, you're stuck in an arena, kill enimes.. go to next room and same old same old. It only changes up at bosses which mainly you can only damage by spamming the ""Rage"" moves. The movement in the game as well as the over all gameplay felt like something from PS2 or launch Xbox360. Take this for what you will, people are giving away -90% coupons for this game left and right so.. for $1 maybe you'll find some enjoyment out of it.			"

												It's pretty bad.  The combat's not very interesting, boss fights are mainly ""use this specific blast and only this specific blast"" but sometimes throw in a few annoying tasks before you can hurt them.  After you play through the levels, it makes you play through them again with some slight changes.  You can unlock an alternate costume about halfway through the game which looks a ton better than the default at which point the game slightly improves.  The story is weak, the ending doesn't make sense, the main character is annoying, and so is the music.			"

												Pretty bad through and through.X-Blades starts looking bad right from the cover art - a near naked girl with what looks like a metal thong resting in an incredibly peculiar way on her buns. But hey, Blades of Time (the sequel which I played before this) had the same problem, yet surprised me with some really good ideas, so I gave X-Blades the benefit of the doubt and played all the way through. Spoiler: there's _nothing_ redeeming about this game.I've never heard more laughable voice acting, but chances are you won't have to hear it because voices generally couldn't be heard over the game's other sounds. Complete subtitle de-synchronization is the cherry on top. It's for the best really because the ""banter"" is cringe-worthy and you'd probably rather just have it on mute. Luckily, they don't repeat lines very often.-Story-The story... watch the second opening cut-scene and just listen to Ayumi's monolog. Now imagine 9 hours more of that intensity of bad. It never gets as high as mediocre- it stays firmly at that concentration of terrible. They try to give Ayumi a character arc- she's a no nonsense self reliant gal and she don't need no ones help! Oh no, she fell into a basic trap! Luckily there's a man nearby to save her. Then.... I just finished the game and I don't remember exactly how the plot unfolds- it's really a mess. He runs off after saving her, they both meet up two other times by coincidence to fight another guy. Worth noting that no one has any given motivation whatsoever. Ayumi wants some treasure but that didn't work out by the third cut-scene, so what follows is Ayumi wandering around aimlessly until the three characters meet up and fight, apparently for lack of anything better to do. Blah blah blah the guy who saved Ayumi from the trap (with whom she has spent a total of 5 minutes with) is possessed by evil powers and she is forced to fight him. You'd think he was her long lost lover by the way she acts when confronting him. The whole plot is really disjointed and Ayumi's character arc advances abruptly and with apparent reason, creating a really confusing and inconsistent personality.-Game play-For the first few hours of the game you basically have only three powers, and they're ""dark"". Dark is bad and Ayumi trades them for light powers at some point in an incredibly confusing cutscene. There are two endings in the game, and you get the ""evil"" end if you've upgraded any of the dark powers. So... if you ever used the upgrade system at any point 4 hours into the game, you'll be getting the evil end. And there was no indication of this. OK, I'm not actually opposed to the idea of this mechanic, but I'm not replaying the 9 hours it took me to finish this game just for an equally terrible ""good"" ending (which I looked up on YouTube). Spoiler alert- in the evil end you're unable to kill the guy without killing him for real and Ayumi is very very sad about this as evidenced by a cut-scene showing her being very sad. Yay character development. It's a fitting end for her character arc.So you don't care about story and just want to watch the boob jiggle physics while killing things? This game almost delivers on that. Almost. I'm of the opinion that the fact it is a crappy console port kicks it out of ""meh time-killer"" to ""don't waste your time"".Brief overview; initially the combat is repetitive, but you gain powers and abilities as the game goes on. I played the hardest difficulty, which required a modest amount of grinding, nothing to complain about. I actually wanted to grind to unlock more powers, because they were somewhat interesting and alleviated the repetitiveness and could be chained together in ways indicative of some intelligent game design. Occasionally you could not proceed without a particular power, so you'll have to run to previous rooms, fighting re-spawned enemies to collect enough souls to purchase a power. You'll never know which power you'll need though as winning these rooms is part puzzle, part trial and error, so if you don't like grinding, guess correctly when purchasing. There was also a system by which you get a multiplier for long combos, which provided some artificial difficulty and much needed mental stimulation for me.Sounds decent so far, right? A large set of powers, incentive to buy and use them, some puzzles that require stringing a few of these powers together, and a multiplier system for self imposed challenges when the game gets a bit too easy. However, it just isn't fun for one reason: crappy console port. There are something like 25 unlock-able powers, and you can only use 4 at a time. Picture this: clicking through mouse driven menus three levels deep in order to shuffle 25 powers around the 4 slots. Any flow this game might have had is just -lost-. You map powers to what would be the d-pad. If they had just let PC users map each power to say, any given key on the keyboard, or had some sort of quick switch menu, this game could have been decent on game play alone. I suspect the people who are giving this game mildly good reviews also enjoy using some ancient version of MS excel- these menus are mouse driven only, no keyboard shortcuts. I considered automating the switching of powers with macros (program a key to automatically click around the menu as fast as they appear), but I never got around to it before reaching the end of the game.-tl;dr-There's nothing worth experiencing here- but the sequel, Blades of Time (for which I have also written a review) , is vastly improved by comparison. It's just a better version of this game. If you're at all interested in X-Blades for some reason, know that there's nothing to see here- Blades of Time is mechanically similar and isn't a complete waste of time.Update: The above said, I have the strangest desire to go back to this game. The experience was sub par at the time, but it certainly leaves a good memory.Edit- I forgot to mention that the combat upgrades are odd. There's a combination of poor instructions, awkward controls / weird timing, and poor visual feedback so that you couldn't tell if you were doing the new unlocked combo at all. In the beginning I would frequently stop and examine Ayumi's attack animations: ""Is that different than normal? I think maybe she did something different here..."" ... I eventually stopped trying to figure it out. When I could actually, without a doubt, see a move distinctly different from the usual flailing swords, it was always clunky and something you'd never actually want to use in the heat of the moment. Pity too- the dodge/jump thing could have been good. Speaking of that, an example of the how poor the instructions are: I had to minimize the game and look on gamefaqs to learn how to do it, as the game wouldn't let me continue without it. The game literally forced me to jump under falling blades- if I tried using my teleporting power I would appear on the other side of the blade dead. And IIRC dodge/jump never comes up again, so at the end of the day we have a hard to trigger, improperly explained move that is brought up exactly once but you can't continue playing until you've proved you can do it.

												I haven't finished the game yet, but from what I've played so far... It just lacks polish...The main character is an idiot. The storyline so far is literally (and this is in the first few minutes, so it's no a spoiler, per se):She's a treasure hunter. She wants a special treasure.She finds it, and is told by the guardian of the treasure... Do NOT touch it, it's deadly and dangerous.She tells him that she can handle herself and grabs it anyway, causing whatever type of mayhem that I haven't really seen yet.The levels are fairly large and have hidden items to find in them... after you defeat your enemies, because during the fight you really have to focus.Unfortunately, the levels are poorly designed and the only benefit of a large level is that they can hide items. The battles usually take place in a very small space where button mashing is your best bet.The fighting system itself has nice controls (using an Xbox controller) but the fights themselves are spamming attack until you can use a skill or if you're in one of the bullcrap fights. Shooting your guns (which offers no ""Rage"" [used for skills]) which means you have to take damage in order to use your skills. The alternative is to use the very underpowered guns and try to kill everything.The boss battles aren't challenging and just drag on. Luckily, when I saw the giant crab-like boss, I was curious. So, I opened my bestiary.It gives details about his weaknesses and strengths. But no where does the game tell you to look at it, or offer a tip stating that the bestiary can help. Even with knowing his weaknesses, the battle still dragged on to become tedious instead of fun.----So, overall... tedious battles with poorly designed levels and a main character that I want to punch in the face.idk if the story is good yet... being that the rest of the design is poor, I doubt the story gets any better.

Sure this game as good points but some things just hold it back of what it could be.PROS:Anime inspire cartoonish graphics.Smooth frame rate on a now 7 year old setup.Fast and exciting slashing and auto aim for shooting.The protagonist doesn't wear pants, nothing wrong with that in my books :3Alot of abilities to choose fromCONS:Awkward camera with insanely high sensitivity (Default)Most spells will never be used more than 5 times.Painfully long and bland boss fightsBlade Sponge enemiesAnnoying airborn anemiesPERSONAL ISSUES WITH SETUP OR OTHER MISCELANEOUS PROBLEMS:Freezing cinematicsMy final rating for this game is a Okay 5/10. But I have a hard time recommending this. There are games much like this that are just more fun. One of those games that come to mind would be lollipop chainsaw (Which would get a 6/10). If it were up to me you would not get this game even though it is not technically a bad game.			"

												My first negative review. I really wanted to like this game. An action adventure/hack-n-slash game, with some Metroidvania style level design, highscores, and an attractive (if a bit sexualized) heroine? Sign me up. Unfortunately, the formula definitely is a lot better in theory rather than practice. The PC controls are clunky to say the least (I don't have game pad, maybe this improves things), and unresponsive. For a game that is combat focused and combo heavy, this is most certainly a black mark. The layout of the levels is dull (every area is basically another large arena), and enemies respawn everytime you pass through an area. This is particularly annoying if you have to get through an area which has some annoying gimic to it (destroying enemy spawners, for instance). The aesthetic of the levels were neat though. The story was also especially lack luster, and with lacking exposition I couldn't tell you why things where happening, even if I wanted to. Also, that attractive heroine? Easily the most grating part of the game. I wish she'd kindly shut up everytime a cut-scene came up. The kinda girl that's definitely ONS status, if she were real. Anyway, unless you're willing to wade through all that, I would most certainly NOT recommend this. Double A, for Absolutely Abysmal.			"

												X-blades is a straight up hack and slash game, an ""okay"" one at that. but there are a few things that need pointing outgameplay: early gameplay is honestly very, very lacking. its a classic hack and slash, so you pretty much just mash buttons, there are no combos to do whatsoever or anything of the sort, so you will only see and use the same moves for the whole game. the game might give combos later in the game (doubt that), but in the few early levels, no combos means boring as sh!t gameplay which is going to turn off a lot of people to continue. theres the ""rage"" meter which powers up your skills, it increases when you are hitting, getting hit or charging up your skills to fill your rage. the rage will go down after a few seconds if its not being used so it will indirectly encourage skill spamming and thats not exactly fun to spam the same skills. which brings it to my next point, the early boss has quite a health. not challenging but its a brick, it doesnt do much to you but takes a billion hits to die, not to mention the game mechanic wants you to only be able to kill certain enemies with certain skills, further encouraging skill spam. the first few bosses have me just run around, kill minions to get rage, and shoot the boss. keep doing that until it dies.thats not very fun , especially in a boss fight, which should be exciting and makes your adrenaline run.graphics: for the time it was released, i guess it counts as pretty good even though it kinda looks like a ps2 game, which isnt very eye candy. the world design, is not exactly compelling either, but it works. the character model looks like the type that will start an internet flame as she is only wearing something that resembles a thong of some sort.not much to say here.story: story is definitely not this game's strong point because its just not that interesting, pretty cliche and predictable.you probably wont remember the story after beating this game.music: so far ive been hearing the same soundtrack getting played a couple of times, but its not earbleeding or anything. its okay.overall not a fun game, but this is the first few levels, which usually the point where it either hooks players or make them turn away. i heard people say the end game is more fun, but with this kind of mechanic im not sure how much more fun there is waiting for me later on. i wouldnt recommend this, and definitely not at full price. got this game on sale at 1$ so i guess i cant complain that much. perhaps if you are really bored or just in case the internet is down you might want this game, but theres a lot of games that are free and waaay better than this one.

												Even at the low low price of 99 cents it is impossible to recommend this game. With graphics befitting a 2008 Unity game that even thongs and jiggle physics can't save, and controls worse than a fever dream, X-blades is an entirely unrewarding experience. Your adversaries are either ripped apart like the tissue paper in a sports bar urinal or take an unneccesary number of swings to kill. Jumping is clunky and aerial combat is near impossible. When faced with numerous mobs, they suffer little to no knockback, meaning that if in your bored tyrade of 'click repeatedly to use sword on mans' you start to take damage, you stagger and your health can be depleted fairly rapidly. There is an illusion of variety in combat, but it ultimately boils down to clicking on everything repeatedly until it stops moving,  and if your blades don't kill it, shoot it or throw fireballs at it until it dies.X-Blades also opens with cinematics - albeit in an entirely different art style - but then ends abruptly when you are transitioned from stage to stage with no advancing in the ""storyline"" or any idea what your purpose is for being there. Although not as polished as similar titles like God of War or Devil May Cry, this games spiritual successor ""Blades of Time"" is all around a better experience. Save your dollar and buy a Snickers or something.			"

												This was an interesting game. I haven't beaten it yet and I may not end up doing so, here's why. This game is pretty much a direct rip off of Devil May Cry, there are a few out there. The gameplay is pretty ok, sub-par at best IMO. Definately a game better played with a controller. Anime Style graphics aren't bad, it's actually quite charming but the animations feel like something out of an early, EARLY PS2 title.The ""boss"" battles are not terribly imaginative and straight forward. Overall heres the pros and cons:Pros:- Charming anime style art- Holds true to the hack and slash genre- Tons of levels to explore- Smooth gameplay for the most partCons:- Insanely repetative- ""Boss"" battles are unimaginative and feel more like a regular battle- Sometimes magic will not cast even if you mash the button- (Personal Con) No achievements, I usually like the extra goals to help keep interest in a Hack n' Slash title, especially one as repetative and tedious as this oneOverall I give this one a solid 4/10. It's not really a great game and I honestly can't recomend it. You're better off buying any of the Devil May Cry games.			"

												This game is actually pretty cool. It can be floaty, but it actually has a lot of systems that make for it.First, the game is not really expensive, and you can also wait for a sale. This way you'll probably appreciate the game better. And this game is actually pretty nice, it is a hack and slash game with a nice lady as protagonist that really can kick ♥♥♥ (she has some swords and guns, so... you can associate that to some other protagonist). Even so, she actually stands for herself, since you can improve her in a lot of customizable ways as bullets for your guns, and magic powers like a fireball.The game looks ok, it has some of those elements that make look nicer than it should, in some older games. The controls are simple and work well in the keyboard, it is not necessary to play with a gamepad.As its flaws, the enemies, even the first ones, can look a bit hard to hit and take a bit to kill. The Targeting system works, but sometimes it doesn't, so it can be hard to hit that enemy. As the character has a wide range of attack, it almost serves the purpose of making for the flaws of the target, but it doesn't.Also, the magic may take a while to charge, which is not really fun, even though you don't use mana.Well, you can buy this game, it has some good elements of fun and you can appreciate the game. Specially in a sale.			"

												Enjoyed my time with this one. I was really glad, when my character suddenly had some sense of decency by wearing more than just her panties and bra. Ok, it is a hidden costume in an optional part of the game, but still. Other than that, a little advice from here: (WARNING - SPOILERS):If you're like me, you're not going to play this a second time. If that is the case, do yourself a favor, and ignore any Dark Spells. Don't buy a single one (it is only avaible in the first halve of the game). IF you buy just a single Dark Spell (Easy to differentiate), you automatically get the bad ending after beating the Finale. To get the good ending you'd now have to restart from the beginning and replay the whole game without buying any dark spells. "

												I look at the reviews for X-Blades on the page and I honestly find myself baffled. Review after review recommending this game that I honestly wish I had never bought. In the interest of honesty, I will disclose that I only bought X-Blades at the request of a friend, with the promise of lunch at a hibachi steakhouse if I got the good ending. And as good as the steak and shrimp was, I'm not completely sure if it was worth it. I'll start with the story. What little story there is is so incredibly generic one could get the main gist with a few key words. Blah blah blah treasure. Blah blah blah Darkness. Blah blah blah ancient power. blah blah blah. This doesn't stop the main characters, though. I suppose just having a story is a major accomplishment for an entity as relatable as the half-eaten bag of crackers in my trash can. This is only half due to the inherent flatness of the characters though. The other half is because of the incompetence of the voice actors. Each and every line is delivered like the person standing behind the microphone has a gun to their head. The incredibly threatening recording sessions obviously having taken place weeks apart and in different locations. Then they just stitched the recordings together like someone trying to make a car by sewing construction paper together with string. The visual design is actually alright, feels like it's a bit behind the times. It would look fantastic on a PS2, but it falls short on modern consoles. The sound design is back and forth, as the music is good, but each individual sound effect feels like a tiny murder every time it plays. And finally, we come to gameplay, arguably the make-or-break point of game design. It's repetitive. It's incredibly repetitive. I honestly can't imagine why anybody outside of an insane asylum would play this game the entire way through without the promise of chicken and shrimp. If you aren't using the weightless melee attack, you're using a small pool of spells that you've picked out until the game decides that the enemy you're facing needs this specific type of spell. One particular boss requires you to use quite a few different spells, and you can only have so many equipped at once, so more than a few times during the fight, your main enemy will be the menu. In conclusion, Don't bother with X-Blades. if you absolutely can't help yourself, go find the soundtrack or something, but the game is absolutely not worth the time it takes to buy it.			"

The gameplay is tedious, the mechanics are terrible oh and if you buy any of the dark power spells you get an unavoidable bad ending that there is zero warning of.

												NO!!! This game is pretty to look at, but terrible to play. Fighting bosses in this game is like grinding my eggs on the side walk. They take several hits, and not just normal attacks, special magic attacks! And, the only way to perform those is by killing the little minions that constatly spawn around them. But you still have to dogde the bosses attack! I've played several missions of this game and all I've seen is a constant repetative nightmare! Do yourself a favor and just avoid this game... I don't care if its free, it's not worth waiting for it to download.			"

												Horrible DMC ripoff. Each level is basically an arena where you grind through continuous waves of enemies till its over. Bosses have way too much health and each area has wayy too many guys, that you'll spend 10 min killing the game guys on a stage over and over till you move onto the next. You basically spam attack or the same spell to kill them. Game lazily forces you back through the same levels through 2nd half of the game. Got to a boss fight that was broken. He spawns these guys you must kill before he becomes vulnerable. Problem was i kept killing them but he never stopped spawning them. There was one opening and I shot him 5 times and it didnt even do 1/10 his health. He then never stopped spawning guys the right of the fight. Spent 10 min killing endless waves of guys that never stopped, and finally ran out of health and gave up. Controls are terrible, as  theres no real useable dodge and no blocking. You get attack combos but theyre so finnicky and hard to pull off theres no point.  Nothing good to see here, even her ♥♥♥ looks bad in the thong. 3/10.			"

												Poor DMC clone, X-Blades could have been great if it had a good story, better combat and more content.  What X-Blades has is highly repetive gameplay similar to the Serious Sam in some ways - Fight waves of monsters to finish level, then standard boss fight + infinite respawning monsters, rinse and repeat, it gets very boring after a few levels because you start to quickly realizes that this is pretty much the game, add in a few occasional power-ups and that is X-Blades, which is kinder a shame because it held some potential to be much better. Not to mention, controls are not nearly responsive enough, and even buggy such as floating in mid-air because bosses have a generic hit box which you can get stuck on.			"

The game looked hard to me the first minutes, the I realised: iit's not hard, it's just dead long! Bosses can be defeated by spamming skills when they're trying to attack and attacking them right after FOR 10 MINUTES.Here's the game: attack a few seconds the ground enemies to get fury to be able to use skills, use any aoe skill you got, shoot eventually air enemies, repeat. The levels can be easily completed.... but it takes so much they seem hard. Waste of time. Now I also see why this was in a 10randomgames-bundle...			"

												it's an aquired taste but it gets fun after a whilefrom what I know there's a secret outfit called the ""feel good outfit"" that makes her actually wear clothes. I don't know how to make her unwear it.But back to the actual game, I got this free with a couple of sold trading cards so I figured i'd give it a go. Amazingly, it's actually worth at least 6 bucks. maybe the 9 bucks full price, but there was like a 3 level dlc that was on xbox live and not on pc, but hell it's kinda fun. if you're a hardcore or even moderate spectacle fighter fan you might find this bland and repetitive but that's kind of the charm. there's an obsessive-compulseive kind of gameplay going on here and bashing buttons is interesting and the leading lady is stupid at first (it's obvious she's dressed the way she is because she's self-obsessed and overconfident, brash... at least they made it work with the character) but her banter gets funny after the second level where you fight the turtle that belches fire at you. the secrets are very easy to find and the game easily has gotten 4 hours in one sitting out of me, so yeah.would I reccommend it?yes, but not for people that want a top-notch game. it's a fun little distraction. get it on sale, and keep an open mind, and try not to get irritated by her constant lack of clothes, and ayumi will be a fun character to play as in this game.I give it 3.5 out of 5 stars. nothing amazing, but it's a very fun grind.

												This is really bad game in almost every respect. The gameplay is tedious, the mechanics are terrible oh and if you buy any of the dark power spells you get an unavoidable bad ending that there is zero warning of. Considering that you get enough currency to buy all the spells without working for it, this is a really bad design choice. If you are desperate for games with this amount of asscrack, there are better ones to pick.			"

												I've played this a few hours and all I found was bland smashing buttons to spam attacks and those 2 same skills that dealt aoe damage... The game looked hard to me the first minutes, the I realised: iit's not hard, it's just dead long! Bosses can be defeated by spamming skills when they're trying to attack and attacking them right after FOR 10 MINUTES.Here's the game: attack a few seconds the ground enemies to get fury to be able to use skills, use any aoe skill you got, shoot eventually air enemies, repeat. The levels can be easily completed.... but it takes so much they seem hard. Waste of time. Now I also see why this was in a 10randomgames-bundle...			"

												Okay, going to say this, first and foremost: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! IT IS NOT WORTH IT!The game is horrible. Without hardly any deviation, this is how the game goes: You start off in this room where you have to kill all these enemies until the game tells you to stop and move onto the next room, where you have to kill all these enemies until the game tells you to stop and move onto the next room, where you have to kill all these enemies until the game tells you to stop and move onto the next room, rinse and repeat, RINSE AND REPEAT, OVER, AND OVER, *AND OVER!* Repitition is the name of the game, here.The ruins where you ""explore"" are interesting to look at. Wanna learn more about them? Too bad, the game doesn't explain them! And Ayumi, the lead character, is nothing short of obnoxious! I HATE HER! I hate her personality, I hate how she dresses like a street walker, I HATE HER! And, yes, she is a BLATANT rip-off of Lara Croft, without any of the latter's charm, explorative abilities or puzzle-solving antics.The enemies are dumb as rocks, and while that can be dealt with easily, there is one kind of enemy that you face early on that is a pain to deal with, as if you're getting swarmed by ground-based enemies and five of these special enemies circle you, then there goes half your health and no, I am not kidding.I also had MAJOR lighting issues while playing it, at least on some stages. It was like the camera had its own shadow. And speaking of mechanics, swiping or shooting at destructible items is counter-intuitive. You need to break all items in the game to get 100%, but you can stand in front of a pot, hack and slash at it for about five or six swings, but it'll break at the sixth or seventh swipe. Stone coffins do show you hitting it, but nothing else does.Finally, something worth noting, this version was played on a Mac. I am aware that the Mac isn't a good system to play on, except I also owned this game on the XBox 360, which is said to be the best version. That's not saying much - I had the exact same issues with that version. However, as I mentioned, this was on a Mac, so, instead of doing a different port, they just made what is called a Wineskin (for those who don't know, it's an application that allows programs that were made for Windows to be played on Macs.) They did nothing to enhance the game in any way for the Mac.In the end, there is no possible way I can recommend this game. It's like they tried to make a game, like Golden Axe or Streets of Rage, but ended up sucking all of the charm out of those kind of games.In the end, I had more fun playing Superman 64.			"

												At first I was tough that this would be quite good game, dynamic fights and what not but it is basically fighting tons of enemies in arenas and you don't even know if you are doing well or not, how many more enemies you should kill to progress to another arena, no indication whatsoever. And with boss fights you don't have boss health bars so you don't know if you hurting them or not, or you need to kill like thousands on simple enemies first.Very very repetitive and fight itself isn't even that challenging, there are couple upgrades and spells but nothing like Devil may cry skills/ combo upgrades, just some basic spells and gun shooting modes, really nothing special here :/Some very bad design here not only gameplay specific but also main character that have face of baby and is half naked and even as a man I find it little cheap and irritating.

												From what i have experianced it is a ""eh"" game. During the above the sea part, it is a pretty tedious fight, and the targeting system caused me to jump off the edge near the 2nd to final enemy i needed to kill. To keep it short, the game is pretty damn bad with it's default settings (my sensitivity and motionblur made it unplayable without changing), the targeting system is pretty bad, it kinda of falls in with DMC but worse and it is (from where I got) Boss Fight the game. If you get it for like a few bucks go ahead, but all it has going for it RN is Ayumi's ♥♥♥ and an hour or so of fun.			"

The minibosses are a pain in the ♥♥♥ to beat, offten stunning you with one attack that does massive damage, letting its minions beat on you for 2 or 3 seconds with no way to dodge out of the way.

												Horrible DMC ripoff. Each level is basically an arena where you grind through continuous waves of enemies till its over. Bosses have way too much health and each area has wayy too many guys, that you'll spend 10 min killing the game guys on a stage over and over till you move onto the next. You basically spam attack or the same spell to kill them. Game lazily forces you back through the same levels through 2nd half of the game. Got to a boss fight that was broken. He spawns these guys you must kill before he becomes vulnerable. Problem was i kept killing them but he never stopped spawning them. There was one opening and I shot him 5 times and it didnt even do 1/10 his health. He then never stopped spawning guys the right of the fight. Spent 10 min killing endless waves of guys that never stopped, and finally ran out of health and gave up. Controls are terrible, as  theres no real useable dodge and no blocking. You get attack combos but theyre so finnicky and hard to pull off theres no point.  Nothing good to see here, even her ♥♥♥ looks bad in the thong. 3/10.			"

												Can be summarized as ""Mash M1 until the little red bar depletes."" In each area you enter, you must kill the enemies until the bar on the bottom right of the screen is depleted, that's it. They will always spawn in the same spots and if you're lucky, they might start spawning different enemies. I often wondered if I was doing something wrong at first because this seemed so tedious but that is the way it's supposed to be. Come to the first boss I keep hitting him over and over but nothing seems to be happening. Surprise! That bar is now the health bar, and yes it does take 5-10 minutes of doing the same exact thing to kill the boss. Occasionally, you will enter rooms that contain some form of a ""puzzle."" For example, there is one room where you are trapped and must avoid spikes that go in a pattern for about five horrible minutes (and again, I thought was doing something wrong BUT NO IT'S JUST THE WAY THE GAME IS).There appears to be some barebones of a story but the voice acting and writing is just so awfully cringey that I could not manage to get through more than oen or two of the cutscenes. The game looks okay graphically but the design of the main character is frankly just creepy.The only saving grace is the soundtrack alone which is AWESOME.			"

												Three good reasons to get this game.1- You're to poor for Devil may cry / a game like that.2- You like the Female buttcrack[images.akamai.steamusercontent.com].3- You got this game for free.Graphics: 6/10 Animestyle looks ok & Female uncensored butt.Story: 5/10? The story of the first 30 minutes I played was this -> Contains wanna be spoilers > Here are some random monsters and fight.Gameplay: 5/10 No matter how often you aim down, you will swing your blades over the monster. This also applies when you try to hit a nonmoving statue. Skills are kinda bugged and will mostly trigger once all the mosters left. Attacks are so slow, it makes me wonder if my framerate dropped.I haven't unlocked the steam trading card yet, but I don't know if I should endure this game for unlocking them.“As fan of the Devil May Cry series, you will love X-Blades.” 80 – GameRadio.

When you play a game, you expect being able to actually do all the stuff or die trying, not just sitting there waiting for a NPC to rescue you by a design decision.I was breezing through the game, with nothing being very hard to kill, and then BAM, a boss with a life bar so big that it would take an hour just to beat him, even if you had cheated someway to be invincible.Don't buy. Don't play. Avoid.			"

												What a awful game. The combat is some of the most light feeling and generic that I have ever seen. “As a fan of the Devil May Cry series, you will love X-Blades.” 80 – GameRadio. I honestly think they were very, very stoned to have said this. Yea, Devil May Cry games, particularly the newest one, are awesome. This game is so generic and bad that it is a slap in the face to DMC to mention it in the same sentence.“X-Blades is an absolutely solid hack 'n slay game that can compete with major titles of the genre.” 84 – NexNow. Again, they must have been really high because everything is way better when you are stoned. To call this a solid game would suggest that whoever wrote that has never played any other game in their life because this game is very, very generic, bland and boring and just not well made at all. All you do is mash the attack button and use the same couple skills over and over again. To say that it competes with major titles in the genre, well it made me laugh. What it should say is “X-Blades is an absolutely HORRIBLE hack 'n slay game that can compete with major titles of the genre when hell freezes over.”All you do is spam the same skills over and over and over again and mash the attack button four thousand times a minute. The graphics are really bad but oddly enough the art direction of cutscenes is good. I stuck it out for as long as I could which was about one and a half hours. I thought the combat couldn't get any more generic but on the boss fights the only way to dmg them is with skills. Boss fights last an incredibly long time because you just have to spam your skills which do barely any dmg to a boss until he dies. This game is so generic it feels like some college kids got together and made it for a school project. F--k this crappy, mind-blowingly generic game.3/10. If you think this deserves over a 4/10 you should be hung. Poorly executed, highly generic dog crap that is constantly on sale for a dollar but they should be paying people to take this horrible piece of trash.			"

												Score - 48/100Personal rating - Game-starved genre fans only need applyHad I played a demo - No purchase""You can't judge a book by its cover.""For most things in life, that old adage rings true. First appearances are most often not representative of something's value. When it comes to video games though, there are a decent number of things that can be almost instantly determined, and such was my experience with X-Blades.The graphics are a strange dichotomy of fantastic and bad. The 3d modeling is acceptable, the animations are rather clunky, and the texture work and set-piece design are phenomenal enough to make you forget about it all. Until the cutscenes, anyway, which are SO low-resolution and SO compressed that you'll be looking for the Youtube quality button in the corner, trying to switch up from 360P. Thankfully, the game is extremely well-optimized, with my old desktop able to get framerates in low 100s at 1920x1200 with everything maxed (AA on 4x).Speaking of graphics, I can't type up a review of this game without mentioning its most advertised asset. I have seen some ridiculous fan service before, and seen main characters in AAA games that I would have hidden from my mother as a kid, but this game's heroine, Ayumi, takes things to an entirely new level.Her outfit is so ridiculous that she is seemingly naked from more angles than not. Her hair covers more of her body than all her clothes combined. Her boots cover more of her body than the rest of her clothes combined. Hell, even one boot covers more. Her thong literally disappears into her impossibly-tall butt crack, and the camera is far enough back that should you play all the way through this game, you will be treated to a full moon for 8 straight hours. Her bra-esque top is by far the most sensible thing about her outfit, and if that doesn't just highlight the absurdity of it all, I don't know what would.You know a game is pushing that envelope when the obligatory softcore-porn fanart pics come across as nothing but redundant. Don't get me wrong, I like a well-sculpted butt more than most, but this is getting ridiculous. I'm not lying when I say her outfit couldn't possibly be any skimpier unless it just consisted of strategically-placed k-tape and pasties.I am a sucker for good music in a game, and I'm happy to report this game satisfies. The driving soundtrack in this game is pretty great and more than once, I found myself nodding along happily while I slaughtered wave after wave of enemies. I even checked the game's data folder for MP3s so I could keep them (they're there, in .ogg). Even in just my short while with the game, however, I noticed themes being recycled, which is understandable yet unfortunate. In addition, the sounds are cheese-tastic. The voice acting is stretching to be considered B-quality, and all the other sounds are completely forgettable. While that in itself is not a problem, overall the game will not win any bonus points for audio.This might all sound pretty decent so far, but the real meat of the matter, the gameplay, is bland at best. There is one attack (the X button), and several unlockable skills. No combos, no strong/heavy attacks, no aerial launches, and no strategy. Just X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, rage attack, X, X, X, X, X. It gets very repetitive very fast. While some people might not mind that kind of repetition, I don't think anyone would deny that a little bit of strategy would make the whole thing a lot more palatable.This is especially true since character movement is so disjointed and... clunky, for lack of a better word. Ayumi tears around the levels at full sprint, but doing anything else just breaks her rhythm. Attacking slows her down and leaves her vulnerable just slightly longer than it should, there is no dodge button, and jumping is entirely useless. There are no valuable aerial attacks, and jumping actually slows Ayumi down, so if you're trying to leap out of danger, you will come back down in worse shape than you left. If all you're doing is touching the left analog stick, Ayumi's movement is incredibly smooth and fluid, but as soon as you touch any other button, the action gets choppy and frustrating.Level design is rather lame as well. For the most part, each area just drops you in a little self-contained arena, where you will be spamming the X button over and over and over and over and over on little endlessly-respawning waves of weaklings until you earn enough rage (basically mana) to cast the one or two spells that can damage any applicable ""boss"" creatures. Repeat until he/she is dead, and move on to the next arena.Games of this genre are at their greatest when they set everything up for frantic high-speed slaughtering. This game introduces so many little quirks, niggles, and idiosyncracies that I just can't recommend it over any other similar game. I would suggest going and playing any of the Devil May Cry games, that new Metal Gear Rising game, or even this game's own spiritual successor Blades of Time (which is supposedly better in every way, and not a direct sequel).For the vast majority of things, it is undeniably true that you can't judge a book by its cover, but when fundamental things such as character controls and basic gameplay mechanics frustrate me and nothing other than music impresses me, I'm perfectly confident in my decision to skip this one. Take this review with a grain of salt, of course, as it is always possible that I'm just not the target market at all, and so this game went entirely over my head. I've always found the concept of ""fun"" to be more or less universal, so I kind of doubt it, but whatever.			"

The fighting is enjoyable. The guns are fun to use with their different upgrades. The bosses all have different weaknesses, and ways to beat them. The skill system is fun to use. All that right there makes me come back to this game. It's fun to just play around with with I'm bored. As for the fact that she seems nearly naked? Who cares.			"

												Looks good, but a real grindwasteHere is what I liked:Art styleIdeasKind of the story-------And now for the rest of my opinions...-------I could not stand the grind for souls, so I hacked my save and gave them to myself.I don't like cheating, but this game was not worth the amount of time it wanted to request of me.The story needed to happen more often, the battles take forever EVEN WITH ALL THE MOVESEnemies respawn, making backtracking a bit tedious, and no real reward for finding anything or all this extra work.The gameplay is okay, the camera is terrible, and the moves are pretty much different elements in varied power levels.  The only variation is if an enemy needs a specific move to kill it or times when an element is needed.I really cannot say much... I rushed this, I know I did, I hate that I cheated, but all cheating did was spare me a ton of hours I would never have wanted to invest in the first place.I played this, now I am installing Blades of Time.I would not have paid full price for this game, other than the hours of grinding, there is not much to gain for your money.  I got it in a bundle :PThis is one I would pass on if you have it in your wish list.  Plenty of games like it, and the story could be viewed on YouTube.			"

YouTube™ Video: Random Opinion: X-Blades First Impressions 

			Views: 102		

			This is my first impressions. I didn't finish the game and i won't. Follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Little_B_Gaming		

X-Blades try to be spectacle fighter like Devil May Cry, God of War and so on, but it's far, far away from them. Here you don't have different weapons to choose or set of move. You relay on two swords and guns which are useless (after upgrading the guns they start to become somewhat useful) and a lot of mashing buttons.After killing an enemy, you collect souls, which are the currency of the game, With them you can buy magic spells. You can equip four at any time. But they are almost the same!!! Lightning on sword, fire on sword, Earthquake or Fire Rage it doesn't matter. From time to time you see new skill is unlocked, you open the menu to check it and where is it? You have buy some of the available spells and then you see what is unlocked. But what if i don't want to? Well there is no choice. The spells are tight with the bosses, not all but still. For example, there is this werewolf looking boss (which i fought 3 times) For 20 min or more i didn't hurt him once, then out of frustration i open you tube. You have to buy a specific skill named Sparkling Sword to beat him. How can I know that?! There is no indication that you need it. This is the same thing for some of the other bosses. And the fights with them are too long. For activating spell you need Rage. This is why you use the swords, other than that as i wrote they are useless, so most of the time you count on spell with area of effect, like Fire Rage. Later in the game the skills are quite expensive, so prepare for grinding. The difference between area of effect spells are the animation for each one. They take you out of the action and after that the camera is in weird angle. Games like this have some sort of move to avoid attacks. Here you can buy one, but it's not that useful and a lot of attacks become hard or impossible to avoid.Graphics are good, but the cutscenes are bad, they look worse than the in-game graphics. Level design is boring, just ruins and they are basically arenas. To move to the next area you have to kill all enemies on screen.The music is okay, rock and metal tracks, probably you won't remember it. Same thing can be said about the story. You play as Ayumi, treasure hunter and she touch something and she is cursed. It's completely forgettable.I mentioned you don't have different set of moves. This isn't quite true. In the game you collect three types of artifacts. When you find enough, you gain more life or some moves for the swords or new skills for the guns (then they become somewhat useful). Let me buy them, I don't want look around just for upgrading my airstrike, which is useless!!!I can go on and on with the negativity. There is some pleasure in the mindless action, but it won't last long. I didn't expect AAA game, but me some bad design decisions ruin the potential of X-Blades. It's not the worst game i've ever played It's often on sale if you have some interest, but don't even bother.Pros: nice visuals, okay soundtrack, some mindless action, responsive controls Cons: boring level design, no debt to the combat, repetitive, some skills/spells are directly tight with the bosses and it's not at least hinted what you need to buy for them, annoying heroine, forgettable story			"

												This game is like putrid anal fudge coming out of a rhinos ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, dribbling into my eyes, mouth and ears. the controls range from ♥♥♥♥ to meh, the motion blur is horrid and annoying. The main character is a unlikeable ♥♥♥♥ing prick, willing to let all of earth die because ""she can handle herself"" and then procides to ♥♥♥♥ everything up. Her voice will get to you, causing you to either mute the game or turn it off. Now the controls are simple, smash the left mouse button and maybe press E on a boss, the guns are completely useless unless you want to spend 13 years shooting the smallest thing. boss fights are the worst ive seen in a while, its you fighting waves of the same people from the game you have already fought before, while you run and try to hit them with a fireball. the bosses are simple and not worth the effort. The only redeeming part about this game is it makes for decent porn when you have nothing else as all the female has to were is a g-string, bra, and assless/crotchless pants. Even when running this game at low (and i can run it on max) there are framerate issues, and graphical bugs, randomly becoming invisible or falling through the floor, once you look past all the glaring problems with this game you find just a mess as well, its a undercooked, copy paste version of devil may cry except devil may cry is actually fun! There are some small positives with this game, such as the porn thats bundled when you take awkward creepshots with the camera angle, the music at first was not bad, and i like the level design, but every problem i see with these games just throws those positives out the window. ♥♥♥♥ you green man gaming for giving me a discount on this game.

												Back in 2009, many games tried too hard to be God of War/Devil May Cry and failed miserably.I remember this game back then, I was like ""Wow, this game looks like ♥♥♥♥..."" and now that I got it for free and I'm 6 or so years in the future, I shouldn't bother anymore but.... wow, this game IS ♥♥♥♥.-The combat is dreadfull. You smash the X button in hope of hitting anything, but some enemies just run away, can't be hit or are way too small to be hit. Every ♥♥♥♥ing move from bosses will stagger you CONSTANTLY, which is infuriating, specially when they have godlike homming fireballs that chase you even in reverse.-Bosses can't be hit by your swords, you'll have to kill them with magic, the problem is that bosses  have WAY TOO MUCH hp, and the only way to regain ""mana"" is to kill enemies around them, which are more annoying than the boss itself.-Dodging is USELESS. Doesn't respond correctly, doesn't do sh*t. You have to get the teleportation skill ASAP.-Enemies are dumb and infuriating, specially the small crabs. They make a mosh around you and don't let you move.-Character design is stupid. I can't take this game serious. The main character fights using a G-string, for christ sakes.-The story? I couldn't give a rat's a*ss to it. Just skipped every cutscene without thinking twice.... and I could go on.I got this game for free, and I shouldn't be complaining, but time is money, and what a waste of my time.I'll probably try it again in the future. I always give second chances, not that I intend to becoming a fan any time soon.UPDATE: This is it. This game just broke the record of most annoying enemies in a single game. Enemies that run away from you, are too small to get hit, fly away or fly to high so you can't hit them, enemies with stupid homing attacks that follow you even in reverse, enemies that pop out of nowhere and hit you whitout you even knowing, enemies that hide inside walls, bosses that take way too much damage to die, attacks that stagger you everytime. enemies that surround you and don't let you move.For f*ck sakes. Why did I even insist?			"

I enjoy some hack and slash games but most are  total garbage. This just seems to be a crappy game. The graphics design in the prerendered scenes and the game are also totally diffrent to the point that when I got into the game I thought something glitched.This just seems to me a worse version of a game we all have played. Whether thats God of War or whatever isn't important, the important fact is that this game is meh.			"

												This game is one of the most supremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pieces of garbage i've ever played. Never have I played such an inept and careless amalgamation of every single awful trait you could possibly include in a video game. The entire game is smacking monster shaped pinatas over hilariously edgy music and then moving onto the next arena filled with monster shaped pinatas. Each arena (of which there is a variety of like 5) is the entire ""level"". Sometimes the pinatas aren't even monster shaped. They're just ♥♥♥♥ing urns that take 2 minutes of continuously clicking left click to kill individually. The ""levels"" that these urns appear in are the ONLY ENEMY IN THOSE ""LEVELS"" AND THERE'S LIKE 10 OF THEM ON EACH ""LEVEL"".It would be impossible to list all the reasons this game is a steaming pile of anime dogshit even after only playing it for an hour.The cringy trailer, typo ridden and laughable bio, and sheer hilarious ♥♥♥♥♥iness that I gathered from the screenshots made me think this would be worth 99 cents for a laugh.It wasn't.i'd rather buy blood and bacon for the third time			"

												Fairly certain the main point of this game was so the devs could stare at an underage blonde girl's bare ### throughout the development process, and pass that perk on to the audience.Being blinded by that is the only way I can explain the play-testers overlooking the pointless, seemingly endless waves of uninspired enemies...  (That last point-- seemingly endless waves-- in any other game, would indicate you're supposed to either push past them, find some way to stop the flow or find the ""real enemy.""  Not here.)At $0.99, though, I don't feel bad about it.  It could be fun in short bursts.			"

The game spots quite weak and unimportant storyline, very nice graphics, beautiful level design and enjoyable combat system letting you upgrade Ayumis weapons and powers as the story progresses.

												This game is horrible. I am not even going to ease the message in. No. This game is pure crap, and I couldn't bear to go through the first 30 minutes of it. -Some times enemies pass through walls. -Other times you don't have any indication you're doing any damage to enemies that can't be hurt by your swords, so you stand around shooting them for around a minute each until they fade into non-existence. -In 2 out of the 3 levels I (somehow) played it just placed you in the middle of an arena(?) while enemies suddenly appear... and that it. That's the level. No explanation, just, fight stuff. Yay. -Special attacks can be activated using a rage meter that builds up, flying and tiny enemies cannot be hurt by your sword, which means you cannot generate precious rage, which means you have to stand and shoot them for uncomfortable amount of time with nothing really exciting happening, just begging for those enemies to die already.I want to add some more - on top of what I said, there is no combo system, the combat is dull and boring, unlockables seem like copies of eachother with no unique aspect to them, and the sound is also lacking and unsatisfying.Did I mention the protagonist is bland as toilet paper fan service?In short, I feel ripped-off, and the sad thing is, I got this game for free. I feel sorry for the poor people who actually paid for this game, it's... it's as if Devil may cry was developed by the creators of starforge, if they were into kawaii rip-offs of prince of persia.Ju-just no. If you're buying this game send it as a gift to your enemies. I mean, instead of putting this game under ""Hack and Slash"" put in under ""Total Hack"".			"

Lackluster characters - CHECKTerrible storyline - CHECKMEH combat - CHECKDeplorable AI - CHECKThis game will be in my list of ""What had gotten into my mind when I decided to play these?""The most  REDUNDANT  game I've played. Fight through the designated areas in broad daylight for the first half of the game, then spend the second half going back through the  SAME  areas in the evening! No new architecture;  NOTHING! Atleast they tried to cover that up by adding the ""emblem collection"" system for improving the various combat aspects of Ayumi. and even the beastiary is a bit acceptable. But it doesn't matter; the cons are just insurmountable. Also, our little thong-wearing heroine, who has been desperately designed to be compared to the likes of Lara Croft and others, has miserably failed to garner attention, and is another deplorable character, just like her co-stars - Jay, Light, and Dark.So, people ... STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME! DO NOT PLAY! Well, you can, actually. But then you'll have a severe headache! And I didn't even buy it at it's full price. I got it for a dollar, and look at me regret that move! xDBe intelligent. Don't play this game, and you'll stay happy. "

												I bought this game because it looked like a lovely exploration game. But after playing a couple of level I must say, this game is mostly crap. The Voice Acting is poorly made, the graphics are cartoony in the cutscences but overbright in the actual game (and there is no option to turn it off.) The Main Character is a girl with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ clothes. The Story is boring and the Fighting system gets boring overtime too. I would of loved if the game had more to explore such as Tomb Raider or Uncharted. But this game is literally just for brainless fightning and staring at her ♥♥♥ or boobs. Which it seems the developers mainly focused on, instead of the actual gameplay and voice acting. This Game is just repeating the same boring bit over and over and over again. It doesn't even have any achievements! The Only Positive thing I found it has trading cards. I can't recommend this to anybody besides really sad people which love staring at an animes girls boobs / ♥♥♥ for hours and hours.			"

												In X-Blades, the player takes on the role of the enchanting heroine Ayumi, who survives a breathtaking dance of blades through the Hordes of Darkness. The long-haired beautiful anime, with her pistol blades and mind-blowing leaps, whirls and swirls from one fantastic level to the next. In brief: An anime-style, opulent hack n' slay spectacle for fans of entertaining action games. X-Blades creates a fantastic universe around the attractive heroine, who has to fend off innumerable monsters and imposing boss opponents with her power and tactics. A long list of all sorts of magic spells widens the range of potential forms of attack. Once Ayumi has collected enough experience points, she can activate new skills. The anime-style level design is what really gives X-Blades its special flair. Around 40 magical indoor and outdoor worlds dazzle in an enthralling rhapsody of color. Action and magical effects are impressively incorporated through the use of cinema stylistics such as bullet time or motion blurring.			"

BUT, the gameplay is terrible. Long range attacks might as well not exist because it does non-existant damage (except in level 1). The swordplay doesn't feel great at all and my hits don't seem to be concrete. This is the deal breaker. If a hack and slash game has a unsatisfying hack and slash experience then it failed.I'm surprised gaijin released such a game, given their track record for excellent games in the past.

												Oh my god. Where do I even begin.A brief explanation of the plot/overview of this game, I guess (might be inaccurate since I gave up less than an hour after playing):This is a hack-and-slash game where a greedy lone wolf treasure hunter ignores the advice of an ancient temple guardian, touches a magic object (that she was directly informed by said guardian that the power within the object is completely fatal to humans; by the way, she is, in fact, a human, so she is no exclusion to this reality), and gets the ♥♥♥♥ cursed out of her.Alright, onto the specifics.This game tries to be fast-paced and cool with a sexy heroine main character to keep people interested (i.e. the half-dressed protagonist that has jello for breasts that will dramatically move around even if you are just walking, and whose ♥♥♥ is always hanging out in hopes that you stay focused on that as often as possible; I was able to ignore both things and focus on the absolute terror that was the gameplay since I have no interest in either of those subjects [laughs in aseuxal]), but in reality, this game is just a wildly unpleasant experience all around.The movement controls are disorienting as ♥♥♥♥. Your default movement speed is ""a desperate sprint for your life."" If you jump too close to a ledge, Ayumi will abruptly roll forward instead of doing the logical thing and jumping up. The double jumping is also commonly unresponsive.The melee combat is standard at best. It controls like a hack-and-slash game. Run up to common enemies, and spam a button at everyone until they stop moving. That much is at least correct.The gun combat is honestly funny as ♥♥♥♥. If you are locked onto an enemy, Ayumi will not miss a single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shot, even if they are all the way across the area from you. In the second level, I was practically in tears when I became a sentry gun and skipped enemies across the beach with my guns like a rock getting skipped over water. Ayumi being a sentient aimbot program is fairly useful, I guess.The magic combat is okay. In order to use magic, you need to build up ""rage"" by either attacking enemies until you have enough rage to use a spell, or by holding down the key/button that your spell is bound to until her rage is charged up enough to use the attack. Since this game likes to fling large hordes of enemies in your direction at once, you typically have enough rage to last you the whole fight.The combat interface as a whole is rather confusing. Nine times out of ten, I did not even know that I was getting hurt. Usually, in games with a health/damage feature, you know when you are getting attacked since your character will typically make a noise or flinch or something when harmed, or maybe the screen will flash red for a second or whatever. Ayumi does nothing if it is not a big enough attack to stagger her. I kept looking up at her health and getting surprised at how much I had lost without noticing anything.Ayumi as a character made me want to stop playing before the opening cinematic for the first level even ended. She sounds like the ""mean girl in high school,"" and she talks as if she is above everyone else. For example, in her very first sentence, she outright states that she is ""the best treasure hunter ever."" That opinion is open to a staggering amount of debate, have some ♥♥♥♥ing humility. Later on, when the aforementioned temple guardian warns her that the object that she is trying to steal will straight-up kill her and tells her to leave while she still can (without trying to harm her, by the way; he was literally going to just let her turn around and walk out of the temple unharmed and without a fight), her reaction was to flip her hair, roll her eyes, adamantly state ""yeah right,"" try to steal the object anyway while the guardian was not looking at her, and then get cursed like a dumbass since she thought that grabbing an object that is ""fatal to humans"" was a bright idea. For the ""best treasure hunter in the world,"" she sure does make some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thoughtless decisions. I am almost completely certain that all of her previous heists up to that point were from children that were holding a coin that they found on the ground.On a related note to Ayumi, the physics in this game are abysmal. I am not talking about her earthquake jello breasts again, either. I am talking about her three ponytails. I have never seen hair move that erratically in my whole life. In every cutscene or moment of gameplay where she was moving around too fast, her ponytails went ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They looked like the tentacles of the Kraken emerging from the waters and searching for a ship full of sailors to pull into the depths of the sea. This was a game for the Xbox 360 and PS3, too. Those consoles had pretty good graphic capabilities for their time. I am not forgiving this one. If her hair was that unstable, they should have changed it to something more usable.This game, at the time of writing this review, is on sale for $10. That is the normal retail price. But, from what I have experienced, this game certainly is not even remotely worth that much money. If you seriously want to buy the game that badly, please wait for the price to drop hard first.((I got this game for free from Bundle Stars as a Christmas ""gift."" I am almost completely certain that they no longer want me to be a customer of theirs.))			"

												I initially gave this game a recommeded rating but after playing it again and beating it...well. the ending was just a giant f*ck you. when you finnish the final boss the game just ends and returns to the menu. i was like ""wtf? no cutscene? no closure?"" then i go to the part of the menu which is called the ""diary"" which holds all the cutscenes in the game, there i find the ""ending"". the ending i got was the ""bad"" ending...it was very short. the bad ending implied that the player should beat the final boss again to get the good ending. I really enjoyed the upgrading, the difficult bosses and the hack and slash...but if the devs cant even properly edit the story in the game, what's the point?			"

												In X-Blades you play as the fierce Treasure Hunter Ayumi as she unveils the secrets of a hidden artifact. X-blades provides quick combat, a range of spells and multiple levels. You can choose between magic, swords and guns to attack the numerous enemies you find throughout the temple. You may need to wait a bit before buying the more powerful spells but the game allows you obtain most of them without wasting time grinding.Now for the cons. X-Blades starts off bland and doesn't get any better. The boss battles are more tedious than challenging and you end up using the same one spell to go through most of the game. Hitting enemies doesn't really provide any feedback and you end up dying due to the terribel camera angle and/or a silly mistake. It doesn't take long for you to get bored at looking at the same brown temple walls every SINGLE STAGE! Honestly, throw some different environments in there.Now this may be subjective but if you're going to make a scantily clad heroine then at least give her some assests to work with. Honestly, it would have been better if they gave her some armor to cover up. Oh well, at least give them 2 points for trying.All in all, I would avoid this game at full price. Sure I had fun with the game but it gave me  more frustration than enjoyment. If you're really curious I would recommend picking this game up when it is at least 70% off.			"

												I got this game with at a price of 80% off and I wouldn't have paid more for this.The game itself is not really bad but the real problem is the gameplay...For example, when you're fighting the first boss, you're surrounded by small enemies and you can't really manage to do whatever to hit the boss.As a consequence, fights are very long because it's a total mess.The second problem are the light effects. Sometimes, your screen becomes totally white because of attacks and other light effects and it's blinding you.And finally, as I'm french, I tried the french version but the voices are horrible. Don't play this with french voices !After all that, if you're in to try it then get it on sale.And one last thing, if you're wondering why you have the Demo Version that stops right after the first boss, it's because you need to activate your game on the windows before the game starts. Then you'll be able to go further in game.			"

												This game is grindy and boring. The challenge comes from an unrewarding, boring combat system and large hordes of enemies. What would make this game better is a combo system that extends beyond button mashing, an engaging/interesting story, more interesting stage design, and if the time spent making the character's boobs jiggle was spent doing just about anyting else.Seriously, this game isn't even so bad it's good. It's bad at being bad and that's the worst part. It's boring, don't spend your money on it.			"

												I know no one reads these or cares what they say, but while I wait for Blades of Time to download I want to leave a short review;This game tries to oversell itself as a stylish 3rd person action game in thhe vein of DmC, Bayonetta, or any of Platnium's work. This is false.While there is some ""style"" to it, it doesn't have that tight heart beat that makes the combat flow like in those game. This game more is along the line sof Gauntlet or Dynasty Warriors - sans the strategy,It's a ""mash X to win"" game (X for 360 pad users) with a few special moves you ccan activate via a single button press rather than a combo. You can map the skills to left bumper, right bumper, Y, and B. Though, they stupidly made dodge-roll double-tap-forward+jump which is awkward to execute, so I can guarentee once you have the ability to unlock the ""teleport"" skill, that will ALWAYS be mapped to one of your 4 slots.The game is short, and the opening is rough - with the beginning mostly being ""mash, mash, mash, earthquake....mash mash mash, earthquake."" but after the first hour you begin unlocking more skills and eventually, this short game turns into a fun little romp.Don't take the story seriously, it makes no sense. Play the game solely for it's mechanics, which aren't very deep, but I beat it and had a decent little time with it. I don't regret my purchase and it sold me on playing the (supposedly) superior spiritual successor. Give it a whirl - just don't expect something great. It's good and I think worth the $10 asking price even though the game has glaring flaws and seems like it was made on a very low budget.			"

												This game does a ♥♥♥♥ poor job of combining DMC and Prince of Persia while trying to hide it all together. The game doesn't flow well and the lack of enemy variety is appauling. The game is ridiculously easy even cranked up to max difficulty. This game isn't even fully finished and feels like it's been slapped together just for a nice big money grab. The voice actors do quite well for this project but the animators and coders fail to make up something that feels right. I've had enemies drop through the floor becoming invincible and impossible to kill, random deaths that just happen, and even positioning glitches that just up and throw me into the skybox allowing me to get to the exit with ease. For the voice actors sake I give this game a 3.5/10 and still don't even recommend this pile of garbage.			"

												I picked this game up on a recent sale, I only paid $1.99 for it, but I feel like I overpaid.With a lackluster voice over, and less emotion in the voice and facial features than Kristen Stewart in Twilight, the only thing left to look forward to is the gameplay.The gameplay leaves much to be desired. Mouse controls are choppy and very rough, the movement is buggy, the motion blur is way over exagerated, and the combat system seems throw together. Enemies are either small fry that die in a two-three hits from your 'gun swords', or they're heavy hitters that can only be killed with the games very rough and crude magic/skill system.I do not recommend this game, unless you can pick it up for free.

												If only it could catch my eye for more than a few minutes.The visuals,sound and prince of persia 2 style level design keep me playing for a bit and before I knew it I was playing for about an hour.At that point i was completly unaware of the story,my goals, and any possible motivation for my actions.3 or 4 bossfights later I then figure out that its that of metroid or casltevania on PS1 (the name escapes me).A map your supposed to explore though linear roads and whatnot.Simple enough right?Well yeah but this game does wrong in every single way possible.Yeah it a map....thats about all it is.There are no borders on the map to indicate what part of the map your on...add that to the icon displaying where the player is does not move at all until you go to another area,wait for the scoreboard for the area your leaving, and a loading screen.That does'nt help when later the paths start spliting.You won't know which path your taking until you go though all the crap I just said including a boss fight.The combat is boring,abilities are predictible as ever,the AI is just as dumb as i felt playing this all they do is rush you.kill them they respawn instantly,the constant bosses suck ♥♥♥, and Ayumi would be pretty cool a character if her controls would mess up from time to time.In short don't play this...at least it was only a buck 50.

												This is a weird game. It's sometimes very fun, and sometimes ridiculously boring and horrible.To start off, the story is poor and almost non existent, with even worse voice acting to accompany the few cut scenes.The levels are okay sometimes, but other times they take forever, especially when you have to sit there and figure out what you need to kill to pass the level. This takes even longer when certain enemies take certain spells to kill, but the enemies are never consistent. Sometimes you need to use fire, and later you many need to use lightning. All the while you are trying to figure this out, you are getting mobbed by never ending enemies.Tat being said though, the game is at a comfortable difficulty, so its not really all that frustrating.Though the most frustrating thing is the toughest enemies you will find in this game...pots. Dear god those pots. The hit detection is so horrendous, you will spend a good 30 seconds trying to break a pot. They seem to just break whenever they feel like it...it's so annoying.Oh and rolling is horrendous too...yeah, rolling. Rolling is so hard and random to acheive that there are two levels dedicated to just managing to pull off rolling three times to beat the level. It's a disaster.Jumping is a mess as well, though still easily doable.Some good things about the game is the combat is ok, with plenty of upgrades and spells to keep things interesting. Other than spells, you can use swords and guns to attack foes, making for nice, varied gameplay. There are hidden artifacts in the levels to find too, which give you special upgrades.The best part about the game though is your character, Ayumi. You get to enjoy the nice view of a woman clad only in underwear and a few shreds of armor, but even this does not distract from all the downsides of the game.Overall its not the worst game I've ever played, not even close really, but it sure isn't good. I wouldn't recommend spending more than $2.00 on this			"

												I imagine the design team spent more time designing their ideal girlfriend than they spent designing a game. in my experience the game has about 15 minutes of play time and no replayability. the game felt more like a demo than a full game but isn't marketed that way. the reason for this is that it is a full game but is so buggy it is impassable at some points. for me i killed the very first wolf boss and the game reverted back to the start. also, why would you call this game an RPG when the story is non existant and the protagonist is a knock-off, colourless, anime, american laura croft.""has the ingredients of an instant success"" - all are uncooked.“X-Blades is an absolutely solid hack 'n slay game that can compete with major titles of the genre.”  - in how jiggly the physics are.

												A fairly low budget, quick paced, hack and slash game with repetitive gameplay. When I say quick paced and repetitive, I mean that the action itself feels fast and you may need to concentrate to keep up with everything. It is repetitive because there is not alot of enemy or level variaty, and the few levels only feel long because they keep throwing hordes of enemies at you.The story, what little there is, started out interresting enough to get me going, but leaves pretty much everything unanswered. Maybe there's a book or something I don't know about, the game sure doesn't explain anything, just leaves you with the feeling of 'I would love to know more about everything'.That said, did I enjoy the game? Yep.The combat feels satisfying when you figure it out, even if it's not particularly deep. It's at the level where you might call it brainless action, but every once in a while you need to wake up another brain cell to figure out the right solution, which I at least enjoy once in a while.I think I bought it discounted to 5€ or maybe less. At that price, I can recommend it, if you're into these kind of games.			"

												X-Blades in my opinion is a great game, the skill system is amazing for a game made in 2009, The cutscenes are amazing!!! the graphics are great, loved the voice acting also I enjoyed the story :D I give some extra points cause well I LOVE RPGs... a lot. Finally, I highly recommend picking up this game whether it be on sale or not ;)			"

												X-Blades is a fun hack and slash game with a few flaws.The pros:  It's fairly long.  The world looks good with a kind of cartoony style.  It has multiple story paths.  Quite a bit of different skills you can choose from.  You're looking at ♥♥♥ all day ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)The const:  Higher difficulty is just more spam, you're often stun locked by the constant damage animation because about 15 enemies are attacking you non-stop.  The game has extra DRM. Which I couldn't properly  activate with my CD key and I ended up downloading a cracked exe instead. It normally tells you to contact support on some dead forum and I didn't feel like waiting 2 weeks for an answer.  At some point in the game the audio just craps out, however this could be because of the crack I installed.  Some things like healing end up becoming ridiculously overpriced in the end-game, where you need them.Despite the flaws, I had a lot of fun with this game.Pick it up if you like hack and slash games and definitely pick it up in sale.

												I couldn't finish it.  It's just too repetative.  One monster-filled arena after another.  After a few they all look the same.My biggest gripe is the boss monsters.  Your normal weapons don't hurt them, so you need to kill OTHER monsters to build up ""rage"" so you can use spells, which shave about a hair off of their HP.  This make the fights long and tedious and not interesting at all.			"

												game is good in very few ways, but for under 5$ it is worth a play threw.pro:gameplay- great idea, but poorly made in this casecons:voice acting - horrible, could not be worsecontrols - clunky, died about 20 times, mostly control issue(try rolling)level design - bc of controls, the design is poorly made. hard to climb up spots with clunky jumpgraphics - lighting is bad, turns out redish. cinematics, blocky.yes, many cons. but in the end after the multiple stupid deaths. i still recomend it if you get it under 5 dollars. more like 2. but still.

												Not bad, say 6.5/10. A pure hack and slash game. Combats can get a bit confusing at times (when there are lots of weak enemies around you). It gets better  when you get lots of ""souls"" (which gets you stronger powers). The half-naked sexy female heroin is easy on the eye and is part of the charm of the game. I'm not big on pure hack and slash games, so it got too repetitive for me after a while. The game is not very hard, neither it's too easy, so I guess it can keep a fan of these kind of games hooked for a longer time.			"

												For $1.00 this game is a STEAL! I have played it for about an hour now and I can honestly say I'm not dissapointed at all with this purchase. It does play a little like the Devil May Cry games if you are familiar with that franchise. Nice Anime art style and great graphics! Of course it does get a little repetitive at times, but it's worth a try!! :D			"

												Combat looked semi-interesting in the trailers... it is not. Clunky controls, one attack button instead of the light and heavy typical of this genre, so no variations in your attacks. Very large waves of enemies that take far too many hits to kill and aren't even remotely threatening. Just incredibly boring gameplay. Voice acting is... decent. It's about bad B-movie grade, it is tolerable, but nothing to write home about. Music is ok, nothing you're going to want to hear more of, but definately not ear grating. The game is very pretty, which is the best thing I can say about it, it looks very nice. And if you want gratuitous eye candy there is plenty of that, but that's not what I was looking for.Overall the game is just boring. If you want a good game in this genre that has a lot of eye candy try Bayonetta instead. Or any good game in this genre try Bayonetta 1/2 or DMC 1/3/4.I got it on sale for $1 and I think I still overpaid for it.			"

												0.99€ Spectacle fighter - worth it?Hell yes, love the character artstyle, only sad part is i wish the entire game would have had it, the graphics are ok but it feels like the competent art team was only involved in the character the reset was bought from some cookie cutter texture creators.The responsiveness in the fighting is great as is the flow of combat when u use special attacks.The game do get a tad repetetive but for a 0.99 you get 2-3 hours of hack n slash looking at a cute female protagonist.Yea the thong makes no sence, especially since in later stages you get armor upgrades where while she still looks cute she doesnt look akward :)While this game got a lot of flack for its repetetiveness I would say its not the combat itself that i find booring, its rather the rehasing of the same enemies and how they are lacking in artistic creativity, they simply dont look cool, which is weird since i love the artstyle for the protagonist.

You are wandering on an island, killing monsters, collecting their souls and buying new spells or upgrading them with those souls. Don't forget to collect shards to learn new moves. And then start killing even more monsters and defeating a lots of bosses.			"

												It plays like Brutal Legend mixed with Devil May Cry 4. And I can safely say that I have never wanted to punch a protagonist in the face so badly, and this is after playing DMC, Shadow Warrior, and Duke Nukem. There is only a light attack, with it seems the rest of the buttons being rerserved for magic attacks that require ""rage"", a resource that constantly drains, even in combat. There is also guns, just like devil may cry. A style meter, just like devil may cry. Even the fact that gunshots keep you in the air, just like devil may cry. I think(?) there is a doge roll allocated to the right stick. Needs confirmation. The combat itself is so basic, dominant strategy takes over any creativity.It also seems like parts of this game are meant to show off this characters ♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥. The very first level has you lock on to an enemy that's in the air.Unfortunately, you can't even see the enemy, just a butt. Feminism aside, it's not even a good ♥♥♥. Like, remember that Lady Gaga type lady in DMC 4. Remember how hot she was? Too bad the girl here isn't. PLUS I WANT TO PUNCH HER IN HER FACE. She is one of the most annoying characters I have ever seen, and it seems like the only reason she's designed the way she was was to make teenage boys all hot and bothered. I want to say that for 99 cents, you should consider getting it....but no. Most of the  positive reviews seem to be people who only played an hour or two into. If thats what it takes to finish the game, then it's garbage considering it's not an indie release (I've seen this for sale at walmart). They also might be liars. Fans of Devil May Cry, not really. I should finish this game, for the sake of clarity. I should finish to see if there is a slight glimmer of hope. But I don't really see this going anywhere.			"

												This game is not the best, but it is worth the 10 dollars or your regional equivilant. This game has all the things it needs to be considered a good hack and slash game: good keyboard controls,good progression, fun enemies, and some fun varying combat. Anyone that says this game is button mashy has not used spells spells are effective and fun to use, and like any good hack and slash rpg, will require careful planning on where to use them on the hard difficulty. The protagonist is a funny, overconfident, and arrogent female lead, this maybe a turn of to some but I enjoyed the humor. It is kinda annoying to see an obviously adult character act like a child, but never since Lollipop Chainsaw Massacare have we had a character like this that is so well written, so I don't really car. This game does have it's flaws though to change resolution options you have to reset the game BEFORE you can. This would be more acceptable if the game put it in the options menu and then auto saved and reset, but it doesn't. It makes you quit then start again which dosen't even matter because changing it crashes your game at random intervals. Thats right cant change resolution. Luckily the game runs well so you should have no trouble running it  on 1080. I was recording without an ssd on low graphics on 1080 on what is practiclly half potatoe, and still kept 30. If you hoped on recording this sad news, game will crash randomly at times with most software available. As well the game shows most tool tips with bot controller and keyboard mouse bindings, which dosen't cause issues, but is still really irratating. My Final verdict is that this game is indeed worth ten big ones, but may not be the best for a YouTuber or Twitch Streamer to get, however the games has a great character, fun combat, interesting skills, and a kick ♥♥♥ sound track. If you are a fan of Hack & Slash RPGs, and are at least OK with the anime style, this game is worth the buy.			"

												TL;DR For a dollar with trading cards, it's an almost decent hack 'n' slash. What I feel are poor mechanics sour the experience. The devs absolutely learned from the mistakes in X-Blades and made Blades of Time a great game. Get BoT instead. EDIT: Art direction is lovely but to say succinctly what I did in a rambling way: Blades of Time is fun. X-Blades really isn't.I care not for anime sexuality.I bought this game.*GASP* How can that be?!X-Blades is the predecessor to Blades of Time; Blades of Time is a remake/reimagining of X-Blades. I got BoT in a bundle. I very much enjoyed it. I bought X-Blades in the hopes of encouraging the dev's to include Cards for BoT / Achievements for X-Blades.I did not fully grasp the significance of ""reimagining."" X-Blades is horrible when compared to Blades of Time. My saying so is unfair, of course, but also truth.With X-Blades, I was hoping to relive the glory days of PS2 platformers (Sly Cooper, Jak & Daxter, Ratchet & Clank, Beyond Good & Evil, KyA, Vex, etc. etc.). LOL upon further research, X-Blades was released for the subsequent generation... so my hopes were dashed from the start.Several reviews compare X-Blades to Devil May Cry; I'm pretty sure I compared BoT to DMC. X-Blades is similar to DMC only superficially: the targeting and combo system, the sword/gun-play, the double-jump, the fact that you fall slower while shooting, and of course the monsters (are vaguely similar). Other than that, X-Blades is a hodgepodge of (bad) mechanics.You're a nimble nearly nude female treasure hunting... n-nin... er s-samur... er anime. Yeah. You can swing your blades and shoot the shooty-things with the quickness; you can run (in the classic ""back-bent-at-a-45-degree-angle-for-speed-and-style"" pose) LIKE a ninja. When it comes to being swarmed by enemies... Ayumi moves like Zero from BoT: heavy and slow, tank-like. I'm playing with a controller and I don't even know how to dodge; I got the Teleport power, but you can only use it when your feet are planted firmly on the ground. There is no manual lock-on to enemies; moving the camera over enemies does it automatically. This makes targeting the bosses amidst the throngs of grunts a chore. The Store Page doesn't mention controller support; you can play with a controller but there are no options like Right Stick or Vibration Sensitivity (I THINK you can remap buttons but IDK). Speaking of mobs, you best get that Teleport power early on and refrain from jumping like you'd figure the agile MILF with a baby's face (yeah...) should be able to. Else, you'll float atop the mobs or, somehow, one of the grunts will end up on top of you, out of reach of your blades.Combos... I don't even know. I don't even know how the points work, actually. Your melee attacks are the only thing that multiply your combo; if you use guns or powers, you get nothing. In BoT, you could run all over the map with the (pretty much useless) points (""souls,"" I think) following you tirelessly - you were never going to lose any of them. In X-Blades it seems if you get too far from the points, they just disappear. If you're working on a mob, of course, the multiplier is multiplied. I think if you get hit once, you lose every bit of those banked points, rather than it just resetting to zero and getting the points you had earned. I like this idea, it is, how you say, ""hardcore."" When you can't maneuver well enough on your own to preserve that combo, when there isn't a block/parry; other reviews that say ""The game is nothing more than spamming LMB"" are correct. I hate to admit that, since that could be argued for SEVERAL games, but with X-Blades, it's absolutely true.There is a bit of a prologue and you end up being sent to some other... dimension. The beach you spawn on is apparently a hub(?). I cleared the waves upon waves of enemies, went through the door that opened, cleared the boss and those waves, didn't find another door, went back through the first, back on the beach, cleared those waves, didn't find another door, went back through the first door, and had enough. I'm certain some sorts of new mechanics / gimmicks will be employed throughout the game but I'm not sure I have the fortitude to deal with the just plain poor combat (which is, no doubt, the entirety of the game); monotony. Get Blades of Time; it is fantastic (though Ayumi is ("")a bit more("") conservative).			"

												I only played the demo. How is that possible even though I have this in my game library? The game requires you to ACTIVATE it by writing the cdkey (you can't even copy paste it, you have to waste time writing it) and activating it online. Too bad the online activation doesn't work. The gameplay in the demo is boring, the amount of slowmo it has is obnoxious, the skills aren't nice to look at, the enemies are dumber than a lobotomized 6 year old (they just chase you or run away), the gameplay is repetitive (you entered a new room? be prepared to kill 20 badly designed generic ♥♥♥ enemies, the fun never ends) and THE ONLY  good part is that the demo is only about 30mins long.The fanservice isn't even that great.

												The bottom line for this game, It's worth the 99 Cents.The good:-Very nice Graphics-A nice mix of Devil May Cry, Tomb Raider and Dynasty Warriors styles of gameplay-The main character is appealing to look at if you like skimpy characters-Hilarious moments in the story-Trading Cards!The bad:-The cutscenes look horrible and are extremely compressed. They look worse than the actual game-Story makes no sense and is riddled with dumb or useless characters-Keyboard and Mouse controls are delayed and a bit bad. Controller EXTREMELY recommended-If you don't like skimpy, barely dressed characters, this isn't for you-Doesn't work properly unless you fiddle with NVIDIA Control Panel a bitA budget game for a budget price.

												Pros : Interesting gameplay mechanic, I love slicing up my enemies with combos and magic. I also like the fact that you can select the spells you want to unlock, by spending these points you get from defeating enemies.Cons: Not a good story, and the face model is just ♥♥♥♥. Also the motion blur is irritating as ♥♥♥♥. It's like some over-exerting feminist with see-through eyebrows and wimpers decided to go treasure hunting.I still like the game, because, you slice up monsters with combos and spells!

												I got this game for a dollar with a coupon.  It's hard to say no to a game for a dollar but normally it sells for a few dollars on steam. The Good:  -  This game is not a bad ~concept~.   Cel shaded female anime character wielding two gun swords, who can shoot, slash, and cast spells you unlock with souls.  Character moves quickly like sonic the hedgehog, so think a quick moving sonic the hedgehog hack and slash that collects souls instead of rings... except the souls look like rings?  Not a terrible concept.  With pumped up metal music.The Bad:     -  The graphics are not there.  This can be understandable in low budget first game. They are not downright terrible by any stretch of the imagination but with the high speed it makes me almost nauseus.  Feels like spawn rate is just too high / quick on monsters.-  The cut scenes keep going choppy on my computer.The Ugly:    - The way you assign the spells and buy the spells to the menu, the system is just kind of clunky and not easy on the eyes.   I think some improvements here with color scheme, easy UI, would really really help this game.-  Why the music does this horrible garbled thing on my end I still fail to understand.  The music is generally fuzzy but it ups the level to a car radio in a tunnel during battles.-   Tiny menu button in the corner when you press tab for spell buying is the only way to close the game.  Ctrl-Alt-Delete caused it to just become angry and make it's static loopy metal track go insane on my computer. Do yourself a favor and don't try to kill this program it's one of those that can't be killed and just gets more angry.As it stands now I wouldn't recommend it, but unlike some games on steam I wouldn't outright say it's a bad concept either.  The concept of a high paced anime hack and slash is really a great idea.			"

												This game does a ♥♥♥♥ poor job of combining DMC and Prince of Persia while trying to hide it all together. The game doesn't flow well and the lack of enemy variety is appauling. The game is ridiculously easy even cranked up to max difficulty. This game isn't even fully finished and feels like it's been slapped together just for a nice big money grab. The voice actors do quite well for this project but the animators and coders fail to make up something that feels right. I've had enemies drop through the floor becoming invincible and impossible to kill, random deaths that just happen, and even positioning glitches that just up and throw me into the skybox allowing me to get to the exit with ease. For the voice actors sake I give this game a 3.5/10 and still don't even recommend this pile of garbage.			"

												This game is fantastic it supports multi monitor well, running it at 4080x768 and i have 0 hiccups with this game as far as how it performs, i sometimes have games that dont play nice with SLI configured GPUs but this game seems to not care at all. Some things that are a little funky is the dodge system and occasionaly i can get hung up on some of the land scape. The directions for the controlls are a little off and it took me a long time to figure out how to pass a few spots due to not knowing the controlls and how to combo up. If you like ultra fast 300 FPS speed hack and slash game then try this game out. If you like boob physics try this game out. If you like a good game with little story and just a good slash em up buy this game on steam sale.			"

												Think about God of War and everything that made it great aside from mashing a button to open up a chest. Now take everything and make it slightly annoying; the result is more or less X-Blades. It's a semi-fun mindless buttonmasher with minor annoyances thrown in; certain enemies are so short it's hard to hit them with your blades, bullets and spells don't always go where you want them to, the plot is just shy of nonexistant, pots are somehow immune to your swords unless you get them at just the perfect angle, certain rooms have enemies that can only be defeated in a certain way but it's up to you to guess how, certain mechanics are explained long after it would've been nice to know about them, and there's no dedicated dodge button/stick. Your rage(mana) decays unless you're in combat or getting punched in the face, so you can run into situations where you have to choice but to let some monstrosity gnaw on you for a bit while you wait to get angry enough to use the only ability that will harm it.While not good, it's not exactly bad. It's just a shame to see that it had potential yet missed the mark and dove off the cliff instead. Not really worth it at full price; I would not recommend purchasing it unless it's on sale. Also, much bloom. Wear shades.			"

												Not bad, say 6.5/10. A pure hack and slash game. Combats can get a bit confusing at times (when there are lots of weak enemies around you). It gets better  when you get lots of ""souls"" (which gets you stronger powers). The half-naked sexy female heroin is easy on the eye and is part of the charm of the game. I'm not big on pure hack and slash games, so it got too repetitive for me after a while. The game is not very hard, neither it's too easy, so I guess it can keep a fan of these kind of games hooked for a longer time.			"

												In hindsight, it was a good thing I got this game for 90% off in a steam sale. As the things bad about this game are a bit numerous to mention, I'll sum them all up in a couple of main points. CONS:- This game is pretty short. Expect to beat the game in roughly 5-6 hours in one sitting. - The controls are clumsy, especially if you're using a keyboard. Some of the moves don't work very well, particularly the forward roll.- The story sucks and there is no character development. Literally, the only thing we know about the heroine is that she's some kind of treasure hunter. We know almost nothing about the other guy. The game villain just randomly shows up and, true to overused cliche, wants to engulf the world into darkness for some arbitrary reason.  - For a game made in 2009, the graphics looks and feels kinda sloppy, more like it was made in early 2000's. PROS:- It's a fast-paced hack and slash if that still tickles your fancy. - Uhhh..... boob physics.			"

												If you set out to play this game then I strongly suggest you play some Nightcore music, as this game, along with it's music, can take itself way to serious. But with the right music, and oh my word a controller, it can be a somewhat enjoyable game. There are several parts in the game where you can just sit in a corner and shoot the enemy until the wave ends which make the game rather trivial at times, especially when the waves can go on for over 10 minutes. Another aspect of the game I disliked was the fact that the level designer got so bored with the game that instead of creating new levels you simply start at the beginning and playthrough the game twice, simply with the monsters being stronger the second time round.Also, the last boss is, in my opinion, the easiest part of the game.... what's with that? Simply holding down the Light Burst attack you can defeat him in nearly under a minute.TLDR: Turn on some Nightcore, Grab a controller, and make sure your mum doesn't look at your monitor, because it's time to play as a 95% naked girl who fights demon spawn in a huge castle with her giant sword/guns, twice.

												X-Blades is a fun hack and slash game with a few flaws.The pros:  It's fairly long.  The world looks good with a kind of cartoony style.  It has multiple story paths.  Quite a bit of different skills you can choose from.  You're looking at ♥♥♥ all day ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)The const:  Higher difficulty is just more spam, you're often stun locked by the constant damage animation because about 15 enemies are attacking you non-stop.  The game has extra DRM. Which I couldn't properly  activate with my CD key and I ended up downloading a cracked exe instead. It normally tells you to contact support on some dead forum and I didn't feel like waiting 2 weeks for an answer.  At some point in the game the audio just craps out, however this could be because of the crack I installed.  Some things like healing end up becoming ridiculously overpriced in the end-game, where you need them.Despite the flaws, I had a lot of fun with this game.Pick it up if you like hack and slash games and definitely pick it up in sale.

												I couldn't finish it.  It's just too repetative.  One monster-filled arena after another.  After a few they all look the same.My biggest gripe is the boss monsters.  Your normal weapons don't hurt them, so you need to kill OTHER monsters to build up ""rage"" so you can use spells, which shave about a hair off of their HP.  This make the fights long and tedious and not interesting at all.			"

												Pros : Interesting gameplay mechanic, I love slicing up my enemies with combos and magic. I also like the fact that you can select the spells you want to unlock, by spending these points you get from defeating enemies.Cons: Not a good story, and the face model is just ♥♥♥♥. Also the motion blur is irritating as ♥♥♥♥. It's like some over-exerting feminist with see-through eyebrows and wimpers decided to go treasure hunting.I still like the game, because, you slice up monsters with combos and spells! What's not to like?			"

												For $1.00 this game is a STEAL! I have played it for about an hour now and I can honestly say I'm not dissapointed at all with this purchase. It does play a little like the Devil May Cry games if you are familiar with that franchise. Nice Anime art style and great graphics! Of course it does get a little repetitive at times, but it's worth a try!! :D			"

												Combat looked semi-interesting in the trailers... it is not. Clunky controls, one attack button instead of the light and heavy typical of this genre, so no variations in your attacks. Very large waves of enemies that take far too many hits to kill and aren't even remotely threatening. Just incredibly boring gameplay. Voice acting is... decent. It's about bad B-movie grade, it is tolerable, but nothing to write home about. Music is ok, nothing you're going to want to hear more of, but definately not ear grating. The game is very pretty, which is the best thing I can say about it, it looks very nice. And if you want gratuitous eye candy there is plenty of that, but that's not what I was looking for.Overall the game is just boring. If you want a good game in this genre that has a lot of eye candy try Bayonetta instead. Or any good game in this genre try Bayonetta 1/2 or DMC 1/3/4.I got it on sale for $1 and I think I still overpaid for it.			"

												0.99€ Spectacle fighter - worth it?Hell yes, love the character artstyle, only sad part is i wish the entire game would have had it, the graphics are ok but it feels like the competent art team was only involved in the character the reset was bought from some cookie cutter texture creators.The responsiveness in the fighting is great as is the flow of combat when u use special attacks.The game do get a tad repetetive but for a 0.99 you get 2-3 hours of hack n slash looking at a cute female protagonist.Yea the thong makes no sence, especially since in later stages you get armor upgrades where while she still looks cute she doesnt look akward :)While this game got a lot of flack for its repetetiveness I would say its not the combat itself that i find booring, its rather the rehasing of the same enemies and how they are lacking in artistic creativity, they simply dont look cool, which is weird since i love the artstyle for the protagonist.

												I only played the demo. How is that possible even though I have this in my game library? The game requires you to ACTIVATE it by writing the cdkey (you can't even copy paste it, you have to waste time writing it) and activating it online. Too bad the online activation doesn't work. The gameplay in the demo is boring, the amount of slowmo it has is obnoxious, the skills aren't nice to look at, the enemies are dumber than a lobotomized 6 year old (they just chase you or run away), the gameplay is repetitive (you entered a new room? be prepared to kill 20 badly designed generic ♥♥♥ enemies, the fun never ends) and THE ONLY  good part is that the demo is only about 30mins long.The fanservice isn't even that great.

												The game is good it has some ups and alot of downs.The cutscenes were the best out of the entire game but sadly its too shot.For a game it self it feels like it might have been rushed sinse i keep running in to bugs.But the most horrable part of this game is that the level it selfs.where almost everyroom is the same kill all of this and find that weakness that (it reuses alot of it). ill give it a 7 out of 10 for well you know that art ;3 for the replay value its okey but once you finished with the game you dont even want to play again for that next few year.I only wish that their was a book or artwork on sale but sadly there isnt.

												Not the most serious or grandest of games, but in the end I did find it enjoyable and worth it, and no, I'm not influenced by Ayumi's assets, not in the slightest, not at all....ok yes maybe!Most levels are nice and short so you don't have to spend hours and hours over a level; think more like 10 minutes a level, and maybe 15-20 for the harder ones. For some people, this may be a con, but not everyone has all the free time to spend as others do.Another bit of a con is that her voice is rather annoying when she speaks; it doesn't quite match the character at all.In the end though, I enjoyed the game. It's a nice slasher game and the music and visuals aren't half bad either. I would recommend though that you buy it on sale.Some useful tips though for new players:- There is a good and a bad ending which is influenced by your ""decisions"". What is not hinted at all is that there ""decisions"" are not conversation based choices but rather based on the Spells/Abilities that you choose to learn (broad hint, ""bad"" spells have a colour/description that is rather obvious in hindsight). So be warned, if you want the good ending, hold off a bit until you have the choice of the ""good"" magics. You'll know by the name. Try not to end up like me who reached almost halfway before realising this and had to start all over because I wanted the good ending.- Check your Beastiary often; it can be a huge help when countering some of the harder enemies.- You have to spend souls on upgrades and whilst you may feel to be cheap in your spending, don't worry, you'll have plenty extra by then end of the game, and those upgrades to Regeneration and Form Duration are well worth the cost.- And speaking of souls, you can also find them in breakable items, like statues and pots. And the items can also hide valuable upgrade parts/artifacts. So take the time to slash/shoot everything you can.- There is also an area where you get an outfit upgrade, but, if you like how she looks, you can choose to not take it....because it covers more, lol- The nice thing with dying is that you'll restart the level with all the enemies respawned but with all the souls and upgrades that you died with.- There was one item of note, a scroll that halved the cost of any item/upgrade. The bad part, well you don't have a choice of whether to use it or not, it is automatically used on your very next purchase. Lets say you've been saving it for that (otherwise very costly) upgrade/spell, and you're in a fight and need to heal, well guess what, if you buy a heal, then say goodbye scroll. So better to use it before a fight so you can make your best choice.- There are a few areas that involve jumping around. What can help is after you jump (or double jump) is to start shooting (or slashing). It slows down your descent and can help to extend the distance you cover while ""falling"". Really useful in some areas to get to hard to reach items or ledges. I recommend shooting over slashing however, as there is the chance that you do a special slash move that makes you move downwards....and maybe plummet to your death.- In her special forms, her movement and attack speed increases, so make good use of it in those harder levels. I also noticed that her Rage (i.e. mana) may have taken longer to deplete when using abilities. "

												Not bad, say 6.5/10. A pure hack and slash game. Combats can get a bit confusing at times (when there are lots of weak enemies around you). It gets better  when you get lots of ""souls"" (which gets you stronger powers). The half-naked sexy female heroin is easy on the eye and is part of the charm of the game. I'm not big on pure hack and slash games, so it got too repetitive for me after a while. The game is not very hard, neither it's too easy, so I guess it can keep a fan of these kind of games hooked for a longer time.			"

												A fairly low budget, quick paced, hack and slash game with repetitive gameplay. When I say quick paced and repetitive, I mean that the action itself feels fast and you may need to concentrate to keep up with everything. It is repetitive because there is not alot of enemy or level variaty, and the few levels only feel long because they keep throwing hordes of enemies at you.The story, what little there is, started out interresting enough to get me going, but leaves pretty much everything unanswered. Maybe there's a book or something I don't know about, the game sure doesn't explain anything, just leaves you with the feeling of 'I would love to know more about everything'.That said, did I enjoy the game? Yep.The combat feels satisfying when you figure it out, even if it's not particularly deep. It's at the level where you might call it brainless action, but every once in a while you need to wake up another brain cell to figure out the right solution, which I at least enjoy once in a while.I think I bought it discounted to 5€ or maybe less. At that price, I can recommend it, if you're into these kind of games.			"

It should, cause there's nothing, absolutely nothing in this game other than hacking and slashing the same generic enemies for way to long. At one point it popped up a ""New Bestiary Entry"", and I laughed out loud, cause 1) Where are those new enemies? They look exactly the same to me, and 2) A Bestiary? For real? This game doesn't have a plot and you gave it a Bestiary? Priorities.Also, a female protagonist with a thong? Come on man... We're better than this.The game begins with a quick 2 minutes tutorial about what weapons you have, and an elemental effect kind of damage system, which doesn't seem to matter. Jumping seems not to matter, and you can't really jump and hit aerial creatures, which seems like something you'd like to do.There was also a plot somewhere. Idk where it wen't off to.This game, however, does look pretty, requires absolutely nothing more than a simple run-of-the-mill PC to run it, and if you like the simple, non-changing, generic kind of hack and slash, you'll spend hours re-running stages here. So it has that going for it. Too bad they decided to break that beautiful scenery with awful character design and weird electronic-metal kind of music, and not something more atmospheric.For the same price tag, Darksiders/DMC/God of War early installments  are all better choices, by far, with a better setting, better plot, better gameplay.

												It may look stupid but it runs really well and it's actually pretty fun. The story is crap but the gameplay is what you'd expect from a hack and slash with a bit of gunplay and magic attacks for the bosses. So if you wanna kill a bunch of demons while wearing a steel thong then this is the game for you.			"

												The game is pretty nice, but i can think it's too small, and the History isn't pretty much interesting.. The end really disappointed me, but as a game, is nice to kick some asses with some blades Pro: - You can kill the time by killing monsters- You can unlock some nice spells- The prices about health and Rage will go up after you buy it (wich means will be more harder!)Opposite:- The story-line Sucks- It's really repetitive - Too shorter (i completed it Less than 17 hours)			"

												3 stages in there's an area where you cannot advance.The autoaim is terrible.The combat is just: Run away for a bit till stuff recharges, come back for a quick strike, run away again, repeat.			"

												game is good in very few ways, but for under 5$ it is worth a play threw.pro:gameplay- great idea, but poorly made in this casecons:voice acting - horrible, could not be worsecontrols - clunky, died about 20 times, mostly control issue(try rolling)level design - bc of controls, the design is poorly made. hard to climb up spots with clunky jumpgraphics - lighting is bad, turns out redish. cinematics, blocky.yes, many cons. but in the end after the multiple stupid deaths. i still recomend it if you get it under 5 dollars. more like 2. but still.

												Pros : Interesting gameplay mechanic, I love slicing up my enemies with combos and magic. I also like the fact that you can select the spells you want to unlock, by spending these points you get from defeating enemies.Cons: Not a good story, and the face model is just ♥♥♥♥. Also the motion blur is irritating as ♥♥♥♥. It's like some over-exerting feminist with see-through eyebrows and wimpers decided to go treasure hunting.I still like the game, because, you slice up monsters with combos and spells! What's not to like?			"

												There is not much to say about this game.You hack'n'slay your way through tons of all the same enemies forever, the bosses have healthbars that never go down and it gets boring really fast.What actually drove me to buy the game is obvious:Boobies, hips, ♥♥♥ and good boob-physics. c:Perfect to buy on a sale for 2 bugs, even better if you are young and lusty as well, but don't expect a hardcore gaming experience.

												It plays like Brutal Legend mixed with Devil May Cry 4. And I can safely say that I have never wanted to punch a protagonist in the face so badly, and this is after playing DMC, Shadow Warrior, and Duke Nukem. There is only a light attack, with it seems the rest of the buttons being rerserved for magic attacks that require ""rage"", a resource that constantly drains, even in combat. There is also guns, just like devil may cry. A style meter, just like devil may cry. Even the fact that gunshots keep you in the air, just like devil may cry. I think(?) there is a doge roll allocated to the right stick. Needs confirmation. The combat itself is so basic, dominant strategy takes over any creativity.It also seems like parts of this game are meant to show off this characters ♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥. The very first level has you lock on to an enemy that's in the air.Unfortunately, you can't even see the enemy, just a butt. Feminism aside, it's not even a good ♥♥♥. Like, remember that Lady Gaga type lady in DMC 4. Remember how hot she was? Too bad the girl here isn't. PLUS I WANT TO PUNCH HER IN HER FACE. She is one of the most annoying characters I have ever seen, and it seems like the only reason she's designed the way she was was to make teenage boys all hot and bothered. I want to say that for 99 cents, you should consider getting it....but no. Most of the  positive reviews seem to be people who only played an hour or two into. If thats what it takes to finish the game, then it's garbage considering it's not an indie release (I've seen this for sale at walmart). They also might be liars. Fans of Devil May Cry, not really. I should finish this game, for the sake of clarity. I should finish to see if there is a slight glimmer of hope. But I don't really see this going anywhere.			"

												got it for $1 but still cant enjoy this.- each level seems to be just a room to defeat hordes of enemies, gets worse with bosses arounds- Boring gameplay, click left button till things die, and they arent exactly killed that fast- Terrible hit detection in small enemies, i have to use the guns instead and takes longer to kill.- unbalanced skill system, first skills are 100-1000 points, next level go around 20000, beat about 7 levels and im just at 5000 skill points.

												I don't know what those people are smoking who claim that this game has a deep and meaningful story but that's not even a close to true. I also think that hack and slash does not require any epic lore to be a good game. Anyway, playing this game through once was fun and relaxing with normal mode but I cannot see myself playing this again for a long time. So replay value is pretty much a zero.Graphics are decent, controls may be a little bit clumsy but good enough. Combat works and there's a nice variation of different spells and skills to spice the gameplay a bit. What I did miss was some indication when you actually took damage, and how much. Of course it would be a nice to see how much enemy took damage with some specific skill or combo. Dodging is also missing completely and it's replaced with fast running speed that allows you to kite almost any enemies as long as you want.If you are truly hack & slash fan I guess you can get something out of this. For the rest, I think there's better hack & slash games for the same price or even cheaper.			"

												A somewhat fun hack'n'slash. The main character you play as is a narcisistic, wannabe bad-girl type character and could stand to be taken down a few pegs, but her design (being her only redeamable feature) makes her tollerable if you like the view you'll be getting of her skimpy outfit.I don't recommend this game, however.

												I couldn't finish it.  It's just too repetative.  One monster-filled arena after another.  After a few they all look the same.My biggest gripe is the boss monsters.  Your normal weapons don't hurt them, so you need to kill OTHER monsters to build up ""rage"" so you can use spells, which shave about a hair off of their HP.  This make the fights long and tedious and not interesting at all.			"

												I wont call this a review more like a warning, dont pay over a dollar for this ever!This game is only an arena type hack and slash, levels are very basic and they just shovel waves of enemies at you.You can explore this tiny arena find artifacts and very basic crap, so let me be frank with a face so blank,combat is the meat to this odd burger that needs lettuce, tomato with cheese and where the hell is the bun??I found the bun at least, thats what i call her assets, oops i mean her backside,  yeah thats what i meant..dont judge me!This feels like a fast paced PS2 game that somehow made it here by mistake, or some cruel horny teens prank.So dont buy this unless you want combat only, no butts about this unless you really like your butts.

												Repetition. That's the main problem with this game. Fighting hordes and hordes of enemy until you're able to progress. Fighting COULD BE fun, but not when you waste way too much time on a single battle because the enemies just keep coming, even when you do everything correctly.Really, nothing against the character sexualization or the weak plot.  Good and fun games also have those, but here, combined with the REPETITION, doesn't help you to the bore of fighting the multitude of fodder thrown at you. I was caught at time wondering ""When is it gonna end?"". Also both weak endings only add insult to injury.  Nice presentation, sound is fine, but grinding all the time is tiresome and a half-♥♥♥♥♥ way of adding play time to your game.			"
