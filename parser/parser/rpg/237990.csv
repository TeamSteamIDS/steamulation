												I backed this game on Kickstarter very early on, basically after having read the words ""turn based strategy"" and ""vikings"" and had very high hopes for the project.During the first hour of play I was entusiastic and impressed with the artwork, the graphical style, the music and the combat system. It runs well, I encountered no major bugs, and the story starts very intense and engrossing.Now, after nearing the end of my first (and, most likely, only) playthrough I can sum up my personal experience with a single sentence: I learned to *thoroughly* hate this game.I'm terribly sorry, I desperately wanted to like this, but with every tedious, frustrating and boring hour of gameplay I had to concede, that just about *every* design choice made by Stoic seems to go diametrically against my personal preferences.Trying to cast an objective vote, I'd rate it about 5 out of 10, because there are undoubtedly many things good about the game, but the essence of what it's about - having fun, being motivated and enjoying the time spent playing - simply doesn't happen.TBS is the very definition of a railroaded game. More than that, it actually *feels* like more than half of the time I'm actually watching pointless, endlessly repeating nice backgrounds scrolling past, while nothing happens. Events are scarce, and when they happen, they kill my motivation and the RPG aspect. Because, frankly, I'm NOT making decisions. I'm playing a random guessing game, in most cases with absolutely *no* clue on what the consequences of the 4 ""choose your answer"" alternatives *might* even be. I hate playing a game where I don't even know the rules, and I hate winning every battle and then losing my heroes (and the associated investment!) to random dialogue events.The world map is like a bad joke on my expense, as it serves absolutely *no* function in the game but as a ""choose your flavour text"" library. It feels like there's an entire aspect of the game simply never implemented here...Same goes for character development and resource management. Both are oversimplified, shallow and simply feel completely unfinished. Each character has one single item slot, and the items available are nothing special. Abilities are pretty much predetermined, and dividing 10 points you *might* receive during 5 ranks isn't that big a deal towards diverity or individualization.There is one single resource for everything (renown) and one single sure way to acquire it (by killing enemies in combat). Sometimes you might draw a lucky card during the random dialogue guessing game and acquire some extra, but that's it. As the resource is used to buy supplies, items *and* for leveling up your heroes, it comes down to either have your caravan starve or run around with level 1 heroes, despite them having earned several promotions on the battlefield. That kills motivation on such an epic scale, and can't even begin to describe it.There are no side quests, no method to forage for food, trade, to gain extra renown or anything - remember, you are on one long, single track railway and never look left or right. You will *never* feel in control of *anything* in this game. For me, however, that is what gaming should be about.Even the combat system, one of the best parts otherwise, has several unnerving flaws that started bothering me in the long run:- You are forced to choose your team *and* the sequence in which they act *before* you know anything about the enemies you will face. Why is there even a deployment phase at the begin of combat if all you do there is arrange the predetermined team on the board? That placement will be void after one round of movement, a wrong party mix or suboptimal sequence will stay, however.- the way the two sides take turns is beyond silly. If you face a single, strong opponent, that one will act 6 times for every ONCE your heroes do something, as it's always the *sides* that take turns.- one stat for hitpoints AND combat effectiveness basically means, that the battles are decided in the first round. The side that starts taking hits is the side that will lose. Always. Without a way to regain strength, a single hit can de facto disable a hero. The whole system is too simplistic, counter-intuitive and artificial. Simple to understand, but never becomes fun for me.And another main grief is the complete absense of a save game feature. Not because of technical problems, but simply because the designers want to forbid me to play the game any other way than to live with the random outcome of their nonsensical guessing games. Sorry, folks, I'm 45 years old, have been playing games for 30 years and don't need *anyone* to tell me how to. This arrogant patronizing annoys me to kingdom come!So, again, sorry Stoic for being so negative, but this game is so totally NOT my piece of cake. Terrific art, great lore, good music and a stable game do NOT equal fun, I'm afraid. Lots of bad design choices for me equal de-motivation, tedium, boredom and frustration. Others might love this game, probably the majority. But it's definitely 100% not for me - and the files were deleted after that completely silly, unfair and annoying final battle.			"

												It really pains me to do this because there are so many reasons to like this game.The problem is that The Banner Saga simply doesn't deliver what it promises.At the very beginning we are informed that at our decisions affect the game: THEY DON'T. Despite the fact that they've created this vast and gorgeous world, steeped in lore and history, you can't even choose where to go. You're firmly 'on-the-rails' for the entire game. Occasionally, you get text based encounters where you get to make a decision, but having played Banner Saga a couple of times, I can tell you that most of these change nothing. Sometimes one character or another dies, but it's trivial since they aren't really necessary anyway.At the very beginning we are treated to a beautiful animated cut-scene complete with voice acted dialogue, so you'd figure those would come up at key points in the game at least, right? THEY DON'T. Not even at the end.As the story develops, more and more layers are revealed: The gods are dead; the sun has stopped in the sky; there's a prophecy; there's tension and intrigue between characters and races, etc, etc. NONE OF IT GOES ANYWHERE. In a nut shell, the story is: survive until you get to the end boss - who has practically nothing to do with anything.The artwork is gorgeous, the concept (Viking Oregon Trail + Turn Based Strategy + Some RPG elements) is simple but it works. But instead of using that simplicity to really open up the world, we're instead treated to a vast tableaux of untapped potential. Maybe they're planning a sequel - and heck, I've put this many hours in already, I might even pick it up - but honestly, if a game leaves you feeling, ""What, that's it?"" It failed to deliver.EDIT: I DO NOT care that Banner Saga is part of a planned trilogy. I WILL NOT base a review of a game on the potential of its sequel. I think that would be a huge disservice to those choosing whether or not to spend money on THIS game.			"

												Despite always handing players a crummy hand, the consistent drawbacks in The Banner Saga are exhilarating, even if they are utterly exhausting as well. While a sporadic bout of good news may flow through the caravan, the tone is clear. It’s an arduous journey and one that will come with death at all times. With an authentically illustrated ambience of harsh winters and closely followed characters, its story seen through tough conversations becomes that much more captivating. Offering simple yet fully symbiotic combat options as an active counterpart to text, this game leaves little to be desired, except the will to survive.Read the full review: http://www.noobfeed.com/reviews/995/the-banner-saga "

												Just want to give my early impressions.  Not a full, formal review.The Banner Saga is a Kickstarter game and it's exactly what Kickstarter should be about: visionaries with bold ideas that probably wouldn't get funded through traditional means.  And that's exactly how TBS feels; it's a game designed by visionaries who love every bit of their craft but that leads to some issues of its own I'll address later.First off, this is a gorgeous game.  The art style combines the clear-line character art of Ivan Bilibin with the iconic backdrops of Eyvind Earle.  Every piece of art from the intricately detailed world map to the rotoscoped animations is beautifully rendered.  The world of TBS draws heavy inspiration from Norse mythology but there's quite a bit of detail and world building when I was expecting it to be very straightforward.  While it is still a strategy game through and through, fans of RPGs will find plenty to like with the well defined characters and detailed world.Being a strategy game, combat is at the forefront but has some niggling issues.  It's a very clean move-action system where character order is more important than arbitrary stats like speed.  Being wholly turn based, action economy is the name of the game as you're forced to dominate the battlefield through superior placement of your units.  Combat could be a bit more robust but normal difficulty is a decent challenge so far and there's ""hard"" for people wanting more of a challenge.  Thankfully, battles are evenly spaced between story scenes so every individual battle feels special.Unfortunately, my biggest complaint of an otherwise fine system is the speed.  Combat moves at a lethargic pace.  There's no option to skip animations or speed combat and in a game where battles with as few as 4 enemies can take 10-15 minutes average, having a speed-up option is sorely missed.  TBS is immensely pleasurable so far and I can only hope it remains consistent to the end.  I'll update my thoughts as I go along.			"

""A tale is but half told when only one person tells it."" - The Saga of Grettir the Strong, Chapter 46The gods are dead. The sun never leaves the horizon, shining on boundless wastes of tundra. The land is torn between men, giants known as varl and armored creatures known as dredge, neither carry any reason to trust each other. A new day dawns, and the world is at the brink of turmoil, weary of old wars, always anticipating new wars; nearly void of hope. In such a time, you take the role of leading a caravan across frozen wastes to its destiny.You play the parts of many characters, make their choices and endure the consequences while discovering the beautifully weaved tale of the realm. Each and every character that you lead tell a story of their own in this Nordic, war-thorn saga. Each choice that you make affects your chances of survival, and makes you approach one step closer to your destination. The setting is incredibly rich, expected from any proper RPG game. Every road, landmark, settlement, mountain or forest; every region depicted on the map contains its own local history. The lore is complete and refreshing.To begin with, the game contains a diverse gameplay, bringing together elements of adventure, role-playing and strategy games. The adventure elements are directly affecting the story, and the outcome of your choices twist and turn to present you alternative destinies. Combats are turn-based in isometric maps, and gameplay is fairly easy to grasp. Yet 'fairly easy to grasp' quickly turns into 'hard to master'. You are able to level up your characters with renown, a kind of currency that you may gain through heroism either in adventure choices or by slaying your adversaries in battle field. Alongside leveling, you are capable of gathering minor and major items to enhance your heroes furthermore.The Banner Saga presents a direct example for my reason to become a gamer: a story to be told. The game satisfied all my expectations thoroughly. I do not wish to present any spoilers, but it is safe to declare that the story of the realm is not finished in this game. Good news is that The Banner Saga 2 is in development. Cheers!Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												I have mixed opinions about The Banner Saga, but I'm still very happy to have played it. Most of the time, when I find games to be surprisingly brief, it's generally to their benefit. However, this is one title where I felt like it ended before it could really shine. I'm appreciative that it didn't drag itself out, but at the same time it's always a bit jarring when the end credits sneak up on you.The Banner saga is some weird mesh of grid based strategy rpg (Fire Emblem, Tactics Ogre, FFT/A) and...the Oregon trail. And Vikings (or something resembling Vikings). However, only the first part of that hybrid combination does the game feel polished, gameplay wise. The game's most notable feature when it comes to the primary battle engagements is the Armor/Strength duality, as well as Willpower and Exertion mechanics. In order to deal a lot of damage to most enemies, especially Dredge, you first have to spend time working down their armor instead of trying to outright lower their health to zero. This is only a small wrinkle to the normal rpg standby, but it is implemented well enough to have two interesting results. One, it creates some very real consequential moments where you've got a unit able to do decent armor or strength damage and you can't be certain whether you should really strip the armor down further or if you should take a chunk out of the enemy health so that they might be finished off sooner. Secondly, it creates much needed class specialization where certain units are much more adept at stripping armor while others are better set finishing weakened foes. The game then allows you to use some basic accessory-equipment to either further specialize (giving an armor-break boosting equipment to someone already well equiped to break armor) or to make certain units more versatile. One thing that I suppose I wasn't used to is that the class-roles are specified and listed on the heroes pages, but they still don't seem as iron-clad or strict as those in games such as the Japanese srpgs I listed earlier (where the class given to a unit is much more defining). I couldn't tell you which units were which class off of the top of my head, only what each given unit was good at performing in battle. I suppose it feels a bit more organic this way. I feel like the willpower-exertion mechanics are the most important (and unique) mechanics of the battles. Exertion allows you to add damage points to your strength hits, break down armor faster, and move further than normal. Morale allows you to add willpower to units as you need it, and replenishes as you defeat enemies. Since exertion determines how much willpower you can add to any action, it was the first thing I upgraded on any unit promotion.The battle animations and sound work is expecially great, and I generally love the look of this game. The battle environments are a bit bland but that's not a real dealbreaker. One thing that I never did gel with was the out-of-battle dialogues, usually set as continously reversing camera shots of the front facing portraits of the various characters. The continuously changing perspective and lack of multiple emotive artworks for each character really made clicking through these dialogues to be a chore at times, and it was sometimes more difficult than it needed to be to determine who was entering and leaving the scene, and even who is all present at any given time.The in-between battle treks with the caravan were not super enjoyable. I was given a unit count of clansmen, fighters, and varl but I didn't really know what this represented and only tried to keep the numbers high because that's what you're expected to do, right? A handful of times the game would tell me that the enemy force was so large and my force was compartively large but I couldn't really tell what numbers the game was crunching underneath. While other moments of open-ended choice and consecquence within these sections was enjoyable (do you help the random caravan you come accross, do you punish the drunk, do you demand goods from the traders if your supplies are low, etc), the various off-screen battle tactician moments (do you charge in, do you pull back, you have x forces against their y forces) seemed to be more random and less consequential. In the last two chapters of the game, I had made a dumb mistake and lost most of my unit count but it didn't seem to matter at all. That said, in general I enjoyed the challenge of the game. I played through on Normal mode, and I even lost two battles (one of which I am sure you are supposed to lose :p ) but the game ended up allowing the journey to progress with those loses, which makes the prospect of a replay to see if I could either avoid or overcome though encounters to be somewhat appealing. The last battle of the game took a few tries, but at the same time, I didn't realize it was the last battle. It didn't really seem appropriately grandiose when considering some of the things introduced before that point that I thought I would be tackling. I'm unsure how much the ending can change depending on your choices, so I might have to do some reading.I just wish the game was a little longer. Some of the units in the game I felt like only saw 3-4 battles, and with the number of units you get in total (quite a few) and the frequency in which the become available and unavailable, and the low-map limit of who all you can bring into any given battle, I just felt like there were a few things I was unable to ever get to try. While I had some units level up many times, but the end of the game I had some units only often enough to have promoted once. But again, I suppose that allows for some variety in re-plays.Great art, but I wish there was more to the dialogue sections, retweaked caravan between battle-mechanics, some larger more interesting maps would be neat, and more chances to be able to bring units into battle which a lower frequency of units becoming unavailable. Though not to any extreme extent, having some limitations on those sorts of things is a great way to force yourself to try out different strategies rather than just bringing your strongest units every time.Lastly, the overarching story and narrative were interesting enough, but sometimes it felt messy and cluttered. You find yourself moving from one outpost to the next, each with exotics names, and never in one place for too long. Yes, there's a fairly nice in game map that helps to try to put things into place mentally, but when the purpose of most encampments is to simply upgrade your units and merch and be on your way, there wasn't a lot of incentive to really keep track of much. A large part of the game boils down to someone declaring that you need to leave place x and head to place y for reason z, and that's really all of the motivation I needed or wanted.			"

												A nice game, really loved it.+ Great athmosphere.+ Beautiful.+ Interesting fights.+ Every choice has consequences... Often huge, life-and-death consequences.But:- You don't really care about most characters.- There is a big gap in difficulty between all previous fights and the final boss.

												Wow, did I really already spend 15 hours in The Banner Saga? Yes I did and as this game has currently been on various holiday sales it's time for a little subjective review without getting too much into game and details:If you want to know about TBS's game mechanics you best checkout some gameplay video. I'll rather praise what in my opinion makes this game a good one worthwhile both your money and time. - Art & style: Beautifully crafted (rather drawn) environments and characters and map; it may not be everyone's taste but the devs put much dedication into creating a world you care about.- Music: The soundtrack alone is a masterpiece - the classical compositions fit seamlessly into the game's medieval fantasy theme. It really helps the immersion, for example if your caravan moves across the lands.- Writing: It's based on Nordic mythology but neither does it copy known works nor does it feel clichéd. Each character and each location has its own history and meaning. You can read all about it if you care but you don't have to. The story unfolds in a great way and at good pace. I really care for the protagonists which isn't an easy task/achievement for this type of game - I never skipped through any dialogue as I always wanted to get to know as much as possible.The whole story feels like it's part of something bigger, some universe that makes sense - one might even compare it to Sagas like Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones etc.- Gameplay: To keep it short, this is solid turn-based strategy (some might miss complexity) along with text-based RPG where your decisions affect combat and experience. It offers enough opportunities to upgrade your characters and to make the impression that your choices matter without getting overwhelming at any time.These points above are the core of why I recommend this game to others to whom those impressions appeal.PS: As this is a saga the devs currently work on a sequel - TBS 2 (first trailer already out)...I hope this was of any help for your,Yours,Bethlemos			"

												Wow, just wow. The Banner Saga blew me away. Incredible art and animation, and a fabulous turn-based strategy game with RPG elements in general. I couldn't stop thinking about this game for days after I finished it and I normally don't even like turn-based strategy games (or it has to be something like Advance Wars).This game is deep, as far as the story is concerned at least. You'll be losing plenty of people over the course of the game, and it's not necessarily because you made the wrong choice. It's because the choices *are* tough and there usually isn't a right answer to begin with. The game autosaves so you can't go back and try it again, and you can't save manually.The artstyle and animations are just beautiful. I appreciated it, and enjoyed it, for the entire length of the game. There's just so many detail. The characters and the environments, especially when you're fighting. Normally all you see is empty looking environments with a tree or something, but here you have dead bodies lying around and destroyed villages. Nothing looks the same (as far as I can see). They put *a lot* of love in this game. It also feels, and is, incredibly polished. It's simply amazing. The UI is small, clear and unobtrusive, but some things could've been explained a bit better. Some things are a bit unclear if you go to the character management screen, for example. It could benefit from more and better explanation. Still, no biggie.One other thing that stuck with me are the difficulty spikes. These are random but annoying. However, you can change the difficulty on-the-fly so it's usually just a matter of pressing a button.The game itself can take about 9-12 hours to complete, so it's a pretty big game. I personally never got bored of it. Now I'm anxiously awaiting the sequels, because man, this one set the bar pretty high for me. If they can maintain the same quality and polish it will be awesome, even if they decide to never add any new features.Absolutely recommended ![Rating: 93/100]			"

												The story itself starts off with humans and varl(giants) trying to bond thier alliance when suddenly everyone getting attacked by the armies of dredge (stonelike people) and are forced to travel away to confront this diaster, as you travel the lands you'll discover friends, encounter wars, and make choices that will change the outcome of your party. You'll be playing this game from the perspective of two different caravans.What an amazing game for its value, The art in this game is fantastic, the story is also very well done and the music is phenominal you'll enjoy this game if you enjoy turn table tatic with great art, story, and music with a viking theme to the entire game. only cutscenes had voice acting and that was pretty good. The only things I thought was meh in the game was is how a unit must kill off a unit to level up otherwise he'll stay level 1 forever so you'll have to really decide who you want to level up, the limited special moves  that each of the units had (which is 1) for each char, and  the lack of voice acting during the events scenes but this is understandable due to the fact that its an indie title and the focus of the budget was on everything else. So hopeful for future sequels to be even better.The game itself is really hard due to the fact that you cannot heal your units in this game so you have to make your turn wisely,  Your units only levels up if they get the last kill which I was meh about, but the choices you make to either level up your army, buy some items, or supplies for the travel is gutwrenching making the game really challenging, especially since choices you make can effect your entire party and army and your currency (renown) is so limited.There is many heroes to gather during your travel which you'll get to interact with at camp as you travel to learn about them. The travel itself which reminds me of oregon trail a bit,  is enjoyable to watch as your little army travel the lands and the events with decisions unfold for you to decide on how your battle will be or what the outcomes will be.  The map itself presents a sizeable amount of lore about the land itself and there are more to read as you travel.+Good story with good amount of lore and character interactions.+Great Art.+Music is fantastic.+much replayability due to choices you make in the game, also there is interaction with the heroes at camp.+its a 20 dollar game and have a good amount of hour in it, 10+-wish there was voice acting during the traveling event, lots of reading and text-each char only has one skill, not everyone has a buncha skills to utilize and the leveling is really straightforward since you can only level chars up to level 5 max, would love to see expansion of this-No multiplayer of any sort in this one, singleplayer only you'll have to play THE BANNER SAGA FACTIONS for this.

												The Banner Saga is a beautiful story-driven turn-based strategy game/RPG lasting about 8-12 hours. Overall, I thought it was a great experience and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys tactical strategy games like Fire Emblem and XCOM. Its major strengths are its fantastic art, reminiscent of classic Disney or Don Bluth animated films, good soundtrack, and relatively challenging and compelling battles. My primary complaint with the game is that its story is told in a bit of an exhausting way with a ton of dialogue that's not easy to care about, and I was really ready for the game to end a few hours before it actually did. Also, the game feels episodic and I'd imagine more content is on the horizon. If that's the case, I really feel like the experience didn't need to be as padded out with so many seemingly same-y towns and encounters. Still, The Banner Saga is a really ambitious title and one of the better strategy games I've played in recent memory (and certainly the most visually striking).			"

												Fantastically well done story and presentation, but one of the most AWFUL gameplay designs imagineable.Story+Dialogue: 9/10Presentation: 10/10Gameplay: 5/10The banner saga tells the epic tale of individuals fighting for survival in a dying world that dead Gods no longer watch over.The story was great, interesting characters, dramatic plot twists, and serious consequences you wont see coming.Your choices DO matter. And while watching the overworld slowly crumble under the pressure of enemies, there are many fun choices you'll make.The story itself did have problems. The transitions between parties as well as the beginnng felt clunky, as if it was trying too hard to force too much information onto the users at once, especially in the beginning where you don't understand the concept of renown. Without giving away spoilers, some companions seemed to be set up to have arcs of conversations that never happened, as well as characters that were just thrown in with no personality at all.To quote Narushima, whos review I found sad but true:""Oh look at that, you just lost two of your best characters forever because you clicked the wrong choices in a conversation that seemed trivial. Have fun trying to play with those lvl 1 or 2 characters that you were never interested in in the first place and who will never be able to do the same job! :)""""Oh no, you have no way of knowing how many days your journey will last, and therefore how much supplies you need, because you're never told, and half the time it's not even clear where you're going.""""What's that, you thought you could explore more than one reply option in that dialog, because that's how they pretty much all work? Nope, not this time, and now you're stuck with a dumb decision you would have never chosen. You're welcome!""The above statements are witty insults to the story, but honestly I still managed to enjoy it.The art and animations were fantastic. Exceptionally well done. Reminds me of old Disney animations.But there are parts of this game that are simply awful.You have the option of choosing your banner in the main menu, they created over 800 of them though you'll probably not bother skimming them once and just go with the default banner, its a cosmetic choice so I ave no clue why they'd invest so much of their time into that and not enough into the gameplay.I LOVE srpgs (trpgs if you like) but I detested this game's awful mechanics.I'm sure many srpg fans have played several other games of the genre: fire emblem, xcom, etc.So let's talk about XCOM. In XCOM, you have a unit of soldiers you command, different classes, all of which use different strategies on the field. Because I can't see through fog, I can cautiously walk through from cover to cover keeping my squad sade and update my map as I go or rush. In the expansion, I now have the incentive to rush so I don't miss out on lootable meld. Two possible strategies for exploring and advancing through the level with rewarding outcomes.XCOM has another strategy for combat: I move each of my units 1 time a turn and there are 3 enemies in front of me. I could attempt to have one of my soldiers walk behind enemy lines and flank the enemy, though if I brought him to cover its possible he'll be found out by another group of enemy soldiers, so I might want to risk just having him walk in front of them and attacking quickly and killing them before a counter attack (although this would put said solier at huge risk if i dont finish them off). I could also use one of my soldiers grenades, though he'd be out one for the whole mission, it'd destroy our enemies cover allowing us low risk execution. There are all kinds of tactical approaches I can use because this game has cover, height, destructible environments, each with different risks and rewards. That is EXACTLY the kind of thought process a srpg should have. Different strategies with different possible outcomes.So does THIS game meet up to having all sorts of tactical strategies with different risks and outcomes? No. Absolutely not. Disgustingly bad.There are three reasons.-Chess style gameplay. You have a turn to move a unit based on initiative. Your opponent moves a unit. This does not change until there is 1 unit on either side. As a result 2 units will move as fast as the combined speed of 10 units.-No cover, no terrain advantages, no heights, only minor cases of walls/objects you can't walkthrough.-The literal worst part of this design choice that led to the biggest problem of this game: injured/weakened foes do signifigantly less damage than healthy ones.If you read those three balance decisions, you can probably figure out the single strategy to use for virtually all battles.MAIM, DON'T KILL.Yes, that's right. You can essentially waste your opponents turn by savagely weakening his units, but absolutely never kill any unit until they've all been beaten. This way you mitigate the majority of damage your units take, waste your opponents turn, while retaining the benefits of your own turn. If a unit is weakened, you're best off using him as cannon fodder and letting him die asap so he's not a waste of turns.This strategy... it would be one thing if it were only a cheap exploit, but its not. It's an ENFORCED strategy.If you DON'T play by this strategy, the game punishes you, there is no superior strategy to this, and the game becomes difficult if you're trying to use any other strategy. With absolutely no cover or terrain advantages or heights it's just a math battle where u run your units over and see how much armor you'd be best off breaking before targeting the enemy hp without killing him. It's one of the single worst design ideas an srpg can have.It is the literal worst srpg I have ever played in terms of gameplay. The genre is sorely lacking in games and I had the best wishes for this one. I've heard they were planning to bring that same battle mechanic back in its sequel. I'd recommend passing on this one.

												An exellent, albeit linear, narrative constantly interrupted by flawed turn-based combat. The Banner Saga boasts great visuals and beautiful soundtrack, character design is spot-on, reminiscent of older cartoons, while still being true to the nordic theme and as historically accurate as a fantasy saga can be.The flaws lie in the gameplay, particularly in the fact the game concentrates too much value on Renown. It's the currency with which you buy food, amulets and level up heroes. It's also not that easy to come by, since it's mostly rewarded from killing things and winning battles (although you, very rarely, gain some for a choice).The game alternates between frequent combat sections, where you and the enemy alternate in turns, regardless of numerical advantage. Combined with the fact strength is both HP and how much damage you can deal, this system encourages the player to not kill oponnents, but, instead, harm them until they all have low HP, only then should the player start the killing.The fact renown is used for everything also limits character choices and story decisions. You'll be encouraged to be a psycopath, partaking as many battles as possible to gain extra renown. To make matters worse, there are no real consequences for such choices.Morale is almost meaningless, only awarding a few extra willpower points at the start of the battle. Supplies are also meaningless, seeing as fighters aside heroes have no effect on war outcome, as long as you win your battle (usually a charge, since it puts you against more enemies, which equals more renown), a team of 5 heroes could win a war against thousands of dredge.Downed heroes come back with injury whoose duration and severity depend on game difficulty setting. Ironically, these same immortal heroes can die arbitraly during text-based events while travelling.While I haven't been able to finish the game yet (always get bored by the game before being able to do so), I've seen users complain the story actually ends abruptely, leaving space for an obvious non-advertised sequel. The Banner Saga is actually just a first episode, despite not being advertised as such.EDIT: I have finished the game on a new playthrough, and the ending is indeed abrupt, with a short (non animated) cutscene right after a rather easy boss fight (just ignore every dredge and focus on the boss). Even if it's part of a trilogy, a game must feature a relatively complete story (compare it to a movie such as ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" and you can see how this kind of ending is unsatisfying). A bit more recently, the store page was updated to reveal banner saga as the first of a trilogy, despite that not being the case on release date.To summarize: The Banner Saga has great visuals, soundtrack and (linear and relatively unfinished) story, but it's held short by bad gameplay which ranges from silly to frustrating, removing almost all immersion or tension the well written story can create.If things don't get better in the sequel, I think stoic should give up on making games and start writting novels or animated short films.

												Two thumbs up for this game. Had it in my Steam library for quite some time, and I really don't know why I haven't given it a chance before. All in all, its an RPG game with turn based combat. Characters in the game are superb, choices you need to make along the way influence the story greatly. After this game, I thought to myself: ""Is it really possible to make such a good game on Kikcstarter?"" I had my doubts before, but now, I'll gladly admit I was wrong.Buy the game, support the developers, and enjoy the tale about Vikings and their folklore.			"

												Oh, Banner Saga.  I supported you on Kickstarter, and I wanted so much to love you.  Your visuals are gorgeous, your music excellent, and your writing sublime.  But your gameplay!  Ah, your gameplay leaves much to be desired.Drama aside, The Banner Saga is a game that should have been excellent, but is marred by its actual gameplay.  The tactical combat is the sort that some will love and some will hate, but either way the initiative system is completely nonsensical, with units in each army getting to act more often as they become outnumbered.  Damage and health are also based on the same number, so as a character takes damage, he becomes increasingly ueless in battle - which is a serious problem if you outnumber your enemies.But where the game really fails is the decisions it presents.  On the surface, it looks like the system used in many games: be presented with a situation, and react.  The problem is that it falls into the trap of frequently making the consequences of your choices arbitrary.  Sometimes you can reasonably predict what result each choice will produce, but most of the time the results come from nowhere, making the decisions effectively meaningless.  If the player can't reasonably exert control, why give him choices at all?The game has been getting a lot of good reviews, so clearly my opinion is in the minority.  But I can't recommend it.  Its gameplay simply holds it back too much from being a satisfying experience.			"

												Most games these days are designed to be won; The Banner Saga is meant to be survived. Anything more would be a mockery of the Viking apocalypse suffered by its characters. The atmosphere of Stoic Studios' first title is so evocative of desolation and despair that succeeding too grandly feels like a betrayal of the twilight sagas. With the gods dead and the sun stalled in the sky, humans and giants work together to eke out a shattered existence. The arrival of an ancient enemy throws the tenuous balance into question and sends desperate warrior caravans across the hostile landscape. The displaced and hopeful follow in their wake, scraping together what lives they can. The leaders of these caravans are forced to make difficult decisions, by which their followers live and die.The point of view shifts several times throughout The Banner Saga, demonstrating the dire straits in which both humans and giants find themselves. However, in spite of the multiple views, so much about what's really happening remains unknown. Each caravan meets many people, most of whom have an angle for survival. Figuring out who can be trusted is one of the great challenges of the game, and also one of its greatest pleasures. It's easy to be trustworthy when supplies are high and no one's laid low by crippling wounds. Righteousness is more difficult to come by when the gods are dead, the horizon is alight with burning villages, and taking on new allies means condemning others to slow starvation.Despite the pervasive apocalypse, not all is lost. Stoic has done admirably at focusing on the personal stories at the epic's core. The key characters' motivations are well-explained, and their mysteries reveal themselves at an appropriate pace. Even when all seems lost, moments of heroism, compassion, and courage keep the narrative of doom from becoming crushing. The ending, such that it is, is powerful. Unfortunately, it is abrupt. Future chapters of the saga have already burdened themselves with the hype from the first installment's unanswered questions. Everything looks and sounds amazing. Character designs are rich and colorful, and their animation is like something from out of a lost 80s classic. The visuals scale impressively, handling great crumbling monuments and fierce monsters as well as delicate human gestures. The deliberate staging extends to travel scenes where no actions are allowed. Watching the caravan struggle through the landscape to deep chants and mournful horn movements offers counterpoint to moments of blood and steel. These contrasts demonstrate relatable smallness against the enormity of the end. Occasionally animations look uncanny against their backgrounds, but the characters are nuanced enough that the strangeness almost feels like a stylistic choice. The music is professionally orchestrated, and would stand out as a compliment to the mood no matter what medium it accompanied. Whereas The Banner Saga's story and sensory appeals are difficult to critique without gushing, its mechanics are more controversial. Combat has many quirks that may seem counter-intuitive to SRPG players. However, learning the ins and outs of the system can be an enjoyable puzzle. Battle takes place on a flat grid. Up to six plot-relevant allies, drawn from a frequently shifting pool, face off against a potentially frightening number of enemies. Battle proceeds in alternative rounds, with one member of the enemy force getting a turn for every allied turn. As a result, keeping weakened enemies alive is often an effective tactic. Hit points double as a character's damage capacity, so getting the enemy to waste a turn commanding a shattered unit can delay a stronger unit's attack. Managing each character's reserve of willpower and exertion - the amount of willpower that can be spent in a turn - draws the resource conservation elements from the rest of the game into battle. Every enemy killed provides bonus willpower that can be distributed to any character, allowing momentum to build from a victorious thrust. Racking up death willpower isn't always a strong enough incentive to overcome the strangeness of alternating combat rounds, but it helps. If the battle quirks get too unmanageable, it's possible to dial the difficulty down from hard or normal to easy.Despite its enjoyable features, not every desperately calculated moment of battle is joyous. Many battles begin with a large-scale conflict, which pits the caravan's rank-and-file soldiers against enemy hordes. The formation options in this system don't feel as strongly tied as they could be to the skirmishes that follow. Most battlefields are devoid of terrain, and facing doesn't matter. As a result, character placement, willpower expenditure, and party composition become the major tactical elements. The sole currency for preparing for battle is renown. When all is lost, only a man's observed actions are important. Renown is used on stat-boosting treasure, character advancement, and purchasing supplies for the caravan. Focusing on any of these areas limits growth in the others, and doing everything is impossible. Keeping a trailing column of peasants fed is an admirable goal, but it becomes difficult to justify when contrasted with clicking the button that increases an ally's armor break ability. The choice is further complicated by the knowledge many more could die if the warriors aren't kept strong.Playing The Banner Saga as a standard game of optimization and the greatest possible success may lead to disappointment. Trusting the crazy - eyed wanderer who smells of stale mead could be the best decision you make all week, or it could lead to a knife in your back. Rolling with the punches and accepting the permanent death of a favored all adds texture to the banner of a doomed people. Some choices are mechanically better than others, causing the more damaging answers to become less interesting during multiple replays. Certain tricks will only be novel the first time around, while others allow more strategic calculation.All saves are autosaves, and are made at predetermined checkpoints. There's no indication when these saves occur, except manually checking the Load menu. Attempting the old Choose Your Own Adventure trick of sticking a bookmark in at a difficult decision point isn't so easy here. Loading a save to choose a new answer may require fighting several battles again. On the plus side, the game is short enough to invite multiple replays. Although the central narrative is the same every time, choices made along the way lead to different side paths and party composition. Simple, split-second decisions can lead to significant consequences.Stoic Studios have set themselves up with a difficult act to follow. The Banner Saga is a rare game that forces its player to think and feel, often in delightful opposition. Its subsystems combine to support the narrative of desperate heroism, hard choices, and survival. Like the doomed giants who fight its battles, The Banner Saga is powerful, thoughtful, and worthwhile. Recapturing this winning combination is going to be risky. When a game is so precariously excellent, a wiggle either way in the sequel could spoil the formula that made the first so magical. Regardless of whether future installments stand or fall, The Banner Saga has done its duty. It may not always give gamers what they want, but it gives them what they need: challenging questions, tactical gameplay, and a strong, fully realized atmosphere.			"

												This game causes mixed feelings. The concept had really great potential but it wasn't fulfilled. Some (+)s and (-)s(+) Art. It seems to me that graphics and music were on the minds of developers from the very beginning and they focused solely on it. Great, fantastic art. Impeccable style. Totally enjoyed it.(+) Caravan management and interactive stories. These determine the result of everything: what characters you'll get, which ones will survive and which will die, how much resourses you'll get etc. That's one of the best parts of the game.(+) Strong authentic atmosphere.(+) Excellent initial concept.(-) Weak repetitive battles and gameplay in general. Too few different types of enemies. Few classes of characters. And there are hundreds of battles when you have to fight the same enemies with the same characters. Boring to death. It seems that developers devoted themselves to making graphics so much that they forgot about gameplay till the last night before the release and barely managed to finish it hurriedly. But often gameplay = fun.(-) Story. It was intended really epic. I mean REALLY big and epic like in Game of Thrones or something. But they didn't have enough resourses, so in the end it finishes abruptly, it is relatively weak, it's not supported by great gameplay, it is disappoining. If they'd taken something of a less scale the game would have been much better I guess.My overall imression is negative which is sadly, because this game could have been truly terrific.			"

												This game has a beautiful aesthetic and engaging story, but too many gameplay mechanics are broken or intentionally flawed to create a phony sense of challenge.  These are:* The devs took the ""turned based"" of turned based strategy way too seriously.  Fights are ""you hit me, I hit you,"" and turns are based off of how you line up your team before battle.  If you didn't line your team up right and properly zerg rush the enemies, you're in for a bad time.  And if you kill the guy who was next in line, the unit three turns away magically gets to go next.  I guess they weren't paying attention until their buddy died?* You can't save the game.  The game autosaves at pre-determined points and that's it.  Made a bad choice or screwed  up your zerg rush?  You go to the last save, which may include lengthy marches you can't speed up and cutscenes you can't skip.  The devs say this is to make you live with your choices, but it's really to punish you for a combat system they didn't think through all the way.* You have a single resource.  No gold and experience, just renown.  You buy food with renown or level up with it.  As you can guess, this can leave your army starving or your team underpowered.  I guess real heroes don't need to eat?  You lose renown for buying food so that must be the case.  * Strength and HP are a single attribute.  This means the more damage you take, the less damage you can do.  This is the main fault of the game - if you don't properly zerg rush the other team and whittle each unit down one by one, multiple characters on your team will be crushed.  There's no strategy and no system to learn.  Either you chip away at each unit (instead of taking out the most powerful first), or you get shredded.  * Forget guarding (unless you're a special unit), cover bonuses, overwatch, or any other hallmarks of the genre.  In this game, you rush in or rush out (and the AI always goes for the weakest unit so you won't rush out for long), and that's it.  Better hope you leveled your squad right or by the time you realized you upped the wrong attributes, you're slogging through hours of unskippable cutscenes and ridiculously flawed fights.This game has great potential, but is so badly flawed that progressing through it will frustrate you to no end and wear your patience to nothing.  Watch the cutscenes on youtube if you have to - the torment that comes from making it unfold for yourself is not worth it.			"

												The Banner Saga was a wonderful turn-based strategy game. It's probably one of the more challenging games within the genre. I personally had to play it a little over 2 times through just to get a better foothold on the combat system. Here are a few observations I can make after playing over 30 hours of the game:Pro:- The game is VERY challenging. The jump in difficulty between easy to hard is extremely high and there is a very small room for error in most battles.- Great visuals. The characters (from the animation to actual design) are amazing. The landscapes are gorgeous and you get to experience them in full as you travel to the final destination.- Numerous tactical possibilities! When you finish the game for the first time on Normal, you'll be able to decide how you want to invest your resources and who you want to invest them on. This opens up a lot of possibilities when it comes to character placement/formations. Even though there's little room for error when playing on hard, there's a ton of ways to overcome each challenge based on decisions you've made from prior experience.Con:- The camera controls are limited. I would have liked to see keys binded to auto-move to each of your characters. You have a max of 6 so f1-f6 or 1-6 would have been nice.- No key binding. I know there's not a lot of use for the keyboard in this game.. but a skip function to automatically rest for willpower would have been very helpful.All in all, it's a really good game. There's a lot of things to appreciate in this game and you can tell that a lot of effort was poured into polishing the experience. I hope that this game continues with further installments because I would gladly pay full price for more of this masterpiece!			"

												I certainly enjoyed this game. It has a unique feel even if everything is stolen from Norse mythology. The story was captivating, so much to the point that I yelled in fury when I happened to loose a member of my party. Combat is perhaps less than groundbreaking with originality but it was certainly solid and very rewarding when it came to leveling up characters. I got a couple of the giants mixed up for a while, but aside from that, most characters have a unique backstory that fleshes out as things progress. It is certainly worth it to read into everybody's capabilities, for the most subtle traits  they posses play out very importantly once you realixe their potential. Every battle should be played with the intent of keeping as many of your fighters intact, lest you be forced to send in your benchwarmers in for the next fight.The artwork was impressive, captivating, and downright epic, however.......... the first cutscenes really got me stoaked for kickass cartoon ""Heavy Metal-esq"" laden story line. The artwork let my hopes fall gracefully rather than total disapointment. Despite the fact that I have 1 and a half playthroughs under my belt I do not see an increible amount of playability, although it seems as though a few play throughs could be rewarding due to the amount of different options/results offered throughout the game.Now, here's where I'm not totally sure how I feel about the game: Choices. Some choices totally blindside you with how determental/beneficail they can be. They game has a habit of throwing scores of petty situtions in your face just so that you'll be unaware of the severity of a certain choice and suffer because you did not treat it with appropiate reverment. I mentioned earlier that I have one and a half playthroughs; this is because I utter screwed myself in the first game so I went back to ammend my ""mistakes"". If you've ever layed D&D, this game has the feel of a ruthless yet rewarding DM that often sets you up to hang yourself with your own noose once you get things going.All in all, I loved playing this game, yet I do not see myself playing it in the immediate future.

												I love the Viking setting.  I enjoy the story, and it certainly kept my attention.  The combat has some interesting mechanics: armor break, the fact that strength is health, and some great special moves.However, the turns and initiative are implemented in a really frustrating way that, in the end, has ruined this game for me.First, each side gets to move one unit per turn, no matter how many units are remaining, in a fixed rotation.  As enemy units are injured and lose health, they also lose the ability to deal damage.  However, once they are killed, their spot in the initiative order is filled by another healthy unit.  If I have 4 units remaining, but the enemy has only 2 units, then those units will each act twice as frequently as my 4 units, and they will have a distinct advantage.  Sometimes I may have a couple of units across the map who have just killed their opponents, and while those two waste turns walking back to the other side, the fewer remaining enemy units that are engaged with the other half of my force will be attacking twice as often as those units near them.Bottom line is that killing an enemy unit is generally a bad idea until the very end of the fight.I have adjusted to this tactic, as unintuitive and frustrating as it sometimes is.  Now that I have advanced sufficiently, I was able to raise the Strength of one of my favorite units to 18.  Now, his key ability, the sweeping attack that hits 3 enemies, has been rendered much weaker.  Many weak enemy units can be killed by a single 18 STR attack.  When he had only 16 STR, he could severely injure 3 of these weak units in one blow, which was fantastic.  Now, he kills them outright, and what remains are 3 stronger units that now get to attack twice as frequently.Killing an enemy unit is a bad idea?  Killing 3 of them even worse?  My favorite character is too strong, and that's a tactical disadvantage?To me, this is just a bridge too far.Is it novel?  Yes.  Can you work around it?  Sure.  But it draws out the combat as you avoid weakened enemies and chase down the healthy ones before you start delivering the killing blow.  And the longer I play this game, the less I enjoy it.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: StoicPublishers: Versus EvilInitial release: Jan 2014Genre: Strategy, RPG, Turn-based, Dark#Worth/NotWorth: #AbsolutelyWorth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationThe Banner Saga..I've been trying to write this review for two days now. I played through the game twice. The first time I played was about a year ago. I'm trying to find some quick snippet I can use to surmise the game but nothing comes forth. So I guess I'll provide some exposition. Its a turn based, tile based, highly narratively driven up to 5 person party adventure. You make decisions as the leader of a large group of traveling humans and a race-- Well, more of a species called the Varl; which more or less are giants. You are constantly having to manage resources. Battles earn you renown, which is used as a currency and XP. Renown can buy you items for your characters to wear to increase stats, supplies for travel as well as allow ready candidates to level up. Resources are needed on the road for your traveling companions to survive. As well as keep morale up. Poor morale can effect the abilities of your fighters in the from of losing willpower. On the road you will run into events that you will have to make decisions about. Including dealing with everything from fights in the caravan to deciding to trust outsiders or not. I never quite pinned down if they are all scripted or procedurally generated. Some but not all seem very timely. COMBATThe battle system takes a little time to get used to as its slightly obtuse at first. Each characters health is their strength, what this means is as someone gets hurt they progressively become weaker and their strength is directly blocked by the enemies armor. So you must choose to either attack their health or armor. There are some other variables such as willpower, which allow you to move farther or do extra damage in one turn. Killing enemies earn you a notch on the horn which equates to an extra willpower lying in wait when needed. Some other stats that effect the two main ones are exertion and armor break. Exertion limits how much willpower one can use even if they have more. Armor break allows one to do more damage to armor regardless of other variables. There are of course classes for all the characters which have specific abilities such and Tempest, a sort of whirlwind attack and others like Forge ahead that allow you to choose someone to move up in the turn order. If a character falls in battle they will become injured and need to rest, usually for multiple days. The character can still be used in other battles while injured at the cost of lowered stats typically. The game does have multiple endings. I am interested to see what happens in the sequel regarding them. I will also say the game does sort of end abruptly. It does come to a climax but to be honest, a lot it seems a bit unresolved. The game is also, from what I can tell, hand drawn. Characters have very fluid animations when attacking and the overall aesthetic is very pleasing. THE GISTThis is maybe one of my favorite games in the last.. decade? One of the most gripping, memorable and emotional games I've played in my life. Definitely in the top 20 ever. Difficult decisions abound. Stuck in between a rock and a hard place? Can't move the rock? Don't have a drill? People are relying on you ya know. Better think about your actions.Follow my curation for more "

												The Banner Saga’s awe inspiring scope is both its biggest strength and weakness.It paints a picture so lavish and compelling that its almost irritatingly compelling with each new thread it introduces, so rich that you want to spend time learning about every character and piece of lore but haven’t the time to do so. In a medium so oversaturated with derivative fantasy, the distinctiveness of the world Banner Saga creates pulled me in eagerly awaiting even the most trivial of pieces of exposition. It wrapped me up so tightly in its intrigue that even when its problems surfaced they could do little to take me out of the experience, the only real issue then being that said experience unfortunately only has enough time to tell part of its story.The Banner Saga is quite simply the telling of the end of days. The Sun has stopped moving, the gods are dead, and the return of an enemy thought extent threaten to annihilate those few who still survive. It’s bleak and unrelenting in its showcasing of how dire a place the world has become, as you embark on a caravan fleeing to anywhere not already destroyed, many not living to see the journey’s end.The tension of the narrative - the abundant despair and sacrifice every step of the way - rejects the overly cautious writing far too often substituted in for more disruptive outcomes, and makes the characters you travel with people you care and worry about. With how constant the possibility of death becomes, I was invested not only in each character’s narrative but also in fighting to keep them alive as best I could. The choices presented before you become agonizing decisions that often decides who lives and dies, leaving me paralyzed as I hoped I’d made the right call. It’s stressful, but crucial to the story Banner Saga wants to tell and the emotion it intends to make you feel, and it succeeds at this almost perfectly.The lack of voice acting or animated cutscenes for most of the game definitely at times hinders the impact of events, but by the time these begin to arrive I was already so caught up in who my characters were that dialogue alone was enough to humanize them. The bigger “problem” is that Banner Saga’s narrative and world are on a scale far larger than a single game can contain, and as a result many of the story’s plotlines both overt and secondary are left dangling, with a statement that they will be expanded upon with the next two games in a planned trilogy, but for the time being left me frustrated that I was so quickly cut off. Of course I say this only because of how enthralling the narrative is already, but it was a tad disappointing to see so much setup but only partially executed, leaving me with more questions than answers and praying this adventure gets finished.With how seamlessly the experience flows together, it might be easy to forget that under all the plot and jaw-dropping artwork exists a polished and inspired turn-based strategy game. The Banner Saga works as a game of small, important numbers and mechanical simplification so as to make every fight immediately understandable. There are very few numbers to be concerned about, and every one that is here matters and is imperative to make the absolute most of if you want your party to survive. Fights are designed not as giant encounters or grand boss fights, but small battles that often come down to the last fighter standing. This raw, streamlined approach was refreshing, not only in that it cut down on the number of throwaway encounters but also made me far more conscious of every tool at my disposal.Party creation and leveling were more meaningful to me as each character played a distinct role in combat, and raising their skills was a rare and extremely important event. The low numbers tied to everything kept things from ever becoming overwhelming, and made positioning of fighters just as if not more important than the blunt force they could inflict. With each battle intimately tied to the narrative, I also became conscious of who it was I was sending into battle, a decision that could potentially result in them never coming back.The areas where combat breaks slightly are mostly related to a handful of oversights as to what information you’re given. Though you might have been given hints via a preceding narrative bit, you’re never allowed to see who or what you’re fighting before the fight has already begun. This makes selecting the right fighters almost a game of luck or forcing you to develop a standardized strategy and only focus on characters that work within it (which of course is compromised if one of those characters dies or is injured). It prohibits experimentation and seems kind of silly, as surely you could see the battle you were going into before you walked into it. This extends even into letting you see character stats, level up, or change items on the party select screen, which can have a huge effect on your outcome if you haven’t recently looked at and adjusted these earlier.What’s surprising though, is that The Banner Saga’s flaws for as irritating as they often are feel less like problems and more potential. There’s so much here that’s inspired, engaging, and full of promise that anything that doesn’t work perfectly doesn’t bring the game down but show areas where it could be made even more amazing. This doesn’t make it a flawless game, but it does make it one that’s worth playing despite any mistakes it makes. Developer Stoic’s ambition is intoxicating and left me not unsatisfied by what The Banner Saga isn’t, but excited to see just how much more it becomes.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Banner Saga is a fascinating trip to Norse mythology. Half leg deep in snow I enjoyed the story, the conflicts, dilemmas and also emotions, all in its graceful audiovisuals. Several of its flaws and ambiguities are not worth mentioning. This visual novel game shouldn't be missed (like its sequel was)! There should be more games with this style!

												I had heard very good things about this game so I had high expectations. The art is indeed gorgeous, it is reminiscent of old animation movies from 70s and 80s, but with a modern twist. Unfortunately I wish there was more positive things to say about the game. Well, the world and the background story are pretty good, plus the game doesnt feel too short nor too long... I actually was positively surprised by it, I thought the story would draw to an end earlier. Here's a collection of random thoughts I have about the game:1) you spend almost half of your time staring at a long string of tiny characters plodding at unnatural speed through snowy landscapes. 2) the map is not integrated at all in the game. You dont have any saying in which direction your caravan is going, everything is decided. You can access the map only when you camp or stop the caravan, and at that point I've already forgotten where I am supposed to go... why isnt the map shown when the route to be taken is presented to the player? there's a huge map full of Norse-sounding names, and you can click on most of them to get additional info... but why would you? I got bored after a while, like with the planets' descriptions in Mass Effect. You dont just dump a huge map to the players to satisfy their thirst of knowledge, you introduce the world little by little with bits and pieces that are relevant to the story.  In TBS only a handful of locations on the map matter for the story and they are all non-descriptive... one town or the other, they feel all the same (except the Varl capital). 3) I heard some people saying ""The dialogues are really good""... well I dont know what kind of games these people have been playing but the dialogues in TBS range from average to bad, with a couple bordering to nonsensical (e.g. the one of the mead house stands out for making little to no sense). I grew more and more irritated. 4) Another little irritating thing: the lines in dialogues only proceed forward. If you press accidentally the mouse key (in my case the trackpad) you will skip to the next line without possibility to go back. it happened to me a bunch of times, I play with the finger resting on the Macbook's trackpad and a little twitch sends the dialogue forward5) the story feels really average, many questions are left completely unanswered... I can only guess they might be doing a sequel to expand on the story. I'm not gonna mention anything to avoid spoilers but seriously there's stuff that happens that you feel it's major and could definitely steer the story some way or the other, but instead nothing happens and the event/story element is not mentioned anymore afterwards. 6) the fighting system is super clunky, doesnt feel fluid at all. You are often pitted against more numerous / stronger enemies and your characters never seem to level up fast enough for the fight to feel equal. Moreover they are equipped with abilities which are often difficult to use (this ability? Only works with enemies which are positioned EXACTLY diagonally in respect to the original target. Oh you think it's hard to use? How about we make it so that it can inflict damage also to your allies?), or semi-useless (each time my Raidmaster used Stone Wall he's never been targeted afterwards; Rain of Arrows, Mend, and others are so nerfed they suck). In the end it pretty much resolved in ""I start chipping down the armor first, then I go for the health"" with basic attacks, hoping the bad guys would go down before mine. Sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt. Lost maybe 1/3 of the battles, without chance to replay them. 7) the big-scale clashes are just ridiculous... you can chose one of the strategies like ""Hold them"" or ""charge"" or ""tighten your ranks"", and how the battle will resolve feels totally random. If it is not, than there is no way to understand the logic behind it. 8)  I felt no attachment whatsoever for the characters nor the caravan members (i.e. people who depended on me for protection and leadership). Especially the caravan members, they are just a stat, when they starve you see the numbers going down and the morale plunging and you're like ""yeah so what? the game continues anyway."". This is a major drawback, you dont feel you have anything to lose, you can lose all the battles and starve out almost everyone in the caravan, you will still go on. At a certain point I started playing like a di*k, thinking ""well let's see how much I can f-up before I get a game over screen""... it never came. Ok for the story-driven playability, but this is still a game. If the game plays itself what's the point?9) you are forced to make totally random choices. E.g. how many ratios to buy before setting on a leg of the journey... you have no idea how many days it will last... how about informing the player?? Renown is always scarce, because it is mainly used to evolve characters, so it would be good to have some planning before spending some hard-gained renown.10) The banner itself plays NO role at all in the story, it is mentioned in one line of dialogue and that's it. For the whole game. So much for a whole ""saga""....11) Hardly any tutorial in the game, just a basic one about combat. How about explaining how the different abilities work? I had to quit the game and resume from last checkpoint when I realised my assumptions about a certain ability were off and I lost the little tactical advantage I had because I screwed up12) I dunno what was the reason, not enough money to put in the artistic production or time constraints, but I got so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off when I realised (and i realised it pretty soon in the game) that there is only one image for each character. All the dialogues, during the whole story, the same expression. Zero emotion response. Oddleif is stuck with the same scornful expression for the whole game, Eyvind with a sorry-♥♥♥♥♥ smile, and Ubin goes around holding his quill even in the middle of a battle.			"

												According to Steam I tried for 8.5 hours to like this game. I failed, even though the story looks interesting enough and the visuals are beautiful. I have read from others how they dislike that choices give little hint to as what the outcome could be. Even worse is how the story swaps between protagonists and thus those outcomes are arbitrarily moved into the future.Still, I'd try to play it if it wasn't for the gameplay. The combat must be the worst turn based combat I have experienced. Units can move past enemies, in and out of melee without any fear of turning their backs on enemies. While attacks of opportunity have become a staple for many games, they are non-existent in the Banner Saga. Coupled with how units can burn Willpower for extra moves and then burn Willpower to boost their attack, means that even if you try to tie up an enemy in melee, they can still stroll past your fighters and get to your back row. After all, archery range is within charge distance. And since movement is always the same, there is no chance to get out of melee range once an opponent has gotten close.Even worse is the initiative system. Both sides take turns moving units, meaning that the side with less units gets to move those more often. If those are more powerfull, having twice the stats of the player's units, then those powerfull enemies hit multiple times before you have the time to even try to save your hero.Yes, you can learn to beat these fights. But it seems less like adapting tactics than learning to play a broken system.I had heard combat was bad, but I had not expected it to be this bad. At least I bought it very cheap on the Humble Store for a good cause.			"

												I had a very hard time deciding if I should give this game a thumbs up, or thumbs down. TL;DR: This game is too short, the story left wholly unfinished, and your choices matter much less than the game leads you to believe. Purchase only on a good sale. At first blush, this game is evocative and intriguing; the artwork is beautiful and the characters well-wrought. It's sort of an Oregon Trail meets turn-based RPG, and the story appears vast and your choices deeply important.Unfortunately this game fails to deliver in three key areas: choice, story, and length. At the beginning you feel like your choices matter. Make a wrong decision and you run out of food, or an important character dies. Later, you realize that you're pretty firmly on the rails; you might save people here or there, but in the end, it doesn't really matter much who lives and who dies. I was deeply disappointed to discover this, as the game felt like it offered really gritty options in the beginning. The story and length problems go hand-in-hand--this feels like a book you slam shut in the middle and never pick up again. There are so many loose threads that doesn't have answers, so many stories left untold. The ending felt so abrupt that I had to do some internet searches to see if I'd somehow screwed up and ruined my game, or if the credits just happened to roll in the middle. It didn't end, it just dropped off into oblivion. I got roughly six hours of gameplay out of this, so the $10 sale price tag wasn't too bad. If there's a sequel released, I'll pick it up for roughly the same price...but for now I feel cheated. Not in price, but in story. There's so much left unfinished that I feel unsettled, and the realization that my choices matter not is rather disappointing as well.			"

												Beautiful but Flawed.Greatness lurks beneath the skin of The Banner Saga. It is a beautiful, emotionally involving and utterly unique experience, but sadly I found this first installment to be marred by a host of frustrating design problems.The artistic vision of The Banner Saga is without peer. Its world, characters and story are depicted with rare clarity and conviction, without compromise. The visual style is bleak yet gorgeous and can be mistaken for no other game. The music (by the talented Austin Wintory of 'Journey' fame) powerfully evokes a forlorn, dying world. The writing too is excellent throughout, defining tragic characters with sombre nuance.The combat in the game is also novel and interesting, with great tactical depth. Battles are tense and strategic, and the developers succeeded admirably at weaving it into the storyline - battles affect choices and choices affect battles, each adding meaning to the other. That a turn-based combat game kept me so enthralled with its story (an unremittingly bleak one, at that) is a testament to the talent and passion of the studio.That said, at the same time everything feels somehow underproduced; voice acting and animation are conspicuously absent in all but a few scattered scenes, and each character has one fixed expression - which can sometimes be incredibly inappropriate to the dialogue. While it is true that the art design of the game is deliberately spare, my impression was that some things had been over-simplified, as if the game had been rushed to completion.Minor cosmetic issues aside, the game felt unfinished in other more problematic ways. It crashed several times for me, and on each occasion I suffered from poorly placed autosaves. The combat interface also frequently proved vague or incomplete, in many cases failing to explain critical rules. One consistent frustration was the inability to undo or preview character movement, in cases where the (often severe) consequences of a particular move could not be determined beforehand - this did not seem like a deliberate choice, but as with the incomplete UI more likely due to a lack of playtesting.The most frustrating aspect of the game, for me, was the handling of player narrative choices. This story is one of loss and hopelessness, so as such I accept that there are no happy endings to be found, but rather a series of tragedies to be survived. And as in combat, the player is asked to make difficult decisions, with no clear right answer - but unlike in combat, the consequences are utterly random. In combat, the player is asked to make careful choices and is rewarded with various bonuses on success. These bonuses usually relate to specific characters, as do the combat choices, so this feedback cycle works well, strengthening engagement with the characters and story in a satisfyingly consistent way.Narrative choices on the other hand, often reward the player with an unforeseeable slap in the face, throwing away much of their prior hard work - for example by stealing away a character in whom the player had already invested a lot of time and emotional energy. I question why player choice is involved at all, if it does not involve skill. If the intended purpose was to make the player identify with the hopelessness of the characters' situation, then this would have worked better if the choices embodied clear tradeoffs: in a bad situation, allow the player to pick which sacrifice to make, based on what is more important to them or to the character. But by consistently leaving me feeling cheated and powerless, by the end of the game it merely served to reduce my engagement with the characters and plot.Years from now I feel sure that I will remember The Banner Saga more for its strengths than for its weaknesses. The beauty of the experience implies a great deal of talent, and the various flaws are all fixable - as such I still highly recommend the game, and have high hopes for its sequels!			"

												10/10 - Epic Nordic Tale With Turn-Based Combat! This game exceeded my expectations on every front; I found it so enjoyable that immediately upon completion I purchased the sequel at almost full price. No regrets either!The game brings together elements from several genres and magically blends them together in this Choices Matter masterpiece. The main point of interest for me was the lengthy, epic tale that unfolds as you lead your people through struggles of surviving a increasingly barren world. You trudge your army in a side scrolling fashion and frequently engage in grid turn-based combat which I love. This elements really reminds me of the combat style in the Kings Bounty series; if you liked that... You'll love this. My first play-through took about 11 hours. I will 100% play this through again, maybe several times. Replay value = Very high! With over 25+ characters to assemble your army and hundreds of camps and towns to explore; you'll be sucked in quickly!Overall, definitely worth the $20; grab on sale if you can but not required in my eyes! A must play for turn-based and fantasy lovers alike!   Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more. Free Keys and Reviews weekly!

												I don't think The Banner Saga is a very well executed game. The ideas are certainly there, the story is interesting, the music is excellent, but gameplay-wise, it has some pretty egregious design problems.Consider that players replaying the game regularly consult a guide to check when certain characters might die, in order to not waste resources levelling before that point. Then consider that on your first run, you don't have that - you have the option to choose from an assortment of characters, spending your points (renown) on whoever you please. But while they can die from your negligence, they generally don't: they die from purely unpredictable events instead.Well that's how surviving in a viking wasteland is, yes? That's how it should be!The trouble is that this is not FTL - a run is not 1-2 hours, it's 10, and it isn't replayable if you find yourself trapped with a now-useless team after luck decides to screw you. It's harsh, and adds to the tone of the game, but it's also ruinous. Save-scum, save-scum.Double-edged sword that may be, I can see the justification for it. What I can't justify, at all, is that the game essentially does nothing with it's random encounter system. Events pop up and you're faced with options. Based on my runthrough of the game, I'd say you get positive outcomes maybe a fifth of the time. Further adding to the harsh climate of the game, etc, etc... the trouble is, your options tend to lie in shades of grey between the -right- thing and the -wrong- thing to do in any given case... and THERE IS ZERO DIFFERENCE. They're all dice rolls, and that I started at a point of angelic service to my fellow survivors and slowly arced towards commiting horrible deeds for my tribe caused not one change. It was dice rolls all the way through; you get nothing in exchange for that guilt, and seeing what emotional impact it has on the player to decide, I'll murder this person in front of my (character's) daughter, when you take the plunge and hit that button ----> dice roll. The same dice roll. 80% of the time, it goes bad, and you feel worse.(On a lesser note, a gripe: this game totally does not have good animation, as nearly everyone is excited to share. It has a very cool art style, but central story beats aren't illustrated; they're all just text... including the climax.)I leave off with one thing. The final boss is very very poorly designed, requiring a combat style the rest of the game would punish (rushing in a straight line forward), and I didn't/couldn't finish with the team I had, and I now have no intention of continuing with this franchise. Cross your fingers. You might find the telepathy to make the right decisions, and the game might be fun!For me it was a lesson in negative reinforcement.			"

												I was very disappointed in this game.The GoodIt's beautiful. The animation and soundtrack are phenomenal. The combat is satisfying.The BadThe story is slow to start but by the time it gets interesting the game ends. The story is presented almost entirely through text and that text reads like a ""choose your own adventure novel"". This would be fine but the quality of writing is lacking and the way the text jumps between third person perspective and second person narrative is annoying. It's especially annoying because there are multiple points of view for a majority of the game.I'm an avid reader so I don't mind reading in my RPGs but I at least want some consistency.As for the main game mechanics it's a lot like a 2D Oregon Trail. The campaign consists of two stories following two player controlled caravans as they cross a map. Most of the choices given the player consist of:Do the smart but heartless thingDo the dumb but moral thingDo nothingThere will be other options but they either return you to previous ""options"" or are just variations on the same.The main game mechanics  consist of making dialogue choices and trying to keep your caravan of refugees alive by making the correct choices.The entire game is on rails so you don't actually change the story or make meaningful decisions (outside of combat), you just get rewarded or punished for the choices you make.SummaryAll in all the lack of real game content and lackluster story heavily detract from a beautiful game that could have been brilliant but just overall feels lacking. There's also nothing to do after the main story has concluded but play the game again. I would be okay with that if they story had been well written and the other game mechanics had been fun.If you're looking for a finished tactical RPG keep looking. This is apparently the first of three chapters but it's up in the air if those will be made, and as it is this is not a finished game. It ends abruptly just as the story becomes interesting, and no matter what you do, the ending is the same. The store page should be more reflective of the fact that this is not a single player version of Banner Saga Factions, but is in fact more like Oregon Trail, with some tactical combat tacked on. Or maybe it's the other way around, but either way it doesn't work.Updated Review on 1/16			"

Pros:- Unique and great looking art [+++]- Fun turn-based combat system [++]- Great underscoring [+]Cons:- The rewards/penalties for in-game decisions are inconsistent.  You can't play a ""good"" or ""bad"" character.  Help someone, get punished.  Hurt someone, get rewarded.  Or vice versa.  [---]- Short and somehow repetitive; about 9 hours for the first playthrough without much variety [--]- Story and gamplay are too linnear; not enough variety to warrant multiple playthroughs [--]ProCons:- The main narrative isn't as interesting as the world it passes through, which is terribly interesting [++-]- Voice acting is sparse, but good when present [+-]- There is almost as much (if not more) story than game, which would be a positive if the main narrative was better [+-]- Limited character progression system, but diverse character options [+-]- Initiative is interesting.  One character from the player team will go and then a character from AI team will go.  A character death will only reorder the initiative order of the team, not globably, until a team only has one character remaining.  Then the last character will have to face the entire team in succession.  This means that even if a team with two characters is grossly outnumbered, the outnumbered team is still moving every other character. [+--]Final Verdict:It is an interesting game and worth playing for the art and combat system.  But it isn't worth the $24.99 retail price.  You might feel you got more of your money's worth at $15 and below.			"

IntroductionThe Banner Saga is made up of three parts:(a) Dialogue & Role-playing -- You assume the roles of fixed characters and guide them through the story, in a choose-your-own-adventure style, albeit in a relatively linear way.(b) Traveling -- You manage a viking caravan that's almost always in peril, with enemies constantly on its heels.(c) Tactical turn-based combat -- You assemble your heroes (1-6 of them) and fight against various enemies on a grid-board. This part of the game is probably the one you'll spend more time with.The GoodThe first thing you've probably noticed about The Banner Saga is the uniquely beautiful graphic/visual style. Just look, if you haven't. What you can't actually ""experience"", unless you actually play the game, is the excellent bonding of the music with the visuals and the atmosphere it creates. That's also unique and powerful, worth another thumbs up. Now, lets get to the main course, the combat system. If you've played Factions, the free-to-play offspring release in March 2013, you know what I'm talking about. The combat mechanics are very sharp and allow for great simplicity and remarkable strategy depth, at the same time! It's the paragon of the ""easy to learn but hard to master"" type of game. Finally, the last merit I'm gonna give to the game is the marvelous lore and deeply detailed world they have created. It takes a lot off of the viking/Norse history, but it also blends-in many fantasy themes in a very successful way.The BadOK, enough with the good stuff. Lets see the bad ones. Actually, what hurts most about this game is its own extremely high potential. I mean, it offers so much potential that seeing it come short of that is enough to let you down. For me, the biggest problem about the game is that the final product feels a little rushed, kinda unfinished in the sense of consistency and balancing. There aren't big flaws in the core mechanics of the game, but it could use a lot more polishing. I'm gonna bring up some specific issues so that you understand what I mean:-- Caravan/Survival balancing issues : Sometimes the game feels too hard for its own sake. I mean, it's supposed to be hard, about survival and all, but at some points it just feels wrong and falls out of perspective. EDIT: This was addressed, to some extent, by the first patch. Chapter 6 is now kinda easier, but there's still no incentive to try to keep your clansmen alive, or have more join you...-- Language & Localizations: In my opinion, the language used is often too ""casual American"" styled, something that hits bad with respect to the viking theme of the world. Also, the quality of some localizations was sub-standard, according to native speakers.-- Inconsistencies and awkward ""story delivery"" : The game is all about a branching story line, where each choice you make has consequences. That's fine. Problem is that it feels like some story parts don't quite glue together, or the pacing of the story changes from Chapter to Chapter sometimes putting you off. That's more noticeable near the end of the game, where the pace dramatically picks up, and you are bombarded by a lot events all at once, that you barely have time to digest. Also, I could argue that the ending sequence, despite its emotional strength, is a little wanting in view of the climax that precedes it. Finally, it's quite evident that the game is just the first part of the proclaimed trilogy, so it leaves a lot of unanswered questions. It's not a cliffhanger per se, but close enough.My opinionTo conclude, I'm giving it the thumbs up because it's a beauty to behold and has four very strong components (visuals, music, battle system, theme/lore). Also, I believe that most of the problems I found can be easily addressed with patches without meaning that the game is ""bad"" in its release state. I'll say it once more -- The only thing that is not perfect about the game, is that it has the potential to be more than perfect! "

												One of the best games I've played in a long time. Three reasons stand out:First, the writing is superb. I recently finished Divinity: Original Sin, and have played all kinds of RPGs from the old Baldur's Gate titles to Morrowind to System Shock 2 and a lot in between. This game manages what few others do: create believable, interesting characters without walls of text. I like reading, but I don't like huge amounts of text that do little to further the story, character development or immersion. Even though I liked D:OS a lot, and the game had some great writing, a lot of the dialogue was just doing nothing to these ends. The density of little clues and nuances in the Banner Saga is astonishing, coupled with some humor and great attention to setting-appropriate terminology.Second, this might be the first game ever that managed to make me feel pressed. Generally, games I've played fall in two categories when it comes to time-crucial missions: either they don't enforce it at all mechanically, meaning that while the princess is being eaten by the bad guy I still have all the time I need to loot chests, talk to strangers and tend to my weapons. Or they implement some kind of timer - an option I hate with a passion because it feels so out-of-setting and forced. In the Banner Saga the whole setting screams 'hurry up' - and you do, by weighing the alternatives and choosing how much time to allocate to them. At least to me, it never feels artificial, or unfair, or like a difficulty-thing, it's just part of the story.Third, and fans of A Song of Ice and Fire will likely agree, the fact that beloved characters can die on a whim makes the whole cast and your decisions infinitely more interesting. I'm generally someone aiming for the best possible outcome in RPGs, including loading a save game when something turned out to be a bad decision. In the Banner Saga, for the first time ever perhaps, I did not feel annoyed by bad things happening to me. It's just 'damn... guess the next few hours just got a lot harder'.All in all a very, very good game, including the ending. Fights can get a bit repetitive since you only have one special ability per character, and some of those are frankly useless, but that's a minor gripe since the system is still well executed and challenging while staying fair. Maybe we should combine D:OS's combat system with the story and writing of the Banner Saga to create the perfect RPG.			"

												I've seen some mixed opinions about this game so I thought I'd give you mine.I'm at what I think is the last or one of the last battles in this game so I'm pretty far in.I noticed this game on the ""coming soon"" list some time ago and without hesitation I pre-ordered it. Why? Simply based on the artwork, turnbased combat and the setting of the game. And mostly, your decisions affect your journey! I played The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among us and I like to have some choice in the direction a story is heading.  Basically it's Vikings on the Run (would have been a good title as well, but not nearly as cool as The Banner Saga). You're fleeing from a ""robotic"" army called the Dredge. On your journey you meet people, villages and enemies. You meet a lot of those so you have to make a lot of decisions on how to approach each situation.For example: A Village you pass is under attack by Dredge. Will you help the villagers (chance of casualties or other surprises and possibly a cool reward), wil you sneak past (no casualties if you aren't discovered) or will you watch the fight (and later check out the village and maybe kill the remaining Dredge)? All decisions lead to a different situation, and they can not be taken back. Luckily there is no time limit on your decision so you can take your time to think it through. Whatever you choose, you never know what's going to happen. You might even lose main characters by ""bad"" decisions, and believe me, you WILL make bad decisions ;)So you're on the run with a rather large crew of Vikings: Warriors, women, old people, giants, kids... a whole community. Lot of people means a lot of problems. You're not only fighting the Dredge, there's a lot more happening. Intrigue, jealousy, betrayel, you name it. And they need food too, so you have to keep that in mind as well.Now the fighting part. You fight a lot in this game so don't underestimate it.It's turnbased and actually imo it's the worst part of the game. Once you find a tactic that works you can stick to that most of the game. There isnt much variation in fighters: you have your tanks, archers, warriors and a rare magician. All characters have different special skills, but you can finish most battles without thinking too hard which characters to use (simply those who have the highest skills). Oh, and each character can equip 1 special item to boost some stats. These special items can be found on your journey or bought at a town market.Your enemies are of the same type: big ones, small ones, magic ones and those that can do ranged attacks. Sounds basic? Yes it is. At this moment I've seen a lot of battles and they bore me.Conclusion:If youre looking for a Viking version of a good turnbased combat game this isnt for you. If youre looking for a RPG look further. If you want a fast game, tough luck. ""That's a lot of bad stuff you wrote, why did you give it a thumbs up?""Yes it has some major flaws but the story keeps me going, even though it's not even the best I've ever seen in a game. The graphics are beautiful. The amount of decisions you have to make is impressive. The soundtrack is good, nothing fancy. It's a game that makes me want more, which is impressive. I consider myself a bit spoiled and I'm not easily impressed by a game anymore. I play 1h -1.5h sessions almost every day (my gaming time is limited and my backlog is huge). I'm sure I'll finish this soon and I'm looking forward to the next part(s).			"

												After my Assassin's Creed binge last week, I took a bit of a break to wind down a tad. I started playing Banner Saga a few days ago however - I wasn't sure what to expect from it, the screenshots looked more like a point and click adventure, a genre which I normally don't enjoy as much - thankfully I was wrong.The Banner Saga is heavy role playing game where you face numerous scenarios throughout the story, each decision you make will impact the outcome and general feel of the game.The story goes extremely deep into Viking saga and history, which if you are interested in that sort of thing, this will already be a winner for you. The devs have done a very good job at making you feel you are part of the caravan and are right there in the midst of it all.The game does start out quite slow, but as you get past the first chapter, it picks up pace and you keep wanting more.The actual game play is a turn-based strategy basis. Again strategy is not normally one of my favorite genres but The Banner Saga does a very good job at introducing all the elements and features of the game at a slow but reasonable pace for you to get used to them.  By the end of the game you'll be able to blast through your turns without thinking at all, very simple (which is a good thing in my eyes).Graphic wise, the 2D art is beautiful. It looks as if every scene has been hand drawn. Length of the game is just right - a full playthrough for me took about seven and a half hours, and this was with picking up quite a few achievements along the way.I highly recommend The Banner Sage as it will be a welcome addition to your library if you give it a chance.More reviews at - http://completingthebacklog.blogspot.co.uk/ "

												This was a beautifully rendered tactical turn based RNG RPG with an engaging story and for the most part, stellar gameplay. The backdrop was visually stunning, and this was easily the games strongest feature. It really did a great job of not only creating a game setting, but also adding an air of mystery and intrigue and foreboding to the game.The combat itself was fairly simplistic as far as hex based battle systems go. The RNG aspect can create some frustrating moments, but can also conversely make you so stoked that you took a low percentage chance and succeeded.The RPG upgrading system likewise was fairly simple. As far as the writing goes, the story itself well complemented the artistic design of the game, or vice versa, lol, and the characters were pretty interesting in my opinion, overall. They weren't fully fleshed out, but I didnt feel they needed to be, and for what the game was presenting, I thought the whole thing worked quite well.So, based on all that, with the excellent story writing, the cool characters, the amazing set piece, and the decent combat, this game should really be one of the best. However, it had some very real issues that knock it down some.For one, as good as the writing was, realistically, none of your choices leading up to the finale really mattered, EXCEPT who you leveled up. Speaking of which, party members only level up through use, which I feel, based on the type of game it is, is something of a failure. I feel party members should level together in games like this, or at least, the unused ones should get some sort of experience. Otherwise, you end up woefully unprepared later when you are FORCED to use certain characters, arguably the ones that held the least appeal through the rest of the story as far as using them in battle went.So, like I say, your choices didnt really matter. You have to fight starvation and loss through battle based on your actions, which for the bulk of your group (the common soldiers, scouts, and peasants), basically affected the amount of survivors left when you get to the final city WHERE they all die anyway, lol. However, your party decisions definitely matter, and because you are forced to use certain characters later in the game, and one specifically for the final battle sequence (the daughter), you would be encouraged to use them EXCEPT, the game really doesn't hint at that. They are mostly the characters you will find least useful overall, and that coupled with a distinct lack of anything suggesting they might be important later, virtually guarantees that most players will face the same complications later in the game.So, this matters because the final battle is two stages and relies solely on the daughters archery skills to win. However, there was no real reason to level her up through the game, and I know that most players enter that final battle with an under leveled primary use character, which generally spells defeat. Now, it is my understanding that the developers listened to these same complaints from a large percentage of the people who played this just after release and made some adjustments, but I haven't played it since those patches were released, so I cant speak to whether they really helped out with these issues or not. My understanding was the patch release focused on the final battle, so that aspect might be better now.Anyway, I think overall, I want to give this game an 8 out of 10, but all the issues with it make me drop my rating down to about a 6.5 out of 10.I do intend to revisit this game and see how the patches impacted things, so I will revise this review if necessary after I do so. Regardless, it is a game worth experiencing, so I do in fact recommend it.			"

												The art is beautiful, the story compelling, and the mechanics are interesting. However, I feel like this game spawns really ugly  atritional environments. The out of combat gameplay revolves almost entirely around making choices. This kind of decision making is interesting and compelling in games like FTL or King of Dragon Pass. This is because the risks apparent in your choices are relatively apparent, and make a lot of sense. And the consequences are also appropriately weighted. But In Banner Saga, there's a disjoint between what choices you make and the consequences. You choose an option, and are greeted with a largely unknowble outcome, which is almost always overwhelmingly bad. Random, roadside events can easily kill off characters, or rob you of supplies. More often than not it feels like my reward is simply not dying. If that's what the developers were aiming for, I understand, and it matches the theme of the game, but its not fun.In combat there's a similar feeling. Character's damage output scales directly with their remaining health. A character who is still alive but with low health might aswell be dead. He'll do 1 damage, or miss alltogether. This means that characters who want to deal damage cant afford to take any damage, and character who tank do almost no damage. Its an interesting mechanic, but its not fun. It slows combat to a crawl since it takes relatively little effort to reduce the damage of your units to negligible amounts. Considering you are literally always facing more enemies than you have champions, this is crippling, and boring.Good Story, feels very game of thronesy. Beautiful Art, it looks like classic, rich disney animation. Crappy gameplay.			"

The Banner Saga is a turn based RPG set in an apocalyptic fantasy world being invaded by a host of armored giants dubbed ""The Dredge"". Stoic, the developers of The Banner Saga have recently released a sequel and have even released on mobile platforms due to its success on steam. The Banner saga is a singleplayer-only game with a story mode that has the interesting main mechanic of switching between two different points of view for the first half of the game. The Banner Saga contains 7 chapters and each thrilling chapter will keep you on edge for the entire time. Chapters are fairly lengthy, each ranging from an hour to two at most and for me I ended up finishing the game in about 10-11 hours on my first run through.

In the Banner saga there is two different phases in the game: Caravan phase and combat phase. When you're in your caravan phase you oversee your caravan as you try to head to your next destination. This is where you make almost all your choices and also where you will see the various resting points in the game. As the game progresses you find various different resting points where your caravan can take a break in places such as towns and villages or sometimes even near one of the holy godstones. While you're camped out at a resting point you can access your hero screen, your map, and you can even have chats with some of the characters in the caravan. In this phase your caravan slowly consumes supplies which can be bought at markets in some villages or even acquired through some choices. There are also different items for sale in the markets although most of them are very basic passives that don't really add that much to gameplay. The items really could benefit by giving you new skills or maybe skill point boosts but instead they're just rather bland passives. In order to buy anything though you need renown, the games currency. You acquire renown from killing people in combat, although I do believe there are some major decisions that grant renown. Renown can also be used to level up your characters for combat however I feel that most of the time these upgrades are too expensive and you end up being unable to buy items and supplies because of it. The caravan also has a morale system where, depending on the current morale level your characters may suffer a penalty in combat. ""As we pass steep cliffs, the sprawl of Boersgard comes into view. A city of contrasting rich and poor, opportunity and gamble. Our best hope for salvation, or our graves."" -RookThe combat phase is a pretty refreshing take on turn-based combat due to the willpower system. Willpower is a stat on your characters that, in combat, they can use to increase the damage of their attacks or allow them to use special abilities. In The Banner Saga there's two types of damage you can deal to enemies: Strength and Armor. Strength is the stat that determines how much damage you can do to an enemy, so if you attack an enemies strength then they'll do less damage. If you decide to attack the enemies armor however, then that will open them up and make them take extra strength damage from future attacks. It is absolutely critical to make sure you don't only attack health or armor but instead mix them up. I really dislike how the more damage dealt to your strength the less damage you deal because then the combat can devolve into who gets the first hit. Every character that you have can be upgraded, up to level five, for increasing amounts of renown and this is where, as I said, you end up sinking most of your renown. Every character has a class but they mean very little and the characters all follow the same archetype and some characters literally use the same model with a slight recolor. I wish that instead of having loads of characters that you could equip for combat you could have fewer combatants with more unique models and stories. Even with these flaws The Banner Saga still has a very unique take on a combat system that, in my opinion, has begun to get stale.When the Banner Falls

The story of the Banner Saga is also one of its strong points as it is both unique and easy to follow without letting the two detract from the plot. The story, without spoiling much, is essentially divided into two parts until about halfway through the game. The first part you play as Hakon, one of the co-commanders of a group of giant-like beings called varl. You're goal is to essentially escort a human prince to the varl capital of Grofheim so that you can seal an alliance between the two races. The other side of the campaign you play as Rook, a human father who is out hunting with his daughter, Alette, when they run into a dredge footsoldier and have to retreat back to their village. The chieftain of their village ends up being killed so Rook has to take command of the caravan and help them reach safety. With the counsel of the chieftains wife and some old friends, Rook sets out with the caravan in tow in the hopes of making it to the nearby city of Frostvellr. The story features a strong mechanic of choice, similar to Telltale's ""The Walking Dead"" series and this takes an already intriguing story and gives it all the emotional twists and turns that come with choice based storytelling. Most of the time the choices you make result in effects like getting or losing supplies or having morale changes but in some cases you can gain or lose characters. However, you can never really alter the story that much from a set line of main events for it to make a significant difference in the end but it's nice to have choices that actually feel like they effect gameplay. The story has so many mysterious elements that you cannot help but to keep playing just so you can find out the next little bit of character development or lore. TL;DRAn intriguing story of camaraderie in the face of ahnihilation that revives turn based combat and shows how important choice can be.If you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to join my Steam Curator Group at  Mudkips Gaming "

The Banner Saga PC Review Quick-View Substantiation/ Summation The Banner Saga has one of the most immersive strategy based storylines in a game to date. Unfortunately, it  is hard to see all the elements of the game's story without playing it in its entirety. However, here are the main ideas: We have a band of warriors and Vikings tasked with fighting a vile opposing faction called Dredd, heavily armored soldiers that have more strength and force. The Dredd come in a variety of sizes from small ( normal-sized, normal strength) to brutes ( the largest of the Dredd). We, on the other hand, control a cast of characters that are a mixture of warriors, Vikings, chieftains, and archers. Through the story, we are presented with a set of four different choices. All of these options impact our morale.      Ideally, we want high morale because it adds to our reputation when coming across travelers and people to help us fight against the Dredd. On the other hand, low morale will make us gain low rapport and a high level of distrust among people, preventing others from siding with our caravan, while, on the one hand, high morale boosts our accolades, authenticity and certified credentials as a leader. Normally, we have one person we control in these situations seen as the leader. Our first leadership opportunity occurs in Chapter 2 where Rook, the Father of  Alette, the daughter of Rook are traveling home when the Dredd overtake their land forcing all the inhabitants, men, women, children, clansman, and fighters out. Audience The Banner Saga fits a core niche audience and is not a game that was intended for a mass audience appeal. In the life of a Viking, you get to experience the lifestyle, religious aspects, and warring sides while you travel with your caravan; a band of people that consist of fighters, clansmen, and varl. Varl are giants that are Vikings and warriors, the human race which is weaker in the game and more vulnerable to strong attacks. The soundtrack score was produced by Austin Wintory, the same man that produced for us the soundtrack of both Journey, Flow, even, a more interesting soundtrack called the Spirit of the Cosmos.  The gods have died at the start of your trilogy on this journey of yours. The loss of gods are indicated at the beginning in which it states that some bad omen has shielded out the sunlight, now, producing snow during a unusual time of the year that now daily occurs as progression continues.      However, later on, in Chapter 2, you come across an interesting looking stone. This stone is fashioned after the god Hridvaldyr; offerings given to this god by travelers that pass through to pay their omens. The mythology of this god claimed that he transitioned into two forms, one human and the one, I would call a wolfman.Overall ScoresPresentation: 10/10- The graphics are a nice art style that I am at a loss for words in how to describe its immense beauty. When it does include voice-overs in the dialogue, it is well done while relying heavily on reading the text and selecting from four options of real-time choices which affect consequences, overall morale, and casualties. The title screen demonstrates carefully placed particle physics of trickling snow drifting by the display, slowly. The main menu has a user-interface that is comprised of hyperlinks that take you directly to the corresponding store page ( i.e. stats shortcut, rate app, share app and soundtrack purchase). Gameplay: 7/10- Gameplay is solidly reinforced by its grid-based system and movement allocation at the start of each battle that is set up as a game of chess, where the grid-based system is primarily movement based.Value: 10/10Replayability: 10/10 - Many choices are at your disposal as a leader, you are in charge of decisions made and who gets saved from those who do not.Niche Audience: 10/10 - The niche audience will be those that enjoy learning about other cultures and civilizations such as polytheistic based religion, Vikings and large-scale stories of the previous history of all of these people divided in chronological order through the use of chapters that unfold the story, but takes longer to progress.Story: 7/10-Although the story is robust and accounts for how these people lived in real-life during these times before technology, travel and innovations in computer technology were invented, it is slow to build up because its introduction is too long. Honestly, they should have begun with Chapter 2, since, this chapter is where it gets engaging, interesting and the first chapter in which you make the most decisions.Soundtrack: 9/10- I cannot complain at all in regards to the soundtrack. I have listened to Austin Wintory's work across many of his projects in which his use of instruments without vocals always creates a very soothing atmosphere and experience. The Banner Saga would not have been possible without it.Overall- 9/10Small Points ( Pros & Cons)Pros•Excellent use of vivid imagery to capture history, time dilation and lifestyle elements contributing to the setting.•Versus Evil used one of the best video game scoring artists, Austin Wintory to deliver a beautiful score.•Choices impact your decisions as a leader that has to make quick-based decisions, many so hard that others are either hurt or helped by your internal, external actions,convictions, and, rationality.•They went with real-time cutscenes; the cinematic opening is high quality as The Elder Scrolls Skyrim V.Cons•It serves a primary niche audience instead of a more mainstream, broad audienceVerdict-Overall - 9/10- A good solid role-playing, tactical based strategy game for all ages.Disclaimer     This review was written for Steamified.

												Few games keep my attention for more than an hour or two. I beat The Banner Saga in one sitting--which is no mean feat, as it took me nine hours to complete. It's a profoundly beautiful game, not simply from a graphical perspective (though it is one of the best-looking games I've ever played), but from a narrative perspective. I don't think I came across anything that I ever completely expected. The friends I lost and gained were unexpected. Some people lived when I thought they would have died. My losses were many, my victories few, but I soldiered on.Oh, yes, underneath it all, there's the tactical gameplay that's pretty interesting. I feel like it's lacking in something, though I couldn't tell you exactly what that is. And, y'know what? It locked up on me multiple times; I had to exit, restart, and load from the last save. It might be nice if I could manually save the game as well, but, hey, that's not really a big complaint, as the autosaving is fairly generous. The game's got a few grammatical errors in the dialog, mostly punctuation, but I think I spotted a few spelling problems as well.As an RPG, I'm not really sure how deep it is. I'm not sure if many of my choices had consequences. One choice led to fighting, but fighting is how you get renown, and renown lets you buy supplies for your people, as well as upgrade your units, so it's kindaBut y'know what?It's a beautiful game. I feel really... really different after having played it. It's an emotionally impactful experience. I'm a little bummed that it was only nine hours long, sure, but I also know this: I'll be replaying this game more than once, which is another feat I'm not prone to do. I'm not really a fan of turn-based games, but gameplay proved enjoyably compelling. The Banner Saga is a game I think everyone should play. It's a sad and heavy game in a wonderfully original take on the Viking mythos. I almost shed a tear at the end.This is a game worth buying.			"

												While the combat felt a bit repetitive toward the end of the game, I did greatly enjoy the story and the characters in this game. The Oregon Trail-esque choices that truly could mean instant death for your favorite characters is present, and makes each choice truly feel important. This is like the recent The Walking Dead game, except when you go back to play/read what the other outcome would have been, you realize your choice actually did matter.I'm not sure I would play through it again, but I absolutely recommend playing this game to completion at least once if you are a fan of RPGs, turn-based combat games, and/or isometric older games like Baldur's Gate or Fallout 1 or 2, mixed with some Oregon Trail.

												I had great expectations about this game and, to my surprise, The Banner Saga surpassed them all. It has a fantastic world building, a rich narrative, and marvelous art style. Soundtrack and gameplay mechanics are also adequately good.The choices present are relevant to the way you play the game (there's various ways to do it, since you can prioritize resources - don't let anyone die of starving -, focus on the combat and upgrade your warriors characteristics or gauge the overall caravan mood - by resting and making sure everyone is happy and etc) and can make you form a connection to the characters that is becoming rare on gaming these days.In my opinion, everything in this game was perfect or close to perfect, and if you either like choice driven stories, turn based games or beautiful pieces of art, you should pick this up and play it on the moment.➡️️Final Rating: 10/10			"

												A really great game. It's a turn based tactics set in some sort of Scandinavian myths setting. The story seems to be very well written and captivating from the start. But what is really stands out - is graphics. The artwork is astonishingly great. The colors, the details... all is just right and very pleasant to the eye. The overall quality of the game is surprisingly great (in our year and age of rushed releases).The combat system is also quite unique. Your units can attack armor or strength. If you're attacking strength, you deal damage to health and to enemy's ability to fight at the same time, but this attack will be mitigated by armor. If you're attacking armor, you're not doing any harm to unit's health or his ability to fight, but instead open it for a much stronger attack in the future. There's also an unique characteristic called Willpower. Units can use it to deliver stronger blows or to run further than normal. But it's a limited resource which can be replenished by resting (skipping turns). It's just 2 unique mechanics but they greatly enrich the tactics metagame.All in all this is a great buy for anyone who loves turn based strategies or wants to try them out.			"

												I did like this game, it is basically like Oregon Trail but instead of hunting mini-game there is a Tactics Turn Based Strategy mini-game.  The characters are interesting, the plot is easy to follow and enjoyable.  The music is unique, not my favorite personally but if you like old school chanting, this is definitely up your alley.  All that comes with some caveats though.  Firstly the game ran potato quality on my computer, which is a little embarrassing, my computer is getting fairly old but the graphics were also at 64bit levels so I have no idea why the framerate was so bad.  Secondly, this game will kick your ♥♥♥ a little bit because the difficulty does ramp up after about 10 hours but also because it feels like a long slog to try and get through.  This problem is magnified by the end which is even more depressing.  Thirdly, the combat because pretty stagnant pretty quickly without much difference in units and with you using the same strategies over and over.  I'm still not sold on the armor/strength system but is was at least unique as far as I know and did make you think a little differently than most other Turn Based Strategy games.  I won't lie to you though, I hated the turn order system they used which made me use strategies that would be stupid in any other TBS game.That got pretty negative pretty quickly so let me re-iterate, this is a good game, but it could have greatly improved from just a bit more polish.

The Banner Saga caught me by surprise.I did not hear of its [highly succesful] Kickstarter campaign, and only came to learn of its existence when it showed up on Steam's ""coming soon"" section.Obviously the first thing to draw my attention was the art style. As you can see from screenshots and trailers, it is clearly inspired by Walt Disney's works, and indeed it's absolutely gorgeous. Animation quality is great, too.The gameplay is really enjoyable. I'm not the biggest fan of turn-based combat, but The Banner Saga presents some interesting mechanics that make encounters with enemies feel like more complex chess matches.Where the game really shines, though, is in the ""caravan-management"" sections. You lead families and warriors for leagues across a beautiful land torn by war, making sure mouths are fed and morale stays high, facing dilemmas almost every step of the way. Every decision you make feels meaningful and impacts the world and characters around you.As the story approaches its climax, the atmosphere grows dire. At one point, I genuinely felt like I had painted myself into a corner, bad call after bad call. I despaired. That's a feeling few games can boast about being able to provoke.But for all its ruthlessness, The Banner Saga is not unfair. I persevered, and managed to complete the campaign. Finishing the game really felt like an accomplishment.And an accomplishment is what this first chapter of The Banner Saga is. A work of art. A masterpiece of our time.I stand in awe.			"

												Visuals A+Sound AGameplay CI absolutely loved the intro and the first few chapters.  The story was interesting and the characters compelling.  Unfortunately the turn based combat is uninspired and dare I say outright bad design.  This is a game I should have loved from top to bottom.  I love turn based games.  But the movement, lack of terrain and outright poor combat design principles just kill it dead.  Having your attack strenght directly tied to your hitpoints is one of the worst design ideas I have ever seen.  It completely eliminates any kind of come from behind strategy.  If you get behind in damage output you might as well restart the match because mathmatically you can't win.  Which brings me to the worst point.  Without any kind of cover or terrain the matches feel like math equations.  You put damage A+B against enemy C and your outcome is X.  Mid to late game you realize that spending renoun on anything other than upgrading your warriors is a complete waste of time.  Your people and troops are completely irrelevant and the later game enemies completely outclass your best warriors.  You will also extremely favor some warriors over other less useful characters to the point of completely ignoring them.  Since levelling is directly tied to defeating enemies there is no incentive to take less useful characters.Bottom line, I bought this game for $5 and Card Hunter for $0.  Other than the story, I get way more enjoyment out of playing Card Hunters during the turn based battles.  I find this game to be highly over rated.  Maybe because its an indi game a lot of people give it a pass.  I wont be getting the sequels.			"

												I debated back and forth on writing a review for this, since my overall and gut reactions to the game have been primarily negative. However, as I'm near the end of what I'm guessing is chapter 1 I'm finding my feelings of discontent to not be fleeting agitation due strictly to losing a battle.I kickstarted this game on the premise of creating an RPG with tactical elements similar to those presented in Final Fantasy Tactics. Furthermore, the creators promised a rich and immersive story. For the most part, I feel robbed.StoryI can't describe the story as anything other than incredibly boring. Perhaps I find myself easily disassociated because of the extensive use of the game's in-game terminology to which there is no real primer on. I am aware that this game has a wiki and fan base which has been following along throughout the entire design process, so it may be that none of the language is foreign to most folks.The story leaves much to be desired with regards to its presentation. Characters are presented and disappear without word for long stretches at a time. On the rare occasions you are able to talk with other heros, you don't learn much (if anything) about them. This issue is further aggravated by the notion that it seems that none of your selections in conversations seem to have any bearing whatsoever with regards to those you talk with. I get the impression that the designers read about games with character discussion choices like Dragon Age or Mass Effect, but never actually stopped to play them and figure out the appeal.Furthermore, the game lacks a practical method for the player to learn about the world or truly take upon the mantle of the main character. I felt so consistently detached from the main character that for a good 2 hours after starting the game, I was not at all clear who the hell 'I' was (apparently I was Hakon).These issues are further reinforced by virtue of the main character having no real control over the events happening around them. As your caravan progresses through the game, multiple story events will occur wherein you have to make choices with regards to what you'll do, who you'll help, etc. However, I never feel like I am making decisions, rather I'm just making guesses and not even educated ones at that. This matter is further frustrated by the game's autosave system, so there is no way to go back should I not like the results of my guess.GameplayMore and more games have taken it upon themselves to dispense with any sort of instruction manual and just rely upon teaching you how to play in-game. Banner Saga has also done this, however, they have only bothered to do so with regards to combat; which is really only half the game.I state this, because it was not really clear to me how scarce food and supplies might be until I was well into a situation where I lacked any. The in game currency/experience system is renown and as best I can tell you earn it by either guessing correctly for story events or killing enemies within the combat system. Overall, I cannot stress the lack of any explanation regarding the importance of balancing the need to train up warriors with the need to purchase supplies.With that in mind, the other aspect of gameplay I found extremely frustrating was the utter lack of a means for your party to forage for food. As a sort of larger scale Oregon Trail game, the notion that you cannot hunt or forage the lands you roam for food borders on a little hard to believe. The forced suspension of disbelief is only worsened by the fact that everyday I have warriors and clansmen dying from starvation as a trained woodsman leads these people through hills, forests, and dales all of which are apparently completely devoid of anything to sustain ourselves on. Apparently my people would rather starve to death than eat anything short of steak.I cannot help but demerit the game for this exclusion, doubly so when it lends itself so much towards having a hardline, realistic tone. Decisions (guesses) have permanent consequences where someone usually dies and you have no means to stop it at all. With that in mind, I can't believe the designers missed the opportunity to punish you for slowing your travel by having frequent attacks on your caravan and thus force you to choose between making continued forced marches and slow starvation or slow down to gather food and risk attack.The last thing which irks the crap out of me is betrayal by heros you have picked up. Not necessarily that it occurs (usually because I didn't guess what they want), but that after I put down said betrayal the items they had equipped are gone forever from my inventory. I'm guessing (because I'll be damned if I'm going to be allowed to know anything at all ever) we've all assumed the incredibly useful trinket strapped to Stabby McBackstab's wrist must be cursed as that's the only sensible reason for him to attack a group effectively three times his size.CombatCombat in the Banner Saga falls somewhere between interesting and boring. Your primary health stat is broken into a unit's armor and their strength. The former provides the opportunity to deflect attacks while the latter measures both your ability to deal damage as well your health. It makes a certain kind of sense, the more injured you are the harder it will be for you to hit harder.As combat systems go, it's interesting because of its focus upon realism. That said, it's still rather boring in its execution. There is minimal variability between attacks which succeed and those which fail. Characters require an item to be equipped in order to manage a critical hit or just get lucky and have an attack miss them. Perhaps for some folks this general lack of chance isn't an issue, but I found it rather infuriating especially because many battles included multiple enemies whose strength was well above my most heavily armored characters.Furthermore, the combat system is deficient in many other ways. There is no bonus for flanking, no bonus for having superior numbers (in several situations your greater numbers can put you at a notable disadvantage), no means to delay a character's turn until the situation is more conducive to their abilities, and I'm sure I'm missing at least one more. Again, the exclusion of these standard tropes for tactical combat are a pretty glaring oversight; much of the combat system feels like a good idea that was only halfway thought through.One last complaint for the combat system is the fact that you cannot rotate the map to get a better view. The map has one isometric angle to look at things with, hope it shows what you need to see because that's all you're getting.SummaryI initially thought I was just being a whiny little ♥♥♥♥♥ about a game that was hard, but I think it's much more than that. The Stoic crew had an interesting idea for a game. Unfortunately, what they made was a game, not a good game nor a great one.Multiple game site reviews have lauded the Banner Saga with plenty of accolades citing its originality; but I feel where this game succeeeded in originality it fell far short on completing its thought.

												Definitely have mixed feelings about this, because while The Banner Saga is a game with great art, great music and an interesting concept, it falls short in immersing players into its world. I would love to recommend the game on the basis of the beautiful drawings and epic music, but it's been really disappointing to see that this game isn't what they marketed it to be.The game promises that every decision will have a ""meaningful effect on the outcome as your story unfolds"" and that ""the journey is as important as battle"", but players aren't even given the option to choose where to go and the micro-management of the caravan doesn't really affect how the story ends. Although there's a possibility of gaining, keeping or losing supplies and units during random encounters on your journey, the only thing that really matters is keeping your main team alive. Losing units doesn't mean anything.The game isn't too long but has players going in between different caravans with different characters in each one of them. This isn't too great because after spending time with one caravan and just starting to become emotionally invested in their plight, they abruptly shift you over to another where you have to familiarize yourself with a whole new set of names and faces. It might have been nice if they stuck to one caravan throughout this first episode of the trilogy, so we could've seen more character development and become more attached to the world.Battle mechanics are interesting but the fights can be tedious and repetitive because of the limited diversity of foes. Some battles can be challenging in a good way but most of the time, it felt like a ""rinse and repeat"" kind of affair. There are also weird spikes in difficulty from time to time, and the final fight arrived quite abruptly in a ""that's it?"" kind of way.If you're interested in looking at the beautifully detailed drawings and can appreciate epic music, the game would be worth getting when it's on sale. However, as the game stands currently, If you're expecting more from the gameplay and story, then this is hard to recommend. I hope the next part will fair better.			"

												I've been postponing to play The Banner Saga for a long time. When the game was released on iOS, I suddenly realized I didn't even start my pc game yet. That evening I sat down and played for several hours straight. Now, 18 hours along the way I just finished The Banner Saga on Normal difficulty for the very first time,I'm not the type of gamer to play a game again in order to get all achievements, but I did check which ones I earned and which ones I did not get. As it turns out, there are many story branches based on the choices one makes. Characters can survive through out to story or die during battle. I love the background of this game. Vikings are cool. By adding some kind of Super Viking (Varl) the studio has created a big divirsity in the characters one can use during the game. I will not spoil anything, but don't get too attached to your characters... they might die. The combat is tactical. Take your time is make a move, look at the movement range of your enemies and make sure you double check for example the reach of your archers. It happened to me more than once that my archers was one block short to reach its target... That's just waste of a turn and might result in you losing the battle. During a battle characters can die. But you can't know in advance whether they are just ""passed out"" or they will be actually removed from the game and story. Between the turn based battles there are lots of conversations in which you get to make choices. It's not always clear what the results of your choices will be. The most confusing thing in The Banner Saga is that you can be travelling without food and still thieves can steal food or Varls can drink beer because we passed some religious statue. Overall The Banner Saga is one of the highlights in my recent gaming years. It left me wanting for more. I've got the same feeling I got when I played The Walking Dead by Telltale for the very first time. Game studio Stoic has developed a very nice and enjoyable game with a touching story. No tears, but in the end you can't help but wonder whether the ending is just the ending of the story or the result of your actions.I've decided I'm not going to find out. This is it. My story is over and now I'm waiting for the second chapter.			"

												Once you begin this winding and perilous journey you almost want it to never end.  The Banner Saga has one of the best stories of any game.  You really get absorbed into the characters and the plot line.  The graphics are gorgeous.  The turnbased combat is simple and easy to learn, though it does require some strategy and forthought.  This is a great game that all can play and enjoy.			"

												The Banner Saga tells the story of a band of warriors, leading a caravan of soldiers and refugees over the countryside to escape the encroaching hordes of monsters known as Dredge.The game is a cross between a point and click adventure and a tactical RPG. There is a text-heavy story, with frequent choices to make that can have drastic effects on your progress. The choices you make during the events that unfold on the journey determine everything from loss/gain of supplies, to the deaths of certain characters.Your caravan will consume supplies and lose morale as it travels. The ""currency"" of the game, ""renown"" is gained from successful battles and from choices that have great impact. Renown can be spent on supplies or items at town markets, or on boosting the stats of your characters. You will likely find balacing your purchases extremely difficult, as renown is not so abundant.The main attraction to the game is the combat. You choose 6 warriors to take to battle, each with their own unique abilities. They can also be customised by choosing skill points for their stats when the gain a level, as well as equip them with items that provide buffs and other effects.The warriors move around on a tile grid. Moving a melee attacker adjacent to an enemy will allow you to attack. You can choose to do direct damage to their health (which also doubles as their strength stat), or deal damage to their armor which makes it easier to do more damage to their health. Your strength - their armor = damage done.There are two races in the game, Humans and giants called Varl. On the battle grid, the humans take the space of a single tile while Varl take up 4. This means you have to think carefully about positions, as units cannot pass through each other and grouping them close together may mean a character is simply stuck and wastes a turn. Additionally, you will also want to make sure your weaker units, specifically those with ranged attacks, are kept safe by placing them behind tougher characters such as the Varl Shieldbanger.Combat is satisfying, yet tough. You may find you become too weak to win battles while they keep getting harder throughout the game, it would be likely you need to replay the game so you know better what to expect. It is also a shame that units have no strengths or weaknesses against specific types of enemy units, and also that the unique abilities of each character are very situational and won't get used very often.The presentation of that game is fantastic, it is a visual marvel with finely animated characters, gorgeous scenery and a pleasing artistic aesthetic. There isn't much music to be found, but what little there is usually fits the scenario perfectly and adds to the atmosphere and scale of the world you traverse.Without spoiling anything, the storyline is a little on the weak side. None of the characters are particularly memorable. One of them had actually died off earlier in the game and I hadn't noticed until much later. Too much of the dialog is filler and a lot of the interesting parts don't lead anywhere and are never mentioned again.As a complete package, this is a gorgeous looking title with a lengthy campaign and addictive turn-based strategy gameplay. Veterans of this genre will find enough content to chew on and newcomers will appreciate the easy-to-understand mechanics and hands-on tutorials. "

												The Banner Saga is a strategy RPG with a viking fantasy setting developed by Stoic and published by Versus Evil.Narrative:The Good - The Banner Saga has an amazingly well detailed and rich universe. There is a whole map created for the game that gives an insane amount of lore about the world. The story itself is much better than most fantasy stories. Rather than going for the clichè ""save the princess"" or ""find the sword"", The Banner Saga instead is about the journey of clans across their continent in search of safety and it is very well done. The main characters are incredibly vibrant and interesting from the stoic (ha ha), grim, and stern Iver to the innocent and forgiving Alette. I became heavily invested with many of the characters and actually cared about what happened to most of them. The Banner Saga also has branching paths. I looked back over the course of my journey and wondered how I could have changed things. The dialogue is also quite heartfelt and believable so that certainly helps add to the immersion.The Bad - Let's get the big one out of the way. The game does not pace itself well at points. There are points where it completely rushes through areas that could have been expanded on considerably. The ending is also one of the most rushed I've seen in quite awhile. The final moments are just sped through with absolutely no slowing down to emphasize the impact of the results. Also, many characters that seem like they could have been focused on more get little to no screen time and some that seem incredibly important just up and screw off. The game also doesn't wrap everything up and leaves some loose ends. The game has so much potential and would've hit every note if it had slowed down and taken awhile to let the story's outcomes settle in and open up more about characters and areas.Score - 8/10Graphics:The Good - This game is gorgeous. Every area of the game is brimming with little details that make it just a little bit more immersive. The hand drawn art style is perfectly done and should be applauded. The game runs smoothly for most of the time and has a beautful color palette that fits very well. One of my favourite art styles.The Bad - While travelling across the continent there is occasional hitching. Nothing horrible but certainly noticable.Score - 9.5/10Sound:The Good - The music is beautiful. This game has one of the most fitting soundtracks I've heard in a long time. It's incredibly somber during heartfelt scenes and tense and fast-paced in battles. The voice acting is done extremely well and the sound effects are crisp and perfect.The Bad - I feel like there could've been more narration and it would've added to the experience. There was barely any.Score - 9/10Gameplay:The Good - The game follows some of the basic SRPG mechanics and discards others while adding in some new ones that I feel mostly benefit the game. To start, the rock-paper-scissors style combat that usually shows up has been completely removed and replaced with Willpower, Armor, and Strength. These three mechanics work VERY well together and help give the game its own gameplay style. Strength is your health, however it is also your damage so when your health goes down, so does your damage. This might seem frustrating but actually works quite well and results in a lot more thought being put into moves as placing your party in a vulnerable position may result in future losses. The Armor affects how much damage can be done to someone. High armor means it is very hard to get a meaningful hit in and so it also has to be taken into consideration adding even more complications. The game, however, never becomes overly complicated and manages to still be easy to understand, yet incredibly hard to master. As for Willpower, this is probably one of the best features. Willpower allows you to do more than you can normally do. It allows people to move further, hit harder, or use their special attacks. This is great as you can use it as a way to get out of a place you don't want to be in or take that last bit of health out of an enemy. The party management is also interesting. If a party falls in battle, rather than dying, they are injured and have a Strength penalty until they rest enough. This means you'll have to rest and waste supplies, causing your clan's morale to drop, causing a loss of Willpower in battle. It puts some extra pressure on during non-combat segments. Wars also happen throughout the game and allow for several different options for handling battles giving a sense of freedom. The difficulty is also perfect. The game never becomes too overwhelming, yet always offers a challenge. Tactical, patient players will be rewarded while people who rush to kill someone will usually be shut down. Finally, Renown. Renown is the in-game currency and is used to purchase supplies and combat items. Renown is also used to upgrade characters so it becomes quite a problem for youself when you don't have enough to both get a crucial upgrade for a charcter and that really enticing piece of equipment. Overall, the gameplay has some amazing mechanics at work and can certainly hold a candle to other SRPGs.The Bad - First, the game does not explain the consequences of clan deaths at all and there doesn't seem to be any so that mechanic is dead in the water. As for combat, the game becomes repetitive sometimes. Not many different enemies are thrown at you and so it may become a bit tedious at points. The final battle was also obnoxious as my characters were randomly getting stunned at random times and there was nothing I could do about it, prolonging the battle and irritating me. There is also almost no customization for characters. There aren't many different ways to build characters and usually your party is already decided due to low character counts at points. You can't choose their weapon and upgrading usually is quite straight forward. On top of this, many of the special attacks were (in my opinion) very underwhelming and ignorable. Score - 8/10Longevity and Replayability:The Good - My first playthrough lasted around 11-12 hours. I still feel like there is a lot I could've changed and seems like enough incentive to go back and try again. There are also a considerable number of acheivements if that's what you're in to.The Bad - Again, the game rushes through its story quite a bit.Score - 8.5/10Final Score: The Banner Saga is flawed. Greatly. But there is so much good here that I really do have to commend it for its efforts. It certainly isn't perfect, but it has enough good in it that I can recommend it at full price, easily. If you enjoy SRPGs, fantasy settings, or beautiful looking games, then look no further than the Banner Saga.8.6/10 = Very Good			"

												While the story borrows some really fantastic concepts from Norse mythology and starts with a bang, you're promised a Saga and receive a segment. There is no finality to this game, and you're ultimately left with an extremely shallow version of Final Fantasy Tactics with units who max at level five and some beautiful locations / characters who are left hopelessly vague. I bought this game when it went down to $15 after being released from like $30, and it was by far the worst decision I had made during any Steam Sale. I can say that as somebody who hasn't bought into too many Early Access titles. Download a background or two, watch a video on YouTube, just don't make the same mistake I did.EDIT: Some nice brony just pointed out my review is bull and they have a sequel coming later in the year. Great idea, spend another $30 to walk characters over more backgrounds. Even more of a downvote than I previously had.EDIT #2: Hey look, the second game is out and even worse than this one in many ways. LOL GO GO FANBOI FEVER			"

												This is why we love games over most other medias people. The story. As you play two different clans that struggle to survive the multiple onslaughts of an unstoppable army of beings known as the Dredge, a world consuming worm that shatters the land, and desperate highwaymen. You must make calculated, difficult and terrible choices to keep your tribe intact from these unrelenting threats. In the turn based combat you must anticipate your adversary's move and force them to react to your's.The combined animation and music elements evokes emotions that root you in the moment. The characters ARE the story. Each person has the power to save the day or bring everyone to ruin. Your choices are what make the story. You cannot save a game at certain point, make an undesirable choice and rehash it. It's just like it should be, YOU must OWN your decicions.			"

												For what it promises, it doesnt deliver. The battles are fun and certainly challenging at the higher levels. However, the game in my opinion inadequately makes use of a lot of the 'extra' stuff (the number of people in your party, the management of supplies and morale, and even the map are all just extraneous). You can go through the game without caring about supplies at all or by carefully managing the size of your group, and it doesn't matter; the only thing that matters is that you have leveled up enough for the final boss.The 'decisions' you make seem to have little impact on the actual gameplay other than what characters you have at the end, and zero impact on the end of the game. Zero. You might as well read a short story and have battles in the middle of it.I have read this is meant to be a trilogy and maybe these 'decisions' will mean something in a sequel, but for an opener, the game leaves WAY to much story on the table unanswered. I did not feel like I had come to a closing point in the game when the credits rolled, I felt like I had completed the first chapter of a standalone game, and was mildly annoyed (Imagine playing Final Fantasy Seven, and after you escaped Midgar, the game was over).

'What's the Deal' with The Banner Saga?It pains me to give this game a thumbs down, because it's clear that a lot of love went into creating it. The Banner Saga finds a ragged group of humans and giants fleeing from a world-consuming scourge. As the leader of this caravan, you are presented with choices that will determine your people's survival. You get to decide the course of action, from when to fight to how to adjudicate petty squabbles. And here is where the one of the game's major flaws comes sharply into focus: You're routinely asked to make these decisions without enough information, and some of the choices you are presented are not choices at all. For instance, in one portion of the game, I was asked whether I wanted to take my caravan the longer, safer route or try to make it through a dangerous shortcut. Realizing we were low on supplies, I knew we would run out of food if we went the longer way, so we drew our swords and attempted to fight our way though. After some combat and attempts by the game to dissuade me from taking the shortcut, it eventually just perma-deathed a party member I'd been leveling and told me I could not go that way because it was too dangerous. I didn't lose the battles; I was just forced to take the other option. It reminded me of the old choose-your-own-adventure books, where the choice presented might be to go left or right down a path, and the next thing you know you're killed by aliens that came out of nowhere. The player is deprived of any way to gauge risk and reward, and left to just picking something and hoping for the best.On the positive side, the artists have done a beautiful job, creating intricate visuals and animation that evoke the frozen Viking -inspired world in which the game takes place. The sense of immersion is further heightened by Austin Wintory's music, which serves as a perfect accompaniment as your lost group treks across the bleak, snow-covered plains and jagged mountains (go check it out on Spotify). But then there's the writing. Oh, the writing. It completely shatters the world the game struggled so hard to create. Watching hardened Norsemen saying modern phrases like ""We got screwed in the great wars,"" ""What's the deal with him?"" and ""You have to put up with my crap a little longer"" serves as a constant reminder, that no, you are not the leader of a group wandering refugees in the frozen north, you're sitting at your computer playing a game.If you're looking for a similar experience that includes turn-based combat, RPG elements and decision-making, while immersing you in the game's world, ""Expeditions: Conquistador"" is a far better game.

												I bought the Deluxe pack and I muıst say, that this game is lesser than I've expected. Don't get me wrong, It's good stuff you will play. Yet, there are some issues I need to tell.1. The game is largely story driven:The wonderful game map may give you a misconception, that you can travel to any area. Sadly, your route is predefined.2. Most of the character abilities are useless and some items are over powered:For instance, give Alette the +3 Armor breaking item and you will see it's much better than her special ability. Somewhat broken if you ask me. The spearmaster's impale ability is mostly useless except of the projectile enemies that flee after each damage they take. Another item gives you a knockback ability with 4+ strength damage. LIKE A BOSS!!!3. This game has a main character:The way that the game was presented, you may assume that Rook is just a kindle of the events and you will be very flexible on each decision making process or character addition. It gave me an idea that if other people play the same game, we might have entire different outcomes. (Someone, who decides to go on with the lead of Ekkill, Eirik, Hakon etc. find entirely different paths in the story was what I have expected.) Characters like Ubin and Ludin have rarely a weight at the story.4. Next episode:Within the game, you see a lot of additional material that reveals a centaur race, and you know that there would be much more to explore. The game just came out as the first episode of what is bound to come afterwards. But, I'm still waiting for sequels, DLC storylines etc... I begin to suspect that this will not happen.FINAL VERDICT: Buy it if it's on sale!			"

												This is not a really fun game. Some of that is by design: you are trying to survive and take care of your people against overwhelming odds, making tough decisions one after another. The dread that your characters feel gets to you.Sadly, its too much. After being blindsided by some terrible consequences (some from decisions made 45 minutes into the game; others product of a lot of walking around without being able to judge distances/food), you start to feel the game is a chore. For me it was a chore to get to the finish line. Once again, some of that is intentional, but if the game doesn't leave you with a good taste in your mouth, its because it went too far.Obviously that is a very personal issue with the game; a more general issue will be its combat system. I love turn-based games, but some decisions made here opened the combat to be way too exploitable.The rest of The Banner Saga goes from average (the lore ""borrows"" from new places, but is not unique enough) to very good (the ilustrations are amazing, although way too stiff during dialogues).This has been an enjoyable experience for many (rating ""very positive"" no?), supporting the developers decisions for some of the choices made here. Sadly, I cannot agree with them enough to give it a thumbs up.			"

												The Banner Saga is a charming little tactical RPG with a good story and some interesting decisions. It's set in an idealized Viking-ish world, where humans and varl (read: giants) coexist, more or less, and occasionally unite to fight off the dredge - a race of poorly-motivated Bad Guys. The game excels at its aesthetic - the setting, the characters (though not the writing), and the art and music are all quite good. Those elements serve to create a feel for the game and, while I may be critical of some of the actual gameplay elements, it's important to note that those gameplay elements are ultimately servants of the general aesthetic the game is going for, and in that capacity, they serve it well. The game does a really good job of creating an interesting, well-put-together setting and aesthetic, and of arranging game components (of which there are a few) to support that goal. The game components are:Combat. It takes place on orthogonal tiles where you control different characters (up to six) and try to beat up your opposition. Characters have strength, which counts as both hit points and damage dealt. When you get hurt, you also do less damage, as your strength goes down. Characters also have armour, which is directly subtracted from any damage taken. Armour can be difficult to remove and is often high enough that you have to spend a little time getting rid of the stuff before you can really lay into your opponent. Characters have a special ability, and they have some extra (limited) 'willpower' points they can add to specific actions to move faster and hit harder. Also, the combat has this weird thing where, as long as there's more than one person per side, each side alternates taking actions. So even if you have three people and the computer has nine (or vice versa), you still get to act as often as your opponent - with the result that if you have fewer people, they will get to act more often overall. Consequently, contrary to most games of its type, I felt the best strategy was to weaken without killing my opponents in order to make them useless, thereby wasting my opponent's turns. It seems better, in some respects, to have a few good characters than a bunch of crappy ones. The game makes when to kill vs. when to wound an interesting tactical decision.The combat's good enough for what it is. Generally, I enjoyed it. I felt to really excel at it (rather than just win on normal), a player would have to math it out a little to be able to optimize special abilities (some of which are just crazy if used right) and to avoid damage at key moments. That's not me. I like to run intuitively on my tactical RPGs, so while I had no real problems, I also recognize I'm not playing the game on hard any time soon.Resource management and strategic decision making. You spend a lot of time watching your caravan move across frozen tundra being chased by the dredge, and running out of food. Running out of food is bad, as members of your caravan leave (or die off, I guess) and your moral drops, making tactical combat harder. Tactical combat gains you renown, which you can use to level up your characters to make them better fighters, or to buy food (or to buy artifacts, but that's the worst use of it, I think). Your caravan contains fighters, varl, and clansmen, and occasionally you'll use the fighters and varl to conduct a large-scale combat that is handled off-screen while you handle a typical tactical combat using your heroes. If people starve, you'll run out of fighters and varl, which I guess would be bad? I don't know. Never seen it happen. The whole large-scale 'strategic' game doesn't really seem to do much.Interactive story events. You are given a situation, you make choices, and then things happen. It's not always clear why the things that happen happen, and sometimes those things are really bad, but not something you could've anticipated. I had to reload a couple times because I'd made a choice that saw me lose a few key heroes, and I didn't know that would happen. Good (/lucky) choices can gain you renown, same as in battle. Choices that gain renown are, I found, much easier to anticipate than other choices, and don't seem as arbitrary. It's better than it sounds - while the choices you make are annoyingly opaque, I think they're supposed to be so. Bad things are supposed to happen, and you're supposed to pick up the pieces. In all cases, that's much of the game - the characters you control are people who are watching things go south awfully quickly. Making choices where you don't know what's going to happen, and often what happens is bad, is pretty consistent with the game as a whole.Generally, the game was quite good. It won't be for everyone. But I think those who appreciate it will really enjoy it. "

												The Banner Saga is definitely in the top tier of games that have been Kickstarted. It has a very deep, involved plot from multiple perspectives and is filled with surprising revelations and heart-wrenching endings.The graphics are a refreshing departure from the norm. The conversation scenes are reminiscent of Fire Emblem's static conversation scenes, while the travel and cut scenes are truly beautiful. The animations during battle are enjoyable to watch, as your character pulls off such a powerful hit and damages nearby enemies as well, or when your archer nails an enemy from across the map after their careful aiming.The music in this game is just beyond words. Austin Wintory does an exceptional job on the soundtrack. The audio cues seem to hit at just the right moment to strike a chord of fear into you, or even to set the mood for celebration or sorrow. It's not often that the audio of a game ends up being my favorite part, but The Banner Saga really delivered.The story is very involved and changes based on the decisions you make as you go along. This means that I'll be completing several more playthroughs before I'm done with the game. The choices can really reward you, or even end up in a death if you're not careful. I haven't gotten more involved in the wellbeing of a game's characters in quite some time, though in this game I find myself desperately trying to make the best choices so they can be happy, or even survive!The combat, though it lacks variation, reminds me a bit of chess. It would benefit greatly from anything that could introduce deviation from the repetitive battles (though some specific battles can be exciting and different). My favorite point of the difficulties though, is that if you choose to play on Easy mode, you can play through the entire story without having to worry about battles, as some can be even skipped! If you choose to play on Hard mode, it is ACTUALLY a challenge. This is a nice change from ""hard"" modes on games lately not actually challenging their users.This game is worth the full price, and more. I look forward to any sequels that come out from Stoic.

												Unfortunately this game in incomplete and sold as such.  Supposedly it's meant to be part of a trilogy, but what is available here for purchase is far from a finished product.  After a mere 14 hours of gameplay I have finished the game.  There is some minor replayability due to the nature of the branching story paths, but really only two ultimate outcomes.  If you can find it available for a few dollars it may be worthwhile, but anything over $5 is too much and the actual retail price is absolutely absurd.The story is interesting, but the characters are not fleshed out enough.  As an incomplete game, much of the story is never resolved or even explained.  I enjoyed the art and fact that most of my choices seemed to have repercussions.  However, the ending really came out of nowhere, as it felt more like I beat a mini boss, rather than an end boss.  Indeed, the game's supposed ""end boss"" isn't even introduced until near the end of the game, and the game spends very little time building the boss up to something substantial.  In fact, the end boss' actions are never espoused upon at all, it simply exists to move the plot forward, like some broken macguffin.  Worse than the broken story and ending of the game is the fact that the actual battles feel very unfinished too.  The fights you encounter are rather simple, which made the game easy to pick up.  On the other hand, as you play through the game the fights never really get any more difficult, and hardly change at all.  In fact, there are only a handful of enemy types you encounter, and their type hardly makes an impact upon the combat system at all.  I can literally count on two hands the different types of enemies one encounters in this game, and even then some are simply the same type, but with a different skin.  That is, there are human archers and monster projectile throwers, human swordsman and monster swordsman, etc.  Having the same encounters again and again just feels incredibly stale after about 1 hour.If there were a greater amount of variety of enemies in The Banner Saga, a more interesting combat system, and all three chapters had been released as one, complete game, than I would give this a very positive review.  As it stands the game is boring and unfinished, so I can't possibly recommend it.			"

												I bought this game several months after its release, heard a lot of positive reviews and decided to try it on my own.Banner Saga is a fantastic game in my opinion. I finished it three times, taking different decisions during the playthroughs just to see all the consequences they could have (and had!). I liked the setting very much, the epic viking saga of last stand of both humans and giants against a merciless invader horde. Heroes and their personalities are quite memorable, I enjoyed every bit of dialogue. The system of somewhat random events in-between your main battles is not new, we could see the same in Fasterthanlight, but it does surprisingly good here.Tactical battles mechanic is interesting, exploring various character options while advancing their level and unlocking new abilities gives some hidden depth to the game.The visual part is awesome, plain awesome. The same could be said of 100% fitting soundtrack, the melodies create just the right mood for the game events flow.I cannot say this is a game for everyone, but if you enjoy tactical battles and storytelling you'll likely fall in love with this game. To me it's nothing but a masterpiece.Looking forward to the sequel.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. The combat isn't bad (though it's not inspired either -- the lack of terrain features combined with the suicidal ""gank the weak ones"" AI combine to make it all feel very gamey) but the story is just not interesting.If you're going to go with the whole ""the world is doomed"" plot line you have to give me a reason to care about this world. However, all the characters felt flat and uninteresting, and with a few exceptions they were just variations on the 'generically ok person' template. The visual design was not very interesting -- everything looks like a 70s cartoon and all the characters basically wear the same outfits. Also, the game occasionally ambushes you with choices the ramifications of which are not really possible to understand at the time. This is a big narrative mistake; it's not really clever writing to ""trick"" the player into making a bad choice when there's no way to understand what the choice actually is. Actually gripping choices in a game come from making a hard choice between two equally good (or bad) outcomes, not from simply trying to pull a gotcha on players.There are lots of VERY good RPGs out there. There's no reason to waste your time with one like this unless you're really desperate for something to do.			"

												How often would you do take a wrong turn in a game and then load to get it just right? The big difference between a really good and an average game is that you live up to your decisions.You never wanted neither planned to be a leader, but here you are, people depending on you, enemies around you, food hopefully long enough to sustain you, every day facing a new problem. You would sometimes screw up, get someone killed, but you move on and take responsibility for your actions. The game is so immersive it doesn't even come to mind to save-load and change it.Banner Saga is a beautiful interactive novel / oregon trail mix with clever and dynamic tactical fights. It features a mysterious doomed Norse mythology based world and a rich story told from different viewpoints.			"

												This was a good game. I liked that it had good art and story, but it was a lot of reading. There is very little animation. Most images are still art that you pan across. I was expecting it to talk like the telltale games, but it doesn’t. There are a few speaking narrative parts so expect to read a lot and don’t try and skip the text or you won’t know how to respond to conversations. The fighting part of the game was fun, but could have been better. I'll probably pass on the sequel unless a good sale comes along. Overall I give it a 80/100			"

												The Banner Saga is a shiny red apple that looks delicious until you really bite into it and find it worm infested.  The art and music are very well done and bring a sure charm to the game that seems to have bedazzled a lot of reviewers.  My issues with the game didn't become aparent until well into it (more than a few hours).  The only important resource in the game is ""renown"", which you use to either level up your characters or to buy supplies so your ""caravan"" can eat.  There is so little renown in the game you generally have to choose to do either/or of these activities.  As a result you can either feed your people as a kind leader would and end up losing a lot of battles with a stagnant squad of low level guys or you can ignore your people, allow them to starve and die off, and level your squad of fighters to win battles.  Despite the fact that one of your two leaders you control has the occupation of ""master hunter"" there is no hunting in the game.  No way to procure food except for the occassional scripted even with a ""King of Dragon Pass"" choose your own adventure chance to get precious supplies.  It makes for a frustrating experience.  Perhaps the point is the force the player into being cold and heartless much the same way Fable 3 did.  That experience ended up being sub optimal as well.  For $30+ I wish there was more of a game here to go with the fantasy story.  It just as easily could have been an excellent interactive novel on an iPad.  Instead of playing to the strengths, the game is shackled like a mewing beast to lame ""Oregon Trail"" gameplay and a somewhat counter intuitive basic turn based tactical combat system.  There are D&D Goldbox games available online that were made twenty years ago with far more tactical depth than what this 2014 game offers.  On the upside, the game looks great (even on a Mac without a dedicated graphics card).  The music is decent if not a bit overly dramatic.  The characters are mostly interesting.  I haven't finished it.  I'm probably a little more than halfway.  Sadly, there are too many worms for me to finish this deceptive looking fruit.			"

												For all you guys who are hoping for a gameplay - Banner Saga is not for you. If you like playing visual novels - this game is not for you also, the story is really poor. Get some time of your own and read a book.To start with. I have had great hopes for this very game. The videos and screenshots looked impressive. The graphics and music definitely made my decision on the purchase.Once I hit the 10 hours mark of being in game it come clear that this is nothing of what I was hoping for.I will just quote some of the description given.>Live through an epic role-playing Viking sagaThere is nothing epic except the plot. Interesting game universe, poor storytelling, poor characters.There is nothing of role paying considering the 'role playing' as interaction with the world and making decisions important for the outcome of an event. You are given a set number of characters that will act as they have been set to, no more. You are being told the story, so sit up and listen - that's how it goes.>...where your strategic choices directly affect your personal journey. Let's be clear on this one. That's bull... . The choices you are going to make through the story are nothing, the choices are illogical and have little to do with the common sense and are anything but strategic. Basically, probable outcome is:1) You get renown (ingame currency also used to lvl up);2) You get nothing/one of your characters dies;3) You get nothing;4) You get nothing.*Moral boosts along with several fighters for your army are not even worth mentioning*To emphasise: YOU CANNOT GUESS THE OUTCOME OF YOUR CHOICE, neither logically thinking, nor by any common sense. The results of your choices are defined by the developers. If you are lucky you will get something, if not... well.You can also make ANY choice and run through the game like nothing happened.>Make allies as you travel with your caravan across this stunning yet harsh landscapeRefer to my thoughts on 'strategic choices'. Same goes here - right answer (on the developers opinion) - you get the allies.>Carefully choose those who will help fight a new threat that jeopardizes an entire civilization. Same as for ""strategic"" choices. The outcome of your decision:1) There will be fight;2) There will be fight;3) There will be fight under another circumstances;4) There will be no fight, meaning no renown for you.To draw the line.Pros:- plot;- mood;- graphics.Cons:- poor storytelling;- no freedom of choice, just predefined illogical variants that have no impact on the story;- no gameplay - you are going to fight two battles all game long: 1) vs humans; 2) vs dredge. That's pretty much all you can do;- you cannot make right decision.Who would I recommend the game to?- if you have not decided which viking movie to watch - this game is for you;Who would I recommend the game not to?- if you like RPG and was hoping to get your hands on one.

												This story has a habit of kicking you while you're down, and then delivering a few more swift kicks for good measure. It is not your typical role-playing game, nor strictly a turn-based strategy; it is more of a choose your own adventure story. And you have distinct honour of having to pick your own poison. No one is holding your hand throughout the story, and the friends you meet along the way may become your enemy in due time. This game is not meant for everyone. It does not aim to please everyone. On the contrary, you will be cursing the Gods for the cruel fate that destiny has entwined for your past deeds and decisions. But no one is listening. Didn’t you know, the Gods are dead.--EDIT: I decided that I should also include the negatives of this game, to ensure people know what they are buying into, I wouldn't feel right recommending a game to a friend or even a stranger without the entire picture. With that said, you should know that it is the first chapter in a three-chapter story.The negatives: The entire story you are met with problem after problem, and at the end (which was abrupt and unexpected) you feel like you haven't solved any of them at all, leaving the player with more questions than answers. The problem is that this story doesnt stand on its own feet, since it is one part of a planned trilogy. Although it does a good job of introducing the characters, world and the problems they face, it does not do much past that. I am sure the game will stand better alongside its other two counterparts, but I cannot recommend this to anyone looking for a self-contained story, since this is just the first chapter; it feels more like an introduction to the world of Varl, dredge and men. You will want to get the second and third chapter to get the full experience of the Banner Saga, but this is a series that will be well worth the investment. The first chapter is one piece of what looks to be a great pie, but you are not given a vertical slice; you are given a horizontal one, and tasting only the crust of the entire story you are left wanting more.After all is said and done, I am sure it is going to be a masterpiece of a trilogy. I would recommend this if you can take it for what it is, the first part of a three-part series.			"

												One of the better Kickstarter games out there. I liked the setting. I liked the turn-based combat. I liked the minimalistic voice/animations. I liked the art style and 'deep' world. Everything seemed positive but I didn't feel like it was a completely positive experience. I appreciate that the devs wanted us to view this world through different group's struggles, but I initially didn't even know whom to identify with and care about. We are thrown into the deep end and expected to make the right decisions (I say right because you can lose some of your main characters in the game, which in my opinion removes interesting stories/interactions down the line). Worth buying on sale, but be warned that it's quite short (~7hrs).Pros[/b] - Your choices do affect the outcome! (#shotsfired #telltale)- Great art style (especially visible during the numerous 'walking' segments). You get a real sense of the minuscule size your units occupy in this unforgiving world. - Turn-based combat (though innovative, it isn't as deep as I was hoping. I ended up doing the same thing in every fight for most of the game). - It may take time, but you do start to care for the main characters (Rook!)Cons[/b] - Story on Iver, the Bellower, the serpent and the Council is seriously lacking.- Everything loads slowly (Map, Camp, Towns, Interactions).- Map is an illusion (extremely detailed map, but most of it is pointless). - No side-quests.- Resource management actually doesn't matter much (I had my caravan starve many times due to random events, but still won every fight easily).

												I so want to enjoy this game more than I actually do. The combat system is fun, sensible, and deep; the artwork is beyond beautiful; the music is fantastic; and the story is enthralling.But there's just way too damn much railroading. I don't mean in terms of not having much choice as to where you're going (that part's fine with me). I mean in terms of what happens to people.The bottom line is that characters don't live or die based on the foreseeable outcomes of your choices. They die based on what whoever wrote the story thought should happen. ""If you do X, this person will die five hours later in your game. Period. No, you will not see it coming. No, you will not get to react to it or have any sort of impact on what happens; you will get a bunch of text that tells you what I have decided will happen."" You're left completely powerless and turned into a passive observer.The loss of control kills the story; it completely ruins your immersion in this rich, deep world, and slams you back on the tracks. Whenever someone's died, I've felt cheated in a way no other game has made me feel. My reaction hasn't been ""well, I was hoping for a better outcome than that, but fair's fair. I took some risks, and I can see how that would make sense."" Nope. The overwhelming feeling I'm left with is ""How the heck was I supposed to know that was going to happen?"" I feel like I have to constantly second-guess the game by trying to figure out how the various choices are trying to screw me over, instead of getting into the mindset of the characters and thinking ""what makes sense here?""This is the second time I've tried to play this game through, and I'm genuinely sad that I suspect it'll be the last. With such a linear storyline, it's only got so many playthroughs in it. Which is a shame, because apart from that it really is a terrific game. If you don't think that'll bother you as much as it does me, give it a go.			"

Epic story telling that thrusts you into situations with which you can't tell what is the most advantageous choice even a few times through. The battles feel dire from your first encounter. Every time an ally is downed it feels fatal and every victory is glorious. You must master stratagem, positioning and party composition in order to survive this journey.

												Genre - Fantasy 80s style cartoon Turn Based Survival/Battle GameI love this game set in the world of Viking Types and Giants (Varl) with the Baddies (Dredge). The game plays like you are escorting a caravan with clansmen, fighters and Varl to deal with and feed on the way. The animation and characters look great and awaken a lot of nostalgia (for people having watched things such as Fire and Ice and the LOTR animated film). There are several chapters that see you following different characters to add variety to the story. The combat is quite tactical and is a challenge with some character progression and single items allowed to boost them slightly.Main Criticsm - The voice acting is limited so you end up reading a lot of conversations (although it is worth reading in most cases).

												The Banner Saga is a game that delivers mediocre strategic gameplay with lack luster game mechanics. The game drives you into making choices between being able to use the primary resource to feed your people or level up your characters. But no amount of leveling prepares you for the random events that can kill off a character suddenly, without warning, and strip you of a vital character you might have just spent the past hour leveling. While I do not mind random events being a detriment in a game - insta death choices are fairly often additional signs of poor game design.The best things about this game is the music and the compelling storyline. Place those into a better mechanically designed game and this would be the indie darling that everyone else believes it is.  "

												Whelp, this is a disappointment. When you start the game up, it impresses left, right and centre. It's artwork is amazing, the music is stellar, the combat system appears really interesting and there's lot of named characters to explore and a gargantuan world shown.But the more you play, the more you realize that what it shows you in the first 1-2 hours is actually all there is to this ~7-10 hours game. The AI is dreadful, the combat system never goes past the complexity it has in the tutorial parts, the characters aren't explored, the choices don't actually change anything, the map is useless as you are on two rather short fixed treks with no open exploration and there's no story to speak of.Worse, of the 7-10 hours you play, 15%-20% is spent watching tiny sprites trek along a landscape, fully automated. It's painfully slow, and really underlines how much this was done to pad the game length.Disappointing. In theory, this could be a great game. Good ideas, awesome world, stellar presentation. Just that there was nothing built around it.			"

I admit it is still an ok game and there are many worse out there, but here is why I do not recommend it:- It is story based, but the story is not great - mostly it seemed pretty boring, to be honest.- Lore and world bckground are probably interesting, but the game presents them extermely scarcely, mostly on the world map, which you have no gameplay reason to ever use at all.- There are a lot of characters, who seem interesting at first, but never really fulfill their potential and end up being bland to annoying. My guess is that voice acting would help a lot here.- There is tactical combat, but rather simple and repetitive - and battles seem more like solving a puzzle than being in command of a party of unique warriors. There is little enemy variety too.- Caravan management layer is completely broken. Losing all clansemen makes no impact on the game, it does not even change random events, which still refer to your caravan as if it was full or people.- No manual save option means you might end up forced to repeat certain parts after coming back, if you happened to play through a longer section not containing autosave points.- CYOA dialogue options are rarely clear as to what they will cause, meaning you might choose an option and end up causing something you were actually trying to avoid. Usually you are just forced to choose randomly, as there is not enough information.On the positive side, presentation in superb. The game looks and sounds great (music is especially impressive), but this should be dressing for a good core game, not its main advantage.			"

												It bums me out to give this a negative review, since I badly wanted it to be good and did enjoy some aspects of it.  The art and animation are stunning; it was very clearly made by a team of visual design veterans.  I applaud Stoic's attempt at breathing new life into tactical RPG battles by making it more akin to chess than say, FF Tactics.  Unfortunately, the system they came up with is easily exploited once you understand how it works.  Weaken (but don't kill!) lesser mobs so that they can't deal damage and continue to eat up turns for the enemy team, then focus on the heavy hitters.  After a while I started to dread fights because of how formulaic and boring they become.  No variation/advantages in terrain; just the same tired grid, battle after battle after battle.  The lore is excellent and well-formed, yet the story itself is unfocused and difficult to follow.  Even the score by Austin Wintory (whose soundtrack for indie darling Journey is amongst the greatest of all time) is forgettable.I feel like there's a great game somewhere in here, but the pieces just haven't come together yet.  With any luck Stoic will raise enough funds to continue the saga and I'll give it another go to see if they resolve some of these issues.  Until then I can't bring myself to finish this first installment.  Too bad.UPDATE: Ended up beating the game anyway since I was at the final boss.  Had to cheese my way through on easy thanks to an absurd upswing in difficulty for the second phase of the fight.  It did not improve my opinion of the game.			"

												I wish I loved this game.I love the art, I love the music, I love tactical RPG's.But I can not figure out the story; the choice options are not useful as either they are not what you want to do, are redundant such as: ""say Ludin is no one; tell ludin to shut up and leave; or beat ludin up until he is quiet"", and the choices don't always do what you want them to do.I could get over this and see it as a more fun version of the Oregon Trail but there are 3 things that really bug me about this game.Save Files, turn's and health/armorYou don't get any manual save options, instead the game generates auto save at some point (I can not tell when) and you have the classic ""continue from your last thing"" at one point my 'last play' and the last auto generated save where 10 days of travel and 7 battles apart not to mention key characters that died or did not die.And the turn order in combat. I don't mind the I get 1 move then the opponent gets 1 move. But this system is seriously flawed when either you or the AI are outnumbered by the other, allowing your 3 units to move 2 times for ever 1 time their 6 units more.It would be alot better if it had some turn order based on speed like Final Fantasy Tactics Advanced does, or if it was a simple 1 character move per 1 round like a lot of table top miniature games are.You don't seem to be able to heal your health in battle and this is only annoying because you might have 3 health points left but still have 20 armor points. But because you can choose to attack health or armor, health weakens their life and their attack and attacking armor sometimes lets your next attack on that unit do more damage, there is no point in attacking armor. Enemies almost never attack armor and can hit you unit with a max health of 15 for 7 damage and then because you have 5 unit’s to their 2 that same enemy can get an extra turn to get your unit to 1 health and attack before he gets a move thus making him a wasted turn when he does come around.In my eyes the whole point of an armor stat is either that it decreased the amount of damage you take, or they have to get through your armor to get to your health. However there is no point in enemies attacking your armor because they already do such massive damage while you have to hit their armor down to half if you want to do more than 3 damage to their health/strength stat a hit.

												8.5/10+ incredible presentation, graphics look handmade in pseudo-3d environment, the result is breath-taking+ incredible soundtrack+ gameplay wise it's a turn-based strategy game, fans of the genre will like the mechanics, although not as deep as in classics of the genre like homm. as far as difficulty is concerned it's on the easy side+ heavily focused on story, a story about an alliance of giants and humans vs the dredge (with some twists). great atmosphere+ seems your decisions influence the story, so the game has some replayability+ game length seems fine (not a very long game though, but i prefer that since the quality of the game is very high)- as i wrote game is easy for those familiar with the genre- the game is story driven, which is great for me, but sometimes it's very heavy on text. also people and places have weird (or difficult if you prefer) names that make me loose immersion, because i just can't remember who is who (lol)- map has no practical function, didn't help me at alla high quality game, very fresh for the genre since it has a rich and very interesting story to tell, if this is an indie game it's definitely an example of how an indie game should be. waiting for more from this talented developers.

												I absolutely loved this game.Having been afraid of strategy RPG's most of my life (Final Fantasy Tactics drove me away because I think I was too young to understand what was going on when I played it and found it immensely frustrating) I've recently found a new love for the genre. It started with Valkyria Chronicles on the PS3, expanded to XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and now The Banner Saga joins the list.I felt that everything about it - the gameplay, the pacing, the music, the art - was all top notch. This is a game I'm glad to have backed on Kickstarter, and I'm eagerly awaiting the sequel.If you like strategy RPG's I don't know what's not to like about this one. But the biggest caveat to my recommendation is that if you don't like the genre then you may want to avoid it.			"

Though arguably inferior to its sequel, The Banner Saga is worth buying for the same reasons: hand-drawn animation, beautiful medieval music score, and strategic element of turn-based combat.If you're interested in the first installment, my immediate concerns are the survival and RPG elements.At least 50% of the gameplay is an unrealized Oregon Trail as randomized situations cause your clan to fight, argue, rejoice, or die off. Being nice to people in Banner Saga presents an equal chance of receiving resources and getting stabbed in the back. Read a game guide, attempt to roleplay, or flip a coin.The nagging survival elements consist of managing food supply and morale. Food supply can be bought with Renown, your experience points, which takes away from the pool used to level up party members. This fight for balancing the health of your clan with the power of your party takes away from the possible enjoyment of combat and skill allocation.Fighting with a party of developed skills is arguably much more fun than keeping your clan members alive. Unless you care about the weak consequences (the resulting dialogue is similar to a waving finger), you might as well not care about their health. On the other hand, Morale supports combat by increasing strength of actions, but I did not see this as a necessity.If you are much more interested in the combat, try The Banner Saga: Factions. It's free-to-play, solely based on the turn-based strategy, and free from managing an annoying clan.If you are curious about its Viking-esque world specked with music for pressed marchers, give this game a go.

												As a pure audiovisual experience the Banner Saga is superb, both the artwork and the soundtrack are amazing.Unfortunately as a game it has several major issues. The turn-based battles are not that good and get repetitive really quickly. The caravan management side of things doesn't fare much better. There's plenty of choices to be made, but often the consequences feel very unpredictable and unfair. Furthermore, the main path through the game is fairly fixed anyway and in the long run your choices don't really matter much. Even running out of supplies for days on end doesn't seem like a big deal, you just lose a few people from your caravan.I backed the Banner Saga on Kickstarter and really wanted to like the game. Unfortunately the gameplay is just too weak and the game has too many bad design decisions for me to truly enjoy. I played through the game on normal difficulty.The good:- Gorgeous visuals- Amazing soundtrack- The Norse mythology inspired world is quite interestingThe bad:- There's lots of choices, but the consequences often seem very unpredictable and most of the time don't seem to matter much in the long run- The turn-based combat is pretty weak with some questionable design choices, especially the way turn order is determined and how remaining hit points and attack strength are combined into one stat- There's very little variety in battles, in pretty much every battle you'll be fighting the same few enemies- Using renown for both leveling up and for supplies & items was a very annoying design decision- Ending is very abrupt			"

												Summary of the full review:The Banner Saga is an immensely unique, and, by no coincidence, immensely good game that combines great artistic design and robust C&C mechanics with a highly entertaining and deceptively complex battle system. The Banner Saga has only a few outright flaws; the shoddy dialogues and the constant need to click-click-click through them line by line are a blemish on an otherwise engaging narrative. Moreover, the startling lack of enemy variety and the relatively dumb AI keep the battle system from realizing its potential for true tactical greatness. The game's system of choices and consequences also has far less of an impact on the story than Stoic's PR department has been trying to claim; nonetheless, it still offers an engaging and immersive range of decisions that will directly influence your battle performance and can occasionally result in major character deaths.I suspect that The Banner Saga will always be the subject of great controversy; it has a kind of self-assured swagger, flaunting all of its little weirdnesses and weaknesses without making much of an effort to look like a typical tactical cRPG or a typical casual story game. The game features heaps upon heaps of idiosyncratic gameplay systems, like the strange combination of a broad C&C system with a fully pre-determined linear story, the fact that you will rarely if ever be able to see a ""game over"" screen, the ""sit back and immerse yourself"" approach to map travel, and a whole slew of novel and deeply unrealistic combat mechanics. You may choose to accept or reject these mechanics according to your personal preferences; all I can tell you is that all of these elements stand in the service of a fully coherent and extremely tightly designed gameplay experience that I deeply enjoyed playing through.Full review: http://www.rpgcodex.net/content.php?id=9938 "

												I feel almost bad not recommending it, this game has so much potential, but unfortunately it's pretty much wasted by the horrible ending.The pros:- The graphics are very pretty, and do convey the sense of being in another world, and of setting things up nicely- The music and the few voice-overs are very good- The general story, up until the end, is captivating and unique enough when stacked up against other games.The cons:- The game is on rails. Serious rails. And it feels like it. It actually provides you with a map you can click on, so you can learn about the different regions and cities of the world, but then won't let you plot a course to visit any of them.- The combat is actually pretty boring once you realize that every round of turn based combat, the turns go back and forth between you and the enemy. You just killed 3 enemies so it's now 5 on 3? Well, that just means some of the enemy units will go twice. It really sucks any aspect of strategy right out of the game.- The ENDING! Wow. I don't want to spoil it, but the game builds up so much about the setting, the history of the world, the different characters....and then it just ends. SO much could have been done, but wasn't. What a gyp.			"

												I have been truly excited for this release. I'm a veteran of The Banner Saga: Factions, the multiplayer aspect of this - which helped to develop the AI. I absolutely adore that game, so I had an idea of the combat coming into this. What I did not expect was the scale. I avoided most news up to this release, so as to be fresh and not have any expectations. The battles are wicked. You will not be coddled, one mistake can wreck you. You're always outnumbered. The battle system is fantastic. I adored every battle.The story I find to be a bit lack-luster, but the twists are great. I am going for my second play-through, on normal this time. Great game. Very dark and not very forgiving. Don't really need to say anything about the awesome art. ^_-			"

Pros:Breathtaking visuals. A very unique and beautiful art direction. Characters, backgrounds, battle animations, particles. All very well done.Amazing music, works perfectly with the fantasy/Nordic atmosphere.Combat is easy to pick up, and difficulty is adjustable at any time.Great narrative, with plenty of twists and turn. Plenty of lore if you really dig into it.Tons of random encounters with varying consequences.Choices feel like they actually matter.Cons:While it is a grid based battle game like Final Fantasy Tactics it unfortunately doesn't have the same kind of depth that FF Tactics did. That isn't to say that combat in The Banner Saga isn't fun.Not a huge enemy variety, you'll see a lot of the same enemies in a lot of similar formations. Given the length of the game though this isn't a huge con.Aside from a handful of narrator introductions, there is no voice acting. Which is a shame, I think that it would have really added to the experience. "

												I was really excited to play this game, but the more I did so, the more obvious something became: I just wasn't enjoying it very much.The RPG elements of the game aren't bad. They aren't great either, but they're not bad. Nothing to write home about either way.The problem is with the turn-based tactical combat, which is bland and repetitive.  For starters, there is no terrain of any sort. You just get a blank grid with you and your enemies, with every square of the grid created equal. That means there's no choke points, no cover, no high ground, and so on. This is made worse by the bizarre way that turn order is handled. First one of your units moves, then one of the enemies, then back to one of yours, and so on. This applies even when one side outnumbers the other, so if you have 6 people and there are only 2 enemies left, each enemy gets to move three times as often as each of your units. This disparity just further eliminates any possibilities for actual tactics, and turns combat into a mosh pit of repeatedly hitting each other until everyone on one side has fallen over.Fortunately for the player, the enemy units and AI are sufficiently weak (at least on the default difficulty setting) that this is seldom a problem, especially as the game has no permadeath. You just keep on hitting the enemies until none of them are standing, and if a few of your side fall down in the process then it's no big deal.Which brings me to another problem: there are no other mission types. Every single combat is a straight last team standing. There's no ""control the point"" or ""survive for x turns"" or ""rescue the non-combat units"" or anything else. Just your units, their units, and yet another identical fight to the death.			"

												If you're interested in story driven games and RPGs, this game is definitely worth the buy. The Banner Saga is a combination of (a) turn based, micro-scale combat (a la Dungeons & Dragons or CRPGs), (b) visual novel storytelling with many choices, and (c) a clan management game. This it the abc of The Banner Saga, and its primary innovation is trying to entwine the three elements into a single, engaging experience. There are a lot of things The Banner Saga does right:+ A compelling story in an interesting world (basically a Nordic world where humans and giants try their hardest to tolerate each other);+ A simple yet interesting combat system that is genuinely fun;+ Genuinely difficult choices, both in terms of gameplay and story progression;+ Beautiful and unique art and visuals (a sort of gritty Disney meets Eyvind Earle (mentioned in the credits as inspiration));+ An equally beautiful celtic sound track.But the game has several flaws as well: where it is ambitious in entwining the abc and innovative in its ways to make the interactions between those elements engaging, it never really delivers in the end-game. This is mostly due to The Banner Saga's Renown system, which hopes to bring all three (combat, narrative, and magement) together, but ultimately fails to do so.The Renown system functions much like Experience Points, only Renown Points will buy you (1) character levels, (2) items for your heroes, and (3) supplies for your clan, which you require to travel. Although this is an engaging way of resource management, it fails in several respects. Firstly, it can be anti-fun when the player is forced to choose to buy supplies for the clan rather than spend money on leveling characters, which is a core element of what is enjoyable about RPGs. Secondly, characters that die in the narrative will have been a waste of invested Renown (I personally don't find this a big deal, but those who enjoy the turn based combat more than the narrative may find it irritating).More importantly, this system leads to a watering down of all the three elements: combat becomes too easy and narrative and managament choices unimpactful. The clan management for example consists of managing Supplies (for travel), Figthers (for large battles and random events) and Morale (which affects fighter efficiency as well as the combat system). Yet this never ends up being sufficiently relevant: leveling characters makes it easy to ignore the penalty for having bad Morale, you always end up having enough Fighters, and buying sufficient Supplies is more of a necessary tedium.There are some other, less prominent flaws: sometimes the writing takes much agency away from the player, resulting in catastrophes that you may feel were completely beyond your control. Often, the narrative fails to emphasize important events that aren't entirely in the script, such as a character dying due to a narrative decision. There is also very little time spent actually developing some of the side characters in interesting dialogue, and much focus rests on the main storyline. The latter bothered me enormously, because I liked many of the characters upon introduction, but barely got to interact with them. This is partially due to the game introducing too many characters, but partially simply too few of such events were actually written out.These flaws, as well as a rather abrupt ending (which pretty much makes buying the sequal mandatory), leave me feeling slightly less satisfied than I'd hoped to be. However the flaws are easily forgiven, because The Banner Saga manages to keep the players attention where it wants it, namely with the main storyline. This storyline itself is compelling and well presented to the extent that it warrants the €20,- pricetag in itself.Verdict: Recommended with a 7/10. The flaws in the gameplay are compensated by a great narrative experience; moreover, the gameplay has much potential and if the developer learns, The Banner Saga 2 may become a real classic.			"

												One of the most visually pleasing games you'll ever play. It presents you with tough choices throughout your journey, impacting whom you get to take with you, who lives, who dies, and how good or bad you manage. Ultimately, also impacting your story.Though I didn't feel like many of them mattered for the end of the game, they still mattered for the JOURNEY towards the end.Pros: Gameplay is challenging or if you want to, you can play the combat on the easiest setting if you just want the story and the journey.Visually very beautiful.Music and sound design draws you into it.Choices and moral dilemmas make you sit there for a long time, pondering what will be the best choice.And towards the end... well, I won't spoil it. BUY IT AND PLAY IT DUDE! JUST DO IT!Cons: The combat can become a bit repetitive as many enemies repeat and the variation doesn't happen until later in the game.			"

												Fantastic artwork and story. The battles are fun and intense as well, though if you are a hardcore turn-based strategy player you may consider them lightweight (I certainly find them as much as I can handle). The best parts of the game are the role-playing parts. Every decision is a burden, and often there is no decision that won't have dire consequences. Aside from 2 or 3 main characters, every one of your party members can get killed off in any encounter. Even some of the discussion trees can lead to a character death if you are not careful.Think of it as a combination of the best parts of Final Fantasy, Skyrim, and Oregon Trail.			"

												Recommend -- barely. This game is fun, but it in no way lived up to the hype/my expectations, and it is quite pricey for what it is. I've played through twice, in about 15 hours altogether. Basically, this game is ""Viking Oregon Trail"", with level ups. Very narrow level ups (stat selection for pre-made characters). There's no character creation (though you do have access to several different character's POV during the game -- but you don't have control over switching between those). Events in the game (for example agreeing to let certain characters join or not join your caravan) don't really impact the game other than to provide a bit of flavor to your next play through. The world is interesting enough, and some of the characters are intriguing, but by and large there's no pay off on that, because it's half a game. The game just stops, at about what I thought was the half way mark. So while there's hints at things that it might be interesting to learn about the characters, that's as far as it gets. Furthermore, the characterisation is not that sophisticated, despite the praise heaped on the game. It's not terrible, but it's by no means outstanding. The characters are very trope-y: ""Concerned Dad"" ""Teen Girl"" ""Lady Archer"" ""Rude Prince"" ""Pyscho Pyro"" ""Proud Warrior Race Guy"" etc. A final pet peeve: the dialogue in this game was very iffy in places. It's supposed to be reminiscent of a Viking Saga, but the characters are constantly going around using contemporary slang. I'm not expecting Shakespeare -- but it would be nice if the characters didn't use things like ""ok"". It's just -- not in keeping with the milieu.So, I've told you my reservations for recommending. If you're reading this and thinking, ""wow that's very picky"", then maybe this game is for you! But if you're thinking ""no, that would bother me too"", maybe skip it or wait for a good sale. As I said, I've played through twice. I doubt I will again -- fifteen hours and I feel like I've seen everything the game has to offer. I got the game on sale, which I'm really glad about. I feel like it was expensive at the price I paid. I think I'd be genuinely annoyed if I'd paid more. "

												Many recent Indie games I tried felt like unfinished, half baked products by lazy developers who've been trying to ride a trend for some easy money and fame, leaving me feel cheated and disappointed. Not The Banner Saga, though. This game looks like a lof ot talent, effort and hard work had been poured into it, and that alone, in my book, means a lot.The Banner Saga is a tactical Strategy RPG with a deep, intense story. The graphics and soundtrack are great, but what I like the most here, is the story. The atmosphere of the game is really dark, as the story is about a violent and bloody war. There's a lot of death, injuries, bloodshed and grief. Some people might consider such a setting to be problematic or even inappropriate for such a game, but I kind of like it. It's a refreshing look on things, at the very least. Just don't expect too many rainbows and unicorns. :)Another good aspect of the game, in my opinion, is the choices. Some people complain they don't have enough influence on the game. While I agree that it would be great if the choices had more weight, I think they do offer enough replayability value. Going through the game just once hardly feels like all there is to it, as I know if left me quite curious to play again, make different decisions and see where it leads me.As for the strategy part of the game, it's certainly one of the better parts of the game for me. The battle system is simple to learn (should be almost intuitive for anyone who's ever played such games before), but seems to have enough depth and balance to be appealing and interesting. It kind of reminds me of the battle system in Expeditions: Conquistador (another great tactical RPG, btw).As of now I haven't beaten the game, but I did get to the final battle. I ended up losing quite a few times, after which I simply got frustrated and gave up. I restarted the game, got kind of half-way before losing a mid-game battle and getting a 'Game Over'. The reason I'm describing all this, is to point out what I consider to be the only two real problems I have (or used to have) with the game:1) At the time, the difficulty level of the final battle was much higher than anything else you encountered during the game, and I don't mean ""slightly"" or ""moderately"" higher (which would make sense, considering it's the final battle), I mean it was REALLY much more difficult. I know many people have been complaining about this, enough to have the developers address and fix this issue, which probably means it should be okay now.2) The game is somewhat vague regarding the consequence of losing a battle. In most cases, if you lose a battle you can still continue playing, but you suffer some negative consequences. In a few specific battles, though, losing means getting  a ""Game Over"". It means you can get back to your last save and try again, but you don't get to continue playing despite the loss, as you would after losing a normal battle. This wouldn't be a problem for me, btw, if the game was clear about the rules. I'd expect to get at least a clue, that I'm facing a critical battle that I must win in order to survive. Well, the game doesn't give you anything to indicate there's a difference.Despite those two problems, I really like the game. It's one of the better games I encountered during the last few years. I'm kind of disappointed I didn't get to beat the game yet, but I did really enjoy playing it, regardless.EDIT (March/31/2016): By now I've managed to win the final battle and beat the game on 'normal' (the medium difficulty level). While I'm happy to have finally succeeded, I still feel the spike in the difficulty level was too much.			"

												I’m gonna be honest, I haven’t experienced such an amazing game for quite some time. Graphically the game is astonishingly beautiful, with one of the best art styles I’ve ever seen and the way the animations were made, slow but nailing the right spot. The graphics and the soundtrack are, for me, a masterpiece on their own.Quite possibly one of the most intense soundtracks I’ve heard over the last years. Gameplay wise The Banner Saga could be described as a turn based strategy game with a party/hero management system, which include leveling up using “Renown” and distributing skill points to each separate stat, it also features something which can be compared to something like Oregon Trail in which you need to micro manage your supplies as you travel across the land and each time you visit a town you can trade your “Renown” at the market for supplies or items which can be equipped by your characters.Renown is what you could call the in game currency, you get Renown for killing enemies and winning battles and you can use that earned Renown to trade in a town market for supplies, which will be consumed as each day passes depending on how many people you have on your caravan (Varl, Clansmen and fighters) or you can use that Renown to promote your characters.By promoting your characters you get 2 – 3 points which can be assigned to various different stats, such as strengh which determines how much health you have and the damage you deal to your enemies, willpower which can be used to increase your movement or the power of your attack on a turn but it’s a limited resource in each battle, along with many other stats such as Armor break which determines how much damage you deal to the enemy armor etc.The battle system is pretty simple to learn, yet, hard to master. Before each battle you get to choose your party from your pool of characters and then you will proceed to the battlefield where you can deploy your troops along the starting line. Basically, units have armor, represented by a blue banner, and strength represented by a red banner, if you focus on dealing damage to an enemy armor you’ll be able to deal more damage on a later turn, the more armor an unit has the less damage that unit will receive and the more strength an unit has the more health it has and the more damage that unit will deal to enemies, sometimes you’ll have to focus on dealing strength damage to an enemy in order to lower their damage and sometimes you’ll have to focus on their armor in order to deal damage to them later on the battle, this is the key to mastering The Banner Saga combat system. Each character also has an unique ability which they can use in battle by using willpower, that same willpower can be used to increase damage dealt to enemies or travel distance during your turn.Besides all this you have a fairly standard dialogue system, with some pretty neat writing, albeit with a lack of voice acting, something that works like the dialogue system from Dragon Age or Mass Effect in which each dialogue option will have a different outcome on each situation and sometimes those choices will lead to severe consequences such as someone abandoning your party or your caravan or taking away your supplies so choose carefully.In my opinion this is what makes The Banner Saga a somewhat highly replayable game because if you choose a different dialogue option everytime you play a new game you’ll have tons of different outcomes. Story wise the game did an amazing job in creating a world in which you care about the characters, people you meet along the way and even strangers, while it still forces you to keep your eye open for trouble along the road.Besides the “normal random events” there’s also something else which comes up when you are travelling through the land with your caravan and these are called “Wars”. As you might expect these happen when your army meets another army, in this case a Dredge army. First a screen will pop up showing how many troops the enemy army has and how many troops you have, including varl and men, and after that you’ll be presented with a series of different choices such as “hold the line”, “formations”, “charge” etc.Each one of these tactical approaches will have a very different outcome depending on the battle, the number of troops on each army and depending on your army morale. Morale basically increases and decreases depending on your dialogue choices and if you win or loose battles and wars, lower morale will result in a decrease of the amount of willpower that your characters will start each battle with. When travelling through the land you can also set up camp, on your camp you can arrange your party, you can chat with your party members, check the game map which will provide a description for each region and town on the game world and you can also rest. Resting is fairly important because it can trigger certain events and it’s by resting that your characters heal from injuries and you should always make sure your characters are healed, but, keep in mind that everytime you rest a day passes by and thus your supplies decrease.However, there’s one more thing I’d like to say about The Banner Saga, even though I absolutely loved the game the final boss fight was just way too frustrating and very hard to beat, it took me over 5 hours to beat it on Normal mode so I can only imagine how long it must take on hardcore. It mainly took me that long because by the end, the game forces you to take two specific characters, two characetrs which I barely used during the rest of the game and so they were low level, to battle and by the time the final boss triggers you can’t rest and I had several characters injured which really hurted me thus taking several tries, I don’t think that this was actually my fault but also something on the design side, when you get there, if you get there, you’ll understand what I mean.In the end, despite the frustration I went through to beat the game I can’t recommend The Banner Saga enough, it’s such a great game! In my honest opinion it excels in all key aspects of a game like this, story, graphics, soundtrack and gameplay, it’s certainly a good investment of both your time and your money and I’m sure you’ll have plenty of good moments with it.Still, it needs to be said that The Banner Saga is divided in three parts and this is the first part and buying this game will not grant you access to the other parts when they come out. You can also try Banner Saga Factions which is multiplayer only and it’s available on Steam for free and by playing it you’ll be able to see how the battles play on the single player game.			"

												The game has potential. It's beautiful, no doubt, and the storyline is interesting. The gameplay, however, leaves me wanting. Most of the gameplay is split between making decisions while you attempt to move your caravan somewhere safe and controlling a small party in turn based combat. There really aren't many options with the turn based combat. Most of the strategy will come down to picking your team, but once you're in the fight, there isn't always a lot to do. Each player has a specific talent they can use at the cost of a limited supply of points. Otherwise you can attack or skip/rest. I really wish the depth of options was greater. While the choice to break armor or attack strength adds a potential element of strategy, it becomes pretty obvious once you realize the enemies don't change much: break armor on the big guys, attack strength on the smaller guys, hope you can arrange the enemy in a way to link armor breaks...and that's about it. I was also let down by many of the special attacks. Some are highly situational, and require too much luck getting enemies arranged properly on the board to really take advantage of them. The ranged attackers tend to be super limited, and the support roles just don't offer a viable option to use effectively in battle. The caravan aspect of gameplay has you making text based choices when confronted with an option, like adding a stranger to your party or not. I enjoy the opportunity to roleplay, but it often seemed any choice was bound to be bad. Rarely did a choice end up being positive (though I don't know the results of alternative choices). While I can appreciate the idea that the caravan is supposed to be very difficult and force you to make difficult decisions where you know something bad is going to happen, it would be nice to have some variety. The worst of these, however, is when it leads to one of your characters being killed through text. No one dies on the battlefield, but they can during roleplay. Since resources are so limited and improving your fighters takes up the same resources that you use to buy food, losing a character you've invested in to a choice in dialog was almost enough to get me to stop playing. I've reached the end of the game, but I didn't have too much fun along the way. Some of the issues are just balancing. But ultimately the balance is off too much for me to recommend the game. I really wanted to like this one, but the only thing I came away impressed by is the artwork.			"

												THough the game is more of adventure type then RPG or strategy and it got some questionable balance decisions it remains one of the best games in terms of immersion and story. Narrative is thoroughly weaved at the beginning but, unfortunately, later it becomes more and more schematic, the pace of story got faster, often skipping or even cutting previosuly declared minor storylines. Nevertheless, it was a nice experience for me and unlike most of modern games it was able to hold my interest untill the final titres.			"

												I played this game through and I enjoyed it VERY VERY much. The artwork, the music, the storyline, the battles - everything was mostly great. The game basically reads like an interactive book with lots of awesomely drawn static ilustrations and turn battles inbetween. The influence of Norse mythology is  very obvious here and gives a very good vibe to the experience. There are plenty of choices in the game, but their biggest consequence (as far as I can tell) is who of the heroes will join you and survive the perils. Otherwise the storyline seems fairly linear, although still very captivating and well-written. You will also not experience leading huge armies as you are always in control of no more than half a dozen characters. I personally was  left a bit dissatisfied with the ending (this includes both the final battle, the final plot twist and the final cutscene) and it DOES seem to me personally there might be a room for a sequel. Overall the game has its flaws, but if you like books, high fantasy in norse setting, turn-based batttles and good storyline you can't go wrong with Banner Saga. It was a time well spent, which leaves a desire for more.			"

												A story of utmost intensity and chaos at every turn.  Your actions and words carry heavy weight so choose wisely playing through the history of your Bannar Saga.Turn based action where the battles never seem to end too fast or carry on painstakingly.  A good blend of linear and choices with super artwork played out through epic war.  Character development also flows nicely into place.  Be sure to keep an eye on supplies and morale while distributing your renown, that you earn through battle, only to level up or promote the fighters you are going to use most.  Do not put all your chips on one hand though because in my playthroughs I had various exits upon different actions and choices.			"

												The atmosphere of The Banner Saga is incredible. It's oppressive and depressing, and helps you become part of your party as they desperately seek solace in a world that is slowly ending - being consumed by an ancient darkness.Gameplay is split between turn-based strategy with an interesting Armor/Strength dynamic that will effect your approach and strategy to every situation, and overworld politics and diplomacy as you try to lead your party, maintain provisions, determine the speed at which you travel, and help (or abandon) passersby.The Banner Saga is a slowly paced game, and I mean that in the best possible way. It gives you time to absorb the world, and hammers in the weight of the decisions you have to make for the caravan and your allies. And these decisions matter. Critical characters can live and die based on the decisions you make, and there is no auto-saving to get them back. Choices are gray at best, and it's solely up to you, the player, to decide what you feel will best serve the caravan.Visually, it is beautiful, with smooth gradients of color behind swathes of silhouetted foreground, and a fitting soundtrack for you slow trek through the end of the world.Highly recommended for anyone looking for a story-driven game or a different take on turn-based strategy. The Banner Saga is oppressive, overwhelming, and exhausting. And it's incredible for it.			"

Clean and simple but detailed. -Excellent soundtrack, Songs that make you want to stop the battle and listen. -But the weak point of the game, it would be his lack of command and compatibility with the X360 control.-Some commands are complicated because the screen is static and you do not  to move it to different angles ... it always keeps the same angle, amid battles it ultimately fail bad gameplay.-Another thing that could be better is the personaliação of perssonagens, it could be more like FFT, which has several items, jobs, and powers / different attacks, which ends up leaving the game more envolvente.-The lack of animations of the characters, are always with the same anemation, do you get angry, but this is a simple and silly thing for an amazing game. =Recommend a few people, more for those who like challengesNote 79/100(sorry my bad english... I tried!)Uma história muito bem feita com muitos elementos incríveis, e que fara voce quase chorar.

												The battle system is really annoying. I liked the HP=attack strength part, but the ""turns always alternates between sides, one character at a time"" rule means that if you kill weaker enemies you essentially give the stronger ones extra turns. Therefore, to win, you must weaken as many enemies as possible without killing them. This is nonsensical, counterintuitive, and not very fun.			"

												Near the start of the game there's a fully animated cut scene setting the early stage of the game. It's well done, it looks amazing and gives background to where you are, and the setting you are in. I looked forward seeing a few more cut scenes like this- but to my surprise it was the only one of it's type in the game. No second act cut scene, no ending cut scene- just a couple still pictures. They set the bar for themselves very high whit this opening cartoon story telling bit- get your hopes up high, then let you down by not following through in the rest of the game.The combat lends itself to one tactic- cripple enemies so they don't hurt you, then let them run around and eat up the enemies turn order so the tough guys don't act as quick/as often. It makes very little sense- in video game or real world logic. ""Attack! But don't kill them, maim them, so like, the other guys won't attack as much."" In most tactic games killing a bad guy would mean there is less of a threat- slowly gain an advantage until it's a big advantage, then win. Not here, the metagame tactic of maiming is unfun. The health/armor system is interesting, and may have been fun if the rest of the combat helped with a more cohesive vision. Too often I would feel like a battle would be uninteresting simply because a huge dude just happened to start combat near a weak dude, and smashed his face in- either on my side or the enemy side. There are some 'tactics' to this game, such as positioning people for small bonuses here and there- but on a whole its a pebble in a shallow pond.The decision making process outside of combat is more frustrating than anything. Too often you would look at your list of options, and see the logic behind one of the answers. ""This looks like a reasonable option"" you might say to one of them. So you pick that option, only to find that the vague wording has lead you astray, or unforeseen logic throws you for a loop and you end up frustrated. ""Post gauds to guard supplies!"" You might say. ""Ok!"" The game will tell you. ""But robbers stole half your stuff anyway, wah wah."" So why did I bother with the guards at all! Another example; an option might say “I trust you.” So you selected that. But then the scene plays out like “I trust you. Dead men don’t lie!” Then you stab him dead. Didn’t see the flow of logic there? Too bad, the game autosaved, live with it. At one point in the game you need to use an item to win a battle. This fight is annoying for a few reasons. First- there's an NPC giving stupid hints that too vague to be helpful, and the speech bubble is right over half your characters. So you have to wait a few moments before selecting where to move, because you can't see anything.(Also you can not adjust the camera in combat, and it can get messy/clucnky/and visually clustered quickly. When things get heated in combat you'll be fighting the menu more than enemies.)Next, the storyline item used in the fight is not explained. Maybe this my bad, but I didn't realize that it became a special ability of a character during that fight. There was no indication that it was there, and I never used that characters abilities anyway, so why would I look? I thought at certain conditions where met the item would be used in a cutsence or something- but nooope you just have to know. Great, wasted 2 hours before I realized that.I want to like this game. It does some things really well.The story feels like it's a real fleshed out fantasy novel. The one single cut scene is really good. The use of fire emblem style dialogue deliver (nonmoving portraits of characters) look nice. But overall this game doesn’t need more polish, it needs better design. I want to like it, but can't. I also can't recommend this unless it's on sale for half off or more.			"

												The Banner Saga, it was one of the few indie games of recent memory that I was truely pumped up and excited for... I guess I shouldnt have gone in with such lofty expectations.This is no Final Fantasy Tactics or Agarest War if that's what your looking for, those games are way deeper in terms of combat and story. The Banner Saga is very bare bones when it comes to being a turn based strategy-RPG game. Now I know that the Stoic team is mostly made up of a few ex-Bioware guys but the story similarities between The Banner Saga and Dragon Age are eerily similar, if you've played both games then you can probably see the parrallels. The Banner Saga is supposedly going to be an episodic or trilogy style series, very lame considering nowhere on the steam store page does it say anything about this being an espisodic/trilogy half-baked half-made un-finished game... but this is an indie kickstarter game so why am I surprised. If you were like me and expected to have a full complete epic journey to sink into from start to finish then you are in for a very rude awakening, we got fleeced.The first part which is available on Steam, is extremely short and when the credits roll there is literally no forward progress made in the story and your left with a giant TO BE CONTINUED.... I cannot reccommend this game in its current state unless your a hardcode turn based-RPG fan, and even then this will be a bit of a stretch because the campaign is so woefully short. This game is un-finished and not worth its current price of $25.00Personal Pet Peeve: This game has nothing to do or in common with ""true"" viking/nordic mythology at all. I honestly dont even see how the developers can make such a claim on the store page, sure this game might be ""inspired"" by viking/nordic mythology but I would use that term extremely loosely in this case. There is nothing even remotely viking'esq about this game, only a perversion of what some developer who has probably never read an Edda thinks a viking might be like, for shame.Thanks for reading.

												The art is superb and evocative - like a fantasy film you might have dreamed in childhoood.  The writing is lovely, full of Nordic deadpan and the gallows humor of struggling heroes on what may very well be a death march at the end of the world.  The tactical gameplay is solid, and while I can see there are comments that hack on it for being repetitive in the campaign, I don't feel that way about it yet - also, I feel it's a solid foundation from which to explore the system's potential in multiplayer or for a sequel.  I have only one issue with it, and that is the deceptive title.  I came here fully expecting Candy, and or some form of crushing, based on the name obviously.  This tale of northerners and Giants trudging through the ice and eternal sunset towards a bloody end in battle, as in legends of old, is woefully misrepresented by the use of the word ""Saga,"" so buyer beware.

												The Banner Saga excels more so at being a demonstration at the power and potential of crowd funding more so than it does as a successful tactical RPG. A story driven, episodic, tactical game like this would have had no chance of making it into the public's eye just a few short years ago, and because of this, gamers should be thrilled. Standing on its own, The Banner Saga is a very decent game that just narrowly gets a recommendation from me. The art style is simply stunning, and will undoubtedly land The Banner Saga on many ""Best Looking Games of 2014"" lists. The story itself is also fascinating with its ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" style of narrative, although your mileage may vary when it comes to becoming emotionally involved with the plights of the game's multiple protagonists.The Banner Saga's biggest missed opportunity, in my opinion, is with the combat system. It's a very bare-bones system that adds nothing significant to the genre, and begins to feel quite repititive as you progress through the game and often repeat battles due to the game's high difficulty. It's functional and all, but overall just feels competent at best, and ultimately disappoints, as a stronger combat system could really have propelled The Banner Saga into the realms of the greats. But overall, it's a solid debut effort from Stoic, and if you're a fan of this genre, is worth checking out once the price drops a bit.			"

												I pre-ordered this and honestly not overly impressed with the game, as everyone else has said the music and the art work is lovely but it's not enough on it's own and it really does just come down to that.The combat is not so much difficult as it is annoying, one of my biggest annoyances with combat was how the turns are always switched between sides, so even if I can see which enemy soldier is next on the turn list and I kill him off, his turn will just be replaced by another enemy meaning it's more combat effective for me to leave enemies alive but damaged rather than killed so I can get attacked by a fresh enemy. Very frustrating.I seriously don't understand the renown purchasing thing, why do I have to choose between leveling up my characters and buying supplies? When characters start getting very high level it costs so much renown to actually level them that you're effectively starving your caravan of supplies.I was not impressed that the description of this game put so much emphasis on choices, the result of said choices are almost entirely + supplies or - supplies, occasionally randomly killing off a character who has been with you a long time with just a a sentance, it just doesn't feel part of the story.The last gripe I have is the characters in your caravan, I completed the game after 2 days but I don't think I skipped anything so it's a short game anyway but in my entire play through apart from the scenes where you recruit new characters there is only ever 1 other conversation with them throughout the game (unless of course it's one of the main characters) this annoyed me a bit I was looking forward to seeing how my new companions would get on with each other in the stresses of my starving caravan but they apparently go silent once they join me. After this I really can't recommend this game, it just doesn't deliver on what the game description said.			"

												I marched for days trying to reach my final quest however my journey was rather difficult as I had to decide the fate of my journey. I either starved my men to save a few people, or have them kill each other as I look the other way, or maybe we get destroyed as the enemy surround us...why did I volunteer to lead.The banner Saga is a interesting game to say the least. I found the story interesting and the combat rather enjoyable and fits the overall game. The story has you dealing with a rather difficult situation and to reach the end of your story you will have to make some hard choices some in which will effect your army either making your group weaker or even have different party members because of choices you make. ========The Good========1. Story - I enjoyed the story and found it interesting. I was always wanting to continue my journey to find out what happens. 2. Looks - The overall looks of the game seems perfect for it's story and gameplay. The art work and back drops have move the story along nicely.3. Gameplay - The gameplay may seem simple but at the same time it has you thinking about positions and the right units to counter the enemy units. Just remember one bad move could end up costing you...a lot.======The 50/50======1. Difficulty - I found the difficulty would spike randomly making some battles rather difficult or catching you extremely off guard. However with trial and error you will get through these situations and continue to progress through the story. =======Overall=======I found the game again, enjoyable and fun to experience. I recommend this game for both the story and overall stlye of the game. Just remember it can get tough and you will be faced with a lot of choices which the game pushes you to learn from these mistakes and adapt which is always great to have.			"

												I don't really want to give this Game a negative Review, but there are no grey areas in the reviewsystem and if I ask myself ""would you recommend this game to others"" I simply can't get myself to say yes.Let me try to explain my reasoning:The game has an interesting artstyle and some elements of norse-mythology, and works with a mixture of oregan-trail style  traveling(where you make decisions along the way) and turn based combat on a grid.So far so good, a solid concept.My problems with the game:None of the characters, were all that memorable to me, they all felt kind of bland and those that I rememberd were rather annoying(mostly the humans, the Varl, a race of horned giants, were mostly bland warriors).The oregan-trail elements of the game actually felt kind of fun to me, but I found the combat to be so utterly dull and repetetative... You fight a bunch of really tough(tough in the sense of, they are able to take a ton of damage, not that they are difficult to beat) enemys that repeat over and over again, with little variety. Maybe there will be more interesting enemys later, but that still doesn't change my second problem with the game:The characters don't all that many abilitys, in fact, they have one per character and their base attacks. And Most of the time you just move a character, hit a thing and thats it, as long as you don't let your groupsize shrink to much during the out-of-combat-events and just gather all your characters in one place, you should be able to defeat most encounters with ease.Most of the time the combat just felt like it was getting in the way of the storyprogression though...So yeah, since I am someone who rather likes really complex turn based combat, I sadly can't recommend this game.

												The Banner Saga really impressed me for the majority of its duration. Great artwork, an interesting world inspired by Norse mythology, a interesting but sad story full of interesting characters and unique, enjoyable combat. I began to genuinely care about many of the characters, they are well written and some have distinctive personalities. You will often have to make walking-dead style decisions where you must weigh risk versus supplies, morale and your available fighting force. Later in the game some of the choices you must make are quite difficult and make the story feel like your own. The combat is turn-based, with you moving your selected squad members about using different abilities to damage enemy armor and health, which also serves as strength. Weakening armor allows you to do more damage to strength, while damaging their health/strength reduces the impact of enemy attacks. I found the combat difficulty to be well balanced if not a little bit easy for most of the game, I only failed a battle once but often I was down to my last guy when I won. Sadly things fall apart a bit near the end of the game. The story becomes a bit contrived with the introduction of a certain character, and the final battle is problematic. You are forced to use a specific character in this battle despite making a big choice regarding this character right near the end that in my mind should have left her out of the battle. I had not leveled this character up at all, she was weak and unhelpful in combat and this made the final encounter near impossible for me on the normal difficulty level. Apart from the last hour or so of this ten-hour game, I really enjoyed the Banner Saga and would put it on part with The Walking Dead in terms of story, characters and meaningful choices that have surprising results. one caveat is that there is no voice acting for most of the dialogue, so if you dislike reading you might not enjoy this game as much. I personally would take no voice acting over bad voice acting, but for some this might be a deal breaker.			"

												Be warned. This is not the cheap thrills and quick kills sort of game. This will not provide you with the 30min of immediate satisfaction that you crave before having to go out and do real things. A quick rush of points, colours and sparkly lights with no challenge this is not.This game is slow, deep, and full. And it is most incredible in all the ways that matter. The art style, inspired by artist and illustrator Eyvind Earle, sets this story that sings of a rich norse heritage into a truly magical setting. You command a caravan on two perspectives of this catycalismic event that is shaking the world; one, a ever-growing group of hungry refugees fleeing the oncoming horde of stone automatons, and two, the taskforce of horned giants that are marching to fight it. The characters fill this world with their own histories and personalities, they are fleshed out and become important to more than simple stats and combat ability. There are moments in the progression of the game that the player is required to make choices that will affect the caravan you have been tasked with managing and the direction of the playthrough. As a result of some of these choices, there were points that I cursed the screen in frustration as I tried to re-load a previous save point to try and save one or more characters from their inevitable demise, but fully knowing that it had been my leadership that had put them there.The combat can be at times frustrating, but there is always a way around - rethinking your strategy, utlizing different tactics or simply equiping various items on your characters. It is a thinking game, characters occupy tiles on the board that move, fight, or rest to regain ever-precious 'willpower' per turn. The larger and evidently more powerful pieces - as it effectively rounds down to a chess-like experience - take up more tiles, thus can be hit from more sides and rendered almost useless when kept out of range by being inadvertantly boxed in by allies. However, any foibles or griefs that I have with the combat and the brick wall that the final boss turns out to be are quickly dispelled by the compelling tale that is being woven in front of your eyes. Like any good story, I could not put it down - and after almost 17 straight hours, I am starving for more.I want to see where the people have gone as a result of me - what new adventures and tragedies await them, and how my people will fare with the prospect of doom in the coming darkness that is creeping ever forth, as told by a monstrous mountain splitting serpent.I love this game, and cannot reccomend it highly enough. If there are any talks of expansion or even a sequel, I will be there, waving my banner all the way.			"

												This game is the most impressive, intriguing, challenging, entertaining, eye an ear pleasing that I ever played in last few years. It's like I’ve read an exciting book, watched a beautiful cartoon with awesome soundtrack and obviously played interesting challenging game. I rarely get impression this high from a game lastly, but this one is the massive exception. Actually, The Banner Saga: Factions initially got me in this awesome universe and gameplay style. I was not really into turn-based games or games with turn-based strategic combat style in particular until I met Factions. And I was blown away by what an awesome, challenging and entertaining gameplay guys from Stoic have created! After that The Banner Saga became the TOP 1 in my wish list. And eventually it surpassed all my expectations.GAMEPLAYThis game offers a mix of turn-based combats, text-based quests, interactive dialogs and management of caravan under your leadership. Battles are very challenging and entertaining. Using different types of units — Varl (unique race of horned giants) and humans of different classes — and combat formation you can build your own unique strategy for the upcoming battle. You can take up to six fighters and place them in a specific turn order. Since combats are turn-based, this part of preparation can be crucial. As well as combat formation, because battlefield split in cells and every unit in battle have its own range of movement and attack. Most units can attack foes standing only at nearby cells. So you probably would like to place your archers and other weak units behind your Varl and other strong fighters.Screenshot #1Ability to upgrade warriors' characteristics and unique special abilities for willpower (local currency, earned in battles) or increase with artifacts adds more variety to gameplay and tactics in battles. Upgrade points are limited and can be split between 5 characteristics and since you won’t be able to max all out you better use them wisely thinking of how you want to use this particular unit on the battlefield.Fight mechanic is mostly about unit's armor and strength. Strength is also a health and it makes the WHOLE DIFFERENCE! Once you lowered the enemy’s strength below your armor he gets less than 100% chance to hit you for strength! But he still can damage your armor. So your damage to the enemy is your strength minus enemy’s armor. Using willpower to add additional damage points or unit’s special ability adds some spice to the battle. And more often than not it’s crucial to use them. Ability to hit without a chance to miss or hit multiple adjacent enemies at once or command to specific ally to move on next turn etc. can help a lot, especially if you play on hard, like I did (except first 2 battles). There are A LOT more nuances and things to learn about this very thoughtful combat system. And the more you upgrade your warriors the more tactic opportunities you get. But two biggest advices are: 1) lower enemy’s armor and 2) don’t get hit first. If you like challenge and turn-based combats you’ll love this one.In ""text mode"" you talking with other persons, more often than not choosing what to say next, which will affect the following events. The most awesome thing in this part is that all of the choses are so not black and white – you can’t tell right away which of the options is right and which is wrong. It’s all about making hard decisions and facing its consequences later. Some consequences will appear almost a half game after, striking you hard and unexpectedly. But mostly through text (descriptions of events and conversations) you get a deep story of this world and characters you play, meet or interact with.THE STORYIt’s really hard to tell you how awesome the story is and avoid spoilers. Throughout the game you play as leaders of caravans of Varl and human who faced a new threat, bigger than ever before, and trying to save their lives. Most epic thing in this part is the originality of each character you play or get to know with through the whole journey. They all are very thoughtfully developed, each has its own temper and you know it already after a few lines of dialogs.The story progresses without any breaks and the lack of twists. Don’t expect that all your lead characters are untouchable. You’ll constantly face some events and situations where you need to make a choice. And almost every time it’ll be hard to determine the right way especially when there is no such thing. Sometimes you’ll need to make a choice that would be less painful than others, or you'll lose your men. And the game manages to involve you so deeply in its world and events that you sincerely regret about every number of lost men in your caravan! About lifeless numbers! And when this happen to the character whom you already know (but for like an hour or few at most) you really sympathize for him. But there are a lot of fun moments too. It has it all: hard moments and moments of peace and fun in between, the love, betrayal, conflicts inside groups and families, and some crazy things.The story is deep, entertaining and beautiful. I really think about it like a book inside the game. You definitely should experience it yourself!Screenshot #2VISUALS AND MUSICVisual part of the game is stunning! I won’t talk much about it, I’ll just say that sometimes I just couldn’t move my hand from PrintScreen key. I’ve captured 450+ screenshots! Almost each frame can be taken for wallpapers. The art is really beautiful and along with awesome stylish soundtrack it makes a great atmosphere in the game. The music is very original, stand out and fits the game naturally.THE VERDICT10 out of 10 and totally ""must have"" for everyone who loves challenging tactical turn-based gameplay, the deep, mature and interesting story alongside with stunning art and music. Do yourself a favor — buy this masterpiece!P.S. Stoic, thank you guys!			"

												Wonderful game. It's a mixture of turn-based battles similar to X-com Enemy Unknown, management of caravan's morale and supplies, and text quests where you choose your answers trying to guess the consequences. The choice is usually between bad and worse which makes it even harder.The whole atmosphere in the game reminded of Game of Thrones universe. Your friends and you can die any minute, being in battle or because of hunger. Graphically the game is charming. It doesn't have CGI cutscenes, and it doesn't support DX11. But it all isn't necessary. The Banner saga has fantastic backgrounds which were drawn by hand, and all characters have their own peculiar features and details.At some point of your journey you make crucial decisions that shape your further trip, so the game has high replayability value. In my opinion, everyone who loves stories with important decisions to be made and exciting battles with various strategies should try this game. 10/10			"

												Not a turn based player. At all. So I will have to throw out there that I can't provide the most detailed review on the turn-based combat because I can't speak to what would be good or bad in comparison to other turn based strategy games. That being said, I enjoyed the game immensely without really enjoying the genre. The art style was what got me interested but it was the story that got me hooked. I really enjoyed the gameplay and the importance of the decision making throughout the game. It's not too challenging and at the easier difficulty levels, the game is pretty breezy to play through (almost too easy) if you just want to enjoy the art and music and just learn more about the characters and world.Whether you're a turn-based strategy player or not, you will find a lot to enjoy about the game and I'd certainly recommend it.

												People saying this game is too slow or boring are truly doing this game an injustice. The visuals and soundtrack are stunning on their own, and to be honest make this game worth it's retail price. On top of that, there is an amazing story that lies behind some choices that actually matter (unlike a lot of games with 'choice'; *cough cough* Mass Effect *cough cough*), and a battle system that is very robust and unique. I recommend this game to anyone with an attention span larger than 3 seconds and is willing to put thought into choices and combat, and enjoys an immersive norse experience.I do not recommend this game to people who need instant gratification every second of gameplay.

												I've been waiting for a game like this for a long time, banner saga offers a great singleplayer experience in a fantasy world on par with the elder scrolls and maybe even LOTR. The characters are each crafted as individuals with their own personalities and engaging backstories. The world itself has been crafted from the ground up with each river, road, forest and village having its own backstory as to why and what it is. I find the Banner Saga to be a refreshing game in the ever flowing torrent of ♥♥♥♥ releases we see in this day and age. 10/10 Would bang.			"

												Gorgeous, interesting game with poor combat design highlighted by a flawed final boss fight.Pros:Beautiful game - Art design, music, and style are all incredibleImmersive and unique storyCons:Poor combat - teams alternate turns regardless of how many combatants there are. The result is that a small crew of powerful characters is far stronger than a  full complement of soldiers. This flaw culminated in a final boss that was far more frustrating than challenging, to a degree that sucked most of the joy out of a game that is otherwise very impressive. I would highly recommend changing the difficulty to easy before the final boss fight. Although it flips the fight from exceptionally frustrating and difficult to laughably easy, you will enjoy the end of the story much more if you skip the pain.			"

												The Banner Saga is a brilliant turn-based strategy game with a unique and beautiful art style. The gameplay takes a little bit to get used to, but it's very satisfying. The animations in battle are smooth and the abilities suit the characters. The story grips you. You feel very much involved as you take on the role of a few characters and their decisions. Some decisions are incredibly hard to make, and you must face the consequences of them. Part of what makes the story so good is how well written the characters dialogue is and also the world's lore. There is a lot of detail and it really adds to the experience. I would highly recommend The Banner Saga to anyone who enjoys interactive stories and/or good turn-based strategy games.			"

												Not even sure what to say. This game is something differnt for me. So breaking my review into small Q/A:Is gameplay (battles) good ? Not really.Is storyline good? Average.How about the lore? Not enough.Does player choices matters? Absolutelly.Are consequences predictable? Not always.Personally I picked it up with 70 or 80 % discount, and played 11 hours. Dont regret time/money spend, but wont bother to replay for achievments or different endings (choices?). Keep in mind that story is not complete, a lot of question probably answered in sequel ( I havent played it, waiting for good discount).So if you want to lead people forward (right or left) and make choices with unknown outcomes pick this game.

												From the art design and concept point of view, this game is great.But for the gameplay and mechanic, this game is mediocre at best.Everything is a dice roll and that's bad. You spent a lot of renown for a couple of heroes, take them into battle, got them the last hits to gain levels, but then you make one conversational choice, unfortunately they don't agree with you, and they just left. That's it, they just LEFT your caravan and in one case one of them even killed 2 of your main heroes from the start, yes TWO heroes. There goes your Renown (main resource in this game) and time in battle. And now with your high level heroes gone, all you have is low level heroes to fight higher level enemies.Brilliant.... Just brilliant.Another cons :-Too much loading screen. -You can't equip or change items on your heroes if they are on the Promote status and you don't have enough Renown to Promote them.-You can't go to your heroes screen freely. You must Rest or you can gain access when you're about to enter a battle.-Maintaining high Morale is too hard because you must Rest for a couple of days, Rest consumes Supplies, and Supplies bought with Renown which is limited (especially when you took control of Rook).-The end battle is just silly. This game encourages you to be tactical from the beginning, but when it comes to the final battle, the game force you to engage the boss as fast as possible or you'll get overwhelmed.-Last one : the ending. If you're somewhat satisfied with this game, the ending will probably ruined it for you. Not gonna spoil everything but it will leave you feels empty and that the game is unfinished.6/10.			"

												After having completed this game I am changing my review. This game does have some of the best music I have ever heard in a game and also some extremely beautiful artwork. Some of the story parts offer a very engaging expereince however, this game is padded out with filler and is incomplete. the combat is dull and actually requires little to no strategy. the story ""ending"" happens after the death of a character that has a very convoluted backstory. the many names thrown at you are also very confusing to keep track of. I have no idea what happens to everyone else still iving in the end including the massive serpent creature....which seems to only have been relevent to end a battle sequence. your decicions have actually very little effect on anything and it is quite obvious that on several decisions the outcome would have been the same regardless of your choice. The ending sequence in particular was ridiculous by forcing you to include Allete a weak underleveled, useless, character that, thanks to the poor story telling, I couldn't care less about. This game is ovepriced and very unsatisfying in the end. unless you have actually beaten it; dont fool yourself. this game leaves much to be desired. Maybe if more than a handful of people worked on it or they had another few years and double the money things would be different but this games ambition is too great for its own good. there are so many pointless features like the map for example and I'm completely disenchated by this game now. I would definitely think twice before buying any product from this company again. They owe every person who purchased it the rest of their unfinished game.			"

												Banner Saga is a fairly basic tactics/strategy RPG with an equally basic FTL-style semi-random adventure filling in time between fights. You watch a cutscene where a bunch of surly-looking white people with consonant-heavy names like Hrthfalk or Vrmnyr glare at each other, then choose a dialogue option. Something will happen, then you'll be treated to a 15-60 second unskippable, unspeed-up-able clip of your caravan walking to the right. Then an event will happen, which will most likely lead to a fight. The combat is super simple and not really worth discussing; imagine Advance Wars with even less depth and breadth. Fighting and choosing dialogue options makes up 99% of your gameplay, and about 20% of your time spent on Banner Saga in total. Yes, there really is that much fluff.Much like FTL, the events that happen to your characters and the choices you're given are often obscure. A made-up example for the sake of avoiding spoilers: someone is coming over the hill. Do you kill them, or welcome them with open arms? Kind of a dumb question; you don't really know enough to make a good decision. Choosing either is ridiculous, yet Banner Saga forces you to make these sort of choices all the time.The advertising copy for Banner Saga touts its difficult choices, but the choices are ""difficult"" for all the wrong reasons. Normally, that would be annoying enough to cause me to stop playing, but the outcomes of the events didn't bother me. I'd gain a few supplies, or lose a few dozen men in my army, or in the worst case, an actual hero would die. But I have lots of heroes, and as for the army...The army you're given charge of does almost nothing in this game, and exists solely as a currency you can gain or lose via random events. Ditto with the supplies that they consume. They only effect they have on your actual fighting is a small increase or decrease to a single stat for your real characters during fights. The RPG-standards, Experience and Gold, have been combined into a single resource, Renown, that you must divide up as you see fit. You won't have enough to do everything; you're going to have to balance levelling up your heroes with purchasing army supplies and equippable trinkets. I think this is actually really well-designed and I liked it a lot, but it has one glaring flaw.Renown being so precious means that the Right Choice is almost always the one that leads to a fight. You get Renown not only for winning fights, but also for each individual kill. So the safest way to go through the game is to kill everything and everyone, every chance you get. This way you can keep a well-stocked army with lots of high-level heroes. It's pretty unintuitive, and also makes you fight a lot more times than the meager battle system can really be interesting for.I played this game a lot longer than I was expecting to. None of the systems by themselves are very good, and they don't really form a cohesive experience. I kept expecting something interesting to happen, but I just go more and more of the same. If you really, really like the art and story, maybe you can get through this, but I personally found both pretty mediocre. I give this game a 5/10 - it's not *bad* bad, but it's not really worth the time.			"

												The Banner Saga definitely looks beautiful, and it will suck you in with it's nice story and voice acting (where available xD), but in the end it did not deliver the full blown experience I expected...The Banner Saga is somewhat like rail-RPG. You have a few tough decisions, but in the end, the game has it's somewhat linear path and will play along while you watch. It is not necessarily a bad thing, but not everyone likes it that way. During the game, you will be in control of few characters and their caravans, travelling through Viking inspired lands of humans and giants... When in combat, you will choose a party of available characters and fight in turn-based map (similar to Heroes). Nice touch is when you fight in big battles and have more options before and after combat, that will affect the outcome of the battle. Anyway, after combat, you get Renown points and each character can level up (if they killed enough enemies) by spending Renown from the pool. Renown is also used for trading supplies and items.Aside from visuals, combat is pretty much the best part of the game... It is both simple and fast, but not so easy to master, which is great.And now for the cons; By far, my biggest letdown in the game is its ending... It is very anticlimactic and abrupt... The whole story is nicely presented, it keeps you going and then BAM! It's over... They were obviously getting ready for the second part, but nevertheless, it left the bitter taste in the end... Second bad thing would be the Renown point system (which I explained earlier mostly because of this). Anyway, since game is (except for combat) similar to choose-your-own-adventure book, you are not able to fight when you want and how much you want (or need); you have a very limited amount of Renown points. And since these are used for everything (leveling up, buying items and supplies to keep caravan alive), you need to be careful with how you spend them; and then, you level up some guy, spend a large amount of renown, and he dies in the next scene, and you can do nothing about it. Although, it is realistic to not have ability to control everything, it is still frustrating, and game should not (as they cannot) be 100% realistic...Short version;Pros:- Absolutely beautiful visuals- Really, really pretty visuals... Trust me xD- Nice voice acting and script...- Story is nice and compelling for the most part- Combat is GREAT!- Music is really nice and adds to atmosphere- The game is pretty much choose-your-own-adventure book (if you like that)Cons:- Game ends abruptly- Renown system is nice and simple, but frustrating sometimes (read up for more info xD)- The game is pretty much choose-your-own-adventure book (if you don't like that)Anyway, I liked this game and enjoyed most of the time I played it... I do recommend it, and I plan on playing the second part, too...			"

												Nice visuals, music, and story (bad script, though). Decent combat mechanics but very limited customizability. The major problem with The Banner Saga is that the bulk of the game is just a Viking themed Oregon Trail where ""decisions"" that you have to make have random unpredictable outcomes (including killing off major party members). This is very frustrating. The game also gives the illusion of an open world with a huge map, but you have almost no choice where to go. Would not recommend to anyone unless it was on sale.			"

												I really like SRPGs and I had high hopes for this game. I was a Kickstarter backer at one of the mid tiers.It just isn't very good. The combat system is terrible and actually penalizes you for killing your enemies. Optimal strategy is to whittle enemies down to low str (because of the dumb hp=attack strength system) and make the weaker enemies waste enemy turns. It's unintuitive and unsatisfying.The battles all feel the same because the terain is all flat and boring. The game consists of terrible battles, boring watching your people walk animations, and cutscenes where you have to make decisions with no idea what the result will be. These are probably the worst and I quit the game after one of these random decision events killed off my most powerful character. That just isn't fun. This game just isn't fun. I give up. "

												The Banner Saga is a refreshing blend of a traditional tactics game and a survival game - think Final Fantasy Tactics meets Oregon Trail! The game is filled with beautiful landscapes and a delightfully interactive storyline that'll see you wondering if you can really if it's really worth inviting a drunk varl to join you...If you really dig the single player or maybe just want to preview the game play, there is also a free to play multiplayer version of the game called ""The Banner Saga: Factions"".

												Tactical Oregon Trail with Norse warriors and giants!+Atmosphere+Story and characters+Choice elements that can impact your party and caravan+Interesting classes, races, and abilities for tactical combat-Combat becomes repetetive-Game feels a bit long-Poor save system can result in replaying long battlesWhile not exactly bad, I have to say that the combat system, specifically the way turns are taken, is strange. The combat plays out in turns with one or your characters getting a turn and then one of the enemy characters. When you're evenly matched or even slightly out-numbered, this isn't noticable. It becomes noticable when you have 6 characters, the enemy has 3, and the enemy characters are getting 2 turns to your 1. This can actually be a huge advantage for the enemy.The way turns are taken, forces you to employ a tactic to maim the enemy but not kill them until almost all of them are maimed. The reason maiming is effective is because enemies with low health don't hit as hard. By leaving maimed enemies on the field, you're often ensuring the enemy turn is ineffective.The impact of low health on combat effectiveness is great. It brings a very interesting mechanic to the game. Unfortunately, you're forced to use it every single time you're in combat. The lack of choice in combat tactics is what makes the combat feel so repetetive, which is a same because the game is, otherwise, very enjoyable.			"

												Beautiful. Challenging. And addicting.It's rare that a turn based game draws me like Banner Saga has.... But Banner Saga is different.  The difficulty level is the biggest pleasure to me.  This game is tough until you really learn the mechanics of battle.  There is tons of depth (skill points, equipment, different types of units) to keep you coming back for more.  Every decision you make (apparently) changes the story...

												There's something about this game that I can't put my finger on. It might be the entracing music, the Disney quality hand-drawn art, or perhaps it's the fact that everytime I play this game it's always 30 minutes later than I expected it to be. The combat is simple, for the uninitiated. As you begin to dive into the character types, their respective special attacks, and equipable items, you'll soon realize that there is a depth to the combat that will keep you coming back. When the odds are seemingly against you, and you do in fact manage to reduce your foe to a single unit vs. one or more of your own, you will feel like a champion. A real champion.What has surprised me the most about The Banner Saga is the number of choices and chances the game allows. Every combat decision, every discussion, every step on the map brings consequences.I can't tell you whether or not you should buy The Banner Saga, but I can tell you that you would almost be a fool not to.

												When I first got this game, I was reminded of Fire Emblem's combat system crossed with a couple choices I thought had no impact on the game. I was wrong, and I am very happy about that.First off, the combat is reminiscent of Fire Emblem, but it is actually much deeper with the addition of the willpower mechanic, separate health bars for Strength and Armor, and several abilities. It takes only the tutorial to get used to the combat system, but I find myself 5 hours in and I still discover things I didn't know. There is also a sort of mass combat system, where you issue a command to the troops that follow you and then dive into combat. This mass combat system, however bare bones, feels like it belongs, although it could use some improving, because as far as I can tell there are only four commands.The story is great, and more then earns it's title as a saga. Despite being a dying world,  as the gods are all dead and the sun has stopped in the center of the sky , its people are alive and vibrant, struggling to survive on this barren world. It reminds me of the D&D setting Dark Sun, except there is still some hope left in the world, however flimsy. You grow attached to characters, mourning their failures and deaths and cheering when they do something cool. At least twice I have figuratively shot myself in the foot to save a character I cared about.The art is beautiful, and I'm honestly not sure it would work in any other style. The art is realistic enough to portray the humans as human, but stylized enough to make the varl, who are awesome horned giants, and the enemy Dredge, who appear to be some form of automaton, seem right at home in the world.And the lore, don't even get me started. I play a lot of Dungeons and Dragons (and other role-playing games), and normally play the role of the GM, which means I do a lot of world building. As such, I apprieciate it when a game puts effort into building an interesting world, and I can often kill hours just reading lore and pouring over in-game maps. Stoic has created an excellent world for this, and I have been specifically avoiding the map in The Banner Saga because I know if I don't, I will read every entry and spend two hours doing nothing important.However, this game is not without it's faults (although some of these ""faults"" may just be personal preference). First off, the game feels hard. It isn't, at least not on the difficulty I'm playing on, but it feels as if I'm doing everything wrong. Second, it is a very dense game. As much as I love it, I can only play for maybe an hour before my head starts to hurt and I have to shut it off. This is only a complaint in that I have to shut off the game, and it's a fantastic game.In short, if you want a game with a deep story, deep combat, and deeper lore, play the Banner Saga. If you want a game where you make decisions, play the Banner Saga. If you want a game where the entire world is putty in your hands, play something else, because the Banner Saga is harsh and unforgiving.			"

												The Banner Saga is quite the story, actually, most of the game is just that, story, history, dialogue, choices and characters that interact with one another. A Viking themed inspired game, The Banner Saga is heavily inspired by Kay Neilsen’s art as well as John Hench’s art on Disney’s The Sleeping Beauty (my favorite Disney, as a matter of fact, because it’s all so god damn gorgeous.) The story revolves around the return of a great evil, the Dredge, and Bellower, an invincible boss ♥♥♥ Dredge. The game has you play two groups of people/armies, as the both journey through the land, running away from the Dredge, running to it, or just running. The game, although heavily focused on story, having you read through quite a lot of text and dialogue, remains very interactive. As you Journey, you have to make sure to care for your caravan, the people in it, the rations of food, and who you choose to or not let join your group. The environment, the world, the look of Banner Saga was so very beautiful that I couldn’t stop myself from taking far too many screenshots, and I’m not sure what I’ll do with all of them.The gameplay of Banner Saga is a turn based, strategic kind of battle system. Each of your character has a specific class and/or set of abilities, which you can level up and strengthen as they are used in your battles, the highest level is 10, and I originally though that was a bit limiting, but it turned out not to be limiting at all, as this turned out to be a shorter game than I expected. Elves, dwarves, orcs, humans, your basic and adored fantasy stuff, accompanied with an absolutely wonderful and immersive orchestrated soundtrack by the Dallas Wind Symphony and written by the great Austin Wintory, along with a lot of other musicians I quite frankly want to bow down to.The Banner Saga was a great story. As a bookworm, and avid gamer, it took some of my favorite things, the look of Sleeping Beauty, stories, reading, fantasy and a really great turn based system that I think continues to be grossly underrated, and made something quite frankly, absolutely beautiful. I only wish that the game had been a tad longer, as the ending took me by surprise and left me dissatisfied, I wanted more. The replay value of the game I had yet to test, but I have no doubt that I would very much enjoy this game another time. There’s something I’d like to take the time to dive a little deeper into, actually:The Female Characters of The Banner Saga; There were a lot of things that I noticed happening or being said in the game that pleased me. In one the groups that you follow/lead there is Alette. Established as an amazing archer, I was often afraid that Alette would be refused by her father to show her skills and even participate in the battles, as a lot of female characters are. Introduced as fighters but reduced to watching the men fight from the sidelines. This was not the case. All of the female characters introduced in the game, Alette, Oddleif, Ysra and Nid, all participated to the battles. There were many lines where you are given the option to take away their agency and refuse their demands of, say, training the civilian women to know how to fight, or approve, and the dialogue between the fame characters and you are quite nice. “A strong woman, what does that even mean?” Yes, what DOES that even mean, Oddleif? *slams fits onto table*9/10 Con: Female characters are all archers and thus have the same animation. I often made the choice to leave out most of them and rarely have them in my party as they all seemed a lot of the same thing, someone from the Banner Saga has since contact me to tell me that this was something they were asked to change, and was thus changed for Banner Saga 2, I am very curious to check this out. Con: Too short.Pro: ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful, great soundtrack (Actually all the sounds in this game were really great), loved the story, the concept, made me think of a Lord of the Rings type of game with a whole lot of Disney in it.

A bleak, beautiful & relentless indie with plenty going for it in the turn-based tactics department.The small developer Stoic has pleasantly surprised with how well things go together in their game, The Banner Saga.  Art, music & story combine to provide a haunting world that drew me in.  The combat mechanics are a genuinely fresh twist on turn-based tactics for me too.My expectations were entirely met given the information provided on the Steam store page.  What I enjoyed most: Lore and setting inspired by Viking mythology. A soundtrack I immediately wanted on my playlist. A great art style with plenty of 2.5D hand drawn stuff (apparently inspired by Eyvind Earle, an artist I was previously unfamiliar with). Story & characters that moved me in spite of how brief the game actually is. A unique combat mechanic that provided solid fun & challenge.The story successfully creates a serious feeling of relentlessness, thanks to the Dredge presence & the caravan mode.  The lore mostly is on the surface with no opportunity to delve deeper into any history or such, but what's there is fun.  Character interaction is engaging through the entire game.  One thing that I find very odd is that the writing & dialogue reads like a bad translation into English.  I can't see any reason why that should be the case.I like the combat a lot.  Two of the primary stats are Armor & Strength.  Strength doubles as both Hit Points & damage dealt with normal attacks.  Armor mitigates Strength damage, but can in turn be reduced by armor-break attacks.  This puts a nice spin on the conventional experience.  There are light RPG elements as well.  Kills grant ""Renown,"" a currency used either to level up heroes (boosting their special abilities along with one or two stats) or to purchase Supplies and/or items at markets.  You'll need Supplies to keep your caravan alive & fed as they journey across a land dotted with cities, ruins, forests & a lot of dangerous encounters.Player choice is encouraged in The Banner Saga & results in a variety of good or bad outcomes for your combat encounters, caravan or individual heroes.  Yes, a game in which story decisions actually can make things easier or harder!  Most of these choices seem straightforward, although one or two felt arbitrary to me, as if any choice would end up hurting somehow.  These tough moments are just part of the game & in my opinion amplify the tension, desperation & relentlessness that characterize the plot.Of three difficulties (Easy, Medium, Hard) I did a playthrough on Medium & managed to nab more than half of the achievements.  It's hard to keep your caravan's morale from dipping too low!  I gave up on Hard difficulty.  Medium provided significant challenge.  I certainly had moments of frustration retrying fights after defeat, but each time changing my tactics worked out fine.This is the first of a planned series and I eagerly await the next installment which will supposedly be available in 2015.  If you're a player like me who appreciates artsy indie games, I'd recommend this highly.  Also recommended for any player who enjoys turn-based strategy & RPGs. "

												If you had asked me 5 hours into this game if I enjoyed it, I would have said yes.   The art is beautiful, the combat is interesting when you first play with it, and the story feels epic.  But about 10 hours in (at the end of the game) there are so many flaws you had to endure that you will be yelling at the computer.  You are given really sparadoic choices in an Oregon trail like traveling sequence,  which can kill off main characters that you love. So you try to reload realizing that the game only saves at the beginning of major battles. Meaning if you ever want to redo a choice, you just wasted 30 minutes because you have to do it all over again.  It made me so jaded that I just moved through the game without caring what happened.  (I got the achievement for forced march without even trying.)  The story is very vague and frustrating.  No one knows what's happening, that is what you will hear for 90% of the game.  No battles are a challenge, except the final boss battle, which because manipulating turn order is such a slog, is ridiculously frustrating. Not difficult, just frustrating as you try to kill a boss that keeps regenerating it's life while killing your men.If you still want to buy this game even though the gameplay is so weak: Here's a spoiler free tip for combat: don't kill anyone.  Just weaken them to 1 str and then kill them all. You're welcome.			"

												The tactical, grid-based combat mechanic is done well. You have to take the time to think through your moves and watch the opponent's turns closely if you want to complete the game on a harder difficulty, but defeating the enemies without losing any of your characters is rewarding enough to do that. I, however, was personally looking for a more chill experience, so I played the game on easy and massively enjoyed it that way.The story was surprisingly deep and immersive, and I found myself really mulling over every decision the characters face. Also, the artwork in this game is beautiful. Overall, I enjoyed it a lot, but I don't have a strong urge to go back and play it again on a harder difficulty.			"

												I really like the concept of this game. Banner saga introduces several new genre elements:1) Your damage output depends on how much health you have2) Decisions you make between battles can be life and death for your characters3) Turn order changes based on the number of remaining characters on each sideI think 1 & 2 are really awesome, but 3 detracts from the experience for me. Instead of trying to kill your opponents, each battle is a struggle to keep as many enemies alive as possible, but with only 1 - 2 life remaining, so they can't do any damage. If you kill an opponent, then the remaining enemies move up in order (essentially getting more turns), which means if there is a powerful enemy in a battle, then by the end, they go every other turn. Enemies like Bellower that heal on their turn make this mechanic even more ridiculous.If they make a banner saga 2 or come out with additional content, I hope they consider using a standard turn mechanic, where killing an enemy is actually favorable. Also, the map gives the illusion that the game is an open world with lots of travel options, but you are given very few opportunities to make travel choices; I'd like to see more variety in travel.

												""Only the sun has stopped. ""That is how it all starts. But you aren't some lone adventurer trying to make the world work right again. In this decidedly Norse-inspired story, you are merely a person with the mantels of leadership thrust upon you, even if you don't really want to be responsible for the hundreds of clansmen, fighters and varl that trail after your banner. But they are your people now, and as each day passes you begin to understand how every decision you make has a consequence-- and that sometimes, even if there really isn't a good decision to be had... you still have to choose.AESTHETICSThis game is beautiful.One of the reasons I fell in love with Banner Saga is for its visuals. Aside from the fact that almost each and every piece of screenshot is an elegant work of art, the overall sound and music provide the mood for a sombre yet fairytale-like journey. The UI and animation in-game are also beautiful to look at and harks back to a time when animation styles were traditional and organic. The characters are also very well designed, as was the overall lore that added a sense of depth and mystique without using the standard RPG fare. I wish they could have had more time for delving deeper or a longer plotline, because at times it felt as if some parts were intriguing but left untapped.NARRATIVEBut what made it even more beautiful was its ""weight"". This game is the great kind of narrative, and one that you can participate in. Although other games usually give users free reign over characters' choices and plot lines (choices are technically as simple) Banner Saga gives implicitly moral dilemmas and decisions where you aren't particularly certain of the outcome-- much like in real life. And like real life, some outcomes may be grave.BATTLE SYSTEMYou are in control of your battles. Although the battle system takes a bit of getting used to, it makes tactical warfare as engrossing with all unique abilities per character. They all play differently. This is especially interesting because you feel like you are fighting as individuals and not as a certain class type. I admit, there are points where the UI or gameplay mechanics can be improved (an undo walk button? a way to know spell range before moving?) and the standard tactics would really be to maim rather than kill, but I think that they balanced this splendidly enough because I was neither too disheartened nor did I find it too easy to use. Overall, my experience with Banner Saga was wonderful. I recommend it to people who love narratives, pretty art and vikings, to people who are insightful about leadership, who want to manage circumstance and to people who are interested in thinking through their battles. I recommend it to people who are open to the possibility of their hearts breaking, and to those who are willing to give it some 12-14 hours of love. I thoroughly enjoyed my journey. <3			"

												An interesting game with an amazing soundtrack and art design team. Perhaps one of the freshest games to appear on the PC scene in the early 2010's, albeit carrying with it a cumbersome battle system that makes even the SNES die-hards who sat through Ogre Battle laugh at it.No one can deny the beauty of this game's art direction paid in homage to the late and great Eyvind Earle of Sleeping Beauty fame, but its the brass trumpets and wood flutes that echo through the ice fields of Austin Wintory's soundtrack that truly triumph. Yet there is always a niggling feeling whenever I am thrust in to a battle. When it comes to crafting strategy RPGs the greatest game of all to take inspiration from is chess. I adore chess, but chess doesn't make me grind my teeth. I'm hoping that the team go back and refine the battle system a little more for the later games. Tweak it here, twink it there, and the final result should end up palatable.Another sticking point is the overall story. It tries to achieve the same grand scale that its visual and aural brothers easily scale, but we have all seen and read tales that depict an immense calamity that greatly determines the fates and destiny of the powerful few. Granted The Banner Saga contains stories that may seem slightly original, and the plot twists (alongside brutal character choices) make up for it, but I would have loved a Norse-inspired saga with more races or cultures or whatever. Instead it's mostly a landlocked ice nation that revolves around one shamanistic religion. Those who demand cake will never always be served cake so my antagonist attitude toward this game, especially in the light of this game riding off Kickstarter with a very small crew, shall remain nothing more than personal wishes.I will however raise my hat to those in the lore department. You made the map experience absolutely delightful and original. Thank you.If anything - play The Banner Saga for the truly epic scope crafted within the art field. It is a beautiful game with a strong heartbeat and many will not be disappointed. I look forward to the sequels within the trilogy.			"

												Loved everything about this game. While some may complain about the combat, I found it tactical and rewarding. It also helps if you've played the free multiplayer version, The Banner Saga: Factions. More voice acting and animations would have helped, but it was a kickstarter game, so apparently they were short on money. I only wish it were a bit longer, and am really looking forward to and hoping for the next chapter to come out in the future.			"

												A beautiful game with a great story and a brilliant combat system.The graphics are beautiful, the scenery is absolutely amazing and the fluid animation is very well done. This game is forged by your choices... Every choice you make has its effects, making or breaking relationships, saving or sacrificing the lives of your caravan, finding or losing supplies and wealth. The combat is tactical and turned-based, (Similiar to games such as Disgaea, Final Fantasy Tactics, Suikoden etc.) but is unique to anything I've played before due to its Willpower system. Using your Willpower sparingly and at the right moment can really turn the battle in your favor. The music score is also brilliant, it's the icing on the cake.I don't want to spoil anything about the story, but I will say it's compelling, it really does leave you wanting more. Also, as the story is shaped by the choices you make, I'm sure it'll be a different experience the second time around.It's rare to see this type of game now'a'days, truly a hidden gem.			"

												A really great narrative game. The combat is simple and interesting, but you may find it repetitive. The storytelling is excellent, I love the artistic style, it goes neatly with the music and even the story itself, curious a thing as that is to say. But really, the big draw is that you get given a lot of decisions to make. Some that seem small, some that *are* small, and some that seem, and are, huge. And they all have pretty significant implications for how your story will pan out. Better yet, the choices you have to make aren't just bland good guy/bad guy caricatures. They're genuinely tough decisions that simple morality can't always answer. Loved it. Loved my time playing it, will love playing it again some time in the future.			"

												Beautiful and grim. Fatalistic and daring. Everything from the characters, to your choices makes the Banner Saga an incredibly memorable experience. If you have ever enjoyed games like Shining Force, Ogre Battle, Guardian War, or Final Fantasy: Tactics this game is for you. A mesmerizing art style draws the player in and helps to make your choices (and their consequences) that much more painful. Combat is very satisfying and challenging. If you have ever enjoyed Norse mythology, the Poetic Edda, or Viking Metal then welcome aboard. This is not a cheery world, and the sense of lingering despair and hoplessness may be oppressive to some just looking for a simple teen hero saves the world story. Highly recommended.			"

												This is a beautiful turn-based-strategy RPG. I was really drawn to the cartoon-like aesthetic. Unfortunately, only the opening cinematic is fully animated, but the rest of the game is still beautiful. The setting is vaguely Scandinavian-ish fantasy, featuring men, Varl (a race of horned giants), and the Dredge (a race of stone creatures that are invading the land). It is the end of the world, with a unique apocalyptic fantasy feel.The game is a mix of tactical combat and leading your caravan by making lots of little decisions as you travel. Some decisions have big long term consequences, which is nice. Once I got into the game a few hours, I got invested in the few main characters' stories. I really enjoyed the game and found a couple moments emotionally touching.The combat mechanics are pretty gamey in some ways. You and the enemy alternate taking turns with a single fighter, even if you don't have the same number of fighters. Losing one of your characters effectively lets your other characters act more often. If either side loses all but one character, the game switches to ""pillage mode"", where all characters on one side get a turn before the single enemy does. It encourages you to keep some enemies weakened but alive until you can take out all the more powerful enemies.I switched between 'Normal' and 'Easy' periodically throughout the game. There's quite a big difference between them. The final battle, especially, I found impossibly difficult on normal, but unexpectedly easy on easy.Highly recommended if you like turn-based strategy and the cartoon-like visuals.			"

												Okay, so the game's pretty as ♥♥♥♥ and has an amazing musical score that's dynamically implemented.  That's great and all, but I care about how a game PLAYS.  And to put that into perspective, we're going to have to get some ♥♥♥♥ out of the way right off the bat.This game is a step away from the ordinary.  Some people are going to be turned off by that.  In fact, some people will cry.Me?  I praise the sun.See, The Banner Saga isn't a game that holds you by the hand.  It informs you of things to a degree, drops a few hints in the narration and dialogue that you have to actively seek out, and then expects you to make an educated guess on how the world around you will react to your choices.  And trust me, it doesn't always react nicely.  You'll have party members smashed for doubting in your own abilities.  You'll have friends betray you because you stuck to your opinion just a little more than they'd like.  You'll get mad.Deal with it.One of the best things about this game is that it's about prediction and reaction.  You're always given enough to predict things well enough, if you see the subtle signs in front of you.  And whether you catch those signs properly or not, you'll be reacting to how things play out, so keep a cool head and salvage your situation the best way possible.  Ultimately, you can replay it again and try to not make the same mistakes you did the first time around.  See how it changes your story.  I can guarantee that there will still be surprises even your third time around.  Replay value is basically the name of the game.  It's long enough to be an adventure, but short enough to keep multiple plays from becoming tedious and grinding.  There's a lot of choice, big and small, and all of it will impact your story in a major way by the end.The combat, in a similar vein, is largely randomized encounters.  You can affect the difficulty of each war encounter by how you choose to approach it as well.  Rush in and take on the harder enemies to spare your army?  Take a cautious approach and let your army take the brunt of the forces so your own battles are less stressful?  There's a handful of possibile approaches that further alter your experience.  And don't let the simplicity of the combat statistics fool you, there's a lot of ♥♥♥♥ to think about for every battle.For everyone who's had the opportunity to learn the battle system via multiplayer battles in Factions, it's second nature already, but for all newcomers...there's a lot of subtle things that matter in very major ways.  Positioning is key.  Killing vs crippling a target can vastly affect momentum swings.  Effective use of willpower can clutch out an entire battle.  Sometimes letting a few allies actually die is exactly what you need to do to win.  There's a lot of forethought that can be applied and number crunching is crucial.  Can it be brutal at times?  Absolutely.  But it's never unfair.So, let's sum this all up.  -Do you value transparency in choices?  -Do you like to know exactly what's going to happen before you do anything?-Do you usually follow a walkthrough when playing through a game for the first time?-Do you reload whenever a character permanently dies?-Do you get frustrated when you can't just kill everything in your way?Sorry, game's probably not your cup of tea.-Do you like thinking ahead to predict outcomes?-Do you like learning how to manipulate a system to your advantage?-Do you value strategy over action?-Do you like role playing and value decision making?-Are you capable of taking responsibility for poor choices?If these are the case, be prepared for an amazing experience you'll never forget.With that said, this game gets my full recommendation.  I also encourage anyone interested to give The Banner Saga: Factions a try first, since it's free and will let you experience the battle system to your heart's content.			"

												The Banner Saga excels at telling a story in a way most games do not. The clans in Banner Saga sew their history into the fabric of the banner they carry. As you lead your clan through trying times and your story is sewn into the banner, you can't help but feel you are apart of something bigger. As you play, you are swept up into a vivid and palpable world that becomes your own. If that's not enough for you, the game is also full of exquisite art, a beautiful soundtrack, and challenging turn-based combat. This game is excellent. 10 out of 10.			"

												An exciting game. Very enjoyable, given that you know what to expect.Gameplay: First thing to note - this isn't a traditional CRPG at all. No open world, no exploring, no looting random enemies etc. etc. Basically, the game consists of story given in textual form plus tactical battles. Surprisingly enough, this game is actually very much like a Japanese visual novel: making choices in dialogues with some fighting in between. Nothing wrong with that, but I guess there are people who dislike that kind of stuff.Combat system: The game has an original turn-based combat system which can be a bit confusing in the beginning, but is, in fact, very consistent and coherent. Fights are interesting and challenging - this game isn't easy at all at Normal difficulty (though it isn't exactly hard, the balance is just right). So that part of the game is very well-executed.Graphics: The artwork in the game is to die for! For me at least it was love at first sight. I actually find it quite difficult to stop pressing F12 all the time. Every single screenshot is a piece of art!Music: Good, adequate, though I'm not exactly willing to listen to that soundtrack when not in game. Which isn't a bad thing, there aren't that many game soundtracks that can stand on their own.Story: I'm not quite finished with it so it's a bit early to say, but so far - not bad at all. And I would definitely play again to see what different choices can lead to. All is well here. If it wasn't for one thing... which is in fact the only thing I didn't exactly like about the game ->Writing: This is the only thing I find somehow... lacking. Don't get me wrong, I like the plot, I like the characters. I don't like writing itself, because it lacks style, it lacks flavor. It wouldn't be such a big deal if this game wasn't at least 50% textual. I'm not saying that all the characters have to speak like they are in the poetic Edda, but all those ""ok"", ""crap"", ""yeah"" and ""everything was a mess""-sort of descriptions are not to my liking. And there are typos too. As a part of the game, it's not crucial, because there's also artwork and music and other things. But had this been a book... I'd probably deem it a poorly-written one.			"

												A good game but not for everyone especially twitchy youngsters. It have some downsides like a bit to linear and that a lot of the chooses that you make have bad results or really bad ones. May just be me choosing badly of course, second playthrough should shine some light on that.The story is excellent such good writing and really capture the feel of dread and fleeing for your life chased by an overwhelming enemy. There is some light points and some humour in there as well to balance that out. The artstyle is so beautiful and every frame is so well crafted. Combat is fun and interesting even if it took me some time to get used to it and understand it completely and all hail turnbased combat I missed you so. If I should bring something up that is kind of bad and that frustrated me a bit it's the resource part of the game and the severely limited quantity of it. Sure one could say it portrays the flight and scarcity of supplies for refugees in war time. But when you use the same resources to buy food and equipment as you use for levelling your fighters it get's a bit to much. If I had my way the levelling system should be separated with it's own points from the whole food and equipment currency. I had several fighters that could level up ones or twice even but no possibility to because I needed to buy food for my caravan. Could not buy items for them and even if I could they would have been to low level to use them.Over all though it is a good game and for me worth the money and I do hope to see more as it's set up for a sequel or another chapter or two. Well done, well done.			"

												The art-style of the Banner Saga is absolutely amazing. The gameplay, unfortunately, is less so.For anyone looking for a deep story-based Choose Your Own Adventure, I would strongly recommend King Of Dragonpass instead. At least the first installment of the Banner Saga falls desperately short of this. There are some decisions to make, but they only have an impact on a few scenes wide and far between. Occassionally the loss or gain of a character indicates interesting opportunities, but these are sparse.I had a lot of fun playing the Banner Saga, even though the obvious lack of consequences to whatever I did along the road was highly disappointing in the end.Maybe - and I really hope so - there will be real story-changing consequences to my actions in the later parts of the Banner Saga.I recommend getting the game, but only if you've already done playing King of Dragonpass and itch for something similar if less sophisticated. The art-style and music make for a wonderful journey, though one that leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste.			"

												I can't even be bothered to go into detailed analysis on why you should buy this game.This is the single most beautiful (drop-dead gorgeous/stunning/breathtaking/jawdropping/insert synonym here, all apply) and atmospheric game I've ever played in my LIFE, and I'll be upset (and maybe cry) if you think I'm exaggerating. I clicked ""Play"" not knowing what to expect, and then nearly played the whole thing through in one sitting, holding my breath through most of it. It's like popping on the first episode of some show and then screaming at your monitor for a week straight, with foam at your mouth, a la raving lunatic fanboy/girl mode, because it ended with a cliffhanger and you're craving for MORE, DAMMIT. As implied, this is, unfortunately, only the first part of the trilogy and the second part isn't going to be out till 2015. Again, DAMMIT.If I were to sum it up quickly, it's like XCOM meets Oregon Trail meets Dragon Age (I mean, this IS being made by three former BioWare guys), except you control a bunch of burly, manly, hairy Vikings. Most of the time.But let me warn you, if you're expecting some sort of deep and complex strategic gameplay, you might as well just turn around and go back to said XCOM. This game is HEAVILY story driven - there's no guarantee a character X will stay by your side till the very end, whether you want it or not. So please, please, just SHADDAP YO FACES and enjoy the story, granted there'll be more of it. Soon™.			"

												TL;DR at the bottom.When I had first heard about this game, I was super excited. Turn based combat with a beautiful art style and vikings? YES PLEASE. So I picked it up during the steam summer sale and I played it. I was promptly disappointed.As I said before, the game has a beautiful art style, and a pretty interesting story. You lead a caravan of people running away from an ""evil"" army. You have to manage supplies and make a wide range of decisions that result in multiple outcomes. An example: Refugees approach your caravan, what do you do? A) kill them B) Take them in C) Send them away. Take them in? They could take supplies and run or reveal a hidden cache of supplies to help you. Being able to spend the game making choices throughout the ""journey"" is what would have made the banner saga a fantastic game. It has some measure of replayability trying out different options/choices and as I said, the story is actually interesting and had me intrigued enough to not put the game down.So why don't I recommend this game? Well the crux of the game is the turn based combat. The combat is similar to a lot of other turn based games but it has been simplified. The combat gets really boring after a few battles. The battles never really vary, there all pretty much the same thing. No difference in environment, no real tactical decisions during combat. Its dry, repetitive combat. The units don't do anything to improve this.The units you get throughout the game have different abilities, which is cool, but they each only get one (ie a wide swing that hits 3 units, or a shield bash that knocks units back) dull ability. The units themselves can only level up to level 5. Which is a pretty low cap for leveling units. Leveling them does make them stronger, and make their respective abilities better but its almost a chore. I LOVE building strong characters, I spent many hours playing fire emblem, final fantasy tactics and other similar games building strong characters with interesting abilities. In this game the abilities are bland and leveling your characters isn't interesting or fun. Sure it's necessary for progression, but its a chore.So we have a low level cap, boring units, boring abilities and boring combat. What else? The LENGTH of this game is INCREDIBLY short. I have 7 hours played, and I've beaten the game. From what I understand, this game is a part of a trilogy, and the second part will be released after a short break from the development team. So that begs the question, why is this game 24.99 for a few meagre hours of gameplay. Its entirely possible the second saga of this trilogy will take your characters from before, raise their caps and continue with the admittedly interesting story, but that doesn't change the fact that the first game in the series is dull and it relies on a second game to make itself worth anything. TL;DR:Despite the cool choice system, the art style, and the story, the game falls flat. The core aspects of the game such as the combat and character leveling/abilities are bland, and the length is appallingly short. The game does have replayability, as you can pick different choices every playthrough, but personally, the incentive of a different outcome is not worth playing anymore of the combat. This game simply isn't worth it. Maybe in a few years when its dirt cheap or comes with the supposed other 2 games in this trilogy. As a standalone game, 24.99 isn't worth a decent story and some pretty pictures. Especially since the combat feels like a chore, especially after you've seen how the short story ends.			"

												Wow, what a gem!The art and soundtrack is fantastic. The story will draw you in. The characters and their dialogue are entertaining. The tactical turn-based combat is challenging and therefore rewarding. Choices you're faced with can severely alter your line-up, for better or worse and it's generally not apparent which decision will make it go either way.  My only gripe, I would like to have experienced the great voice acting that the narrator would drop once a chapter or so, since a good portion of the game is reading dialogue. But, for the price the lack of heavy, well-done voice acting is acceptable. In fact, I would prefer no voice acting if it meant avoiding sub-par cheesy voice acting due to budget constraints. I would love to a see a slightly more expensive sequel with a longer campaign and full voice acting.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this game. It's also the first game in a long time to make me want to play through again to try the other avenues of options.			"

												I only know of a few games and movies that are able to touch me in a way that The Banner Saga does. It does not offer many hours of content. It does not have any considerable replay value. It isn't even diverse in its gameplay. And yet it is a masterpiece. Embark on a journey through a Nordic themed world completely different from the clichés that the entertainment industry has thrown at us so far. Brought to life by one of the best storylines I have ever seen, every character you meet on the road matters. Decisions matter and have a profound influence on various outcomes. The narration is delivered with a voice and emotion perfectly fitting the setting, just like the music. I know it will be like one of my favourite books or the cutscenes from Myth: The Fallen Lords; I will come back every year, going through the story again, reveling in their splendour and how it manages to stir something within me. Complete immersion. I for one cannot wait for the next chapters in the saga.You will not regret buying this game. 10/10.			"

												  Haunting, beautiful, breathtaking game - The Banner Saga has more soul than any game in recent memory, *certainly* more heart than any game a major studio has produced in forever.  Games like this are the exact reason I support indie developers.  If you appreciate an enthralling story, a unique combat system and characters you actually care about, try this.  Gameplay-wise, it's Oregon Trail + Heroes of Might and Magic combat + Darklands village interactions, with a multi-tiered narrative and choices that are incredibly emotional.  Banner Saga pulls 0% punches, and you feel the results of your actions HEAVILY.  The game is relentless, and if you get into it at all be prepared to be left with a deep sorrow in the pit of your stomach, or to be on the edge of your seat, paranoid about what choice you'll have to make next - if Sophie's Choice had giants, it would be The Banner Saga.  As brutal as the game is, that's what makes it so alluring - your choices change the game entirely and none of the characters seem one-dimensional, so you WANT to play again to see what happens if you make this choice or that choice differently.  Even just watching your caravan walk through a gorgeous, hand-drawn landscape with snow falling is a sight to behold, and if you're the kind inclined to do so, may even choke you up a bit.  The emotion you feel while playing, bad or good, keeps you invested... and if a game makes you FEEL, it has succeeded entirely.  I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												The Banner Saga is Norse-themed, turn-based strategy game with a traveling system that seems like something of an homage to The Oregon Trail.  Though the story ends up being rather short (I completed my first playthrough in ten hours), it is very well done and kept me interested from start to finish.The experience and leveling system is unique and rewarding.  As you defeat enemies, win battles, and make choices during text-based events, you gain Renown, the currency used to purchase items, level up you heroes, and buy supplies.  On each level up, you can add two points to your hero's stats.  These stats include Armor (used to reduce incoming damage), Strength (used as both health and damage potential), Willpower (similar to stamina or mana in other games), Exertion (the amount of Willpower that can be used to boost movement or damage in a turn), and Break (used to reduce enemy armor).  Combat with these heroes is continually a balance between choosing to break enemy armor so that future attacks do more damage, or attacking to reduce health, which also reduces that targeted unit's damage potential by that amount.While traveling, your units will need supplies, which you purchase with Renown as well.  If you run out of supplies, the non-hero members of your caravan (Clansman, Fighters, Varl) will begin to starve and die off.  This will make enemy encounters far more challenging and dangerous.Finally, the text-based events of the game play a massive role throughout.  You will continually be cycling characters in and out of your party based on your decisions.  For example, it's possible to have a hero with you from start to finish, but it's also possible that you will get that same hero killed in the first event that they are involved in.  This, I found, is what truly made this game shine as a unique experience.I highly recommend this game to those who like tactical strategy games, Norse mythology, and deep storytelling. "

The combat is engaging as it is important to know when to strike an enemy's health or to break their armor. The characters you travel with are interesting with their own views of the situation for the most part. A couple of your members only show up once or twice and never appear again which is a bit of a shame. The lore in this game is actually quite cool to read which you can when you view the map.Nobody can talk about the Banner Saga without mentioning the artstyle. It's amazing and is truely wonderful to see though most of the cutscenes are just still images and that was a missed opportunity however the music is just as good and can really help immerse yourself in the game.The Banner Saga is a worthy game to play with good combat, great story and amazing art and music. It is a 9/10 and if you like the game the sequal is coming out sometime this year.			"

												Let me say the art and general atmosphere of the game is inspired. That being said, mechanics-wise, this game is frustrating. I was really looking for a new-style Final Fantasy Tactics or Orge Battle game, so take that as you will. The choices you make seem to be arbitrarily punished and affect your team permanently. It doesn't feel like a trade-off of strategies, but rather like a guessing game. Given that this isn't a rogue-like, the lack of control this imparts makes that playing the game discouraging. What's the point of restarting? I personally don't like feeling like I lost my way through a game, even if I win in the end, especially if there isn't a way I feel I could have improved.But this is exactly the way I felt playing The Banner Saga so I can't really recommend the game.

												Great game, highly recommended.+ Beautiful, hand drawn graphics+ Great soundtrack+ Atmosphere+ Challencing battles± Great story but it will continue in Banner Saga 2 (and probably in BS 3), so it ends bit abruptly.± Choices matter but not as much as i would like. Now you can get few characters killed by making bad choices and that's about it. You can still finish the game even if you get whole caravan starved to death.- Resource management. You get renown by winning battles and doing ""heroic deeds"", which is then divided between keeping your caravan alive, leveling heroes and buying items. In my first playthrough i made mistake by using too much renown on caravan and leveling wrong heroes, thus making end game too challencing.			"

												I bought this game under the premise that I was getting an in depth tactics based games were your decisions affected the story and the world around you, what I got instead was a lazily made snoozer of a game, where your decisions really have no affect on the game other than screwing you out of some supplies now and then, or killing off one of your characters. The game had some novel elements so I will list some pros and cons. PROS:Bold artworkDecent soundtrack (pretty good, nothing amazing though)Voice acting, what little there was, was pretty good. Pretty interesting storyI'm sure there were some other things about the game I enjoyed but I can't remember them CONS: Let me get this right, I can either buy items and supplies OR level up my characters?? I'm sorry but that's just stupid. In game they talk about goods costing MONEY not ""Renown"". This was a pointless trade off. Absolute minimal itemization. If you somehow manage to have enough renown to buy items (you won't) you can buy some items that have basically no affect on the game whatsoever, only they have level requirements and if you're spending renown on items you probably won't have any left over to level your guys. Yep, pretty stupid. The laziness in which the character portraits and animations are made. The art was interesting, but come on, one stance and animation for the entire game? Sometimes they try to make it look like everyone is standing around talking to eachother, but   it just doesn't work. If you didn't want to spend time making mulitple animations just don't do them at all. Instead you're left with some half finished piece of garbage. I remember arriving a town and meeting some Varl and thinking hmm, this guy looks familiar! Oh wait, that's because he was a complete clone of another character I had except he was wearing red instead of green. Same face, same weapon, same hair, same beard, same facial animations, literally the exact same character except his tunic was red instead of green. Shameful. The utter lack of abilities and customization. Each character has one ability and most of them are worthless. No skill trees, no talents. You get to put in stat points, but they have a cap and there really is no room for creativity. No topography on the battlefield. Every map was exactly the same, a large square with no obstacles or cover. They had some  interesting artwork, but it was all just the same square. Viking oregon trail. You just walk and walk and walk and walk and walk. Sometimes you get a choice! The choice usually screws you over or has no affect. Oh man I remember a game screen pops up and it talks about 'warfare mode' or something. I'm thinking, yeah, I have like 800 guys under my command right now, this will be one hell of a battle! Then a menu pops up and you're given a few choices with accompanying text (which is always the same, ALWAYS). It had potential and then just layed an egg. It was just the same ol battle again. The interface was terrible. Equipping items was weird. The promotion screen has no way to be closed and you have to exit the entire screen to get it to go away. IN SUMMARY:I bought this game for full price not knowing it was a kickstarter game. I was pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and thought it was a waste of money. Then I found out it was a kickstarter game and I thought ""Ah, I'll cut them some slack"" and then I got really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when I say that they raised around 700% more money than they asked for. So let me get this right, you rake in all this cash and then you fart out this half finished pile of rubbish with character clones, ♥♥♥♥ interface, 1 dimensional story and utter lack of depth and you charge $24.99??? AND, the game is ~8 hours long! 8 hours! Oh they're going to split it into a trilogy so they can charge you again and again for their half finished games! Brilliant. Raise a bunch of money on kickstarter, keep all of it for yourselves and then drill your customers. I love the preview videos, they show all these animation cutscenes which look awesome and then you buy the game and there's like maybe 2 or 3 of them. Seriously don't get tricked into buying this piece of garbage by all the fanboys. This game is miserable.  "

 Click here to check out my video review.The Banner Saga is a colorful tactical RPG by Stoic Games. The unique art style looks like a hand drawn cartoon but it doesn’t take away from the gravity of the plot.  The game primarily consists of two sections, the caravan and the battlefield.  The caravan is the player’s home base and mode of transportation.  A fair amount of time is spent watching the caravan travel along a 2d map as you travel, you encounter bandits, disease, fire, and numerous other things that can help you or kill of members of your group.  Most of the plot unfolds here as well.  The game does a great job of depicting the hopelessness and fear of your characters, but it’s worth noting that there is virtually no voice acting.  Reading the script isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but keep in mind there is a lot of dialogue to get through and that means a lot of reading. So be prepared.The combat is reasonably deep and combining health and attack power into a single statistic makes for a unique experience.  Unfortunately there can be quite a lot of repetitiveness in the battles.  After the first chapter or two, all of the non plot related fights feel far too similar.  Add that to the fact that there is no height in the battle field and the fights start blurring together.The art style has a unique beauty, and the combat is fun, if repetitive. If are okay with, or enjoy reading dialogue and like tactical RPGs then pick up a copy.  If you are on the fence then spend some time with the free multiplayer version, The Banner Saga Factions.  That might be good enough.			"

												The Gods are Dead.The lands of The Banner Saga are desolate and barren, the sun hang motionless in the sky, men speak of the end of days as death marches from the north. Stoic has made a game that is just like the land it is based in, stark, cold and beautiful.That beauty is the very first thing you will see when you begin your march in the banner saga. Half the time I was playing The Banner Saga I could not believe what I was looking at, the hand drawn feel and look of classic Disney or the better bits of ‘80s animation.  The aesthetic plays into gameplay as well, with the banner over your party getting bigger as your caravan gets bigger and as you accomplish what you can along your very hard journey. Characters and character classes have distinct looks which helps keep the many characters straight and to pick out what type of enemy you were fighting.The only place that the art slightly falls down is in the arenas that you spend a good chunk of your time in over the course of the game. They are simple grids, sometimes in interesting locations, other times in just fields of snow. There is no topography to the maps, which is good for keeping battles from getting too complex, but doesn’t help with battle variety.Tactical RPG battles are only part of the experience, but are quite important to the experience as a whole. The system brings some interesting mechanics to the tRPG genre while dropping some others. The central mechanic is built around managing two stats on both friends and foe over the course of a battle, Armor and Strength. Strength is interesting in that, it is both your health and how hard a character can hit. The more damage done to a character the less damage they can deal. That is where armor becomes important, blocking damage to strength and allowing characters to stay in battle. Being smart with how you balance your approach to the many fights that the game puts in your path will make impossible seeming battles, just barely winnable. Unit selection also plays a major role in The Banner Saga with not just character class mattering, but also character race. The game has two playable races, humans and Varl. Varl are half man half animal giants that take up four squares on the battle grid instead of one, they hit harder, but are far less mobile. Humans are smaller and can take less hits, but can pester enemies and make it possible to chase certain types of enemies down.Unlike some other games in the genre such as XCOM The Banner Saga does not feature permadeath in battles, but instead characters can be lost in a much more interesting way, your choices outside of battle.Story in The Banner Saga is second only to its art. The story is told from multiple perspectives, as characters deal with a world descending into chaos as an old enemy “the Dredge” a race of obsidian creatures invades from the north. The perspective shifts between an Varl Army and refugees fleeing from the dredge. I loved the contrast of the campaign trail  of the well stocked army of Varl Warriors as it marches home with the prince of man to solidify a long held treaty. You are never short on supplies or warriors and, while a few characters can die, you will mostly be losing faceless stats of Varl and human warriors.In contrast Rook the main character of the refugee campaign, and the main focus of the games story, has a much harder story, that is also full of much more interesting choices. Every choice you make is a pyrrhic victory, either making life harder for yourself or the caravan. On the run from “the dredge” you never feel like you have enough supplies to make it to the next town, which may not even be there anymore, or may be hostile to outsiders. Choices made early in the story, may crop up later as double crosses and or loss of supplies or even characters that you have invested a lot of time and resources on.Almost not choices that you have to make as Rook are easy, even small choices may have big consequences.  Even the meta game choices when you stop in town may effect the over all game for you, for example: the main resource in the game is renown, you gain renown from battle and certain actions outside of battle. Renown is treated as both a currency and experience for your party members, leaving you with the choice of feeding your caravan, so that you have enough men to make it to the next town, or leveling up your party so that you have a chance of surviving the next encounter.  And the game is ready to knock you down emotionally Game of Thrones style by having smaller seeming choices cost you a fully leveled character, just remember, be careful of who you trust.Overall The Banner Saga is a beautiful game that has a few issues in gameplay, but most of that is  settled out by having some the most accessible gameplay in the genre. Its story is dark, and leaves you with choices that are as interesting and difficult as choice made in any game before. I want the next chapter and I want it now after the dark and stark ending of the first chapter of this saga. "

												Overall, the atmosphere, the setting, the story, the decisions, and becoming a leader of various groups at the beginning of a desperate, almost apocalyptic scenario makes this game very satisfying.  The music is fantastic, the relationships between the characters feel genuine and real, and while there isn't as much VA as expected, it works out for the best.  Granted, I haven't played that much but so far it's great.This was a drunken buy.  I was afraid I would regret it, but I don't.  It's very well done.  What I like about it is how the story progresses.  This is a survival story, the beginning of the apocalypse.  It's enjoyable because you become the leader of these various groups.  You can feel like you're really in charge of these lives through the dialogue.  The choices you make can really affect you.  ""Bah, I should have done that!"" ""Shew, I knew it was a good idea to send her there, that was a good decision!""  I made a decision to bring a boy into combat with us and he was awesome!  Really glad I did, but then a decision not ten minutes later took him from me.  That's where the one-save is nice.  If I had another save slot, I would have reloaded.  Your decision are set and stone and that's satisfying in and of itself.The combat is simple but it works well.  I like it and I like leveling up and taking care of my heroes.  It's a good system.At first I didn't like how there were so little voice-overs in the dialogue, but frankly, it's better this way.  I can read it a lot faster than anyone can speak it.  So, really, I'm glad there's not that much VO.  People complain about it, but it's better.  Same for the cutscenes.  I'd rather have dialogue than cutscenes.  The VA that is there is great, especially the ones where you're approaching a village or something like that.			"

												This game takes about 15 hours to complete, i was dissapointed that its not a ""full"" game, meaning it doesn't conclude the story.  I would have waited until all parts came out if i knew this.Incredible art and music, kinda boring characters, never really cared what happened to anyone.combat is weird, difficult.  its a deep combat system and makes sense, i just never really enjoyed it or felt like it ""clicked"".  I would have liked to have tried more of the available characters in combat but renown is so scarce that i didn't have enough to level nearly enough of my people.  The caravan part was fun at first but ultimately doesn't really have any bearing on the outcome of things as i suspected-just felt random, every choice a gamble..  at certain times youre rewarded for being trusting and generous and then later you're punished for doing so.  perhaps this is supposed to be realstic, but it doesn't give you a way to get better at making these decisions, so i just ended up loading save games and trying the different options.Weird game, like the story, feel like it wouldve been a better movie than game.Its decent overall, nothing groundbreaking though.  The reason im not recommending it is because its the first episode of a larger story and doesn't deliver on much of the story.  the dredge are fascinating but you learn very little about them.  id wait till it is finished and then pick it up.

												I cannot express how enthralled I am by this game. It's a mixture of organ trail and turn based RPGs. I've seen people complain about the amount of ""useless dialogue"" but I love the characters and the choices that create this beautiful and deep story. Immediately upon starting the game, you feel immersed in the world. Anything you want to learn more story about (such as the places on the map or the characters) you can! The combat is unique and enjoyable, and when you choose Easy difficulty, it is very easy. I actually changed it back to normal because it was to easy, and normal is just right for me.

												While I understand I'm going to be in the minority here, I found Banner Saga very frustrating to play through, and I essentially had to drag myself to the end of the game. There's a lot of cases of 'false choice' in which it seems like you're able to change the paths of the game but one choice just ends up losing you people or supplies. There are choices that you make and then will have negative consequences later (such as killing your fighters) and you don't have much of a way to envision what is coming along. It wasn't a matter of ""Oh I didn't treat my fighter properly so he left"", but ""This guy randomly killed my other fighters"". By the end of the game, any decision I had to make I was dreading because I knew that there was a right and a wrong way to proceed, and one would just end up with everything progressing that little bit worse.Overall, I simply didn't find the game that much fun. It was a study in dwindling resource management while trying to guess what decision the developers wanted you to take. After dragging myself to the conclusion of the story, I was left not feeling as though anything had properly wrapped up, but as though I had just seen some long-winded introduction to a 'great saga' that I have absolutely no interest in forcing on myself.

												game has a good base, and i generally enjoy the art, and how you command an army on the move where you manage food (altho ive never run out) and various acts you have to make decisions like a choose your own adventure book.The things that bother me to no end are that the enemy gets as many turns as you do until hes down to his last guy, so if you have a large party, then the same 2 guys get to attack over and over again and will generally target the same character while your trying to move your other characters into position.Ive watched 2 enemies hack through 5-6 of my toughest and full health/armor characters like butter and i have no ability to stop this.  The enemies also all have higher level abilities then you and can really surprise you when they do tons of damage from a guy you have reduced down to almost nothing when your people become completely worthless and have to run away.basically i just cant help but always feeling like the computer ai cheats and wont let you walk away without a black eye.  The starting grids are also painful and you generally have to setup in a very specific way that is more of a headache to figure out then it should be and restricts you from options you would normally persue.Also you generally have very little information to make descisions and either have to make it blind or look up solutions which kinds of spoils things.Overall i really wanted to like this game, but it bothers me greatly and i can only play it in short spurts.  If it goes on sale for $5 or less id pick it up, but no more.			"

												While I do believe that developers were sincere in their attempt to create something new, i.e. a story-driven adventure with challenging tactical combat, I do have to say that at the end of the day this game is neither a good story, nor a good tb-rpg/tactical combat game. Moreover, YOU ARE NOT EVEN BEING SOLD ""THE WHOLE GAME""-THE END OF THIS GAME IS BARELY THE MIDDLE OF THE MAIN STORY. So, it's also a bunch of bad marketing thrown into the mix.While not a terrible game, THIS SHOULD NOT BE SOLD AT $25. Even if this game delivered a long, developed story akin to a fantasy book (which it does not both in the quality of its predictable plot and in its length), the price would still be too high. Considering that in order to truly finish the game you will have to buy a future expansion, THIS IS A BLATANT MONEYGRAB.If you are a story-lover, then Banner Saga is NOT for you. It has developmental depth of a comic book and dialogue is not necessarilly great either. This game to reading a good book is what Cheez Its are to a good meal. If you are looking for role-playing experience and to make impactful choices in a dynamic environment, then, again, this game is NOT for you. This game is a ride on a rail-road track, with events that force you to make decisions half the time without giving you enough feedback on the possible impact of those decisions. You will have to simply guess many times, and then the game would try to anticipate your choices by delivering cheap plot twists. It's quite silly. Moreover, after completing the game, it is easy to see that there is actually an optimal way to run through the story.If you are expecting a deep, addictive tactical combat game, then just go for the f2p BS: Factions. Vanilla BS only delivers many boring copy-paste fights against highly-generic AI enemies.Conclusion:Under the pretense that this game is an interactive story deeply affected by your choices and spiced up by some awesome tactical combat you are being sold an elaborate beautiful Flash game akin to the games from sites like Armorgames and Newgrounds. This product lacks in content, delivering only the first chapter of the story, without a definitive ending. That is a giant no-no and a red flag for any story-based game, considering the whopping price of $25. While a good buy at a price of, let's say, $10 (considering the de facto NECESSITY of expansion purchase), this is a lackluster buy at $25.			"

												It is very pretty, artwork is very nice, setting is interesting, with a lot of effort seemingly having gone into creating a fascinating backstory for the world. There are some moments in the story which will provoke an emotional reaction. Mostly ""noooo!"", it is a bleak tale of the apparent end of the world after all.However, it is short, I felt, for the price asked for. It is also apparently part 1, and part 2 and 3 are as yet, unfunded, according to the developers - they are waiting to see how well it sells before they can commit to making any more.The balance at the moment, is somewhat off, as relating to management of resources. This is supposed to be addressed soon in a patch though. I experienced a few game lockups, which were very, very frustrating due to how the game saves its state. Having to force-close the game and reload, meant having to redo an hour or more.I'm conflicted as to whether or not to recommend this. On the one hand, if I recommend it, then it raises the chances of the story being continued, and finding out what happens next. On the other hand, the length of the game, for the price asked, and some of the problems I encountered, and the prospect that parts 2 and 3 may never exist, means that I can't honestly recommend it at this time.Pros: Art is great, setting is interesting, story is involving.Cons: Short length, price, a few glitches, cliffhanger with uncertain prospect of resolution.

												This game put simply is; great. If you like tough decisions and cool characters, I highly recommend this game, go buy it.Long version:The Banner Saga is an incredible game filled to the brim with attention to detail and an interesting if not slightly cliché setting mixed with intriguing writing and scenarios. It has you put as the leader of a caravan, wandering the land in search of shelter from the elements and anybody, or anything that might be chasing you.One of my favourite things about this game is how small you feel in the world, yet more importantly; a part of it. As you move along the 2D screen with a gorgeous backdrop, it really gives you a feeling of wonder. You are nearly always dwarfed by the massive altars known as Godstones, or towering mountains that dot the entirety of the game and it really put you in your place as a someone who is in a world that has existed long before you've arrived and will continue to do so long after you have left.The art style, is surprisngly great. It resembles an old Disney movie with its animation and aesthetic, yet it fits. The animations are simple, yet effective, from simply swinging a sword, to slamming your woodcutter's axe into the ground behind you so you can take the bow of your back and shooting at an enemy. One of the most engrossing things about The Banner Saga is the decisions that you make, and there is a lot of them. From deciding whether to let your caravan rest a day, improving their morale yet losing a day's worth supply of food in the process to deciding whether you let a fully developed character to die for the cause. I can't remember a decision I made where I didn't think that every option I had wasn't worth considering, and that's a really good thing. The sheer amount of decisions you make and the different results they show are absolutely great and the branching storylines allow for more than one playthrough. The overall plot is a bit hit and miss, and can be confusing at times; but it's the small interactions between characters that you're travelling with and the protection you feel for the unique characters as well as your whole caravan that makes this game's storytelling great.The combat is pretty good and reasonably challenging. It's a turn and stat based combat system in which you move around on a small, square-grid battlefield to try and defeat a small host of enemies. Before every battle starts you may choose in which order your party may attack in by placing them in an initiative queue which dictates who goes first and last in your attack order. The way that works is that you have your party member take an action, and then the enemy takes an action, and so on and so forth until all but one person on either one side remains, then a special phase called ""Pillage!"" starts. The person with the larger party may then use that entire party to utterly destroy the last person on the opposing party, as they have next to no actions to take before they get, well, pillaged. I like this combat, to an extent and in my opinion, could use some polish.The UI and character progress screens are simple yet easy to use for the most part as well, not really too much to say about them. The music in this game is to a very high standard and fits in perfectly with the world of Banner Saga which, like the world, fills you with awe, yet gives you the will to constantly push forward. The main negative points of this game (there isn't too many I can think of) is the tutorial and ending. The tutorial doesn't really give you a solid grasp on the combat as you should have, even with its seemingly simple nature. It'll take you at least 5 battles to get a proper hang of it. The ending is quite abrupt and unexpected and doesn't too a great job of tying the whole plot together in a nice way and left me wanting just a little more of a satisfying conclusion.The Banner Saga is a great and utterly charming game that boasts an amount of intelligence and complexity put into decision making that a lot of triple A titles fail to reach. I overall give the game a 8.5/10 with a high reccomendation.			"

												This game steps out of the box and grabs hold of you, refusing to let go. Not because it is addictive in its mechanics, not because it has flashy AAA graphics, and not because of gratitious violence or other cheap thrills. Because it has soul, and plenty of it. Stoic dared to go their own way an create something that is not only beautiful, but also enthralling and evocative in its simplicity.The mechanics for individual parts of the game are not amazing: the caravan mechanic has been over-simplified and sometimes the dialogues feel a bit rushed. The combat is engaging and has strategic depth but has a tad too much repetition to it. Yet the combination of the different parts makes the game special. Together they create a feeling that sticks with you long after you have quit the game.The magic is created by a combination of stunningly beautiful visuals, a haunting soundtrack that adapts to the story and a feeling of doom and despair. Every choice you make ends up bad. Every decision causes suffering. There is no hope, there is no future. There is only The Banner Saga.			"

												For the first eight hours, I was very into the story and tolerated the frustrating combat system. However, reaching a climax point in the story trying to defeat a boss left me in a position of almost no chance of success. My characters were underleved and had worse stats then the enemies. I found that I was against a boss that insta-shot all my characters and regenerated HP as fast as I could damage him. I want to like this game, I really do. The story, dialogue, and the sense of urgency and danger is really well done in this game. But to me, the combat is so frustrating and feels like it works against you. Movement is extremely limited and makes no sense. If my archer moves 3 spaces when he can move 5, he CANNOT move 2 more spaces afterwards. Why? I don't know. Archer range is shorter than enemy movement range, meaning you need a protective wall for your archer or else he will get destroyed by melee. Abilities have no range indicator before you move, so if you move one space short of your special ability range, too bad you wasted your turn. If you are serious interested in this game, wait for a sale when it's 5 dollars or so.			"

												I tried to like this game. I really did. The story is engaging, the visuals are great, and the soundtrack is a masterpiece. But the gameplay is nonexistent. The different take on turn-based combat was cool at first but quickly turned stale. None of your choices matter: you are always forced to take a certain path. There is no point in really trying to choose what to do with your reknown (the games currency); if you use it to level up a character, that character may die or leave and you have absolutely no control on whether or not this happens, if you use reknown to buy supplies, those supplies will be destroyed or stolen regardless of the choices you make. This ""game"" only gives you the illusion of choice and the battles are basically a minigame. The Banner Saga is a visual novel that pretends to be an RPG.			"

												One of the most compelling stories that I've ever experienced in a game. You aren't a group of badasses roaming around the country side giving a beatdown to nerdowells. You play a group of rag tag characters, trying to survive in a dying world. The decisions you have to make give a feeling that you're barely surviving, and sometimes are heartbreaking, or frustrating. But in the end, if they were anything else, they wouldn't be the Banner Saga.			"

												Another great indie game i highly recommend. If you're familiar with tactical RPGs like Heroes of Might & Magic, chances are you will enjoy this one. The gameplay is mainly about turn-based battles on a chess board wich a various sets of character to put into. But the game also relies a lot on choices you make during your journey. And boy, what a joyrney if i might add!... The visuals are just stunning. Your caravan travels accross long panoramical landscapes of snowy hills and frozen forests. It sets the tone for the story brillantly told through a lot of dialogs and interactions between characters. The musics are great, often featuring folkloric chants that makes it even more imersive to this nordic fantastic tale.The battles are challenging then easier once you learn to use the right tactics. Their outcomes will depend of the characters you choose. And your caravan's success will depend of how you manage it, of how you deal with your companions and with everyday stituations.If this game is a ""saga"" then i can't wait for the other episodes!

												The best things about The Banner Saga in my opinion are the storyline and art style. Some people don't like the combat system as you alternate every turn but it does offer a unique tactical challenge I've not seen in other games, if you can get past that. I also quite like the challenge of the renown system. You have a finite amount, so do you level up your heroes, get items, or buy supplies? Later in the game you can usually only choose one, so choose wisely.One misconception I had before buying the game was that your heroes could be killed in combat. Actually, the only way you lose them is by making the wrong decisions along your journey. That system is another aspect I enjoy about the game, even when you get it wrong (as you most likely will quite often.) Bottom line, would buy again.			"

												The Banner Saga is a beautiful, stunning turn based strategy game with it's own mythology, set in a world of Varl (horned giants) and men. The gods are dead. The sun unresting in the sky. In this game you follow two groups. One is the group of Hakon, a leader of the Varl, still kind of uneasy in the role of leader. He has to get along with Ludin, the prince of men, and his bodyguards and entourage.The other group is lead by Rook, a hunter from Skogr. He is together with Iver, a varl he has known for a while, his daughter Alette, Egil, archer Oddleif and all of his clansmen.Along the way you can gather people to join your caravan as you travel the world, fleeing for the Dredge, stone creatures. Fighting them almost becomes monotone, as there aren't a lot of other enemies in the game, except for some enemy humans and varl. But the game makes up for that by fitting it perfectly in the story.The other thing that helps making this game not so monotone is that the special events (raids, attacks, fighting families, hunger, theft, curious characters, etc.) are sometimes random and don't appear in a certain order. You have to think wise though if you want to let certain people in or out of your caravan, as your actions can have heavy consequences.Sometimes, parts of the game seem a little buggy (losing people due to hunger while you aren't skipping a day for example).It takes a while to really understand the dynamics in fighting. I was a bit confused by how willpower and renown works, so my advice to players is to really read into it while the game explains and train with your character for practice-battles, or fighting enemies becomes frustrating and confusing. I almost finished my first playthrough and I'm very surprised. Definetely going to replay the game, as certain decisions seem to have a huge impact. What a worth for my money! I've fallen in love with the characters and can't wait for the next parts.			"

												With visuals like these, does anything else really matter? Every screen of the game, be it the VN-style dialogues, the travelling, or the fights, look absolutely gorgeous. The Banner Saga is worth buying for them alone.On the other hand, one thing I didn't care for at all were the cheesy and over-the-top voiceovers, especially Rook's. Thankfully though, they are scarce.The fighting system is simple but effective, with a million different classes that beg to be explored and combined. Moreover, the fights mostly follow the story, so they don't become grindy; the moment you get used to your party, it splits, or the story focus shifts, or something else happens to add new conditions and spice up the formula. For these reasons, fighting never becomed boring.The fights also have little to no RNG, which is nicely balanced by the main part of the game being RNG-heavy. Your caravan travels across the map, encountering different events and conflicts that you are invited to resolve, but you're not expected to know which choice will lead to the most positive outcome. It boils down to guesswork—which is, like I said, compensated with the fights themselves being non-RNG-reliant.The story is nothing to write home about. It's rather generic low fantasy, which would be fine and dandy, if not for the fact that so much of the game is just a VN retelling said story. On the upside, it's unusual in that you're playing not a brave hero, but the leader of a fleeing group of people. On the downside, the ""there is a Darkness spreading"" plot premise is as lame as you can find in games. Another thing to note is that while the story is self-contained, it's not even remotely satisfying, since this is only part one, so in the end you beat a boss, but learn nothing of the events unfolding.Oddly enough, despite all the shortcomings of the story, the game is very fun to play. It's very well-paced, switching between its various types of gameplay as it goes, always throwing something different at you. The combat is challenging enough to be fun. The main character is actually charismatic for the whole low-key thing. And the visuals are incredible.			"

												This game put simply is; great. If you like tough decisions and cool characters, I highly recommend this game, go buy it.Long version:The Banner Saga is an incredible game filled to the brim with attention to detail and an interesting if not slightly cliché setting mixed with intriguing writing and scenarios. It has you put as the leader of a caravan, wandering the land in search of shelter from the elements and anybody, or anything that might be chasing you.One of my favourite things about this game is how small you feel in the world, yet more importantly; a part of it. As you move along the 2D screen with a gorgeous backdrop, it really gives you a feeling of wonder. You are nearly always dwarfed by the massive altars known as Godstones, or towering mountains that dot the entirety of the game and it really put you in your place as a someone who is in a world that has existed long before you've arrived and will continue to do so long after you have left.The art style, is surprisngly great. It resembles an old Disney movie with its animation and aesthetic, yet it fits. The animations are simple, yet effective, from simply swinging a sword, to slamming your woodcutter's axe into the ground behind you so you can take the bow of your back and shooting at an enemy. One of the most engrossing things about The Banner Saga is the decisions that you make, and there is a lot of them. From deciding whether to let your caravan rest a day, improving their morale yet losing a day's worth supply of food in the process to deciding whether you let a fully developed character to die for the cause. I can't remember a decision I made where I didn't think that every option I had wasn't worth considering, and that's a really good thing. The sheer amount of decisions you make and the different results they show are absolutely great and the branching storylines allow for more than one playthrough. The overall plot is a bit hit and miss, and can be confusing at times; but it's the small interactions between characters that you're travelling with and the protection you feel for the unique characters as well as your whole caravan that makes this game's storytelling great.The combat is pretty good and reasonably challenging. It's a turn and stat based combat system in which you move around on a small, square-grid battlefield to try and defeat a small host of enemies. Before every battle starts you may choose in which order your party may attack in by placing them in an initiative queue which dictates who goes first and last in your attack order. The way that works is that you have your party member take an action, and then the enemy takes an action, and so on and so forth until all but one person on either one side remains, then a special phase called ""Pillage!"" starts. The person with the larger party may then use that entire party to utterly destroy the last person on the opposing party, as they have next to no actions to take before they get, well, pillaged. I like this combat, to an extent and in my opinion, could use some polish.The UI and character progress screens are simple yet easy to use for the most part as well, not really too much to say about them. The music in this game is to a very high standard and fits in perfectly with the world of Banner Saga which, like the world, fills you with awe, yet gives you the will to constantly push forward. The main negative points of this game (there isn't too many I can think of) is the tutorial and ending. The tutorial doesn't really give you a solid grasp on the combat as you should have, even with its seemingly simple nature. It'll take you at least 5 battles to get a proper hang of it. The ending is quite abrupt and unexpected and doesn't too a great job of tying the whole plot together in a nice way and left me wanting just a little more of a satisfying conclusion.The Banner Saga is a great and utterly charming game that boasts an amount of intelligence and complexity put into decision making that a lot of triple A titles fail to reach. I overall give the game a 8.5/10 with a high reccomendation.			"

												Before I launch into my review, I highly recommend looking at a gameplay video to decide if you're really interested as this game is not going to be for everyone. This game is heavily story driven with a nice smattering of choice & consequence and turn based combat. While the story is fairly linear, you will end up in the same place no matter what, who is still alive when you get there will vary wildly from person to person. The game is built on the concept of an apocolypse and the developers had no problems bringing the harsh choices such an event would bring. The game gives a good frame work of the events and then allows the player to tailor how their individual journey plays out. Major plot points will be the same but the pieces that will in the blanks will be customized, and are often memoriable.Cons: Some people don't like cartoony art (I think it's beautiful in this game). There is no save system, it autosaves but it saves multiple copies so it's easy to backtrack. The combat is far inferior to the Banner Saga Factions and not just because it's next to impossible to create an AI on the level of a human. In Factions, every unit has a special ability making positioning and targeting key to success. In Banner Saga, a fair amount of enemies have no special moves, even into late game, erroding some of the tactical depth. This is further compounded by the lack of enemy types. The game is also very short (took me 8 hours), if you don't replay games often this might be a big deal to you. There's also a lack of exploration due to the onrails nature of the story. And finally, RPS has said they found the story hard to follow early on. They don't give you all the details about why what's happening is happening until later but, I never understood where this confusion comes from but feel it's probably worth mentioning.			"

												The game is great! Very interesting storyline that pulls you right in! Honestly i didn't think i'd enjoy reading instead of watching scenes and listening to the speeches but that actually made me feel like i'm really involved in it. Played it on normal and it was quite challenging at some points, supplies were becoming more scarce towards the end of the game, lost quite a few characters throughtout the play due to choosing the outcome really wanted to go back to last save but it only lets you go so far so i stick to the idea that it is right to just move on and suffer the consequences, seemed very natural that way and i liked it! Only the last fight was hard on normal and i wanted to see the ending so i switched difficulty to easy, will definately play it all over on hard. It does seem to have many choices you make throughout the game and even the small one have effect. Several things did not really make sense, you lose so many landsman, fighters and varl if you travel without resources, and in the end you finish with however many of those left but does it make any difference with how many you finish it? Made no sense to me, but i havent serched for the answer either so maybe it does have some kind of effect. In my point of view game does have minor flaws as i would call them but those are not vital at all. Definately worth getting! Looking forward to continuation of the story!			"

												This is a mouse click adventure with a storyline that, so far, has been pretty sweet. The choices you make and the people you talk to definitely have a noticable impact. I just restarted my game now that I have a better grasp on the combat and a key character that I had for quite some time in my other game died because I made a different choice this time around. We'll have to see if that choice plays out with enough benefits to outweigh this decision D:Pros:-Love the storyline and the combat-Good balance between using the ingame 'currency' to either buy supplies so you don't starve, or to buy rank ups for your key warriors, or buying items that boost the warrior's performance.-I don't always pay attention to music, but so far have felt it matches the situations to set the mood/atmosphere very well.Cons:-I got to a particular two-stage fight fairly late into the game and my current lineup is unable to pull off a win, I have tried almost all last weekend, several 2-3 hour sessions at the same fight. I've read how others deal with it online, and because I don't know how far back I need to go to load a previous save....I have no choice but to go back and restart the game. AGAIN.This fight's difficulty ramps up too quickly. Even after I changed the in-game difficulty to easy, the fight says we will rest one day and then go at it, and in easy difficulty my warriors should proc a day of resting and be full strength but they do not. At the normal difficulty this team has made it through many fights but this one's mechanics are not matched anywhere else to prepare you for it nor does the game give you any help in being able to ramp yourself up for it.Aside from really the one glaring con that has forced me into restarting my game to better prepare, it's a good game. I do wish we could explore more of the world map. The game puts an emphasis on checking out the map and having all this detail on it, and then because you're following the story line, you don't get to chose where you're going or do any side quests to different locations. It'd be cool if, in an expansion or patch/update they add more content that is exploreable within this realm.			"

												I liked The Banner Saga. I thought it had really good pacing that keeps wanting me to play until the story is over. The battles were not that difficult except for the final boss who was quite a challenge  even with my factions experience. The game runs well and its a joy to look at. 10/10 would play again.			"

												More than just a game, The Banner Saga is a work of art.  From the outset I found myself approaching this game in a different way.  Even if my adventure ended in defeat, it was going to be a great experience trying to survive as long as possible with warriors (and ethics) intact!  A great game with a brain and a heart, for players equipped with the same. "

												Great game. Hard as hell to keep things going your way. It is easy for some of the events to cause a snowball effect with wounded party members and then get out of control. Also it is important for you all to know that this is Part 1 of 3 and will cut off out of nowhere after 10 hours of gameplay. Overall I enjoyed it and will be looking forward to the next installment and trying to clear the game on hard which personally scares me.			"

												The game is great! Very interesting storyline that pulls you right in! Honestly i didn't think i'd enjoy reading instead of watching scenes and listening to the speeches but that actually made me feel like i'm really involved in it. Played it on normal and it was quite challenging at some points, supplies were becoming more scarce towards the end of the game, lost quite a few characters throughtout the play due to choosing the outcome really wanted to go back to last save but it only lets you go so far so i stick to the idea that it is right to just move on and suffer the consequences, seemed very natural that way and i liked it! Only the last fight was hard on normal and i wanted to see the ending so i switched difficulty to easy, will definately play it all over on hard. It does seem to have many choices you make throughout the game and even the small one have effect. Several things did not really make sense, you lose so many landsman, fighters and varl if you travel without resources, and in the end you finish with however many of those left but does it make any difference with how many you finish it? Made no sense to me, but i havent serched for the answer either so maybe it does have some kind of effect. In my point of view game does have minor flaws as i would call them but those are not vital at all. Definately worth getting! Looking forward to continuation of the story!			"

												This game is amazing. For many months I had seen this on Steam and thought ""It can't be that good, not worth my money"" but my god how wrong was I. This game is filled with beautiful animations for combat, thrilling and amazingly written story and realistic characters.The game has very rich lore that unfolds without you needing to collect secrets or some kind of optional trophy. The Banner Saga combines turn-based strategy with decision making, party management and army management, where you lead a warband in a struggle to find food and combat with the threat of bandits, weather and shadey characters along the way in a truely epic journey.The story itself throws you straight into the sad world of The Banner Saga and only builds up to a more sad and intense tale. The art style is unique and creates a world that really comes to life.In this review I feel I still didn't give it enough justice, just please buy this game because I feel everyone needs to experience their own story in the game, something that Telltale didn't manage to capture.

												So i bought this game on the spot simply because I saw the first 30 seconds of the trailer.  I promptly spent my homework time playing this game....and dinner...and well, 7 hours later I beat the game.  I really liked the flow of the game and the consequences of your choice.  So i decided to play it again, but make new choices.  The conversations didn't really change, but the results of my choices did.I enjoyed the intro movie and thought a lot of the game would have the same animation cut scenes, but they didn't. That i found to be a let down.  The music however was always spot on, which definitely added to the gameplay.There are parts that I may be missing, but some of the storyline hasn't been developed once introduced.  It may be because of my choices throught out the game, but huge chunks of potential story are just not there. I want to know what this ""darkness"" is, or wtf that snake has to do with anything.  Overall I liked the game due to the asthetics, and the Oregon trail feel of the game.  But some parts just fall short, mainly ending being so linear, especially after a variety of random encounters that require a diversity of choices.			"

												First off I have to say that I enjoyed playing the Banner Saga (TBS) even though I found it “stressful” at times. Believe it or not, the story was actually affecting me – the pressure to find my clan a new home or even safe haven was unrelenting – and I realized later that the fact that I found it stressful meant that the game had succeeded, in a way. The story is told from two ends, from two perspectives. It’s a little confusing at first, but you get the hang of it as things pick up.+ (pluses): The game is beautifully rendered, even though it’s entirely in 2D. This goes to show that good games don’t require high frame rates, obscenely expensive graphic cards or computers that cost as much as a downpayment for a home.+ The score and authentic (I’m assuming) Norse vocals are mesmerizing and totally bring the game to a new level in terms of immersiveness.+ Turn-based combat, with a perk system for different classes of fighters. There is also a pre-combat setup phase, for deeper strategy, and special items that can be equipped to boost stats. + Compelling (and unrelenting) storyline. You feel the clan’s desperation, and pressure to find shelter as you flee from place to place. Some players complained that there is too much emphasis on logistics and feeding your party; at first I tended to agree but after I completed the game, I realized that this was necessary to hammer home the desperation of the quest.+ Believable characters and permadeath add to the RPG mix (games are only saved at fixed points). You lose a character and it’s like a kick in the gut. Should you have done something differently? Do you wait for stragglers or push on? Your decisions matter. = (neutrals): I realize that the feeding of the party is crucial; however, I feel that the gameplay could have been better balanced in this area. Using fame to buy food? Seriously? Maybe the party can be auto-replenished at locations instead? Otherwise the player simply skews the entire gameplay towards accumulating food, which makes this kind of meaningless, because TBS is much more than that. - (minuses): While the map is beautiful, it’s not interactive and rather pointless. I realize this is not a traditional RPG where you can backtrack and revisit locations, but the information on the map is difficult to correlate to what’s happening to you in real-time and where it’s happening. So why even bother having one?Overall, TBS is a good game and I enjoyed playing it. There is some replayability, even though the story is linear. Would a character have died if I did something differently? I’m looking forward to playing the sequel and to seeing where the story takes us this time.7.0/10			"

												       I loved this game. It comprised many different types of gamplay styles into one beautifully enthralling unique piece of art. The game promises to be a game where decisions are vital and your choices matter. Some other reviewers think that the game is linear despite its promises. The game delivers in its story so well that it needs to have some form of linearity.      Banner saga is its own story and its your job to see to the end of it. You have to make choices that impact the survival and moral stability of your caravan. Right or wrong choices can be fatal depending on how YOU want the game to be played out. The story was phenominal  and the visuals were unlike any game I have ever played and will no doubt leave room for future games to copy this design.      When there was voice acting, it was well delivered and very well spoken. The game we are talking about here was a kickstarter project, and voice acting for every cutscene is just not going to happen. Some companies do not have the funding.  Luckily, due to the success of this game, we could hope to see improvements in the next part of this 3 part game series. This game was meant as an introduction to the beautiful spectacle that is banner saga. When buying this, you must understand that this game is not meant to be appreciated on its own, it is just a taste of things to come. So enjoy this amazing game because I am already waiting for the next addition in the series.			"

												I am going to start off with a (kinda) spoiler and and the real kick in the teeth that comes with it before I lead up to a very positive review. In my opinion and in the opinions of at least a few hundred others the biggest problem with this game is THE ENDING....I can't decide whether to call it non-existent, unfinished or incredibly poorly executed. This game is 1 out of 3 in a planned trilogy by the way. This is something I was not aware of a when I initially purchased the game. There you are prepared now on the good...Now please bear in mind I do not think I would be nearly as bitter about the ending if the the rest of the game had not hit on so many levels. Initially I thought the combat in the game was based on too simple of a concept but after an hour of play I realized in execution there is a great deal of depth. The simple concept by the way is that of combining atack power and life into one stat for your characters. It really flips the whole concept behind a tactically rpg on its tail and made me think through every battle (and paiiiinfully so on the Hardest Setting). While the RPG style Character Progression of your characters are an Important aspect of gameplay I was pleased to find that the actually Tactical aspects of the game are firmly in the driver seat. To me this is the highlight and the reason any fan of the genre should take the opportunity to download this game (I admit waiting for a sale myself but I would not have been disappointed if I had paid the $19.99 it's currently listed at either).The story and experience itself is very dark one. It was clearly intended and I feel like the developers hit the nail on the head when it came to using every method and mechanic availalbe to them to create that atmosphere. Your watching this World Tear itself apart while the characters fight to hold it together. The animations, story, music, the gameplay all are all geared up to make you feel that way and were a resounding success.The complete butchering of the end of the game really hurt and pulled down the review a notch but overall the hours (and i have far more than 10.2 that steam has me at for some reason) of greatness vastly overshadow the final few moments and bad taste I had after finishing the game for the 1st time. This game is refreshingly different from anything I have played before and would recommend it to just about anyone intersted in this genre.8/10			"

												Banner saga is a epic story set in a fantasy nordic-like world. It has RPG/tactical gameplay and a bit of resources management. But let`s go to the pros and cons.Pros:The story of this game is great, it has a depressive / end of the world mood that is rare to be seen. The soudtrack is outstanding, it fits greatly with the game helping creating the right sensations at the right moments.The artistic style is inovative and very beautifullThe choice making is good and make the game shape itself as you play it. It adds replay value and great a better bond between player and game.Cons: The game is kind of easy (played on medium)I feel the tactical mechanics and characters leveling could be more explored.  The story while it`s good doens`t fill complete, there are some things that will only be revealed on the second game (I hope).			"

												The Banner Saga is a casual turn based tactics game with some beautiful artwork. It's one of the better ones in this genre. The complexity of the battle system hits the right spot. It's not too involved like that of X-Com where you have to carefully plan your every move. What that means is the battles aren't that tense and you can play this game at the end of the day when you don't have much energy left and still enjoy it. At the same time your choices in the battlefield do make a difference and the battles don't feel trivial. The story is decent enough for a game of this type and agian, better than other casual turn based tactical games. The best thing about the game, apart from the battles, is the visual style. It's comic book / cartoon type art style makes me a bit nostalgic. But on the downside, there is little to no voice acting and it's quite conspicuous. It keeps the game from reaching its true potential. All in all the game is quite enjoyable. I recommend getting it on sale if you're into casual turn based tactics.			"

												We’ve seen the world coming to an end many times now. Oftentimes it’s used as a meaningless crutch in order to get things going, to have an artificial reason as to why you have to kill a bunch of enemies. But there are stories that make the end of the world compelling yet again. Because there is something inexplicably fascinating about such a cataclysmic event. The Banner Saga makes the case for the latter. It creates an apocalyptic scenario and thrusts you directly into it. And it’s utterly brutal and unapologetic about it. Your actions have the power to save lives. More often than not, things will go wrong. People will die and the world may yet end no matter what you do. It’s a bleak proposition and yet so incredibly motivating.The Banner Saga is based on Viking mythology and takes place across a vast Nordic land inhabited by humans and varl. The varl are horned, giant-like creatures that were created by the gods. Humans and varl were bitter enemies for ages until the gods grew tired of it and created the dredge, monolithic stone creatures that have a particular thirst for destruction. The two warring races had to unite and push back the dredge into the far reaches of the northernmost wastes. A tenuous peace has lasted since. But the dredge are back in greater numbers than ever and they are mowing down everything and everyone in their path. But the real problem is – the dredge are on the move because they are fleeing an unknown darkness intent on engulfing the entire world. The lore isn’t particularly original or elaborate, but it is really intriguing.As the player, you will be controlling two separate caravans making their way across the lands. One is a varl expedition of kings and princes in the middle of human/varl peace negotiations trying to make their way to the varl capital whereas the other is a human group running to save their bare lives from the outpouring of bloodthirsty dredge. The goal is to survive. You will endure many hardships during your travels and you will have a direct impact on the outcome. Many choices will present themselves to you and the outcome will rarely be clear. You will face certain repercussions of your choices further down the line. Almost all of them are equally compelling and will directly influence who joins you, who lives, who dies and the overall state of your caravan. Other games tell you of hardships, The Banner Saga throws you right in the middle of it so as to feel the brunt of it on your shoulders.The production values will leave you in awe, wondering how is it possible that this game was made by a three-person team. The artwork is absolutely gorgeous, truly some of the most beautiful I have ever seen. Complimented by a superb soundtrack consisting of Viking-inspired tracks, the game manages to create an intensely thick atmosphere, one of beauty drowned in misery and despair. The importance that these elements have on the game and the overall experience cannot be overstated. Throughout the game, there are these calm scenes in which you just observe your caravan slowly moving through the lands and it’s so inexplicably memorable.When it comes to the actual gameplay, apart from the continual decision-making, the big star here is the turn-based combat system. I have played a rather large number of both turn-based strategy games and turn-based RPG’s and I have never come across a combat system quite like this one. What’s most interesting about is that strength and health are the same stat so as a unit loses more and more health, it becomes more and more useless. However, the armor stat is equally important because even if your unit is more powerful than the enemy unit, it won’t deal much damage until you take the armor down. And this is then complicated further because you can either choose to deal armor damage or health damage. Also, all the different units have different special abilities. All of this creates a highly tactical combat system which really makes you think about how you approach the battle.When it comes to shortcomings, the first thing that comes to mind is small enemy variety. Sometimes you’ll fight humans or varl, but mostly the dredge will be your opponents and it would have been nice if they had more unit types. Also, considering that it’s a 2D game, the loading times are unusually long. The game will also leave you wanting more once it ends which you may see as a negative as you’ll want to continue the story right away instead of waiting for the next chapter. However, this is offset by a relatively high replay value. A second playthrough will surely turn out completely different than the first.The Banner Saga is a fantastic game which will place the heavy burden of leadership and responsibility on your shoulders. It will lead you through a beautiful yet bleak world and it will provide a challenge in both its hard choices and tough combat. And it will be a journey to remember.9 OUT OF 10 (SUPERB)			"

												+ Great art and animations+ Some recognizeable music (Austin Wintory + Dallas Wind Symphony)+ Recognizeable characters+ Feeling of deep lore+ Alternating protagonists to control, different views on the events taking place+ Some freedom which paths to take and which fighters to let join (or leave) your group. When resting at villages/cities or when the caravan is moving events pop up giving you multiple choices, often difficult ones as either your caravan, your integrity as it's leader or the people in the surrounding area may suffer from your choice (like your supplies are low - steal from these peasants or pass by letting clansmen in your caravan starve?)+ The combat situations you are getting into are reflected in the actual combat fields you are fighting on (you are not randomly thrown into some generic landscapes; the areas are visibly designed accordingly to how they were previously described, and have fitting assets like buildings, corpses or passive fighters of all the participating factions observing the events).~ Final boss battle can be frustratingly hard (at least on any other difficulty than ""Easy"")~ Story is not finished. It was promising as long as it lasted, but ended rather abruptly, I didn't expect the game to end where it did. I guess this is where the line ""Saga"" comes into play. Stoic is apparently outlining or already working on the sequel. If you expect a conclusive story from this single installment you will be disappointed.~ There is a feeling of deep lore. There is a big world map, and literally any place, landmark and terrain formation you can click at to get a description of it's history or naming or whatever. This alone deserves some respect in my opinion. But not all - perhaps naturally - is used in any gameplay-related way. The worldmap itself only serves as an overview as to where you are, and where you will be going, to get an understanding of your journey. You can very well never look at the map and still get along. - Only very few voice acting, and never during character dialogues (the launch trailer falsely suggests there to be more).- Hostile AI is occassionally doing some strange moves, sometimes hurting their own combatants more than yours.- No idea if it's me but sometimes the game glitched a bit. I was clicking around the combat options of one of my fighters and somehow the game ended the turn of that fighter despite me never wanting to do that. In one occasion I noticed my fighter was teleported on another combat field too. It didn't happen >that< often, but often enough for me to notice, and in some instances it prevented me from finishing some combats as I had hoped to do.- Special moves of the fighters are sometimes a bit difficult to understand. A full explanation you can only look up before a battle. When in battle there is only a reduced description which sometimes lacks important details. So you either need to learn these moves beforehand (there are training battles in cities/villages and when resting with your caravan) or do trial and error (there is some room of error as long as you aren't a perfectionist, fighting on ""Hard"" or on ""Normal"" against the final boss). This could possibly have been made easier by allowing you to look up the full character profiles (and special move descriptions) during combat too.			"

												Viking men, viking women and horned viking giants battling ancient robots made of stone in a scandinavian world where the sun stopped in the sky. Just that would make an amazing game, but The Banner Saga also brings a deep, intriguing and involving story, über charismatic characters and an art style that honours the greates Disney  classics, but with more blood.And on top of all that, a batlle system that's easy to get, but unfolds into a thousand of complex strategies.

												For me personally, Banner Saga is a frontrunner for my GOTY.ProsThe story/journey is phenomenal The decision making (while forcing you down a linear path to your next main progression point) is often weighty and mentally taxing.  If you let yourself get immersed, you will be rewarded.The combat itself is quite fun, though it has a few drawbacks.  You never get the opportunity to truly play around with the systems/characters/strategy side of things.  This is largely tied to.....ConsRenown.  It is used for supplies, character upgrades and items.  While it serves its purpose of ""hard decisions"", it simply isn't fun.  You don't get the flexibility to play around with characters/loadouts and buying items is pretty much out of the question.  You need to upgrade characters to survive, but if you upgrade them, you are in a sense stuck with them, due to resource commitment.  The bottom line is that its a poor mechanic, and it drastically strips away at the strategic elements of the game.Beyond that though, the game is fantastic, and anyone that likes serious/dark toned material, decision making, or turn based strategy games should check it out.

												My feelings about this game are a little mixed, but mostly positive. I like the Nordic background, the cartoon-like artstyle and the storylines. The concept of two groups of heroes starting at opposite sides of the map, uniting and mixing before endgame works very well. The system of character development and equipment is simple, but immersive enough. I also appreciate the additional gameplay layer of troop management (numbers of combattants/civilians, provision, motivation - finally reaching a village where you can buy food is a meaningful event after losing soldiers to starvation on a long march!) Morally ambiguous decisions in dire situations do appeal to me.One thing that prevents this one from being a really great game is the combat system. I appreciate the relative strategic complexity of separating armour and strength, while some other turn-based games only show a health bar, with unchanging damage and protection values. But still, I have my issues with it. Is it realistic that I can attack the body of an opponent without damaging his armour? I cannot imagine that. The distribution of heroes and enemies on the arena follows a few patterns that are repeated too often for my taste. I do not like that there is no chance involved when determining the damage your attacks do - even a weak fighter should have a lucky strike now and then (predictability kills tension). Also, I have a problem with the alternating order of action between the two fighting groups (instead of a more realistic principle of one action per character per round): For example, if one group has six fighters and the other one two, the two will act three times as often as each of their opponents. In the end, you keep weak enemies alive as long as you can just to prevent the heavy hitters from punishing your wounded soldiers. This is very unintuitive. Such things make the combat system feel a little artificial to me, and I do not see what some critics found so brilliant about it.More importantly, the decisions you make only have minor effects on the final outcome, the storyline has only one ending essentially, so you pay 20 EUR for a single playthrough unless you want to see the minor variations in the story that result from your choices. Do you really care wether the final boss is killed by hero 1 or hero 2? I did not.The gameplay serves its purpose, but it falls short compared with other roleplaying games. The substance of this game is the immersive atmosphere of the storylines. My verdict: 6/10.			"

												If you see this game on your Steam frontpage, and think: ""This game looks like some old tv series or movies."" Hell yeah, that's what I thought, and believe me, this alone is worth the 5 bucks you can spend in sales. (and you shouldn't pay MUCH more.)The Banner Saga is a turnbased RPG with adventure elements. Think of it like a mixture between The Walking Dead or Oregan Trail, with the fighting system of Wasteland 2 or Heroes of Might and Magic. The main aspect of the game is to get your caravan to a safe point, travel through the land, and while traveling, ensure you survive, don't starve and keep your morale up. Sounds boring? I tell you, it's not! Prepare to meet characters you won't forget, make super tough decisions with very hefty consequences, that make you want to restart the whole game (I seriously once did, lol).The fighting has some cool unique features, and, depending on the difficulty you chose, can be freaking hard. Another good feature though: Losing a fight doesn't simply get you to a gameover-screen, instead you have to live with that loss and it's consequences. Your comrades could die (yes, there is permadeath), your caravan could lose many people, and so on. Every choice in this game, makes a big impact.Now to the negative sides of this game. Unfortunatly, you can complete the game in around 4 hours, which is okay if you want to re-run it, but I would have preferred a longer story. (remember, don't pay more than 10 bucks!)Furthermore, there is no free saving, it all happens through checkpoints, which sometimes are a bit annoying and misplaced. Lastly, and that's really something I wished they would have changed, there is some brilliant voice acting in the game, only problem is, it only appears very rarely. Most dialogues between the main characters are not voiced at all, and that takes away something I feel.But, if you are looking for a game with stunning visuals (oh god, does this game look good), a neat story, cool fighting system, impactful decisions and a really good soundtrack, this is the game for you.

												The art is beautiful, music astonishing, gameplay solid. The combat system is fun, if a little simplistic for the lack of things like terrain modifiers and a little sparse on variety of units. The story is at once bleak and heartwarming. You feel for every senseless death in your caravan as little events give you snippets of what daily life is like on the road. You want to protect your people. The game will run on even the shakiest toaster and will run a skilled player around 10-12 hours for their first time through. Subsequent playthroughs are tantalizing, the desire to see if you can remedy past failures and save those whom you lost is strong by the end of the game.Highly recommended.			"

												it's challenging (can't beat any fight without losing at least 1 person), but not fun... in most games I see a fight as an opportunity to gain something, but in banner saga you only gain the chance to move forward to your next hopeless situation. Only played 4 hrs, and just not enjoyed it so far.Edited: After a couple more tries, I've come to the conclusion that I hate the battle system, specifically the way turns alternate between my team and the enemies. It makes no sense... If I have 6 units and the enemy 2, turns shouldn't alternate. Last game, i had a member who's health was low, so I moved him out of the way to retreat. This gave the enemy a free turn every time his move came up.What I should have done is let him die, and this drives me nuts, cause any game mechanic that involves ""sacrificing"" a player just so you don't give the opponent an advantage is dumb, and illogical.

												I enjoyed the game quite a bit. To start off one playthough takes about 10 hours. Since the game is fairly different than most games on the whole, I figured it'd be easier to point out the similarities it may have with some established games. The game's a little bit like: Fire Emblem -  grid based combat, but individual unit turn-based with a strength as hp mechanic and armor -- you can try out The Banner Saga: Factions, the corresponding free multiplayer game to try the combat, Oregon Trail - you travel along a fairly linear path making decisions as you go with a caravan nonetheless, Dragon Age - unlike Fire Emblem series where if you lose a character in combat, you lose him/her in the campaign, in TBS you can only lose characters through decisions you make out of combat -- falling in combat will only injure a unit for the next fight, unless you rest at camp or have enough time pass to heal the injuries, King of Dragon Pass - the decision system is similar and you will be given chances to wage war, however you only control the army by choosing one command, such as Charge, Formation, Defend, etc. which then prompts a regular combat scenario,---The campaign affects combat in several main ways. Probably most importantly, it affects who you will be able to play as in combat and which encounters will be combat encounters or bypassed through resolution or avoidance. You can add new characters to your party or even accidentally, or purposefully, kill off members of your team. Next,  your caravan morale affects how much willpower your team has starting the match. Willpower allows characters to use their special abilities, deal extra armor break or damage, and to move further in a single turn. If your caravan morale is low, your team will start fights with less than normal willpower, but if they start with high morale, they will receive bonus morale. Lastly, from making some decisions, you can gain reknown (the currency used to level up units and to buy equippment and supplies -- supplies are used to feed your whole caravan and maintain morale).---Strengths:As you'll see stated in most any other review, TBS is a gorgeous game. The combat is equally good and quite strategic.The vast and detailed world map shows the scope of the game's world in the classic Tolkien fashion.The characters and decisions are very impactful. You can lose or gain key characters (and their equipment) based on your decisions. Some decisions will have immediate results, while others may show up long after you've made them. Weakness:The biggest issue I had with the game is that it felt lopsided on the decision system. If you made a series of a few bad decisions, you wound up always struggling to get supplies, and on the flipside, if you make a series of good decisions, you have a fairly easy time. This is because all of the systems seem to compound on eachother. I preferred to be struggling, because it kept the tension of survival prominent.I enjoyed the overall structure of the story and the many decisions I had to make along the way, however the dialogue sometimes was poorly phrased, such as by using modern colloquial slurs. Some characters would use lore-based expressions, while others frequently sounded like they were from the current era. This was an odd issue. Some character and city names I did not know how to pronounce, and so I didn't commit many characters and places to memory.Lastly, you're always moving forward, from point A to point B. Once you leave camp or town you continue back on your journey. Instead of directly choosing your destination, you're sent in the general direction the story tells you to go, able to take detours or backtrack only when an event decision occurs.---On Combat:If you are not familiar with The Banner Saga's combat, I could see it being a fairly difficult game, as common strategic thought is to kill off units rather than leave them maimed and on the board. With TBS's turn-based system, one character takes a turn then control passes to the opponent to move one character. The order of character movement is established before combat and can be changed only by a few special characters once in combat. Although it might seem odd at first, this system requires much more strategy than just going from one side of the board to the other wiping out all enemy units. Each time you kill off an enemy unit, you are giving the opponent an advantage, slight or large dependent on the difference between both sides' total units.I find TBS's combat system to be a good addition to turn-based strategy family and prefer it to most other turn-based game systems.What I'd like to have seen:Skirmish mode - a mode to fight on all the different maps vs the AI using characters unlocked through the story-mode,Characters & Maps - story characters/classes added to The Banner Saga: Factions (the multiplayer version of the game);Multiplayer - The Banner Saga: Factions accessible in-game from TBS's client; I think leaving the two games separate can cause some confusion for players, some may only know about one version and not the other;			"

I enjoyed playing it but when the credit screen displayed infront of me.. I was really disapointed and kinda glad I didn't spend 20dls or € on it and got it on a sale for 5€, thats should be the real price. And of course they intend to make a second one to conclude the story but its going to be hard to keep the same characters because many will die or survive depending on the choices you make. Buy it on sale and spend arround 10 hours to complete you wont regret it if you truly love based turn, strategy game as FFT (Final Fantasy Tactics).			"

												This game was an interesting but disapointing experience for me.  It felt almost like Oregon Trail with giants and combat.  The combat was not huge on tactics, but turned out to be a click fest.  The staggered nature of player/opponent/player/opponent really killed what tactical feel the game did have. The Opponent types were repetative, and the game was extremely short for the price.  It took me 9 hours or so for a 25 dollar game.  The story was so so, not bad, but it will be forgotten within a few days.  I would wait untill it goes on sale, or find a copy of final fantasy tactics.

												While the game has lots of flavour, a diverse soundtrack and a decent enough story, it unfortuneately is hampered by a strange combat mechanic that has completely turned me off The Banner Saga.In normal turn based strategy/rpg games, everyone rotates through their turns, going one after another. However in Banner Saga, it is one faction then the other faction, regardless of how many soldiers/characters are left. What this equals out to is that fights are brutally rough when trying to take out single tough enemies. More that that it feels so utterly non-sensical that if you fought well, and had all four/five/six characters, and your enemy has one left, that one will get to act four/five/six times more often then anyone of your characters.The whole concept is confusing if you think about it too much, but more than that, characters you like to use, are used less often in relation to the enemy in most fights, and they are more likely to die, if they catch a lone opponents ire, because that enemy can attack your one character four/five/six times before you can get them out of danger.

												Plot played out like a choose-your-own-adventure book, with ridiculous consequences for otherwise benign choices. Characters come and go more often than an RR Martin book, and for no good reason, so it's hard to feel attached to any one of them. The tactics gameplay itself was fairly standard. Overall I love the setting and I was curious about the world, but nothing about the game was actually fun to play. Just a long, frustrating slog to the end -- which didn't resolve anything about the questions set out in the beginning of the story.			"

												Felt like my choices mattered. Great art, great music! Alright combat, could be improved. In fact, there were instances I wish they could've gone without the combat.  However, I feel that the choices take the spotlight here, which I actually had some difficulty choosing between. Wish there was more voice acting, since a lot of the game is cutscenes, but it's not too big of a deal. Just finished, and I'm buying the sequel. 8.5/10			"

												A Viking-themed tactical roleplaying game created by Stoic (which I believe is just three men who used to work for BioWare). The story has tonnes of Lore if you look around the map, but if you want the basics of the story then the return or a warlike race that despises humanity - The Dredge - led by an invincible leader called Bellower has sent the world into chaos.The gameplay is a strategical, turn-based sing-player combat against the Dredge or other survivors and each character in your caravan has certain skills and unique abilities that can help you develop solid stratedgies for taking down opponents. It has the novel idea of your health also representing strength, so the more health you lose the less powerful your character's attacks will be. You have a whole array of units such as archers, shieldbangers, warhawks, etc. Inbetween battles there are chapters, in each chapter you will play as one of three POV characters leading a caravan across this hostile world in a way similar to ""Oregon Trail"". Here you will make conversation choices with other characters and sometimes the wrong ones will result in your characters dying or leaving for good, which results in you having less units to fight with in the tactical combat - a lot of people have a problem with this but it actually works as good incentive to level up everyone rather than just focus on one character and make them the best; you could lose them at any point. One character in particular, Egil, who has a special ability that let's him block almost any attack (so pretty useful when utilised correctly) can be killed about 8 times during these conversation choices and you actually get an achievement for keeping him alive! The choices also offer a bit of replayability in terms of characters but there is little in the way of overall change.The game isn't perfect; in the ""Oregon Trail"" part you have fighters, clansmen and varl (Varl are part of the mythology and are giants with horns) that you are charged with keeping alive, managing supplies to do so, but many players point out you can let them all starve to death and still complete the game without consequences, however it seems this will remedied in the sequel which will make your caravan more important.Another issue is that there is little difference in terms of combat scenarios with everyone with the terrain remaining basically the same and the enemies changing only slightly over the course of the game, due to the different number of units you have to experiment with the game rarely gets boring or too repetitive but given it's estimated run time of about 8 hours you're unlikely to get tired of it in that time.A lot of people take issue with the game opening with a cinematic scene and not having any more in the game and their is little voice-acting. But if you judge this game by that then you are missing out. The artwork is beautiful and it is well written if a few of the in-universe words (such as the insult ""Skal"") can take a while to understand.Ultimatley, the game has its little imperfections, but they don't take away from this being a spectacular and original game that is definitley worth playing. A fun experience that is excellently presented and executed with a diverse cast of characters, intricate and compelling story and a solid combat system.			"

												The Banner  Saga is a beautiful tale of survival in nordic-like fantasy world. It plays itself out in two halves: as a interactive novel with slightly animated art attached (in which you pick your choices and read the text of each character), and as a turn-based tactical combat game.Pros:-Beautiful art.-Ok plot, well narrated though.-Combats are fun, and challenging in Hard difficulty.-Your march in the caravan is fun and requires resource management, plus some RPG elements involving the characters.-Apparently your decisions do alter your experience.Cons:-No voice acting, dialogs have to be read.-Open ending (there is a second part already).-Combats are ok, but several improvements can be done: clearer effects of special abilities, more variety in enemies, maps and options (IMPORTANT: I played all of the game -except the final battle- in Hard difficulty, and I noticed that playing it hard offers a more variety of enemies -more evolved, harder- than Normal difficulty).-It ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off that you would have to spend points in characters to upgrade their level just to found them killed in the storyline. Upgrading should be points free.-The caravan march is fun, but the suppossed effects are not well planned: having your people starving or simply walking will either reduce your population or lower the morale, which eventually only affects the difficulty of your combats.-I'm not sure the reach of effect that your decisions have: seems like it affects more the ""how"" the story plays out than the ""wha"" (events).I clearly see several points that I'd liked the developers to improve for the second part, but this first game is a worthy experience: yes, combat could be better; and yes, your decisions could have much more weight in the story; however, this saga, franchise, has an amazing potential in all areas; and this first part is a good proof of it.7/10			"

												The Banner Saga while beautiful to watch delivers a grim story full of painful scenarios that create a bleak and melancholy world in which your caravan travels. The scenarios that come up frequently throughout your journey often leave you regretting your decisions and praying for reprieve. With that being said though the story and gameplay drives you to continue your journey; from managing your armies, keeping track of supplies to keep you going through the days and the constant brutality that is the decision making. The Banner Saga is brought to life with a gorgeous art style and illustrations. The character interaction and story gives a great depth to the world you are traversing with constant threat of war and death. The combat is a well-structured machine that relies both on the strategy in combat and the logistics outside of combat. Through that combat and the scenarios users are presented with, you gain a currency known as renown which gives you the caravan leader the duty of managing the resources and where they're spent. Should you buy more supplies for your armies to sustain themselves on their journey? Should you spend your renown purchasing trinkets and weapons for your people from the markets you come across? Or should you spend that renown promoting your units so they last longer in combat? It all comes down to human choice and well human error...Battle on through the realm and lead your caravan on a journey of discovery... and... pray that you don't kill off your trusted companion while trying to save a supply wagon.

												I am an artist, and I cannot praise the visual design and storytelling of this game enough. Is it a perfect game? No, but I still love it.Little needs to be said about the striking graphics, which seem lifted directly from a high-budget animated feature, so this review focuses mainly on gameplay. The battle sequences are what initially drew me to the game, in part because I prefer turn-based strategies to RTS. Elements of the battles remind me of the ""Tactics"" games (Ogre Tactics, Final Fantasy Tactics, etc.), which is a good thing. The system is carefully thought out, and a few bad decisions can see a character knocked out and unable to fight for one or more in-game days. This does create some potential for replayability, as a later run through would allow you to make different choices, but at this point, replayability is not something I see as a strength in the game. Why? That has to do with what happens outside the battles.Unsurprisingly, one must consider resources, which is standard fare in a TBS. But in the dialogues that occur, one's choices can mean losing characters, both individuals and groups. More so than most other games, there is a sense of permanence in these decisions, which brings to mind one of the strongest elements of this game: storytelling.Although the pacing often seems very slow—particularly when walking from one area to another—the story that unfolds is brilliant. On many occasions I found myself wishing The Banner Saga was a feature film so that I could just sit back and watch it happen.Overall, I highly recommend this game to fans of strategy games, with the caveat that those who prefer twitchy RTS games will probably find this too slow paced. For those new to strategy games, it may still be worth it, if only to enjoy the beautiful graphics and compelling storyline.Graphics: 9.5/10Audio: 9/10Gameplay: 9/10Replayability: 6/10Overall: 9/10			"

												After just completing one playthrough I am pleased with The Banner Saga. Visually unique by its drawn artwork and backed by an amazing soundtrack makes most scenes quite interesting. While it might seem boring to watch a caravan slowly churn to the next location or waiting for the next event. I mostly just found myself drawn in. My biggest complaint, which isn't even a big one to me, is I wished more dialogue was voiced. 99% of all dialogue is text, which is fine for me to read but I'd certainly be down for Ubin (the narrator) talking more. The voice work that is there is very well done, just used sparingly. The gameplay itself is mostly broken down into two segments, the combat itself and moving around the world. Traveling has very little options on ""where to go"", but some events allow for options. The system works by having renown (currency used to upgrade heroes and buy items/supplies) balanced between having enough food to not starve, but still upgrade units. Combat can stress this because having people get injured requires rest, which takes a day of supplies to do.Ultimately it works fairly well but any nags I would have end up being drowned out by me enjoying the overall experience. It does become fairly difficult, and that was just on normal. But I bet if I replayed it I would have less issues, but I'm willing to bet hard difficulty would be a challenege.I would definetly reccomend anyone to play this game if you enjoy turn based combat games (kings bounty, might/magic, etc) or someone who just enjoys a good world to sink yourself into. For whats basically a 3 man made game for ~700k. I am quite content with what was released from my original backing. I am definetly looking forward to seeing chapter 2/3			"

												The Banner saga is a light roleplaying game which fuses several elements to create an epic norse-inspired fantasy story about several groups struggling to survive during the end of their world. The experience is streamlined, with the roleplaying and strategy elements being fairly minimal but highly effective. This is a game where the focus is on the setting and the story, it stays away from being a grand cinematic experience and instead feels more like a personal struggle.Gameplay varies between side-scrolling travel as you see your caravan moving along the countryside, zoomed in static screens of visiting cities / landmarks, and isometric combat. Whilst travelling you must manage supplies in a style similar to Oregon Trail, stocking up between towns, whilst events crop up that break up the journey and throw your plans awry. Once in town / landmark locations you can choose between visiting certain characters or locations (to engage in dialogue, events and decision-making), stocking up on items and supplies at a market, training or resting.Once you enter into a combat situation it becomes an isometric turn-based affair. The combat is a little tricky to learn to start with (or at least I found it to be), but after a couple of fights you start to get acquainted with its intricacies. I’ve seen a number of complaints related to how the combat was too easy or too difficult (although there is a difficulty slider that can be adjusted at any time), and mention of certain tactics that are far more effective than others, but overall I found it relatively quick and fun. It’s interesting enough as a side-distraction from the story (or enhancing certain key events), but it’s not the main meat of the game.Something I found very refreshing was the fact that several characters who felt important to the story died during events and certain combat scenarios in my play-through. Being used to games like Mass Effect and so-on, where characters will only die during certain rare events that almost feel telegraphed, the contrast was welcome. I’ve heard people complain that you could spend time and effort levelling these characters up and investing resources on them only for them to die, but personally I found the threat of losing people thrilling and enjoyable, adding a sense of danger to the world and considerably heightening the tension during my journey.There is almost no voice-over work, although what little there is works well to help set the scene. The majority of the game is text, which gives the game a slower, more considered pace (a good thing, in my opinion) and I felt it lent a narrative, novel-like feel (although it is light in descriptive text compared to something like Planescape: Torment).The art is absolutely gorgeous, travelling across the landscape is a treat in and of itself, I thoroughly enjoyed watching my caravan crawl on to new vistas, new towns and landmarks. A few of the story twists and surprises are beautifully rendered in the art style, some whilst travelling whilst others are still scenes with text overlaid on the screen, a cost-effective but evocative way of displaying these events.There is a map which is, mechanically at least, fairly useless, but I recommend not overlooking it. It’s beautifully drawn and each element on the map is clickable giving you a little background information on the world and its history. It helps you understand the scale of the distances you’re travelling, although I felt it could have benefitted from some markers to show where you’ve been, how far the next town is and so on.Whilst this is the first chapter in a planned trilogy, the story does reach a conclusion of sorts here, although there are still many unanswered questions and a few important events are left hanging. But don’t let that put you off, there’s enough here that it feels like an interesting and valid story in its own right.I got about 15 hours from a single play-through, although I suspect it could be done in 8 – 10 if you’re really good at the combat sections (or set it to easy) or manage to skip certain events. Overall, I’d highly recommend it, I found it very rewarding and interesting and I'm eagerly awaiting the second chapter. It is very slow, but engaging, and if you don’t mind spending your time reading through a game instead of watching flashy cinematics, you’ll find this a unique and satisfying experience.			"

												The definition of an independent gem, glad to have backed the project in the kickstarter campaign. Not without some flaws, but given the small production team the final result is awesome. I definitely look forward for the second chapter.+ excellent graphics, scenery and environment+ very beautiful soundtrack+ turn-based strategy with a variety of heroes and abilities+ a constant and very convincing sense that you are being hunted and the odds are overwhelming against you+ nice change of setting (low-fantasy, North-European) with respect to generic type- rather short duration- strange autosave system, given also the grave outcome of specific decisions (see below)- a bit out-of-the-usual combat mechanism. It is much more to weaken each and every enemy rather than kill. - some decisions affect much more the caravan and the heroes than the combat outcome- no hint on how much you have to spend on supplies for the travel, or how to spend the renown to level heroes. You can upgrade a hero to lvl 5 spending a ton of renown only to lose him/her in the next instance without a clue or optionThe last three points are put as negative aspects but perhaps a better characterization would be controversial. On one hand they are definitely frustrating on the other it adds to the setting of not knowing what will happen next so that you feel vulnerable.			"

												Hard difficulty is the only mode of play I have experience on.That noted I enjoy this game, highly. I see alot of people complain about difficulty and leave bad reviews. If you do not setup and think for best engagements you will get rolled.But this is how it should be, I request the developers not relinquish difficulty for the more challenged generations. But instead lead an example as to how it feels to fail, and fail miserably. Hence the reward of reworking strategy.Some may be put off of the TBS/RPG infusion but I can say with most certainty..

												This game is basically an interactive storybook with tactical combat!  I was very impressed by the depth of the combat tactics, and I loved acquiring new warriors throughout the story so that I could try out new strategies.  Thankfully the game includes a Training Tent when your caravan camps, so you can test out new tactics and soldier combinations without risk.I found playing this game was very relaxing, and the inability to create a save game in the traditional sense actually enhanced the sense of ""there's no going back now"" that the story really needs.  There are so many times during the story when you end up wishing you could've made a different choice, but you have to play the game again to make different choices.I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys turn-based tactical combat and some light reading.

												A beautiful game with a simple, but adventurous story delivered in the form of a turn-based strategy (TBS). Unlike many other TBS games, this one isn't nearly as boring. The units are interesting enough and the gameplay is just deep enough to make decisions interesting and fun in a very short amount of time. In other words, you can get in a couple of quick rounds per session and make progress through the game in far less time than traditional TBS games.The art style is worthy of awards and the story is engaging. Throughout, you'll be asked to make decisions which change what happens next. You can also raise or lower the difficulty during gameplay by making different decisions. So even if you've set the difficulty to easy, you can make decisions later which make things harder than usual, and vice versa. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy. It's the casual game of TBS and worth every penny spent.			"

												Never played anything quite like it. Calling it RPG with turn based combat can be a bit misleading. You don't create your character and have little impact on how the characters you control progress. Instead you will be taking control of different characters throughout the story. It is an interesting approach to the storytelling and it works really well. The gameplay is really solid. The combat has enough deapth for my taste though it is not good enough to play it just for that reason (you should try free multiplayer Banner Saga: Factions though!) but it complements the story really well. While the story is on rails and you won't be able to choose were to go. There are many tough decisions on the way you will have to make which will have repercusions in the game. Some are small and some can kill key characters. While the game always leads to the same end, the game feels very organic.The plot isn't particulary brillaint but great characters, engaging choices, stellar atmosphere, artsyle and soundtrack make it a good story. Just keep in mind it is a first chapter in the ""Saga"" so while the game has nice arc and culmination, many questions will remain unanswered. Many people complain about the ending but I thought the game ended on a strong note.			"

												Seeing as very few people that I talk to find this game interesting, I see good reason to write a review. Banner Saga can be summed up with a few simple words, impacting RPG, challenging Combat for the one that seeks it, and strategic group management. The game takes inspiration from Nordic and Slavic mythology to form a whole new fantasy world were mankind struggle to live side by side with large human like Varls.  You will during the game follow a group of survivors that try to flee the struggles of war. It is an interesting world were even as the whole world is at war, people find small things to argue about. The artwork and music inside the game is masterful, everything is hand drawn and I for one often stuck around some areas a bit longer to just look at the background while listening to amazing soundtracks. The concept of the game is split into two phases, the roleplaying world and the battlefield. in the first one you follow a panning caravan of people as they progress the world while in the combat phase it turns into turn based combat with a very interesting health/armor system that will require you to find the best possible tactic to defeat your enemy. This is the first game in a planned series of three and it will leave you with a rather impacting cliffhanger but it also leaves you wanting more. With all the decision making inside the game the replay worth is massive, there are tons of branching stories that will challenge you to progress the story in your own way, some decisions may seem good at the beginning, but might end up getting you all killed. I recommend this game for its immerse and original story, and the strategic and tactical turn based combat.			"

												3/5 Story3/5 Gameplay3/5 Graphics2/5 Music2/5 Replay ValueAlthough The Banner Saga is a tactical rpg, it is a distinct departure from other games with that label. The story is more linear, the composition of your party more limited, and the battle options less diverse. Nevertheless, it is an intriguing game. The story focuses on the survival (rather than adventure and exploration) of two seperate groups traveling from one city to the next. Your caravan is composed of hundreds of npcs rather than just a party of a dozen or so like in many games and it is important to procure enough resources to feed them all. If you don't your clansmen and fighters begin to die off or abandon you. Likewise it is important to maintain good morale by resting during your travels, but doing so uses up a day's supplies without making any progress. It can be difficult to strike a balance especially since your resource for buying supplies is the same resource you use to level up your hero units and buy items to give them boosts. Sometimes throughout the game you will engage in a War event in which you choose whether to attack aggressively, defend yourselves, or even run away. This decision determines how difficult your battle with the enemy will be and how many casualties your bulk forces will suffer. Additionally throughout the game random events will occur requiring you to make leadership decisions, like whether or not to aid the sick and injured, how to handle a drunkard, or whether or not to give in to bandits. These decisions are presumably meant to give you the sense that you truly are part of a large caravan of people, but you never have the option to talk with random clansmen on your own, or interact with them in any meaningful way. Essentially every clan interaction is a text box and a few options to choose from. Personally it fails to give me that immersive quality I was hoping for.There is a vast map for the game world but you don't get to choose where to go or what route to take so the map hardly serves any purpose at all. Additionally it detracts from the beauty found in other areas of the game with it's childish scrawl and rough depiction. Similarly jarring are the many Godstones your caravan passes on it's travels. Each one is an opportunity to earn a special item but it is also a massive eyesore on the landscape and I hated having to see one each time. Otherwise the art was generally quite attractive with sweeping landscapes and beautiful splashes of color. Battles employ an interesting mechanic in which your health and your attack are the same stat. As a character loses health they also less effectively. Characters also have an armor statistic that reduces damage they take from enemy attacks. So for most battles the goal is to reduce your opponent's armor until you are able to deal damage to their strength and kill them. While some strategy is involved essentially the game amounts to beating on your opponent until you win. What little variety in abilities and strategic options exists is hindered by the lack of characters to choose from who employ them. Each character, with few exceptions is unique, but it's impossible to level them all up so you generally end up choosing the strongest few and sticking with them. Completley ignoring the rest of your party. I was also displeased to realize that if a character was equipped with one of my items when they left or were killed for story purposes, I lost the item forever. This made me paranoid about my party equipment and I would unequip everything from my characters after every fight, just in case.Ultimately the rpg aspects of the game fell flat for me and the story didn't feel substantial enough, but the overall mood of the game and the unique battle system and story progressing were intriguing. It feels to me like an unfinished game in desperate need of polish and expanding. Nevertheless I do believe it is worth playing, even if it leaves you feeling a bit unsatisfied and wanting more.

												The definition of an independent gem, glad to have backed the project in the kickstarter campaign. Not without some flaws, but given the small production team the final result is awesome. I definitely look forward for the second chapter.+ excellent graphics, scenery and environment+ very beautiful soundtrack+ turn-based strategy with a variety of heroes and abilities+ a constant and very convincing sense that you are being hunted and the odds are overwhelming against you+ nice change of setting (low-fantasy, North-European) with respect to generic type- rather short duration- strange autosave system, given also the grave outcome of specific decisions (see below)- a bit out-of-the-usual combat mechanism. It is much more to weaken each and every enemy rather than kill. - some decisions affect much more the caravan and the heroes than the combat outcome- no hint on how much you have to spend on supplies for the travel, or how to spend the renown to level heroes. You can upgrade a hero to lvl 5 spending a ton of renown only to lose him/her in the next instance without a clue or optionThe last three points are put as negative aspects but perhaps a better characterization would be controversial. On one hand they are definitely frustrating on the other it adds to the setting of not knowing what will happen next so that you feel vulnerable.			"

												Its like final fantasy tactics style combat mixed with oregon trail.  The game is a fairly linear story that you follow but gives you dozens of choices to make along the way that ultimate affect how the game plays out.  Sometimes in very major ways, sometimes in very minor ways.  The combat is very fun and on the normal difficulty it can be challenging at times.  There are three basic class types, humans, archers, and varl.  Each have their own subtypes that determine their unique skills.  As you play through the game you can level your heroes but at the cost of renown which is used for food and other things.  The story, music, and art is amazing as well.  It was a spectacular experience playing this game.			"

												An evil threatens the land and you must lead your people to safety, but your choices mean more than you may think. Simple dialogue options will change the outcome of your party and effect options down the line. An intricate battle system leads to victory or to pain. Will you be able to save your people?PROS: A very intricate and fun battle system (when you learn how to use it) Beautiful graphics Amazing music and SFX and voiceovers Controls are easy to understand/options laid out wellCONS: If you don't take time to learn the battle system it's very frustrating Travel becomes tedious Dialogue options are vague/don't know until you try Couple boss battles are a B!

												The Banner saga is a light roleplaying game which fuses several elements to create an epic norse-inspired fantasy story about several groups struggling to survive during the end of their world. The experience is streamlined, with the roleplaying and strategy elements being fairly minimal but highly effective. This is a game where the focus is on the setting and the story, it stays away from being a grand cinematic experience and instead feels more like a personal struggle.Gameplay varies between side-scrolling travel as you see your caravan moving along the countryside, zoomed in static screens of visiting cities / landmarks, and isometric combat. Whilst travelling you must manage supplies in a style similar to Oregon Trail, stocking up between towns, whilst events crop up that break up the journey and throw your plans awry. Once in town / landmark locations you can choose between visiting certain characters or locations (to engage in dialogue, events and decision-making), stocking up on items and supplies at a market, training or resting.Once you enter into a combat situation it becomes an isometric turn-based affair. The combat is a little tricky to learn to start with (or at least I found it to be), but after a couple of fights you start to get acquainted with its intricacies. I’ve seen a number of complaints related to how the combat was too easy or too difficult (although there is a difficulty slider that can be adjusted at any time), and mention of certain tactics that are far more effective than others, but overall I found it relatively quick and fun. It’s interesting enough as a side-distraction from the story (or enhancing certain key events), but it’s not the main meat of the game.Something I found very refreshing was the fact that several characters who felt important to the story died during events and certain combat scenarios in my play-through. Being used to games like Mass Effect and so-on, where characters will only die during certain rare events that almost feel telegraphed, the contrast was welcome. I’ve heard people complain that you could spend time and effort levelling these characters up and investing resources on them only for them to die, but personally I found the threat of losing people thrilling and enjoyable, adding a sense of danger to the world and considerably heightening the tension during my journey.There is almost no voice-over work, although what little there is works well to help set the scene. The majority of the game is text, which gives the game a slower, more considered pace (a good thing, in my opinion) and I felt it lent a narrative, novel-like feel (although it is light in descriptive text compared to something like Planescape: Torment).The art is absolutely gorgeous, travelling across the landscape is a treat in and of itself, I thoroughly enjoyed watching my caravan crawl on to new vistas, new towns and landmarks. A few of the story twists and surprises are beautifully rendered in the art style, some whilst travelling whilst others are still scenes with text overlaid on the screen, a cost-effective but evocative way of displaying these events.There is a map which is, mechanically at least, fairly useless, but I recommend not overlooking it. It’s beautifully drawn and each element on the map is clickable giving you a little background information on the world and its history. It helps you understand the scale of the distances you’re travelling, although I felt it could have benefitted from some markers to show where you’ve been, how far the next town is and so on.Whilst this is the first chapter in a planned trilogy, the story does reach a conclusion of sorts here, although there are still many unanswered questions and a few important events are left hanging. But don’t let that put you off, there’s enough here that it feels like an interesting and valid story in its own right.I got about 15 hours from a single play-through, although I suspect it could be done in 8 – 10 if you’re really good at the combat sections (or set it to easy) or manage to skip certain events. Overall, I’d highly recommend it, I found it very rewarding and interesting and I'm eagerly awaiting the second chapter. It is very slow, but engaging, and if you don’t mind spending your time reading through a game instead of watching flashy cinematics, you’ll find this a unique and satisfying experience.			"

												After just completing one playthrough I am pleased with The Banner Saga. Visually unique by its drawn artwork and backed by an amazing soundtrack makes most scenes quite interesting. While it might seem boring to watch a caravan slowly churn to the next location or waiting for the next event. I mostly just found myself drawn in. My biggest complaint, which isn't even a big one to me, is I wished more dialogue was voiced. 99% of all dialogue is text, which is fine for me to read but I'd certainly be down for Ubin (the narrator) talking more. The voice work that is there is very well done, just used sparingly. The gameplay itself is mostly broken down into two segments, the combat itself and moving around the world. Traveling has very little options on ""where to go"", but some events allow for options. The system works by having renown (currency used to upgrade heroes and buy items/supplies) balanced between having enough food to not starve, but still upgrade units. Combat can stress this because having people get injured requires rest, which takes a day of supplies to do.Ultimately it works fairly well but any nags I would have end up being drowned out by me enjoying the overall experience. It does become fairly difficult, and that was just on normal. But I bet if I replayed it I would have less issues, but I'm willing to bet hard difficulty would be a challenege.I would definetly reccomend anyone to play this game if you enjoy turn based combat games (kings bounty, might/magic, etc) or someone who just enjoys a good world to sink yourself into. For whats basically a 3 man made game for ~700k. I am quite content with what was released from my original backing. I am definetly looking forward to seeing chapter 2/3			"

												After a discrete experience as a videogamer I learned to classify games into macro-categories, more or less like steam tags. But there are some games, some little pearls, that lie outside every class. If you open the store page of The Banner Saga, it'll tell you that the game is a turn based RPG. Don't believe it. The tag is a lie. That is such a reductive definition that is like to say that the Hamlet is just a tragedy.The Banner Saga redefines itself presenting a game experience that does perfectly what a game should do: it carries you into another world, makes you feel what the characters feel, to the point I wasn't able not to finish it in one day.In the short, but at the same time long days of marching followed by your caravan, you feel the weight of leadership, the eyes of every person weighting your decisions, the fear of hunger for every day you pass in the open, with the supplies running short, the relief of entering a village and rest.Regarding the combat system, it may not be very innovative, but it wasn't meant for casual players, that's sure. On normal difficulty, enemies will smash you and leave you wounded for days, even after victory, if you don't put strategy and caution in your decisions. To cut it short, just because you are giant wielding a battle axe that doesn't mean that rush into enemies swinging it is a good idea.I suggest everyone to play this game. If you want more than entertainment from a game, if you want to feel something, if you want to fear, joy and cry (I admit it, just a little in the end), give it a try.""Why are we alive, when even the gods are dead?""

												The Banner Saga while beautiful to watch delivers a grim story full of painful scenarios that create a bleak and melancholy world in which your caravan travels. The scenarios that come up frequently throughout your journey often leave you regretting your decisions and praying for reprieve. With that being said though the story and gameplay drives you to continue your journey; from managing your armies, keeping track of supplies to keep you going through the days and the constant brutality that is the decision making. The Banner Saga is brought to life with a gorgeous art style and illustrations. The character interaction and story gives a great depth to the world you are traversing with constant threat of war and death. The combat is a well-structured machine that relies both on the strategy in combat and the logistics outside of combat. Through that combat and the scenarios users are presented with, you gain a currency known as renown which gives you the caravan leader the duty of managing the resources and where they're spent. Should you buy more supplies for your armies to sustain themselves on their journey? Should you spend your renown purchasing trinkets and weapons for your people from the markets you come across? Or should you spend that renown promoting your units so they last longer in combat? It all comes down to human choice and well human error...Battle on through the realm and lead your caravan on a journey of discovery... and... pray that you don't kill off your trusted companion while trying to save a supply wagon.

												Tactical RPG fun with a compelling theme. A few quibbles about game mechanics though - the combat mechanism encourages you to bleed enemies until they're almost dead, but not kill them until you're able to do so all at once. And the food/starvation mechanism doesn't seem to have much effect on your battles. But overall, a fun and interesting game that presents good tough choices.			"

												I have quite a bit of love for this game, but I'll say one negative thing about it: the combat system, while getting points in my book for being unique, ultimately rewards a gameplay style that is unintuitive.   For those who haven't played it:   The combat follows a strict turn-based system.  It's always Your Team -> Their Team -> Your Team -> Their Team until one of the parties has only one surviving member, which then takes the turns into sort of a ""blowout mode"" where the entire opposing party gets to move for each of the single unit's moves.  A character's combat effectiveness is in large part determined by their remaining health.  A character with 0 health missing will do more damage than a character with 3 points of health missing that is otherwise identical.   These two factors work together and lead to an interesting quirk - contrary to most tactical games where grouping around a single unit and removing it quickly provides the greatest strategic benefit by removing the total number of enemies faced, in the case of the Banner Saga, it ends up being best to leave weakened units alive rather than finish them.  If you're having trouble understanding, take this example.  You have 3 units at max health and the enemy has 3 units at max health.  There will be 6 turns in a ""rotation"", one for each unit.  The order will be A1-B1-A2-B2-A3-B3.  If you were to completely defeat one enemy unit, there would then be 5 turns in a ""rotation"", one for each unit, and the order will be A1-B1-A2-B2-A3.  Now, the next turn will be B again, but it will be B1, who is a fully powered unit.  Had you left B3 alive at one or two hit points, the turn would be given to B3 instead, and since B3 is very weak, any damage dealt by it would be greatly reduced.  If B1 and B2 do 6 damage each while B3 will only do 2 damage, A1-B1-A2-B2-A3-B3 results in 14 damage to your party across three turns, while A1-B1-A2-B2-A3-B1 results in 18 damage over three turns. By eliminating the weakest unit as opposed to leaving them in the battle, you have reduced the time between turns for the two strongest units the enemy has.  The strongest tactical decision will be leaving multiple enemies at low health to force the enemy team into ""wasting"" turns on the ineffective units while reducing turns for the most powerful enemies.   I want to emphasize that I do appreciate the benefits and wrinkles of this system, one would be parties who have a dwindling number of units are granted an automatically incrementing advantage.  I also appreciate the flavor of the ""rout"" mechanic where the lone surviving unit must give priority to each remaining opponent - it makes battles feel decisive when you're on the good end and makes them feel hopeless when you're on the receiving end.   My complaint with this ""flaw"" as I view it, is that it seems to be a very ""meta"" strategy.  That is to say, it feels at times like you're gaming the combat system as opposed to making tactical decisions -- killing the Big Bad last after maiming the rabble to ensure you only get thumped 1 of 6 turns instead of systematically answering and removing threats.   Regardless, this is a game I highly recommend.  Mechanically, it has several other devices that are quite novel.  Both the Armor and Exertion systems lend themselves to interesting decisions and interactions.   Flavor-wise, the game is outstanding.  It really makes you feel like a survivor fighting an unstoppable enemy and the grinding attrition of daily survival.   Do be aware: this is part one of a trilogy.  I did not know that when I started the game.  Without getting too spoilery, there are quite a few WOW moments at the end of the game that lead into a final battle that is frankly anticlimactic.  Knowing it was only the opening chapter of a grand story would have made things much more satisfying the first time around.   If you haven't played this game yet but are considering it, you're already interested enough to buy it.  The art and music are breathtaking and though your decisions end up not being the most eventful in the long run, they always result in immediate and sometimes totally unforeseen consequences.   Banner Saga is great!  Buy it!			"

												A Gentleman Gamer's Review of ""The Banner Saga,"" developed by Stoic Games and designed by Alex ThomasIntroduction:- The Banner Saga is a turn and grid based, tactical RPG in the similar fashion of Final Fantasy Tactics and other games of the sort. However, the story itself is more interactive than those games, giving you, the player, choices to urging dilemmas in your journey, and your actions have parallel consequences; whether they are for the better or worse. Unlike most RPGs, The Banner Saga breaks traditional and has an icy, yet beautiful, Viking setting. Plot Summary:- The plot focuses on two different caravans with differing casts of protagonists that eventually interweaves together. You start off as an old and wise Varl, a towering race of horned vikings, named Ubin that joins a band of Varls that are tasked to escort a human prince, Ludin, to a far city to strengthen relations between the two races. The story also shifts to the perspective of a man named Rook and his daughter Alette. Unexpectedly, a third race of dark gigantic figures, known as the Dredge, threatens the existence of their world. This looming threat directs the two groups to eventually cross paths and band united as our heroes fend off this army of relentless, innumerable beings. The Dredge pillage any village in sight, fearing the end of days, they seek for a way to evade and ultimately end the Dredge horde.Presentation:- What immediately stands out from this game is its gorgeous, classic art style and animations. It is very Disney like visually; the story is anything but, however. You will soon understand that this world is a dog eat dog world; danger and death broods in the shadows. Cutscenes are very charming and well done; however, they are scarce and far apart. Even though I would like more of these crisp animated scenes, I may have become overdone and over stayed its welcome. Therefore, It is more spectacular to see a cutscene late game, because it may have lost meaning if they were at every few minutes. Though not very memorable, the music does set the tone and is relatively enjoyable; you feel the intensities of battle or the long journeys your caravans trek. However, with being such an odd setting in comparison to other RPGs, it was slow to grow accustom to the story and characters. Eventually, I became invested to the them and quite enjoyed the different personalities you mean through this adventure. One complaint I may add is at times, you are to make a decision based on situation you are in; unfortunately, a couple of times, it was vague on what I was deciding on so I just hoped I was making a keen decision, but these moments came rarely (perhaps it was poor reading on my part but I usually reread most things,)Gameplay & Mechanics:- Being a tactics game, the battle system consists of positioning your heroes on a battlefield strategically according to their attack type, specialty and so on. Some unique aspects about the battle system are: the order your units attack in is not by speed, for there are not speed stats in the game, but by order you wish you want them to move in. Another notable aspect is the Strength stat, because unlike other RPGs, your strength stat is actually two in one. It is both your HP and your physical power. As your character takes more and more damage, his or her attacks become weaker as well; therefore, you are to decide to focus on armor or strength, perhaps a balance of both. Characters in battle can exert themselves to either go farther on the map or do extra damage towards strength or armor. Every time you Rank and Promote (level up) a character, you can increase any stat of your choosing but only twice per level. This makes a simple RPG have deeper complexity. You can have other; weaker characters chip away at armor so enemies receive more damage or have a strong hitter that can go over most defences but be more vulnerable to attacks; this leaves it up to you on what you like to use in battle. However, the terrains are always flat and there are no physical obstacles or barriers in battle, just a grid. There are no random encounters in this game meaning that you can't grind and become undeniably over powered for the story; this makes the game a fair challenge through and through. When you are not in battle, you are either on travel mode or in a city. Just because you are not in battle doesn't mean you can take it easy, you must manage food supplies and make difficult choices. This can affect your morale meter. If it goes low, your party will perform poorly in battle. If one of your members falls in battle, they will be injured for a set amount of days and until they heal, they will do worse in battle. There is no perma death in battle; however, there is perma death outside of battle so think out your decisions. I reccomend for your first play through to commit to your choices even if you didn't like the outcome to create a unique experience. Final Thoughts:- I'd rather enjoyed The Banner Saga and recommend it to any RPG fans that want a refreshing take on the tactic genre. For a RPG, it's somewhat short; it taking me a good 13 hours to beat it my first go; however, seeing how my decisions affected the my journey, I would say it has replayability. The Banner Saga 2 has also been announced so if you are interested and end up enjoying the game as well, you can get right into the next journey winter of 2015. If you are still want more of this game style, there is a online game, The Banner Saga Factions; however, its user base is very thin; hopefully it grows.			"

												I highly recomend this game! People might say the game is a bit unforgiving, but guess what life is unfair too. Though, I felt that the story was a bit short. DO NOT FRET! Banner Saga 2 is currently in development. Gameplay-It's basically a turn-based strategy game and you can collect items and level heroes to improve their stats it can be hard at times, but I found it intriging and enjoyable enough to set asides its clunkyness. Art/Music- I was literally bloooooowwn away from the art and quickly fell in love with it, a decent amount of the game you can view the landscapes and stare in awe with the atmosphere it creates. The music felt like it had Nordic origin and it seemed to perfectly blend in with every scene.Writing: The game offers so much options, meaning so much replayability to discover the possible outcomes you could've have missed. Overall, this is a game that was money well spent and I hope you get to exprience the game the same way i did			"

												I have now completed the game twice and feel like I can properly review the experience. Starting off, this is a very nice change of pace from the regular game, mixing a blend of choose-your-own-adventure with some turn-based combat. Add to that a beautiful artstyle and a superb soundtrack and you get a thoroughly enjoyable experience from beginning to end.The first playthrough was definitely the most memorable as each choice you are presented provides a provocative and ethical dilemma that needs to be solved, often pitting you against a range of really bad choices where there's no real ""good"" outcome to any of them. The feeling of hopelessness and desperation oozes from every minute you play it, and it truly feels like you are the last hope and salvation of your entire caravan of people and fighters. On the second playthrough, things are a little less engaging, as you start to realise that some of the choices you can make through the journey are somewhat arbitrary and you end up running into most encounters and situations no matter what choice you make along the road. You are also aware of some of the more important events and can easily avoid them by, for instance, refusing to allow certain characters to join your party along the way.The combat is fairly well balanced throughout the game and often provides a nice challenge even on Normal difficulty. There are portions of the game where you are part of a smaller battle sequence where a regular turn-based fight can be extended into a second round, but you are almost always at such a severe disadvantage when you launch a second round that I ended up only attempting it a single time, getting my ♥♥♥♥ handed to me, and then staying away from them for the rest of the experience.Here I can take the time to address one of the problems with the game, being the isometric perspective of the battles. At times it can become very cluttered when a lot of allies and enemies are placed in squares next to each other, making targeting of enemies and using abilities somewhat annoying at times. The option to turn the camera, so to say, would have helped here, allowing for easier battle management. However, this could be seen as part of the design, making the heat of battle seem more confusing for the commander.This following paragraph is somewhat of a spoiler, but not a massive one, so skip to the next one if you want to experience everything for yourself: The very final battle (and the preparation leading up to it as well) is a very stiff challenge, and if you have been unlucky or have been spreading out your experience points and currency too much, you might not even be able to finish the game. On both my playthroughs, the final fight took a number of attempts to finish, and me winning mostly just comes down to being lucky in the rounds that I won on. The fight itself is very unfair at times and can leave you very frustrated. However, as it is the last fight in the game, the stiff challenge is somewhat appropriate, but it could be more fairly balanced. Seeing as you could possibly end up in a situation where the entire sequence becomes impossible, ruining a perhaps 12-hour game for a player and forcing them to restart or jump back to a previous point, I can understand that a lot of players are really frustrated at this part.The game also ends rather abruptly, but with a nice climax in the story. I can only imagine that this is because the developers are working in an episodic format and I have heard people mentioning that this is supposed to be the first part in a three part story, which would make perfect sense with the way the story is formatted. Overall, the story is engaging and you truly want to see the characters come through it.All in all, I strongly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys a good story-driven game with an emphasis on turn-based combat. If you're a fan of the old choose-your-own-adventure type games and books, this is also very appropriate for you. The beautiful artwork and soundtrack should also peak your interest, and if you're more interested in the story, the visuals, and the sound, you could turn down the difficulty to Easy and just enjoy the ride. You won't regret it. :)			"

												I have quite a bit of love for this game, but I'll say one negative thing about it: the combat system, while getting points in my book for being unique, ultimately rewards a gameplay style that is unintuitive.   For those who haven't played it:   The combat follows a strict turn-based system.  It's always Your Team -> Their Team -> Your Team -> Their Team until one of the parties has only one surviving member, which then takes the turns into sort of a ""blowout mode"" where the entire opposing party gets to move for each of the single unit's moves.  A character's combat effectiveness is in large part determined by their remaining health.  A character with 0 health missing will do more damage than a character with 3 points of health missing that is otherwise identical.   These two factors work together and lead to an interesting quirk - contrary to most tactical games where grouping around a single unit and removing it quickly provides the greatest strategic benefit by removing the total number of enemies faced, in the case of the Banner Saga, it ends up being best to leave weakened units alive rather than finish them.  If you're having trouble understanding, take this example.  You have 3 units at max health and the enemy has 3 units at max health.  There will be 6 turns in a ""rotation"", one for each unit.  The order will be A1-B1-A2-B2-A3-B3.  If you were to completely defeat one enemy unit, there would then be 5 turns in a ""rotation"", one for each unit, and the order will be A1-B1-A2-B2-A3.  Now, the next turn will be B again, but it will be B1, who is a fully powered unit.  Had you left B3 alive at one or two hit points, the turn would be given to B3 instead, and since B3 is very weak, any damage dealt by it would be greatly reduced.  If B1 and B2 do 6 damage each while B3 will only do 2 damage, A1-B1-A2-B2-A3-B3 results in 14 damage to your party across three turns, while A1-B1-A2-B2-A3-B1 results in 18 damage over three turns. By eliminating the weakest unit as opposed to leaving them in the battle, you have reduced the time between turns for the two strongest units the enemy has.  The strongest tactical decision will be leaving multiple enemies at low health to force the enemy team into ""wasting"" turns on the ineffective units while reducing turns for the most powerful enemies.   I want to emphasize that I do appreciate the benefits and wrinkles of this system, one would be parties who have a dwindling number of units are granted an automatically incrementing advantage.  I also appreciate the flavor of the ""rout"" mechanic where the lone surviving unit must give priority to each remaining opponent - it makes battles feel decisive when you're on the good end and makes them feel hopeless when you're on the receiving end.   My complaint with this ""flaw"" as I view it, is that it seems to be a very ""meta"" strategy.  That is to say, it feels at times like you're gaming the combat system as opposed to making tactical decisions -- killing the Big Bad last after maiming the rabble to ensure you only get thumped 1 of 6 turns instead of systematically answering and removing threats.   Regardless, this is a game I highly recommend.  Mechanically, it has several other devices that are quite novel.  Both the Armor and Exertion systems lend themselves to interesting decisions and interactions.   Flavor-wise, the game is outstanding.  It really makes you feel like a survivor fighting an unstoppable enemy and the grinding attrition of daily survival.   Do be aware: this is part one of a trilogy.  I did not know that when I started the game.  Without getting too spoilery, there are quite a few WOW moments at the end of the game that lead into a final battle that is frankly anticlimactic.  Knowing it was only the opening chapter of a grand story would have made things much more satisfying the first time around.   If you haven't played this game yet but are considering it, you're already interested enough to buy it.  The art and music are breathtaking and though your decisions end up not being the most eventful in the long run, they always result in immediate and sometimes totally unforeseen consequences.   Banner Saga is great!  Buy it!			"

												I can not remember when I had to make such tough choices in gaming the last time. The story is brutal, makes you feel bad everytime you see the effects of your decisions. Because they matter. Because the world is tough and if you fail as a leader, your people die. Because if you decide that those resisting farmers shoudl give you their food so your clan can survive, you will have to kill them. This is Banner Saga, and it is awesome!I am not normally the one to play story-driven games, but this one had me at the first choice to make. The combat system is refreshing enough to make it feel your tactic matters. Someone that got hit a lot, can't hti back this hard, someone withotu armour left, gets hit harder as well. Pretty logical, but amazing how it surprised me with these mechanics I have never encountered in any game so far.By the way, if you are not the type for story-games, try out Banner Saga: Factions, it is free to play and features the same classes and battles as Banner Saga, but in a PvP-environment, where you fight against other leaders.9/10 just because there is a small bit of potential left. Let's hope they nail it again with the next chapter.			"

												A Gentleman Gamer's Review of ""The Banner Saga,"" developed by Stoic Games and designed by Alex ThomasIntroduction:- The Banner Saga is a turn and grid based, tactical RPG in the similar fashion of Final Fantasy Tactics and other games of the sort. However, the story itself is more interactive than those games, giving you, the player, choices to urging dilemmas in your journey, and your actions have parallel consequences; whether they are for the better or worse. Unlike most RPGs, The Banner Saga breaks traditional and has an icy, yet beautiful, Viking setting. Plot Summary:- The plot focuses on two different caravans with differing casts of protagonists that eventually interweaves together. You start off as an old and wise Varl, a towering race of horned vikings, named Ubin that joins a band of Varls that are tasked to escort a human prince, Ludin, to a far city to strengthen relations between the two races. The story also shifts to the perspective of a man named Rook and his daughter Alette. Unexpectedly, a third race of dark gigantic figures, known as the Dredge, threatens the existence of their world. This looming threat directs the two groups to eventually cross paths and band united as our heroes fend off this army of relentless, innumerable beings. The Dredge pillage any village in sight, fearing the end of days, they seek for a way to evade and ultimately end the Dredge horde.Presentation:- What immediately stands out from this game is its gorgeous, classic art style and animations. It is very Disney like visually; the story is anything but, however. You will soon understand that this world is a dog eat dog world; danger and death broods in the shadows. Cutscenes are very charming and well done; however, they are scarce and far apart. Even though I would like more of these crisp animated scenes, I may have become overdone and over stayed its welcome. Therefore, It is more spectacular to see a cutscene late game, because it may have lost meaning if they were at every few minutes. Though not very memorable, the music does set the tone and is relatively enjoyable; you feel the intensities of battle or the long journeys your caravans trek. However, with being such an odd setting in comparison to other RPGs, it was slow to grow accustom to the story and characters. Eventually, I became invested to the them and quite enjoyed the different personalities you mean through this adventure. One complaint I may add is at times, you are to make a decision based on situation you are in; unfortunately, a couple of times, it was vague on what I was deciding on so I just hoped I was making a keen decision, but these moments came rarely (perhaps it was poor reading on my part but I usually reread most things,)Gameplay & Mechanics:- Being a tactics game, the battle system consists of positioning your heroes on a battlefield strategically according to their attack type, specialty and so on. Some unique aspects about the battle system are: the order your units attack in is not by speed, for there are not speed stats in the game, but by order you wish you want them to move in. Another notable aspect is the Strength stat, because unlike other RPGs, your strength stat is actually two in one. It is both your HP and your physical power. As your character takes more and more damage, his or her attacks become weaker as well; therefore, you are to decide to focus on armor or strength, perhaps a balance of both. Characters in battle can exert themselves to either go farther on the map or do extra damage towards strength or armor. Every time you Rank and Promote (level up) a character, you can increase any stat of your choosing but only twice per level. This makes a simple RPG have deeper complexity. You can have other; weaker characters chip away at armor so enemies receive more damage or have a strong hitter that can go over most defences but be more vulnerable to attacks; this leaves it up to you on what you like to use in battle. However, the terrains are always flat and there are no physical obstacles or barriers in battle, just a grid. There are no random encounters in this game meaning that you can't grind and become undeniably over powered for the story; this makes the game a fair challenge through and through. When you are not in battle, you are either on travel mode or in a city. Just because you are not in battle doesn't mean you can take it easy, you must manage food supplies and make difficult choices. This can affect your morale meter. If it goes low, your party will perform poorly in battle. If one of your members falls in battle, they will be injured for a set amount of days and until they heal, they will do worse in battle. There is no perma death in battle; however, there is perma death outside of battle so think out your decisions. I reccomend for your first play through to commit to your choices even if you didn't like the outcome to create a unique experience. Final Thoughts:- I'd rather enjoyed The Banner Saga and recommend it to any RPG fans that want a refreshing take on the tactic genre. For a RPG, it's somewhat short; it taking me a good 13 hours to beat it my first go; however, seeing how my decisions affected the my journey, I would say it has replayability. The Banner Saga 2 has also been announced so if you are interested and end up enjoying the game as well, you can get right into the next journey winter of 2015. If you are still want more of this game style, there is a online game, The Banner Saga Factions; however, its user base is very thin; hopefully it grows.			"

												Art: 10/10Story: 10/10Turn-Based Combat: 6/10Overall Game Balance: 7/10TL;DR:I am an old Turn Based Strategy veteran. Games like Front Mission, Final Fantasy Tactics, Vandal Hearts. If you want deep and balanced tactical combat this is NOOOOT your game. If you want engaging, dramatic dialogue and a colourful story give it a go.-------As a narrative experience, this game is incredible. (WHILE I DID NOT FINISH IT!) I found the story to be mysterious, rousing and very engaging. The writers do an excellent job of making you feel welcome and at home in the setting. The Gods that operate the heavens and earth are dead. The sun is stuck, hung dead in the sky. Humanity is crumbling. The Varl no longer bear children. An ancient evil race of golems, once banished to the northlands are once again descending from their lofty prison. These are the final days.You spend about half the game fighting, and half reading dialogue/choosing options. Choose wisely and you will be rewarded with extra food and followers, choose poorly and your desperate group of survivors will suffer. While I am not certain whether you can have EVERYONE in the caravan die and lose the game, it certainly did feel like a constant struggle to stay afloat. I was always weighing the decisions between using my experience points (Renown) to level up my heroes, or simply buy food for the women and children.The combat itself has simple features, and a hidden depth. Strength and HP are the same stat. The healthier you are, the more damage you do. Weakening the enemy group is sometimes much more important than killing them outright. Battles ALWAYS have one team take a turn, followed by the next team. So even if you kill an enemy combatant, another healthy one just gets more actions to hurt you with.Attacks ALWAYS hit. There are no misses, really. Deflections happen when an enemy has more ARMOR than you are able to pierce with your strength, but you're not rolling dice to determine miss chances. Whittle down the armor to do more strength/HP damage, or attack their HP directly in the hope that they can't hit you as hard right away. It's often a tough decision.I was very frustrated by many of the decisions I had to make in the game. I found that powerful combatants could be lost from the party forever by choosing poorly in a simple dialogue option, and if you want to load and try the conversation again, you have to load from before the last battle. This is a huge pain in the ♥♥♥. It adds to the feeling of desperation and hopelessness, but can really screw up your team composition for the next fight.Overall I definitely reccomend Banner Saga. But if you're looking for pure tactics and strategy, this title has little to offer.			"

												A definite gem of a game, although rough on the edges at times.The hand of the ex-Bioware team is obvious in the compelling story, score of interesting characters and engaging Rpg-gameplay. Imagine Tell Tales’ The Walking Dead and Final fantasy having a baby that was to be nurtured and educated by Mass Effect and Baldur’s Gate.The world of The Banner Saga is grim, cold and beautiful, alive with people and lore to give it substance and plenty of mysteries to give it it’s magical, mythical feel.As the title suggests, you will play out the events in an epic Norse saga in which your choices have either a direct or long-term impact on the world. The story and it’s events, however, are harsh and dramatic making the choices on your path difficult and the following consequences  sometimes hard to swallow.In this, the developers have succeeded in bringing a Norse-themed Game of Thrones like world to their game. Wars, diplomacy between races and nations, strong heroes and faulty leaders in a ‘terror from the north’ story overshadowed by impending doom, add to this.The, at times, faulty grammar or punctuation doesn’t stand in the way of a great game and a wonderful experience. If you’re a fan of story driven RPG’s and solid strategic-turn-based combats The Banner Sage will provide! "

												Finally, a fun version of Oregon Trail. :DBanner Saga is an enjoyable game. The characters are intreguing, the plot is intricate, and the atwork is stunning. If you like turn-based, tactical, story-driven games, you will like this game. The world is very reminicent of Norse Mythology, but also unique with its own creatures. It can be challenging to keep party members alive, but that makes it more fun. There is a lot of reading, so if that's not your thing, this is not for you. My only issue is that I wish there were more of it, but now the second one is out. Hopefully, the second one will be longer than the first.			"

												With so many games resembling a good meal, like a steak with a side of mashed potatoes and some juicy sauce, I've been fed up with AAA titles recently. The Banner Saga is like an exquisite dessert. The portion is small, yes, but the flavour is so unique that you would definetly want more.Food metaphores aside, I recommend this game highly. The combat mechanics are great, the visuals are awe-inspiring, yada-yada-yada. The thing that got to me most, is the atmosphere of complete desperation. The world is ending, and there's nothing you can do about it. No heroes to battle the darkness and win, no magical swords to end the enemy horde's approach. Every victory is temporary, you run, losing people and land. You learn to appreciate small things, like getting a bunch of supplies from a village. HELL YES, my caravan will not starve for a whole day! This tension gets kind of exhausting after a while, but the game is short enough for this not to be a problem. If you like RPG's, tactical combat, good storytelling, all things viking and norse - this game is your kind of savoury meal.			"

												I held off on buying this for a bit but now wish I had got to it sooner, as it's excellent. Was initially confused by the story but  it opens up and becomes clearer as the game goes on. The main characters are excellent and the graphics are pretty unique for 2014, coming across like a 1980s animated movie. The game feels tough, people die and you run out of food and you have to make tough decisions that people hate. The tactical combat is very fun, and can often be challenging, but a crushing defeat does not mean the end of the game, which is fortunate. In the story sequences I felt like my choices had a big impact on events, and I like the game a lot for that, but I can't say for sure unless I go back and replay it.Survival games became ten a penny in 2014 but I feel that this one nails the theme better than any other (though I haven't yet tried the sublime looking ""This War of Mine""). I understand there is a sequel in the works, and I look forward to it's arrival.			"

												The Banner Saga is a post-apocalyptic Viking Age Oregon Trail with fights. If you're still reading instead of buying this game on that description alone, fine - let's get serious: The Banner Saga is a story-driven, turn-based strategy-RPG with incredible art and music that oozes atmosphere and sucks you right into its bleak yet beautiful world. Basically the game tells the story of caravans of Nordic humans and horned giants called Varl struggling to survive after Ragnarok. The gods are dead. The sun has stopped moving in the sky. A great darkness is descending from the North, bringing with it an unstoppable host of mysterious stone creatures called Dredge. The game looks like a Disney animated feature (one of the good ones), but the story has more in common with Game of Thrones than Pocahontas, filled with old blood feuds, betrayal, and grey morality. The point of view switches back and forth a few times at first, getting the player acquainted with the many different characters. Players who aren't paying close attention may find themselves confused, especially in the dialogue scenes where it's not always made abundantly clear who is speaking. The art in this game is gorgeous - just look at the screenshots. Unfortunately the only fully animated and voiced sequence comes at the very beginning, and all of the following dialogue scenes are silent and only minimally animated (blinking eyes, blowing hair, etc.). A bit more animation in the conversations - changing facial expressions to fit what is being said, for instance - would not have been amiss. But even so, everything looks fantastic, including the character animations in combat.The sound is great too. One of the requisite Kickstarter ""stretch goals"" was to hire a live orchestra for composer Austin Wintory, and it shows. Some of the vocal elements weirded me out at times, but on the whole the soundtrack is outstanding, and perfectly complements the mood and setting of the game. There is very little voice work - mostly limited to narration - but all of it is good, if heavily accented. There are two sides to the gameplay. Let's call them Oregon Trail and Gladius. In the Oregon Trail parts, you will see your caravan trudging slowly over the picturesque landscape. As you travel, you will lose Supplies. Supplies can be purchased in towns using Renown, the other currency in the game, which is also used for leveling up characters and buying magic items (each character only has 1 inventory slot for 1 magic item). If you run out of supplies, then each day some of the people in your caravan will die. You can rest for 1 day's worth of supplies to improve your caravan's Morale. High morale will grant you bonus Willpower in combat. Random encounters pop up on the way, offering a series of choices. Choose carefully. I will talk more about the Choices & Consequences aspect of the game later.Unfortunately, aside from a those event choices, the Oregon Trail gameplay has little actual effect on the combat or the story. There are Steam achievements for managing your caravan well, but otherwise you can let everyone die and still finish the game, since apparently your main characters are able to live without eating (?), and a bit of rest will still improve morale. It seems like that needs fixing to me. Now for the Gladius part of gameplay: the turn-based combat. It's an interesting system. Each unit has both Armor (blue) and Strength (red). You can attack a unit's Armor to make it more vulnerable to Strength attacks. Reducing a unit's Strength not only lowers its health but also its damage. Here's where things get interesting... As long as you both have at least 2 units alive, you and your opponent will always alternate turns. This means that, if you reduce an enemy unit's strength to 1, it's often better to leave it alive but crippled than to finish it off, because your enemy's turns will be wasted on these weak units. But even crippled units can still take you by surprise, and killing them grants you bonus Willpower points, so it's a strategy you have to learn to play just right.What I'm saying here is that I found the combat fun and challenging. Though it could benefit from added variety (each character only has one special ability), it's a solid and engaging system that makes you think. You can switch the difficulty mode at any time if combat feels too easy or hard. I found the standard difficulty perfect on my first playthrough, though that final boss battle was... we'll just say adequately frustrating. The final boss is also the only fight of the game (I think) that you need to win. All other fights can be lost, and the story will continue without a game over screen. Though characters who fall in combat do not die if you win (they only become injured for a few days), losing combat too often can have an impact on the story that could possibly get characters killed.In fact, let's talk Choices & Consequences, which to me is the most important aspect of any RPG or semi-RPG. Unfortunately, most of the choices in the Banner Saga story have a clear good option and several bad options. And I don't mean ""good vs. evil"" - the game does an excellent job of maintaining a grey morality. I mean ""ideal choice"" vs. ""less ideal choices"", instead of equally viable options with a mix of good and bad consequences. This is bad, because it encourages metagaming and savescumming in order to find the ""right"" choice.Despite this, the consequences of your choices aren't to be underestimated. While they won't change the overall path of the story (which, like your path of travel, is pre-determined and linear), some choices can have immediate, disastrous consequences like the loss of many supplies or the sudden permanent deaths of characters in your group. Others (especially one in particular) can have delayed consequences that you might not see coming much later in the story. Which is a good thing!Speaking of savescumming, I should mention that this game has no manual save system - just a checkpoint system that creates separate saves at the start of each chapter. I'm tempted to call this a good thing, because it curbs the temptation to load frequently. And if there's one thing I can say for certain, it's that The Banner Saga is best played by going in blind and never loading your game, even if you lose a fight, especially since there are very few ways to get a true ""game over"" screen. You will get the most out of the story and the experience this way. And yes, it's an experience. The story builds up slowly, so stick it out through the first few parts and you'll be rewarded. You will fight and struggle to survive as resources dwindle, you will make tough choices and watch beloved companions die, as you lead your ragged fellowship to the bitter end. Only... it's not quite an ending, because this is only the first chapter of a planned three-chapter game. Sorry! Don't get me wrong; the story definitely reaches a satisfying climax. But it's fairly short, and you're left wondering what happens next. Guess we'll have to wait and see!The Banner Saga is a relatively short and simple game, but it's a good one. Sure, it could be improved by things like non-linear map roaming, a branching story, and more unit abilities and terrain variety in combat. But I applaud the small team at Stoic for not being overly ambitious with their size and budget. They seem to have a clear vision of exactly the game they want to make, and they made it with passion. Nearly everything the Banner Saga tries to do, it does very well: outstanding art and music complement a unique and interesting epic story with solid writing, backed up by fun and challenging gameplay. What more can one ask for? Basically just more of it, but that should be on the way! Perhaps the next two chapters will bring added features and complexity too.			"

												Fantastic game! Played it the last couple hours and I am very happy that I backed this project when it was on kickstarter. The characters are beautifully drawn and the story keeps me on the edge of my seat. The alternation between two caravans keeps you in suspense. It is, however, very likely that you completely forget about the other caravan because you are kept busy by the game not to kill everyone off.You can definitely see that former Bioware staff is behind this game. If you liked Dragon Age and Mass Effect you should get this game. The fighting is comparable to XCOM: Enemy unknown.			"

												In contention for the best game of 2014, The Banner Saga combines beautiful art with a fascinating world and an intricate (if sometimes bizarre) turn-based strategy game.The story of TBS is ""grim and gritty"" in the truest sense of the phrase. Rather than relying on gratuitious swearing and violence, it presents a dying world overwhelmed in confusion, desperation, and shame. Nations are overrun by multiple apocalyptic forces seemingly vying for the right to end the world. Bandits apologize even as they attack you to steal your food, and you can easily find yourself in the same situation. Ageless giants ponder the legacy of their race as they die out in senseless battle. Oregon Trail is a common point of comparison - and rightly so - but there, you ventured through the wilds knowing that wealth and prosperity awaited you. Playing The Banner Saga is an experience in leading refugees drifting from bad place to worse, wondering if the world will ever cut you a break.When not leading your caravan, you'll find yourself in turn-based combat against soldiers, bandits, and the monstrous dread. The system itself is tightly polished, but almost completely unlike typical games like Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy Tactics, or XCOM. It may take some time to adjust to the wildly different assumptions - focus firing is no longer a great strategy, and maiming is often preferable to killing - but if you take the time to dig into it, it's a refreshingly new take on what could easily have been a rehash of dozens of games you've already played.

												I recommend this game but with some caution: here's why.The game is still in some early development, and you can see bits of it in its playthrough. For example, you have three stats that represent your community: clansmen, fighters, and varls (giants). Throughout the story you make many decisions - some may end a characters life - but most of them augment your ability to keep your clansmen alive. The clansmen do NOTHING by the end of the game. Having lots is the exact same (as far as I can tell) as having few. What would be excellent for the developers to do, is to allow different decisions to arise based on your stats - for example: an event might only happen if your have poor morale, or a whole bunch of clansmen. Furthermore, although it is hard to write, make the decisions change the story permanently, and derail the plotline into something new (in particular there is one decision like this in the game and it is excellent!).The games inception is excellent. You definitely feel as if your are part of a big world; the culture, music, characters, and even the art style all help contribute to this excellent asset. Unfortunately this alls falls a little short at the end of the game, because it is the first part of a yet to be developed trilogy, and the game ends rather suddenly (although the ending is pretty interesting)In sum, this game has absolutely huge potential, and the developers are taking feedback to heart for the second and third games. I recommend this game, but for its price, you might want to wait it out and see how the second game is recieved. Pick it up if it is on sale, or if you want to support the game's potential.			"

												Fairly lauded for distinctive artistic design and a atmospheric OST. The game sets the pace with impressive animated cutscene reminiscent of the 1978 animated LOTR film/animated Shakespeare, though, sadly, fails to follow up with similar quality in much of the later content. The static animation is of a high quality, but I feel that the storyline and game as a whole suffered as a result of the sparsity of such talented animation. Admittedly, this may have been due to budget restrictions - as this game is said to be the first installment of a trilogy, fans will undoubtedly be able to expect a more polished, invested experience from the upcoming episodes on account of the financial success of Stoic studios' initial sales.The tactical gameplay has a challenging learning curve, though a tutorial introduces the player to the basics and a 'training' mode will help uncertain players get to grips with the system in short order. If you wish to try it out before purchasing the game, you can play an online FTP version of the battle system called 'The Banner Saga: Factions'. However, the compelling OST, along with a plot-driven investment in the outcome of each engagement, ensures that the single-player product has a (superior, IMHO) mystique of its own.My only reservation concerning this otherwise well-executed game is the lack of an inherent multiplayer capacity. The FTP online version is evidently designed to satisfy this purpose, though I was disappointed that purchasing the game did not offer any kind of bonus or incentive to get involved with the FTP multiplayer component.Overall, though, The Banner Saga is illuminated by an absorbing narrative set within an atmospheric and enchanting environment, supported by the foundation of a solid tactical game mechanic.

												The Banner Saga is a game about a world. There are dozens of characters, all with compelling personalities and motivations, and while you only take full control of a couple of them, the story sections are filled with so much thoughtful dialogue you will end up relating to just about everybody. But even more than that is the world they find themselves in. Drawing largely from norse mythology while adding a few twists of it's own, The Banner Saga shows us a land rich in narrative and life. The first time the map opened up I spent the better part of an hour exploring and reading and understanding it all- it's just that well thought out. You lead your band of warriors and clansmen through hostile lands, trying to unearth the secrets of the most recent crisis. The sun has stopped, the gods are dead, new behemoths loom large, and hordes of stone-skinned warriors threaten to destroy everything. The world of The Banner Saga almost gives the feeling of the real world- much bigger than your individual experience, yet you still eke out your own path and do what you can to help. Whether you help yourself or the world at large is your choice.Now this game has a lot of moral choices in it. There's no morality system (thank god), but very frequently you will be choosing between many tough decisions to make. Almost everything counts, too. If you ever wondered what leading a large group of people in tough times feels like, I think this game gives a very flavorful taste of that. Definitely not something to be missed, if only for that experience.I've already gone on a while- I leave the sound and art direction for the interested player to look into. Needless to say both are beautiful and compelling. I can't recommend this game highly enough. It delivers on several fronts- gameplay, story, music, art direction- this game has it all. If you happen to dislike the game in one of those areas, you're in luck, because there are three more to please you.			"

												The Banner Saga's unique flavour first caught my attention when it was first hinted over a year ago.  It has a unique art style and the music and mood set a steady tone from the very beginning.  I expected a rich story and interesting characters and, while I wouldn't say that I'm disappointed, it does come off as a wounded product in some regards.Don't get me wrong!  I love the game and the story is deep and dark enough to add gravity to every decision you make.  The creators did an excellent job of giving the player powerful agency in developing their story--a weight and caution in your tactics that I have only seen elsewhere in Fire Emblem games.  The consequences of your actions are severe enough that you will take your time and address every issue with the true consideration of a leader of men and varl.  The pace of the game is also quite nice; I finished my playthrough in about eight hours.  I had expected more, but on the same note, I consider this game to have exceptional replay value.  I see myself completing it in full at least one more time, perhaps even a third.My gripes with the game generally submerged in the latter half.  The story is steady and alluring in the early chapters, but once you reach the halfway point, it begins struggling to play catch-up and develop the world it somewhat neglected while it was busy developing the characters and their conflict.  It's very rushed and, without spoiling anything here, it feels like every major event introduces more questions than it answers.  The end of the game does not feel so much like the end of a game as the end of a single episode.  It is my hope that Banner Saga 2 will come to be and fill in the blanks.  Voice acting would have done wonders to add further depth to this story as well and I hope the creators will keep that aim in mind.All in all, while I may have had somewhat unfair and lofty expectations from a game that brandished such a beautiful first impression, I would say that I remain pleased with the result.  This game is well worth your dollar and I hope that you will play through it more than once to experience the variety in the secrets of paths less travelled.  Cheers!			"

												I played this game about half-way in so far, and I can only recommend it.It has an beautiful artstyle, an interesting story and generaly an incredibly well done atmosphere.Many negative reviews critisize the combat system. However, I do not think the unique combat system of this game is a flaw. It's an authentic design choice, making Banner Saga an interesting alternative to the ""usual"" RBS.Especialy on hard mode it becomes quite challenging, considering you will likely lose units from it, it adds to the strategic choices you have to take outside of the battle. Will you rest some more, to get you heroes back up, allthough you might soon run out of supplies? Or will you march on regardless, hoping that you can avoid fights for now? Or maybe you got some more heroes, which can substitute for the missing ones, while they tend to their wounds.Nope. Can't say I find the combat system ""flawed"" or ""broken"". It's an unique and interesting distinct flavour, working well together with the game as a whole.			"

WHAT IS THE BANNER SAGA?The Banner Saga is an epic role-playing game inspired by Viking legend. She filled with dead gods, apocalyptic events and somber landscapes juxtaposed with beautiful shots of your caravan, all brought to life by breathtaking art and animations.The Banner Saga is set in a Nordic fantasy universe where giants (named varls) live alongside humans. The game alternates between two intertwining stories — one starring human archers Rook and his daughter Alette, and the other following a varl consortium led by Hakon.Over 25 playable characters, 7 different classes, each with unique abilities and upgrade options to fit your play style.Decisions have consequences. Every decision, no matter how small, render an impact on the story.Turn-based strategy. The turn-based tactical combat is reminiscent of classics.Renown is hard to come by — only success in battle will net you enough, and it's the only currency you can use to grab supplies and items. These, in turn, are necessary to keep you in fighting shape. It's a tough but fair system.The Banner Saga wants you to have to fight to stay alive, and I loved it for that. I could not put it down.

												The Banner Saga is not for everyone. I'm not everyone though I love the stories that are portrayed, the atmosphere, the music, the general melancholy vibe that I get from a lot of Nordic materials and other things that specify how Viking culture was in the Germanic age. Now with that being said I usually favor action based games, but this game is not that, and that's not bad. It makes me feel like my decisions matter in this universe that has been crafted in front of me and that's what I love about it. If I mess up then my party tells me and if I bring reknown to the party they exonerate and exalt me. It puts me in a different world where things matter and people depend on me. Great game definitely a buy for the price point. (y)			"

The travelling/story sections of the game truly get you into the game, and the decisions you make within those sections both matter AND feel difficult. Can you afford to welcome more travellers in your band? What if you don't have enough food? What if they turn on your later? You even use the same currency to upgrade your units as you do to buy travelling supplies, so you have to balance unit training and watching your entire caravan starve.Truly amazing.

												Final Fantasy Tatics meets the Oregon Trail. The Gods of this world have died and the world has fallen stagnent as legions of stone Giants called Dredge begin to fill the land. Holy crap this game is a doozy. It's story book Norse ""viking"" astetic is absolutely gorgious from the first to the last minute of the game, and the music always masterfully and amazingly fits the tone of the story. The gameplay itself consists of mainly 3 parts.-Combat-Making difficult choices-Managing your caravan and refugees.Combat is difficult. The AI is smart and spot on so you better bring your A-game. If you've played the likes of Fire Emblem or Final Fantasy Tatics you'll get the basic elements but others might have a bit harder time.Choices are by far the defining part of the 3. You will often make choices that will at first may seem simple or obvious but will have far reaching consiquences. A simple press of a button and 1 or 2 of your parties members will die, no matter how strong they are. This merits making sure you think over each choice. At times, there are choices you must make that simply make your heart pound, your mind race as you think of the consequences.Managing your caravan is simple, but not easily done. Morale and food are what you need to keep your band of weary refugees moving....but this is not a easy task. Not in the slightest. The aforementioned choices may very well make your caravan's abysmal morale into normal or good...while another may drain all of your supplies or end up with members dead.One thing that may catch people off guard is it's length and the lack of manual saving. The lack of manual saving is obviously there to prevent or discrouage save scumming. Whats the purpose of having life and death choices if you just reload after your Varl(friendly horned giants in this world) gets killed. The length it self actually caught me off guard since I felt there are some plot points that the story did not resolve and were very important, but we will see if said points are explained if there is a sequal(which I most certainly hope there is)I didn't really know what I was getting into when I bought this but I'm certainly glad I did. Banner Saga is grueling, hard, and beautiful. When you have moments of peace while playing the game, you find yourself as relaxed and releived as the characters are. I absoultely recomend any fans of tatcial stratagy, epic fantasy tales, or people looking for a different experience to give this game a whirl. ""We may not survive, but will all be remembered!""

												The Banner Saga is sure to entice you to visit its world through its early Disney-like artwork, but it is the game's melancholic universe along with its thoroughly thoughtful twist on tactical turn-based rpgs, accompanied by an outstanding soundtrack from the composer of the PS3 game Journey, that will keep those eyes locked to the screen.Storywise, in short, The Banner Saga's story thrusts you into a norse-inspired world where the gods have died and the sun has stopped high in the sky. This has caused an old rock-like enemy of human and giant, the Dredge, to resurface and begin tearing a bloody swath across the land. Taking on multiple characters, you take to the road to either stop, understand, or escape this catastrophe. The Banner Saga's gameplay is split into two portions: an Oregon Trail style caravan mangement system that puts you squarely in the shoes of quartermaster and a turn-based tactical RPG.The former portion of the game may occasionaly have you gritting your teeth. The Banner Saga is a game that is committed to its themes of kinship, journey, and perseverance both through its story and gameplay. As such, you will not only be required to make diffcult choices through the story, but also on rationing a relatively limited single currency system that is used for purchasing items, upgrading characters, AND buying supplies for your caravan (without these, they will die of hunger). It is the managing of all these things, along with endeavoring to keep your caravan's moral high, that some may find unfair. I, on the other hand, find it exhilarating and refreshing that Stoic has enough faith in the player to acctually put them through the very challenges that characters suffers through. It will give you a sense of accomplishment for each passing day late in the game. If this kind of challenge is your thing, this game will be an excellent match for you.If you're a fan of the combat in Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem (to a lesser degree of similarity) this will keep you excited to engage in every battle. The variation on characters losing health and armor directly tying into their strength in battle will provide you an interesting challenge. Also, there are plenty of characters and classes that bring their own unique stats and special abilities to the field that are sure to keep you devising new strategies with each new, powerful recruit. That is, if your choices do not get them killed!Speaking of choice, certain events do feel scripted, or dare I say ""linear"". They are, however, judiciously mixed with tragedies that are completely avoideable. For this reason, Stoic has struck a balance between pushing forward a narrative that has an end and allowing the consquence of your choices to play out. The game will ocassionally make you feel disheartened and it may even make you fruastrated over the difficulty of managing the caravan and party if that is not your thing, but it will challenge your sense of saftey in choice, tell you a bleak and whimsical epic, and provide you a incredibly fun tactical rpg.

												I'm loving it...and you will, too.The history and the art blends perfectly, with a really good script, full of decisions for you to make.This kind of game (TRPG) tend to make the same mistake: Put too much weight on the fight side, but little on the rest.Here is the other way around: All you do is for the sake of the history line. Because you want it to unveil. And in the process you get atached to the characters.- Extremely Beautiful Art- Great Script and Characters- Enough complex battle systemIf you like TRPGs, this is your game ;)			"

												I have to say, this game is an absolute success, probably my favorite genre of game (Fire Emblem-esque strategy rpg), and has a deep backstory and setting as well. That alone would make it 8/10 minimum, but I think the deciding factor for me was the type of situations they threw at you as far as being the leader of a caravan in a nigh-apocolyptic situation. It's bleak to say the least.The world seems to come apart at the seams at a wildly quick pace, it's an absolute nightmare to manage and navigate. I was robbed, beaten, betrayed, almost murdered, and lost a fifth of my caravan to attrition during a bad stretch of road that would have been survivable, if not for the previously mentioned murderous thieves. I lost at least two characters to unforeseen (not plot related) events, and I loved every second of it.It's a leadership simulation at it's finest, that does not coddle you at all. This game really drives the point that being a leader is not being a cheerleader and making speeches every ten seconds, or planning your every move like you're playing chess, it's making hard decisions. Making decisions that could as easily lose you half your supplies or kill your most valuable fighter, as gaining fighters that are direly needed, or creating a distraction so that your caravan may pass to the next town.It's incredibly shocking to lose in-game characters to out-of-combat events, but it really helped suck me into the game. I was completely immersed with the dire need to see that caravan through everything, and seeing that my decisions were being affected by conditions completely outside of my control could not have been more depressing. It was the kind of depression that comes with leadership, watching men die because you had chosen incorrectly, and having to pick yourself up and keep moving, because that's what the caravan needs. This is the kind of game that cements video games as a legitimate form of expression instead of childish escapism, and it does it tastefully without any pretentious subtext, very impressive for a kickstarter.

												The Banner Saga is a beautiful strategy game that has a beautiful artistic presentation. The story has depth, and the characters are well made.The game is a mix of strategy chess like style and traditional board game. The progress of the story is through a journey where the player can have a limited control in where it goes through choices. This will give re-playability value to see the different outcome. The strength of the game in my experience is through the art and the game play. The game play is highly addictive.A side from strategy, it has a good upgrade/power up system.The menus screens are really well made and another strong aspect of the game.The choices will not add much difference to the story, but it will affect how your journey will be. The voice acting in the beginning was really beautiful, and I wish it had more of it throughout the game rather than reading through many texts. Don’t get me wrong, I love reading from a book/e-book, but videogames is more about visual and audio than reading.All in all, I spend more than 30 hours in the game, and I still can play some more. I would recommend this game for any strategy fan, or anyone who likes art and videogame in general, and I can’t wait for the sequel to come out.  "

												So... it's the first of three PLANNED games. That is to say, it ends mid-story. I mean, there's a relatively major event that occurs, but instead of the story continuing to a point where the overall issues can be remotely resolved, the game ends. So... you're buying a third of a game where the rest may never be made.Otherwise, it's pretty and it plays pretty well. I got about 10 hours out of it, and there might be some replay value in it after a while.			"

												If you played the free multiplayer before, you will know what the main part of the game will be - a lovely drawn yet brutal viking Fire Emblem. However, you will also fight aztec-viking stone golem aswell.If you search for a great turn based strategy game with character development and decision making, here it is. If you seek a nordic-skyrim-experience, here it is. If you seek a gracious artstyle, you probably have already seen it in the screenshots. If you seek a challenging and at times unforgiving difficulty, here you go!Minor complaints go only into the safe system, some choices and the ""war"" system. You have one real safe point that auto-saves after all important events. So if you made a mistake and let a companion die (which can happen every minute as it appears, but the game usually gives subtle hints that your current choice of actions might be stupid), you have to replay the whole chapter, which can take half an hour. When travelling, some choices give you the option to ask some people about their opinion. Too bad they take that as an invitation to ""do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they please"", robbing you of the possibility to make your own choice. Whenever you meet such an situation, copy said mentallity. The ""war"" system on the other hand is rather intransparent and will only determine against how much enemies you will fight and how many of your followers will fall instead. There is sadly no visualisation of said battles, which turns war into some kind of ""random encounter"" with adjustable difficulty.Also spotted one bug where the warden shows the Hunters bow when he attacks to the north. Fix pls, I like the Warden.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed playing Banner Saga. I enjoyed the art work, though at certain times the scenes were a bit long and repetative (such as watching your part slowly move across a backdrop that looks similar or repeated.) The whole Banner Saga universe is quite interesting, though I would have loved to learn more about the Varl.The same is simplistic in some ways, but the story itself is great. The different options you have for decision making, and the result of the decision making, seemed a bit random at times but in a hostile environment like your heroes face in the game, you never know how your story will go.I spent about 6 or 7 hours through my first play through and will likely go back and see whatever endings or outcomes I can get.

												The pros to The banner saga- it has an intense turn based combat system similar to that of XCOM's, with a wide variety of characters to use while in combat, each with their own unique abilities.- the environments are beautiful, and while there are no free roaming elements it still has a tonne of dialogue and in depth story to go through- you can play as multiple characters who all have different perspectives, positions and roles to play in the world- the story is split up into sections, one time you will be travelling with your caravan, the next you will be making life choices, going into combat or continueing the story with lots of dialogueThe cons- if you don't like a story that involves reading with little to no voice acting, this is not for you- if you don't like slow paced strategy combat similar to XCOM, this is not for you- There could be some more customisation options for the characters clothing and weapon designs but it doesn't matter as muchOverall, this is an excellent turn based RPG with an intense combat system, a new indepth story with a lot of meaningful decision making and a lot of lore and dialogue behind it - 10/10			"

												FIRST IMPRESSIONS REVIEW:Best way to describe this game: Oregon Trail meets Baldur's Gate meets X-Com.  With VIKINGS.I've only played a little ways in and I'm very impressed.  The art style of this game is fantastic - the art is a little like a mix of a 'good' version of the rotoscoped animation from Bakshi's Lord of the Rings, plus some of the stylization in 'secret of the kells.'  it feels like playing through a carefully crafted fantasy novel where the creators took it quite serious.  The tactical combat feels pretty satisfying, and the sobering choices that matter not in a 'good versus evil' context, but in a morally gray 'actions have consequences' context where you make your own morality makes this title feel very adult and mature.  On that note, so far I am enjoying playing a wise big-hearted viking giant who helps the weak and makes personal sacrifices while making wise decisions about protecting his warband.			"

The Banner Saga is a hand crafted masterpiece with hands down the best artwork I have seen in a game to date.The Banner Saga is the first in a trilogy of games where you play a hero given the responsiblity of leading a ragged caravan of fighters, faimilys and Varl (Giant horned Viking like charters often depicted in game art.) under your Banner - and tword saftey in a breaking world, where all races are forced into a struggle for resources and survival.Excellent writing leads to a well crafted feeling of the desperation of your situation and the story quickly draws you in. The choices are hard and often involve sacrifice making your decision really seem to matter.(I advise you skip all the online guides & tutorials for this game and just play by your wit.)Mixed in with the RPG format is a a unique turn based combat system you can really dig your teeth into, refreshing and challenging, a real tacticions treat.I can't recomend The Banner Saga enough, while it does have several shortcomings to do with choice and consequence they are vastly overshadowed by the great character of the game.Grab some coffee and buckle up your in for a real treat 9/10			"

												I really loved this. It had me the whole way, its the type of game you can get sucked into and play for hours.Its a story about an apocalypic event in a fantasy world where Varl and Humans live and their journey and fight for survival. It has turn based combat and its totally gripping some of the battles especially in my first run through were nail biting, real fights to the death. Great fun! Your choices do have an affect but not too much on the story. I have played it twice and although the story does take you pretty much on the same path, your choices do effect the characters and who will end up with you or not or dead. Theres some Rpg elements in building characters and buying or finding equipment also. It looks great as well, it is very stylized and looks awesome.Great little game!!			"

												I'm not sure I've ever felt as vulnerable in a video game as in The Banner Saga. In most tactical RPGs, the barrier to difficulty can simply be hurdled by a spot of grinding. Here, there's no such opportunity. At every stage of the game you are hounded, chased from one location to another, the weight of the enemy always at your back, with hard decisions (which often only make you weaker) stacking up as you move along. There's no chance to pause and grind the game's singular currency - renown - which leaves it always scarce in quantity. This forces you to choose between purchasing supplies for your caravan, strengthening your warriors, or purchasing a shiny item to give you a small power boost, and it never feels like enough. At no point in my playthrough did I feel overpowered. Even my strongest warriors could be felled in one blow if I made a bad tactical decision. At the start of each encounter, there was always the sense of, ""I don't know how I'll make it through this one,"" and following each battle, ""I can't believe I made it out of there alive."" And that's only the combat. The game also constantly forces you to make difficult decisions throughout, which frequently lead to the death of your party members. It's not always obvious, either, and since the game has no manual saves - only a handful of sporadic auto-saves - you can only change your mind so often. Sometimes, a decision you made hours ago will come back to haunt you much later, wreaking havoc on your party. So yes - in this game, there isn't just the illusion that your choices matter - they do, and you're bound to make some bad ones along the way. It's a bleak game, and feels like Game of Thrones meets The Walking Dead in terms of tone, and hope (or lack thereof). Luckily, it's also a gorgeous game, with a hand drawn aesthetic that looks quite unlike anything else out there. The combat system is interesting, but not nearly as varied as Japanese TRPGs like FF: Tactics, or the Disgaea series. By the end of the game, the mechanics do feel like a bit of a slog - but then, it suits the game's mood perfectly. To come out as some super charged badass capable of leveling a whole army isn't the point here, and wouldn't suit the story. Here, the core is survival, and the grim likelihood that at any moment, any one of your party might not make it to see the next day.			"

												The BEST turn-based combat in video games.It is not an RPG, it is in fact a series of games of highly original chess with fantasy-like Scandinavia-themed pieces. And this chess is wrapped into a very engaging story where you make decisions which affect what pieces you're going to play the next game with.

												What's here is very engaging, the problem is it's not all here.  Saying ""The Banner Saga is the first part of a planned trilogy"" at the bottom of the expanded ""read more"" section apparently gives the dev team carte blanche to dice up a cohesive story and sell it to you one part at a time.In a trilogy each episode has to stand on its own, have its own arcs and resolutions even if it's part of a greater arc.  The Banner Saga leaves everything up in the air, ending abruptly after terminating a single minor character arc in a moment of cutscene-forced incompetence.  It isn't a natural end to a story, in context it begins way more character development than it concludes and it feels as though the game is just throwing up its hands and saying ""that's about a third of the story, roll credits.""Imagine if Baldur's Gate II ended right after you arrive in the Kuo-Toa city, or if Dragon Age: Origins cut off when the Antivan Crows ambush you, then they asked you to buy the rest of the game a few months down the line.  Cutting this story up the way they have they didn't even try to bring the game to a natural conclusion, they're simply forcing it to be a trilogy.The aesthetics are solid, the combat is serviceable and the caravan mechanics reinforce the tone and setting of the game.  But the bottom line is you're coming to this game for the narrative and your agency within it, that's what you want from a team with this pedigree and that's what it's being sold on.  It's a good story well told, but it stumbles massively on a single bad design choice that thoroughly spoils the experience as a stand-alone game.Other quibbles: lack of cloud and controller support.Assuming the quality of the writing remains consistent buy it when you can pick up all 3 in a bundle.  As it is now, I cannot recommend it.			"

												The Banner Saga is a Strategy RPG that excels in presentation and storytelling, but falls a tiny bit flat in combat.The game is based heavily on Norse mythology, in a world where longships and horsetravel is gone, and the primary mode of transporation is ox pulled carts and long, long caravans on foots. The gods are dead and gone, and men and Varl (giants)  seek to eke out an existence among the frozen north in the wake of wars against the Dredge, massive stone-golem-like creatures. You play as several of the caravans, trekking across the world as the Dredge begin to return.The game primarily plays out betwene two phases: Overworld and combat. The worldworld phase is your caravan travelling across the world, conusming supplies, and interacting with random events that can be good or bad, picking up new members of your caravan, and sometimes party members. You must track your caravan's food supply and their morale, as low supplies causes your caravan to starve, nad low morale decreases your units' Willpower in combat, Renown is the currency for the game, and it's used to level up units, buy supplies, and buy items. The best way to get Renown is to fight. So you'll be doing a lot of fighting.Combat is turn based S-RPG fare. You get many party members, and almost every party member is their own class with their own active ability. Passives tend to be shared among archetypes: Archers, Melee damage dealers, tanky characters, etc. Characters level up as they personally accrue kills, so if you want to level up a character, you need to ensure they ge tthe killing blow. This becomes an issue later as future characters join at levle 1, and can't handle the rigors of combat well enough, often, to be handed kills in combat that comes to the wire at times.In combat, units have Armor, Strength, and Willpower, along with Exertion and Armor Break values. Strength doubles as your damage as well as your HP, so a weakened unit will do only very minor damage. Armor helps mitigate damage, and high armor can even give dodge-deflection chance to attacks. Willpower allows a unit to gain a 1 for 1 advantage on attacks, or moving, giving an etxra edge. Exertion determines how much willpower can be spent on an action, and Armor Break determines how much Armor a character can shatter. As a character attacks, they cna attack Armor or Health. Armor must be broken, otherwise only you rmost powerful character swill barely scratch foes. By breaking amror, you open them up to future, highher damage from all characters, and so you want to have at least a few charatcer swith powerful armor break stats, and then powerful Strength attacks to followup for the kill. Combat turns alternate betwene you and the enemy, regardless of numeric advantage, and so a smaller party will act individually more often than a larger one. Ths leads to a prevailing combat strategy: Break Armor -> Maim units to 1 HP so they can't hurt you and enemies have to ""waste turns"" with weake, useless units -> clean up. This flow meant much of the time, I wasn't using active abilities, sinc ejust smashing their armor and then Strength attacing wa smuch more effective. This, along with only a few enemy variations, meant combat became formulaic after being figured out.The story and music, and artstyle is fantastic, with huge, spanning panoramas as you travel. The presentation is beautiful, and the game ends on a cliffhanger with a sequel not out yet, multiplayer arenas notwithstanding. My only other minor complaint is probably not a real complaint: There are dialog choices with will, very abruptly, end in character deaths. You are not refunded the Renown spent on levelling up the character. Other characters will only join for a very biref time and then depart, taking kills and renown with them. It can be frustrating to have a character all game, and then realize because of one dialog choice made over half the game ago, a character was doomed to death with no chance to save him. You could argue this means all choices have real consequences. I would argue it was more frustrating than pathos creating. If a Renown refund had occured, I wouldn't have minded.Despite that, I would recommend the game, if you're OK with slightly repetitive combat. It's not FULLY replayable in that you'll see ""new content"", but you could make the choices you didn't before. Some of them result in characters leaving, joining, or otherwise interacting in ways they wouldn't have otherwise. It is possible to kill damn near everyone in your caravan by the end of the game. Impressive or depressing: Your call.			"

												I'd say that the metacritic score for TBS is fairly accurate. However, it isn't exactly a true traditional RPG as described. In fact it's a turn-based tactical RPG in the mould of Agarest etc. It is refreshingly original in its setting and themes and the combat is quite interesting. It appears to be a little on the short side and is not without other issues but, nevertheless, remains a very good game all round and there is at least a measure of replayability for those who like to discover alternate ways of completing the game. Its main drawback is that the ""random"" encounters just aren't random enough and trial and error will leave you knowing the best response to most situations. Faults aside, I really enjoyed playing this and its price presents good value for what you get. 80%			"

												The first and most important aspect of the Banner Saga are the gorgeous classical visuals.  It really looks amazing.  In addition it mixes in an interesting mythos which really adds to the solid enjoyable turn based strategy.  It really is a game about choice and you choices directly influence the difficulties of the battles you face.  Oh and it can be brutal.  You will lose party members through events so prepare yourself.  The end of the world ain't for the light of heart.There are some issues such as rather quick switches between the two groups of characters you control but if you know this going in its a bit easier to handle.

												I've put a couple hours in with TBS now, and I'm pleased. The game is beautiful, feels like playing an adult version of a Disney film, but you can tell that from the screenshots. It has a very interesting combat system, although it may be a bit tough if you aren't familiar with tactical rpg's. It reminds me a bit of Vandal Hearts if anyone remembers that game. The character progression system is also interesting, though it could be a little more explicit on things like what each stat really does. So far the story is compelling, and I do look forward to seeing it through, and possibly playing it multiple times to see what my choices may change. If you were a fan of Final Fantasy Tactics or anything of the like, pick this up, it's a good price and I think you will enjoy it.			"

The Banner Saga is a single-player indie game developed by a small team of three game designers, namely Arnie Jorgensen and John Watson and Alex Thomas, all of whom worked also on Bioware’s Star Wars: The Old Republic. It is the first game in what is said to be a trilogy. The combat system in the game is rather simple but in my opinion hits the right notes. It’s neither too hard nor too easy, and it fits the general mood of the game very well. Voice acting is almost absent in the entirety of the game, which gives it a distinct old-school RPG style (and surely bother some people). The Norse setting and aesthetics are dazzling and work wonderfully without the stereotypical elves-and-dwarves background so commonly associated with Fantasy games (I think it is worth mentioning that Arnie Jorgensen worked for DC Comics as cover artist and penciler). The chilly, stark soundtrack composed by Austin Wintory (famous for the back then PS3-exclusive game Journey), coupled with the visual aspect of the game, creates a perfectly consistent atmosphere of dreadful cold and silence while you roam from town to town in the Nordic landscape. As far as I know, the decisions you make during the game don’t change much of the story itself. They affect your gameplay directly, though, and can alter the overall experience (especially in War! events), so you must think twice before you act upon a request made by a clansman or a caravan you meet on the road. Anyway, I do recommend this game, not just because I enjoyed it specifically, but because I believe Stoic studio has the potential to continue making quality games (be that a sequel or something else entirely). Their first game is enough proof for me.			"

												I just finished the game mostly offline, so don't let my low hour record fool you.The Banner Saga is an imperfect jewel. It's clear that what it contains is beautiful, but there are a few problems. I won't go into it at length - the bottom line is that it's a great game and worth playing. One playthough will last you about 10-12 hours on Normal, well worth the cost of entry.To be brief: The game is beautiful, from stem to stern. Its visuals are like a hyper-realistic fever dream of Saturday morning cartoons drenched in the beauty of a thousand years of northern European history and design cues. The music from Austin Wintory (of Journey fame - the game, not the band) consistently floored me. You spend quite a bit of time simply watching your caravan mosey along from crushing disappointment to miserable turn of events to death and misery - and the music is what makes it intense and enjoyable.If I had to describe the gameplay, I would call it Oregon Trail Tactics Emblem. As you move from place to place on your journey, you are presented challenges. The right answer may not always be clear, but you always have to make a choice and reap whatever consequences or rewards that come. This makes every decision intense, as you weigh between three or four different possibilities, any one of which could lead you to starvation, death, or an unexpected moment of kindness. The battles are where the Tactics part comes into play. If you like Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, or XCOM, you're pretty familiar with how this works. There is a lot of room for strategy, employing big hulking Varl or your shield bearers to both block movement and set up counterattacks, while having your archers strategically placed to persecute weakened enemies.All of that sounds positive, and it is. However, here's the imperfect part: The story, while in my opinion quite good and entertaining, feels like the first few chapters of a book. Or like a story that ends at the beginning of the first part of what should be a trilogy - like Lord of the Rings just suddenly stopping at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring. It is a tremendous climax, coming at the end of a very difficult trial, with absolutely no resolution after the fact. I had bought up a huge amount of supplies expecting an epic journey afterward, and right after the following battle I was treated to a (very moving) cinematic and the credits.The reason I am annoyed by this is because I desperately wanted more. I was misty-eyed by the end, but ready to forge onward. It was, to say the least, disappointing. However, all I can do is hold out hope that Stoic produces a sequel worthy of picking up the banner and carrying onward.			"

												The Banner Saga is a game with an original concept that I would describe as a union between consequence heavy strategy games like Final Fantasy Tactics and a pioneering simulator like Oregon Trail where you have to manage resources and make hard decisions that effect your journey in unexpected ways.On paper, this sounds amazing, especially when you start to be engrossed by the powerful artwork and storytelling of the designers.Unfortunately, I've reached a kind of personal impasse with The Banner Saga, which ironically is due at least in part to the orginal intent of the designers.  The journey these characters are taking is meant to be bleak and arduous, and playing the game feels like an extention of this as the days slog on: you have been starving for weeks, the characters you've invested the most resources in have died inexplicably, and on top of it all, you face the endless hordes of monotonous battle vs the same enemies over and over and over again.So for now, for my own sanity, despite my admiration of the creators intent and craft, I can't go on.  I can't help wondering if this is a personal flaw and not one of the games design.(note:  the designers have a patch planned which will lower the difficulty of the notoriously difficult last battle)			"

												This is not a fun game, this is an experience. The choices you make will be hard, and there's almost never a right one. Thinking about the choices in a video game sense won't help you either. oh you bought all the supplies from a store so you know you'll have food? thieves stole it. The combat is spot on, in some of the best strategy combat I've ever played. It's hard, tight and engaging, almost never will you get through a battle without someone falling. The story is interesting, and you'll find yourself caring for the characters in your party or hating them, especially when they make decisions for you, sometimes even against you. It adds to their personality and makes them feel more like people. This game has an incredibly strong sense of narrative, lose a battle, you'd expect it to just ask ""try again?"" like most games would, but it doesn't, losing a battle is like making a choice, it will affect what happens to your party, how people treat you, and what decisions you are limited to. This is not a game for the faint of heart, no because it's scary, or intense but because of it's ability to make you stare at the screen and think ""well, what the hell am I supposed to do now?"". The game makes you care about this group of people that you control and must lead to survive, going to the ends of the world, or to death.			"

												I would highly recommend this game for anyone who is a big fan of Viking lore and RPG team building. The battle system is good on all accounts but nothing fancy here and there though - items being limited and all. But the good experience I had from this game was from it's story. While choice-wise, decision making in the game can feel arbitrary, I get that the developer guys wanna bring out a bleak setting for the protagonists. There is no best ""happy"" ending in this fairy tale, and people do die even the good ones. Enemies can be trusted allies and good friends can back stab you at any moment's notice. This is the reality the characters in the game must face when food became scarce, a horde of murderous army is upon them - while doomsday is emminent.Get this game - probably not for the gameplay - but definitely for its storyline, artwork, soundtrack and your casual leisure.

												The Banner Saga Reviewby DaniAngione----------------------------Art - 9 / 10Sound - 9 / 10Gameplay - 8 / 10Emotional - 10 / 10Community - 9 / 10----------------------------Overall - 9----------------------------The Banner Saga; I've never heard of this game until the multiplayer spin-off, Factions, came to Steam. Only after that I've googled it and realized that Stoic's kickstarter campaign passed under my radar. And that was most unfortunate for me, because we're talking about a game that breathes norse mythology, is beautifully crafted with hand-drawn artwork inspired by '1950-60s Disney genious' Eyvind Earle and has an amazing soundtrack by Austin Wintory, the guy behind the musical score from Playstation's big indie hit 'Journey': the only game that makes me cry like a baby after EVERY god damn playthrough.So, yeah. How did I miss that Kickstarter? I don't know. What I know is that since discovering about Banner Saga I've hyped it so much inside my head that I dare say that, in a way, it was a little disappointing. But not in a way that compromises the game - just in a way that doesn't satisfy the 'almost-fetichist' personal desire I built up for this.You start playing as Ubin, a varl (horned giants) that leads a tax caravan through the frontier cities between the varl lands and the human cities. After some time, however, you get to meet and play as Rook, a small village huntsman, and Alette - his daughter. They're being chased by Dredge, these humanoid stone creatures that seem to be quite strong and suddenly start pouring from everywhere. From there on the game is a long and arduous road for survival - as simple as that.Putting it that way, however, doesn't make justice for the beautiful landscapes, the amazing characters and the incredible tale you'll weave along the way. And more importantly: death is around every corner. Choices are tough, choices are insecure and you'll find yourself questioning your own morals for the sake of the people that follows you. Sometimes you'll have to be harsh, sometimes you'll be kind... And might even regret it later. Or be rewarded, even. There's nothing sure in The Banner Saga. Nothing is guaranteed, so it's advised to be careful about who you're going to care about.I'd certainly give Art and sound a 10 - I'm giving a 9 for two reasons: for art, I must admit that the initial cutscene is so beautiful that the game left me wanting more. There is, however, no more fully animated cutscenes. Not even the ending. So I was a little disappointed there. And for 'sound', the reason is very similar: sometimes I miss some voices or a better use of 'human sounds'. For a game that clutches you so deeply on emotions and attachment, it feels a little out of place that all dialogue is only written.Gameplay works well. It's not great but it's enjoyable. The fighting mechanics are good and I really liked the balancing and tactics around armor and strength. I wish there was a little more variety, but that's not a big deal.Emotionally... Well, just play it. I recommend you don't, ever, load your game when something bad happens. Seriously. It's a game about a journey - a true viking saga - and about the pain and the loss and the sadness in said journeys. It's a game about decisions, a game about caring for those you love and losing them because YOU thought that this was the best thing to do... And it wasn't. This is very, very functional as a player-driven narrative. And if you take the plunge into the fantastic and beautiful world of The Banner Saga, it will reward you intensively. I assure you.Community, well... I didn't play the multiplayer part much, but a few rounds have shown me that people are nice and fun, so I suppose it's ok.Overall, The Banner Saga is a beautiful yet silent game. And by silent I mean that it has a lot to offer but you have to go there, you have to take it's hand and walk into the forest. If you do - you'll be so immersed that when you're done you'll realize that we are just guests upon the land...PS.: Just a warning - this game is the first part of a TRILOGY. Don't expect much closure, all will be explained in time...			"

If you're a fan of North-European Mythology (from which the game draws inspiration), Strategy RPG's (think: Shining Force) and an epic storyline, then look no further. The world is ending, a horde of iron giants is invading and you can feel the desperation growing as the game progresses, and you lead an ever growing (or shrinking, depending on how things go) caravan of clansmen across the known world.The main currency is Reknown, which is used to buy food and items, but also to upgrade your units, leading to difficult decisions: will you invest in more food to keep casualties minimized? Or will you level up your units for the battles ahead?			"

												8/10 Beautifully tragic taleI finished this game and now I have a sad.While I recommend this game, I know it's not for everybody. The turn based combat system at its heart draws a lot of fire, but a lot more praise. This can be tried beforehand, I suggest you take a look by playing the free ""Factions"" game. If the fighting, and the artstyle appeal to you, then by the love of the dead gods get the full game and then make hard choices about your caravan. The caravan part is superficially like Oregon Trail with a twist. The RPG parts with developing a team of heroes fit for a saga takes a lot of thought. keeping your playable heroes alive and content to the final showdown is a lot harder than it sounds, and you can't just throw around the loots and promotions. Watching somebody run charging into a horde of enemies withh your best rare magic item and half your caravan's XP is a real tragedy, especially with the permadeath...			"

												The Banner Saga is one of the best games of 2014. It it's a turn based game with beautiful art style and music that fits perfectly on a Nordic mythology themed game.The story is progressed by choices you make which there are plenty and there are hard ones to make which was a great experience. I thing I didn't like was that the game has no voice acting which broke the flow of the game. They could have hired some great voice actors and added an options to turn them off or on if you prefered. The story is great  and there's parts of the game when your not playing you will watch your caravan in the distance moving from place to place and for some people it might be boring but it's great immersion to see their journey from the distance while snow falls while there's a mountain in the background.Some players say the last boss is hard and there's a difficulty spike but while I died about 5 times I only had 2 at max level (5), few level 4 and 3 and poor items. You have to ration the supplies or your people will leave you and you need to rest in order to gain moral. The trick part is you either buy supplies or you pay for items or you use the renown points to level up a character so you must choose wisely!Score: 8/10			"

												I've owned this game for over 2 years and I am kind of glad I did, since Banner Saga 2 is out now.Banner Saga is a well-written, tactical turn-based RPG. You become attached to the characters who have their own personalities and depth. The other part of the game is managing your rations, because the whole game you are pretty much travelling to save the lives of others and yourself. If you get into it, you can feel the hopelessness of everyone. Mainly because there is no hope. There is no happy ending, and I think that's what makes the game so appealing. It's like ""The Empire Strikes Back"", or if the White Walkers from Game of Thrones busted loose from the wall and there was no Dany, Jon Snow or Tyrion to make things right again.I highly recommend this game if you love RPGs. It really does have a great storyline that sticks with you. I can't wait to play the second game now. Thank you, Stoic, for making a game that people will remember, much like Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment.			"

												The Banner Saga is one of the most uniquely exectuted games out there. The art is extremely pretty. The sountrack sorrowful but strong. The story tragic and captivating. However, the gameplay is arbitrary and monotomous. Banner Saga is a weird combination between a visual novel, Oregon Trail, and Turn based tactics. You play as a number of different factions. The events of the game play out on a mostly random scale. The general motivation is that your home is assaulted by monsters from the north and you need to up and leave and lead a caravan of refugees and soldiers to safety, testing your leadership abilities along the way. Combat takes a bit of a backseat in this game and leaves you to manage a convoy as you trek from one end of the map to safety. The gameplay is in the balance between managing the supplies of your convoy and the risks you take on the road. Will you take the short and dangerous road? Or rather take the longer, but safer route? Spend a day camping near an anchient stone temple for good luck? Or rather power on and not wast time. Each choice will either bring or take resources, such as morale, food or warriors. Your goal is to get as many people home as possible.Annoyingly, the game likes to arbitarily kill of your guys when you're just going about your business. Falling in battle is passable, but at any time during your trek, you might be prompted to help some merchants on the side of the road, only to find that they were brigands and they shanked your daughter on the spot. Can you stop it? No. Can you predict it? Maybe. It's all a bit forced and unmotivated at times, and the pacing sometimes slows to a crawl. However, when you're just clicking away for two hours straight, hoping to find that next buried treasure, you're able for forget about these qualms.			"

												Viking themed strategy RPG. Basically its about the world is going under, much like Ragnarök foretold and the giant serpent, much like Midgårdsormen, is destroying the world.  the story is told through two diffrent parties, that later join up with each other, basically one is from the perspective of a hunter and his daughter who later lead a tribe and the other is through a bunch of Varls, giant with horns, who acts and behaves like Dwarfs. Both sides fight and flee the Dredges,  who are basically like orcs in armor that is killing everyone and destroying anything. It plays just like an ordinare SRPG with leveling, equipments,turnbased combat on grids etc but has an unique spin on breaking down armor before doing damage on enemies. This means you have to think carefully if your gonna break down someones armor fast for a fast kill, or breaking down their strenght to make sure the same enemy cant dish out a lot of damage fast. And makes you build up parties in which you make walking tanks with a lot of armor, and other weak, but hard hitting fighters. The graphic and soundtrack is amazing - def 9/10. Great viking music with insanely beautiful backrounds as you travel around in the world.Also, the caravn part where you have to handle supplies and make sure you have enough supplies for your trops is pretty fun but ... whatever choice you pick - your caravan will be ""beeep"" beep"" beep"" which fits into this ragnarök theme and the world is going under I guess...Anyway I give this game 8.5/10, it ends just when things is getting intresting :O Also, this game reminds me nothing of Sword Art Online, but It should. I love cookies, do you love me? Ps! i'm not fat irl, so calm down.			"

It has one of the best tactical battles systems I have played, and I have played almost all tactical turn based games since 2000. Its also an work of art. The game is worth recommending simply as a visual experience.My suggestions for the next installment - allow open ended explorations, stuff like raids etc. Some sort of sandbox mode.

												I really really wanted to like this game. The developers have put forth a laudable effort in the aesthetic arena, and the game mechanics are surprisingly tolerable for an unadulterated turn-based scheme. While this offering is apparently only the first of a forthcoming trilogy, there is simply no exuse to end the game so abruptly. As someone who enjoys games primarily for the story, such an unsatisfying denouement taints the whole experience. The rest of the package is developed to a point that is more than satisfactory, but when a game is centred around the plot it seems rather silly to leave in such precarious shape. I won't delve into details, but a significant proportion of the interesting strands of the plot remain unresolved (or worse, unexplained to begin with) and the tale's rather clichéd conclusion fails to have any emotional impact due to the lack of character development over such a short timeline. Unfortunately for me, The Banner Saga (at this point) remains a cautionary tale of how not to deliver on a very promising premise. Again, I really wanted to like the game... but I didn't.			"

												Played this game for the first few minutes, and you quickly get immersed. The music and beautiful scenery complement each other, setting the mood for this breathtaking epic. As you go along through the story, you meet new groups that travel the land and see the different areas of this vast world of Banner saga. Your groups run into interactive scenarios that change your storyline so there is a few careful choices you have to make. This game has a decent tutorial mode as you start, teaching you the units of the game, as well as placement ranges for your attacks, plus learning the perks in battle. Overall, this game has very little flaws and the story is engaging that spans for quite some hours. Definitely worth the 20$ that I have spent.Overall grade: 9.5 / 10Pros:- Breathtaking storyline- Stunning Visuals- Engaging Score, sets the mood nicely- Battles are well done, can set difficulty if it gets too hardCons:- Save states are always automatic, can't manually save and go back			"

												The Banner Saga is a convoy management game with turn-based strategy fights that augment your heroes and convoy, and ultimately affects the future of your game.In terms of art direction and theme, they strike such a dischordant tone, it might actually hurt your head. Not that either the art or theme are bad. The art is good and the story seems solidly written. Except they're totally opposite. The art is colourful, vibrant and almost child-like in its presentation. The story is about death, hard decisions, starvation and single parent trying to raise a young girl in an uncontrollable apocalypse.Like a WWII history documentary as illustrated by My Little Pony.The game itself has strong central mechanics, and the turn based combat is good. The heroes level up with kills in an RPG style. The elements are solid, and if the final battle wasn't an exercise in throwing everything the game had taught you out the window, it might have recieved a thumbs up from me.It's supposed to be the start of a three part series, but they've made the mistake of not creating the first of the trilogy as a self contained story. It feels like a beginning, like you've wasted time on getting nowhere, and though it purports to be a story driven by your choices, it isn't, your decisions affect nothing but your hero roster.			"

												This game is fantastic.  War is coming, the world is ending.  Blast the viking music as you strike down your foes.  Decide what to do on the road.  Do you take time to raid that village for supplies when the enemy is hot on your heels, do you lead the charge in battle.  Do you set a raging inferno for your enemies?  Your choices have weight, the combat is meaty, and in this game, unlike many, your decisions matter, mechanically, emotionally, it's got it all.  It is only through glory that one may enter valhalla!			"

												This game is not a sandbox storytelling game like King of Dragon Pass or Crusader Kings II. It's far too linear for that, even though you can somewhat influence where the story branches at certain points. Don't expect too much control over things.This game isn't that much of a turn-based tactics battler. Sure, the combat is okayish and gives you something to do in addition to clicking through dialogue, but I never found the fights that engaging and at times it was dull and repetitive. There are way more interesting turn-based combat games out there, don't grab this if that's what you're looking for.However, this game is a pretty good visual novel! The story and characters were interesting, the world is mysterious and the art and music side is well done. If you want to experience a pretty gripping viking fantasy survival story, this game works. Well, at least until the end, when there's not enough closure and it becomes pretty obvious that this is actually The Banner Saga: Episode 1 and it's definitely building up to a sequel. At least the game doesn't over-explain things so the sense of mystery remains.Still, if you enjoy nice hand-painted visuals and very light RPG story elements and just want to be told a neat story, this is a decent experience for that. Just don't expect any sprawling larger-than-life epic, this is quite quickly over even though the world and lore probably could support a larger game in the same setting.			"

												The Banner Saga has stunning landscape art, a great soundtrack, a compelling story and indeed would make a fine visual novel (provided you don't mind 80's cartoon style character art). Actually, if it were several dollars less (or on sale) it would be worth recommending on that merit. Unfortunately, they have made the mistake of attempting to pack a game in with this work of art and underlying game is really bad. Barring some scant and predictable events, you have no control and no agency in the traveling portion of the game. Strategy essentially amounts to buying enough food at each stop to last out a journey of predictable length. The game even makes a lame attempt to reference Oregon Trail at one point but you can't alter your pace, hunt for food or any of that. All you can do is watch the caravan move and occasionally click a pop-up. While the timing of the events can be random, the results of the choices are predictable and usually so inconsequential overall they are essentiall cosmetic.Much of the criticsm of the battle system revolves around the choices made for its turn-based system. While the system is valid, no effort has been made for the AI to take advantage of it. The opposing force scripting is simplistic in fact, that it is outright self-destructive with some units because simple checks were not put in place for splash damage abilities. The battles take place at scripted intervals with scripted rosters and all but one of the battle maps are simple rectangular grids.Conclusion: Wait for a sale, turn the difficulty to Easy. Bear with the game and enjoy the art and story. "

												Its rare when a computer game is able to convey the feelings and connection to a story that normally only a book can. Banner Saga is much a case. The game is predominantly its story and its unfolding through your own actions.I wont go into the details of the story, because it would be a shame to spoil any of it. Suffice to say that it is heavily influenced by Northern European Mythology and that it takes place in a similarly cold and ""bleak"" setting.The game inter-mixes tactical strategy with graphic adventure elements very well, even if the combat and character traits are somewhat simplistic. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter cause once again its all about the story. A story that is most of all, well told.It is this point that makes the game great, as the developers have managed to convey the story and a multitude of emotions that manage (in a very short time span) to tie you (emotionally) to many of the characters and their situations.Don't expect action sequences or cinematic or anything of the sort, the graphics are reminiscent of hand drawn Disney classics and the accompanying music is superb.While there are alternative paths to the end (and different endings apparently), I believe that the average person will not bother to go through a second play-through, if nothing else mostly because they will be satisfied with it enough to not want to spoil it.So at the end of the day if you like story driven games (and can enjoy a fantasy setting), don't miss this game, it is quite the experience.

												I do not recommend and am disappointed of the game because:- the core element, the fights, are very repetetive and do not offer a great variety of strategic possibilites. Also, you might have a choice not to fight, but wont be able to upgrade your characters or earn any reknown otherwise. (Yes, you can get little reknown for other good choices, but far from enough) This renders the fight necessary but boring.- the story only scratches the surface of what would have been possible. The game stops with the first real boss and shortly after all the main characters are introduced. It also leaves a big story gap in between the two main ""armies"".- the ""choices"" you can make will all end in the same story progress and actually all your choices will make everything worse, like being kind to people will almost always end in you being screwed over by these people, and you wont get any reknown. - the ""armies"" lack significance. It doesnt matter how big your army is. At least it didnt matter in my play-throughs. At one point i had only 3 varls in my army and could defeat the enemies army by charging in.- the atmosphere lacks depth. The pictures are beautifully painted and the army wandering the lands look great. But the characters remain static, because their depictions are static and do seldomly show emotions. I couldnt connect to any of them. Also, it seemed to me that any character you like will die anyway, no matter what you do. - the way the story is told is patchy at best. Important or emotional scences are just told as text without any visual or audial aid. Ok, videos are expensive to make, but a picture or speech would have been possible. Like the scene where you can decide weather to take the enemies child with you or not. This scene remains hollow and undetached.+The story, the music, the artwork is great, but its just not a whole game.PS: I backed this game from the beginning. Not unlike Broken Age, it feels very short and shallow.			"

												As a person who likes turn based strats HoMM, Disciples, KingsBounty I had high hopes for this game. After finishing it for the most part on normal difficulty I want to but I really cant reccomend people buying it. The good : Amazing visuals, animation and sountrack. Thats about it. The bad: it would be easy to say everything else but im going to elaborate.With such an amazing score and visuals the game has virtually no voicework to accompany the dialogues. Which would ok if it werent for hte fact that they are either poorly translated or just badly written. You can skip 90% of the dialogue and still be on the same page if you had been paying attention.The unitally cool and challenging combat quickly becomes boring or unfair depnding in you difficulty level. There arent many different enemies so you end fighting the same 4-5 guys for 9 hours and the strategy never evolves beyond gang up on the weak guy. The special abilities of each hero are very situational and I maybe used 3 abilities regulary. Some mechanics are downright broken. The demand for provisions to supply the caravan is completely optional since there virtually no penatly to loosing clansmen/varl. The renown points (with which the game is very stingy) are better spent on your crew and gear.  Beware some party memebers are prone to sudden death during the random encours on the road. So dont be surpised if a badass warhawk level 5 gets killed by dregeling off screen with little infleunce by the player.Despite the strong visual and audio presentation the story is moot and the characters never evolve beyond thier booring achetypes. The pampered prince, the innocent girl, the reluctant leader etc. Over all I would say stay away from this beatiful siren fo a game no matter how tempting the and song lull you to its purchase "

												I don't know where to start on this so I guess i'll just state my conclusion and work back from there:Should you buy this at the current price 24.99(usd), No. Should you buy it if it's on sale at around 75%? Hell yeah!There are many problems i have with this game but there are also some things that were done right that i found as well. Here's list of things I found and you all can be the judgePro's:Pretty cool story, when all is said and done.The whole leading the caravan part of the game, awesome, felt like i was playing the war scenes from a game of thronesAll the characters had pretty decent stories and personalitiesThe combat was pretty cool once you got the hang of it. Think tactics ogre mixed in with some wierd type of chessArt fit the feel of the game perfectlyCon's:You obviously set yourself up for a sequel. By this i mean, there are good cliff hangers that leave me thinking ""oh, well what are they going to do now?"" and then there's  ones that leave me saying ""What the ♥♥♥♥ you spent all this ♥♥♥♥ing time mentioning these things that your not even going to tell me about? Seriously? Not even a hint?""; the later of which you did, and i'm kinda upset about that.There are bugs still in this I had it crash a couple times on me and the load times for the graphics in the game are pathetic. Borderlands 2 loads quicker than this game does for me. (check out ivrir's story background after that big thing to him happens, btw, it's bugged)Game feels rushed half way through, and heres why i say that:You just randomly stop switching between rook and what's his horned face. Just stop. You could've totally split off with him and gone off on his on journey up to the point that he regroups, but you didn't and i was kinda disappointed.You're ending is abrupt, i wasn't quite sure that i hit the end untill the credits popped up.There are 2 GAPING WIDE plot points that never really come to surface, which is too bad becuase I kind of wanted to see more of it.]The army combat parts are a little lacking. Honestly, I felt like i  could have led a charge the entire time and been better off.I would have like to actually have command of my armies as well instead of just saying how to engage. A perfect example of how i'd've liked this game to play the army scenes would be Suikoden. Do some like that with your army combat.In conclusion(again), Don't buy this game unless its on sale or the cost has gone down to around 10-15$ and you'll be much much happier. Took me about 14 hours to complete and i was a terrible leader who told every one to do what they want, which i'm sure divertered most combat situations, so i could see this game lasting at most 20 hrs on the first play through.

												There are not many games that can boast being remotely as beautiful, challenging, and atmospheric as The Banner Saga.The Banner Saga is, at its core, a turn-based RPG. The turn-based combat is conducted on a ""game board"" with square spaces for your units to occupy. Truthfully, The Banner Saga's combat works well enough, but it's not anything special - there's nothing innovative or exceptional about it. It serves its purpose well enough, is fun, and offers some challenge. What makes The Banner Saga so wonderful is just about everything else about it.It's difficult to summarize all of the aspects The Banner Saga does really well. Right off the bat however, you'll probably notice both the art and audio of the game are fantastic. It's rare to find a game that creates a unique artistic vision and implements it so well, while still managing to include a great, effective soundtrack. It's probably fair to say a lot of games struggle with nailing either one of these, let alone both. But, The Banner Saga creates a beautiful, deeply atmospheric experience with its classically inspired animation visuals and moving soundtrack. Of course, this could be all for nothing if it's being used to prop-up a weak story; fortunately, it isn't.If I'm being honest, I don't think I could name another game that comes close to creating such an oppressive story and atmosphere. The pacing of The Banner Saga is excellent; there's a true feeling of dread and desperation constantly building from chapter to chapter as you try to make (what you think are) the best decisions for your caravan, while fighting through seemingly impossible odds. This is a game full of choices - who to accept into your caravan, who to help, when and where to camp, who to take with you into battle - there are many, often tough, decisions that you'll have to make. All of these decisions are presented well, and all of them have consequences, some dire. This makes each playthrough potentially unique.In The Banner Saga, the world is crashing down around you, and you're left facing insurmountable odds. It will be up to you to lead men, women, and varl. You'll make many decisions, some of which you may come to regret. The world of The Banner Saga is bleak and grim. It's hard not to look at this game with a sense of both wonder and despair, and for that it's impossible for me not to recommend it.			"

												The Banner Saga is a fantastic game. Telling a story in a bleak and beautiful world, the game developers have crafted an excellent experience. Based upon Norse and Icelandic lore, the Banner Saga makes you empathize and feel for the characters as they traverse the bleak hills and snowy woods of their world. In addition to possessing an amazing art style which hearkens back to 1960's Disney animation, the game's combat is both tactical and enjoyable. If you are a fan of the Fire Emblem and Oregon Trail games, then you will most certainly fall in love with this fantastic game.			"

												God we need more games like this one! The Banner Saga is the first part of an ambitions adventure game created by indie developers. The gameplay is quite simple but entertaining and enhanced with 3 levels of difficulty. The level design is gorgeous, it's deeply inspired by the art of Eyvind Earle but it still has it's own identity. Anyway it's the story that makes this game different from other RPG/Adventure games.First, the world is a perfect mixture between nordic mythology, fantasy and apocalyptic fiction. The story is about survival and beliefs, in this chaotic snowy and cold landscape three races try to escape the forthcoming shadows. This first part is centered on the story of Rook, a hunter, who try desperately to save his kin and his traveling companions from starvation, killing each other and from the dredge's return. The story really evolves depending of your choices, you can build strong relations with some characters and at the same time don't even meet the other ones. You can easily loose your best mates after making a mistake that seemed to be the good thing to do at the time. It makes the story really moving, mature and immersive. And personally that's why I play video games, not to kill dozens of monsters but to feel something. I'm waiting for the second part with great excitement and you should do the same !			"

It does really well at building connection with the characters, then forces you to make decisions that can have gut-wrenching consequences. The plot twists are frequent, unpredictable and unforgiving.I'd heard mixed reviews, so didn't try it out until a sale. There's some valid points made against it, but overall its a well polished game especially for the price. It's worthwhile just as a really beautifully told story, but the turn based combat is fun and challening too. I hope they add DLC or a whole new chapter.			"

It does a great job of clearly putting a choice in front of you, without tying you down with a morality guage (light/dark side, paragon/renegade). The combat is fun and engaging, although I found myself always wishing it was over so I could further the story. Solid RPG elements, great Oregon Trail management, but last but not least gripping characters and plot. This is the old BioWare we all miss.

												This game is essentially The Oregon Trail, but with a Nordic fantasy theme and a rudimentary turn-based combat system akin to Final Fantasy Tactics or X-Com (but with substantially less depth). The art style is refreshing, and the lovingly crafted world is enjoyable to immerse in for a while. Unfortunately, it is a very short while; most players will find themselves wanting more content after the final battle. Buy the game if it is on sale for less than $20 and I suspect you will feel rewarded by the purchase. In my opinion, the $25 price point is just a bit too high for the amount of gameplay you get.I sincerely hope that a sequel is in the works; one with a hundred hours of gameplay and a more robust combat system.

Its pretty hardcore in that you can't do manual saves (just auto-saves) and thus forces you to live with the decisions you've made. If you want to undo a decision you made, you have to go back to the last auto-save which sometimes might involve fighting certain battles again to rereach the point when the decision was made.I feel that this gives the gameplay more dept though can lead to some frustrations especially once you made a command that leads to the death of some characters.All in all, I really enjoy playing this game. If you're a fan of turn-based startegy games like FF Tactics with added decision making, this game is highly recommended. "

												What an amazing game. I bought it during the Steam sale, but I now would recommend it at full price.It's a mix of The Walking Dead, X-Com, and Viking mythology. The great story-telling of The Walking Dead, the strategy of X-Com, and a world akin to the Norse.Get this game. Play it. Play it again.			"

												The Banner Saga is an excellent turn-based RPG, where decisions you make affect the outcome of the story and changes the lives of the games characters.  The story is engrossing and revolves around a march to save your kinsmen from danger.  You lean to care about the people in your caravan, which make some of the decisions you have to make very difficult.  Although, this also gives the game a lot of replay value, as you strive to make better decisions, and protect more people in your caravan.  Decisions are more than just choosing when to fight, or dialogue choices; when it comes down to it the entire game is a decision of how best to spend your resources.  Do you buy supplies for your caravan to help you get to the next area? OR upgrade your combat team? Or buy items to have your combat team? They each use the same resource, so you have to decide where to put your limited resource.  Even choosing how often and when to rest effects gameplay.The combat is isometric turn-based, and involves a lot of strategy, and can at times, be surprisingly challenging.  There are three game modes, to provide more or less challenge to the player.  Hard mode being very challenging indeed.Overall an enjoyable experience that will leave you wanting more.  As soon as I finished the game, I began researching if there was to be a sequel, and I was pleased to hear the play is for this game to be part of a trilogy.Definitely worth playing, and highly recommended.

												A true testament to the idea that games don't have to have amazing 3d graphics to be captivating visually. The Banner Saga has some of the most beautiful art I have ever seen in a video game, and with a fantastic soundtrack (which I can't get enough of), it's a great accomplishment. But that's not all at what this game excels, because it's RPG/tactic combat and difficult choices to make, are also something I strongly praise. However, even with such a great formula, I can't overlook the fact, that it feels rushed and incomplete. There are some rare moments of voice acted animated scenes, but only in the beginning, and are nowhere to be found even near the end of the game. Also in some parts of the game you just know that things were suppose to be much bigger, but due to some kind of constrains, they ended up as they are. Nonetheless, I enjoyed myself for the (too) short time I played The Banner Saga. I just hope the next installments are more complete products.			"

												Firstly, this game is incomplete in terms of story. The developers have tried to make The Banner Saga complete on it's own as best as possible, but depending on the success (which has been good so far 25/01/2014), they will make Banner Saga 2 and hopefully 3 and or more.The game has beautiful art, although it is repeated throughout the game, it's still amazing to see the line work, balance of colours and Disney quality environments. The music is simply exquisite.There is a moderate learning curve involved as the tutorial is weak & combat mechanics may take a while to get used to. You can test out combat mechanics/strategies in training camp during your travels whenever you camp to rest. Throughout the game you will come across situations where you will have to make choices that can affect your party & caravan. If you're unsure, try out the free multiplayer version ""Banner Saga : Factions"" to see if this is the sort of game that appeals to you & if you like it, don't hesistate to get this beautiful game.The soundtrack on Steam store page only has three tracks, so if you're interested in the complete soundtrack, go to http://austinwintory.bandcamp.com/album/the-banner-saga "

												God we need more games like this one! The Banner Saga is the first part of an ambitions adventure game created by indie developers. The gameplay is quite simple but entertaining and enhanced with 3 levels of difficulty. The level design is gorgeous, it's deeply inspired by the art of Eyvind Earle but it still has it's own identity. Anyway it's the story that makes this game different from other RPG/Adventure games.First, the world is a perfect mixture between nordic mythology, fantasy and apocalyptic fiction. The story is about survival and beliefs, in this chaotic snowy and cold landscape three races try to escape the forthcoming shadows. This first part is centered on the story of Rook, a hunter, who try desperately to save his kin and his traveling companions from starvation, killing each other and from the dredge's return. The story really evolves depending of your choices, you can build strong relations with some characters and at the same time don't even meet the other ones. You can easily loose your best mates after making a mistake that seemed to be the good thing to do at the time. It makes the story really moving, mature and immersive. And personally that's why I play video games, not to kill dozens of monsters but to feel something. I'm waiting for the second part with great excitement and you should do the same !			"

												After completing this game once here's the best way to describe it:Breathtaking.Now I don't mean that in a lame metaphorical way specifically, but suffice it to say that there will be times where you will be caught completely off guard by the plot, and the fact that you had direct influence on it. I immediately started playing again, not for the sake of acheivements or even getting a ""best ending"" but just wanting to do things a little differently.I'm not really a connoiseur when it comes to music, but unlike other games I never listened to my own music on top of the game's.Visually this game is amazing. Boiled down, yea its a bunch of simply cycling illustrations, but those illustrations are brilliantly done, and never make you feel like you're watching some dumb gif loop. In line with that it is one of the only games I can play on my laptop's fan run like a jet engine, which is to say, it is in no way demanding for any computer to run.That said, assuming that the place where my first game ended is in fact the ending of the game, I think the loose ends did catch my attention. That didn't at all take away from the overall experience, and if anything it makes me think that they will (hopefully) be releasing a sequel, what with the girth of lore that was given to the game. Over your travels within the game you travel not even a fifth of the presented world, but it never feels like you're missing anuything. In actuality it just made me wish I could go farther, which is probably the right way for a game to make you feel.The combat is fantastic. I was amazed and enthralled with Factions, and the minor tweaks that were made to pre and during combat gameplay was done with this game in mind, not bending to any sort of predesigned border. Such a thrilling experience during every battle.A small thing that I really did appreciate was that RNG was in the hands of the player. Only by equipping certain items did RNG ever come into play, which is something I wish a lot of Tactical Strategy RPGs (or what have you) would do as well.TL;DR,A game with the smallest of blemishes that left me wanting more, 9.5/10			"

												Where do I start with this game. Well...it's amazing.The art and animation are beautiful, story is book worthy, and this is one of the rare games I've played where choices actually matter. I think of this as part Fire Emblem and part Oregon Trail. Fighting is turn based and requires a good deal of strategy as when to take off enemy armor or go straight for their health as well when to use your characters abilities. In the overworld you need to make sure you have enough supplies to get you from city to city and along the way events will happen from thieves stealing supplies to possible permanent character death. The same points you use to buy supplies are used to upgrade you heroes. Do you use the points to make your fighters better or do you buy supplies so that you can get to the next city? I had moments while playing where I felt acutal despair as I watched my supplies run dry hoping that maybe I could find some more supplies from an event and cursing myself for using to many points to upgrade units.Did I mention the art? Oh I did...WELL IT'S FREAKING GREAT!Though I only saw one animated cutscene in the game just watching your caravan walk across the plains and seeing beautiful mountains at your back. The God Stones with their elaborate designs that also give you a little insight to the lore of the world. The in-fight animations are also very good and I think there's something really cool about the way the magic looks in the game. I think this game was worth shelling out $25 but hey that's just me. With all of the choices you can make in the game I'm very willing to do a second playthrough on a harder difficulty.			"

It does a great job of clearly putting a choice in front of you, without tying you down with a morality guage (light/dark side, paragon/renegade). The combat is fun and engaging, although I found myself always wishing it was over so I could further the story. Solid RPG elements, great Oregon Trail management, but last but not least gripping characters and plot. This is the old BioWare we all miss. My biggest complaint was going in I was not aware it was the first of a trilogy, so be ready for it to end with you wanting more character development and plot.			"

												Amazing game. It's like a cross between a turn-based tactical RPG like Final Fantasy Tactics or Shining Force, and King of the Dragon Pass. Basically, there's quite a bit of combat (which would be the FF Tactics bit), but between them you have a ton of story-based and random events that requite you to make a ton of (at times really, really tough) choices. The actual story is very good, although it's rather bleak (which is a perfect fit for the Viking setting, of course).Add to that a suberb art design, composed of breathtaking traditional 2D art like I've never seen before in a computer game; and a fantastic soundtrack, and you've got yourself a truly amazing game. It's not flawless, though: while some of those flaws (like lack of full voice acting) are completely understandable, given Stoic's small size, others (like the lack of subtitles, or being forced to replay the last five hours of gameplay due to some decision you took waaaay back that now means game over for you) are not. But even with these flaws the game is still a gem, totally worth the two years Stoic took to develop it since the game's Kickstarter campaign was funded in 2012.			"

												Raise your banners it's the saga... The Banner Saga.This game... There aren't a lot of fantasy settings that really get me, but this one was one of the few. It's a kind of desolate, nordic setting with some focus on a few political aspects. Love it.The game has a special art style which wasn't really my thing, but nevertheless very thorough and unique, it has a strong focus on story, but not in your typical fashion, and has a strategic HOMM/XCOM-like battle system with RPG features, like individual character levels, skills and Items.If you want about 8-12 hours of story-driven gameplay with a pretty good but not amazing combat system, this is a really good choice and the release price wasn't extremely expensive. My biggest complaints are the length and that I want a sequel to delve further into this fantasy world.			"

												If you're a fan of tactical strategy games, this is more than worth your time.  The grid-based fights are different from anything else I've played in the genre, tying your remaining health to your ability to do damage, incentivizing keeping your party in good health.  There's a real emphasis on fighting against a team, as a team, and once you start to hang back and create opportunities the strategic depth really shines through.The heroes/caravan/item system strung on top of the combat is well put together and systemized in a fun way, harkening back a bit to things like the Oregon trail.  There seems to be a number of decision points strung through the story that can create some interesting divergences, resulting in losing/gaining new heroes, as well as the permanent death of major characters. The animation style of the game is fantastic, 2d artwork in the style of say, old Ralph Bakshi movies from the 70s and 80s.  It's a fairly unique look for a game in this genre.  Music is fantastic, by the always on point Austin Wintory.Definitely worth your time.			"

												Interesting start to a new franchise. Not perfect by any meaning, but for what its worth, I had fun, was gripped by the story and moral choices and while the ending is *SPOILERS* a HUGE cliffhanger *SPOILERS* , I hope this game gets a sequel to expand on the story and universe.The bad things:-The game is really hard. Even on the easiest difficulty. But this doesnt need to be a bad thing, since loosing characters is integrated into the storyline and can help shape the story of each playthrough new.-Its not terribly long...if you do everything right, the campaign is done in around...8-9 hours, maybe less if you are more skilled and just accept the outcome of your choice instead of save scumming because a certain event left you with a sour taste.-The story starts promising, has a huge buildup, a dramatic climax...and a really bad cliffhanger. I won't spoil much more, but lets say that unless the devs actually get a sequel done (which may or may not fail depending on their current conflict with King.com over the word Saga in their title), this will be a huge dissapointment, not unlike other promising projects like Kingdoms of Amalur or Loom.That said, its not too pricey and definitly a nice spin on the genre. So I can recommend it if you dont mind the above drawbacks and like challenging turn-based strategy rpgs.			"

												Turn-based combat RPG with interesting story, decision-making and combat system.The art is very crisp. Sound is good too.The combat system involves armor and health/strength. Losing health diminishes the strength of a character, and losing armor means they are more vulnerable. If strength is too low itll be hard to attack an enemy with higher armor level. First time Ive seen such a system in a game and it makes for more thoughtful and careful play. As I began figuring out the system my enjoyment of combat increased a lot as I began to make the right decisions and win more battles. For example, archers arent very strong against armored enemy, but they can plink away at armor whilst the melee character moves in - once both have broken they can both finish off the enemy quick.Also theres a practice battle option which provides random set of enemies. It doesnt improve or injure your heroes, just practice. These are usually harder than what you face in the normal game, allowing you to improve a lot and learn how to beat the odds. Playing on the hardest difficulty is essential I think otherwise you might find it too easy. If you like the game's combat is a good addition and adds a bit more to the game's challenge. You can also change how many heroes you go into the battles with so that can make it more of a challenge and make you a better player.			"

												The most remarkable aspect of this game is presentation. From the soundtrack to the art direction to the interface, everything is immaculate and elegant. Nothing feels rough around the edges or half-finished as far as those elements go. The gameplay is unique- a combination of choose-your-own-adventure style frequent decision-making, an Oregan Trail-like survival and travel element that involves some resource management, and the battle system itself which involves tactical strategy and some interesting components like individual health and defense bars to attack, and the Varl race of characters who take up a lot of unit space in battle but have high attack power. There are so many characters to choose from during battle- as many as 20 are encountered by game's end and even character usage involves some decision-making as characters only level up by not only actively participating, but getting in a number of kills.Now for some of the downsides- though there are such a plethora of options and routes to go on, nearly all lead toward the same end and plot points seem black and white in nature- you either picked the ""right"" answer leading to hidden items or a surplus in resources, or you picked the wrong one which can set you back in progress. But making wrong decisions matters little since the difficulty level is low until the end, and the initially interesting tactics-driven combat is actually quite simplified compared to other strategy RPGs. Aspects such as equipment management involve collecting numerous accessories and each character can hold just one. Character classes and stat allocation is similarly straightforward. On the bright side, that makes this title a great choice for those new to the genre and not very interested in micro-management. The storyline is interesting and involved, but there is not much clarification of the lore. While the character and plot development is nicely done, it can be vague with some side characters receiving barely a line of exposition. While I compared the decision-making to a choose-your-own-adventure novel, it has nowhere near the verbosity of visual novels or many story-driven RPGs. The writing is of an appreciably high standard of quality though and the lack of meandering over any particular element (whether it be storytelling or the various types of gameplay present here) keeps the game fast-paced. I achieved completion at around 10 hours and do feel there is some replay value here, but the general asking price ($24.99) is very high for this amount of content. I would suggest waiting for a sale of at least 30-50% off. The exception being if the subject matter is particularly riveting to you, in which case I'd say go ahead as it is likely to impress.			"

												In this squad based tactical/strategy game taking place in Norse mythology you determine the fate of a group of refugees trying to escape the Ragnarok. Playing similarly while being just as deep and as difficult to other famed turn-based tactical games of the past like Final Fantasy Tactics and/or Fire Emblem. But overall the most striking thing about Banner Saga is its beautifully rendered art/graphics style as well as its highly original and grim narrative. Note that this is the single player portion of the free multiplayer game Banner Saga Factions.			"

I think I heard somewhere that if X-com and the Oregon Trail had a baby  it would be this game and honestly that's the best way to describe it.

												The Banner Saga looks very promising. Visually gorgeous, it describes its world graphically through a very accomplished illustrational style. Ambient sound is understated yet emotive, and the strong musical score emphasizes the twists and turns of the plot and the interspersed turn-based fighting.The Banner Saga is set in a mythical world very much inspired by Norse legend, and being norwegian myself, I can vouch for the fantasy names, although constructs, being of the right timbre. There is an emotional relationship with the old sagas of Snorre et al.You should definitely check out The Banner Saga if you like to think and strategize, and soak yourself in the atmosphere of the vikings and their mythology. If however, you are impatient, have any sort of attention deficiency - then this is not for you.Bravo to Stoic, Bioware escapees, on The Banner Saga!			"

												Absolutely fantastic. Hard as hell, a lot of planning involved and I can tell already there is going to be some serious replayability in it.. My two gripes about the game: 1 No rotating camera in combat. When enemies cluster it is difficult to tell what is going on. I really need to rotate a camera for this. Which brings in the second issue. You sometimes make movement pathing errors. You can't take these back, there is no undo so you can get screwed by no undo for just basic movement when you haven't taken any skill / combat actions.Besides these two flaws. The game is fantastic! Great combat, art, music, story, and definitely replayability. 9/10 if you need a numeric scale. Honestly though if you enjoy tactic games like Fire Emblem. Think of it like that plus oregon trail.

												""Choose your own adventure"" strategy game with Vikings, stunning graphics and an amazing soundtrack. The story unfolds brilliantly, although the beginning can be a bit confusing (There's a lot going on and it's not explained properly until later in the game).My only complain is about the battle mechanics, the combat is too slow and there's only one special skill per character class.A great game overall, totally worth it if you are looking for a different type of adventure game. In case you're more interested in the turn-based combat system I would recommend to try it first in The Banner Saga: Factions (it's F2P).			"

												A gorgeous art style, witty dialogue, and some solid mechanics help make the Banner Saga something to sink hours on end into. There are many games that suggest that your decisions make a big difference, but the weight of your choices in The Banner Saga really have a visible heft when that last minute decision to save some civilians puts your entire clan at risk. I do wish there was a little more of a lead up to the story, and that it was easier to see the nuances of troop movement; but these are all things you eventually figure out for yourself anyway and it does have the neat effect of making things feel more rewarding. Fans of XCom will probably enjoy the simplified (yet similar) combat mechanics, and those familiar with Telltale's Walking dead series will likely find a resonance in the unforgiving decision mechanic. Either way; give it a try ^^ It's good fun.			"

												The Banner Saga is a phenomenal game - the perfect mix of Fire Emblem and Oregon Trail. I'm absolutely in love with the art style, music, and narrative. The story progresses well, and is told magnificently. If you take the time to invest yourself in each character, you really start to feel their plight as the game moves forward.Unfortunately, getting invested in the characters is difficult because of the large amount of text presented to the player in conversations. I know full voice-over for a game of this scope (and a small development team) is very expensive, but it's just a bit jarring to go from enthralling VO to text choices.Overall, this is an excellent game that tells a great story in a beautiful setting. Worth playing.			"

It's an RPG, but its tactical turn-based combat is also somewhat reminiscent of some of my favourite classic strategy games; while its approach to story-telling and choices, and its disapproving stance towards savegames call to mind the best of FTL or similar recent roguelikes.

												Freaking loved this game. (And who doesn't love vikings?)It has a great story and quite an unique art style. People tend to forget how immersive animation can be in both video games and movies/series, I mean.. How often do you see an animated game these days? While you are travelling the land with your caravan you'll never get bored of the background.. it so addicting to watch at, same goes for your caraven which increases in size in time.. it is kind of satisfying seeing all those people march with you upfront.The music is incredible nicely song and again.. immersive, I did notice a lack off of it while travelling with the caravan sometimes though. But beautiful nonetheless it grabs all the dangerous and emotional moments.Choices are rather important in the story.. If you make a certain choice one of your hero characters can suddenly betray you or your army gets sick by picking fruit from certain trees. Also don't let too many people join your caravan no matter how nice it might seem. (You will run out of supplies and most of them will starve to death!)The combat gameplay itself isn't that impressive but.. It's fun and can be very difficult (depening on your difficulty ofcourse).I would certainly recommend this game to those who love good story telling, characters and immersion.			"

												Banner Saga is a real treat from former Bioware employees and the writing, tough decisions, and attachment to the story / characters is on par with earlier Bioware titles (KOTOR, Dragon Age: Origins). The game is a mash-up of Bioware storytelling, Oregon Trail-like treks, and fairly deep turn-based rpg combat (Final Fantasy Tactics, Disgaea). The treks transverse a fantasy nordic realm and you have to deal with having enough food for your soldiers / civilians, encountering hazards, and sometimes deviating from the ""main"" route. Visually they were inspired by Disney's Sleeping Beauty and the nordic soundtrack compliments the awesome landscapes and story well. There is some voice-over work, but nearly all the dialog is text.I backed this game on Kickstarter and I'm happy to say the game has surpassed my expectations. To be clear, this is Chapter 1 of a trilogy Stoic has planned and additional chapters will not be free. My first playthrough lasted a little over 14 hours and I felt the journey was fulfilling and satisfying, while still wanting to continue the narrative. I can see myself replaying the story once or twice again, since there were numerous choices I'd like to see pan out differently.There is also a free-to-play multiplayer client, The Banner Saga: Factions, which features this game's combat and is worth a try imo.

												Rated eleventy million out of ten.Earlier today I rushed out of my study to find my girlfriend so I could bemoan the enormity of making decisions I knew might cost the lives of many of my clansmen.  ""I can't handle this responsibility! People are looking to me to lead and I'm constantly letting them down."", I wailed.For me, the hallmark of any exceptional game is that it leaves you pondering the wider story and the lives of the characters within it, even when you are far away from your computer.  The Banner Saga most certainly falls into this category. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to find myself dreaming of Dredge and Godstones again tonight.The Banner Saga game mechanic is essentially a modern multi-choice story-driven take on The Oregon Trail, with a squad-based tactics battle engine bolted on top.With captivating writing, stunning graphics and an engrossing, mood-setting soundtrack, the twists and turns of the story have at times left me setting my jaw or blinking away tears. I have found myself incredulous, mouth agape at the narrative's brutality and unfairness.  Knowing in my gut that survival is unlikely, I grip the mouse tighter, hoping it may somehow force my starving caravan up the next desolate snowy peak...			"

												What catches the eye - this is an excellent graphic performance. As an illustrator I was very pleased to recognize). This wonderful videos and charming style, detailed animation fight. The next thing that impressed - it's the sounds. This is a very melodic music, and accompanying sounds (someone sneezes, wheezing, flaps its wings, shuffling foot,  energy  armor opponents buzzing).  :)  As for the body of the game - it's combat system and dialogues. All that I like too. First, about the combat system. Nothing super new, but there are some pleasant little unusual moments. The main thing that is quite thought out and not annoying, interesting to play (especially at the most difficult level of difficulty).The combat system allows you to use characters to help each other. (They have distinctive features. Such a blow that all who are near allies also hit the enemy, even if the allies had already made ​​their move) In other words, each character beats here not only for themselves but also the team That is a good impression.By the way I love tactical games (Heroes 3, Fallout 2, Hoshigami, Front Mission 3, Kings Bounty, Vagrant Story, Disciples 2) Dialogues done at a good level. Loved the style of communication. And most captivating-  bifurcation versions of the story in small segments. For example you have finished an hard battle (but the game is not saved) then immediately draw you into a dialogue where you choose options from which you can lost one of characters. I had to replay the battle 7 times to guess the option of dialogue that will lead to the fact that the characters remain aliveOverall, the game is and lures in a single stylish amazing world of fascinating atmosphere and strong components.

												Hello,I'm going to start off by saying that this is a beautiful game. By beautiful I mean soundtrack, artwork and story. It's really enjoyable and definitely worth playing. It has a very... ""Authentic"" feeling to it.Pros:Artwork - The artwork is beautifully drawn and everything is nicely animated. Even though a bit simple at times, even the simplicity of it all seems to blend in perfectly with everything.Music - The soundtrack is nice and gives off an appropriate vibe considering the setting, but it's not incredible. It's nice, really, but it could have been a bit more diverse.Story & Character development - The story and character development are amazing. Even though they have small flaws, everything seems somehow inevitable and most of the time you are basically doing everything to make the best out of an impossible situation. That's the real struggle. Doing the best you can - no matter how bad it is.The characters are nicely designed and some of them actually evolve in unexpected ways, even if they do scream cliché at times.Skills and attributes - These go hand to hand with their usability in combat (which I will explain below) and how much you really need to think about when you upgrade them.Combat - I assume that we've all seen this type of combat by now and its basics should come as no surprise to anyone. I like the general combat style, but what I love about it are some small touches that make it... Unique. Crippling the armour of an enemy is generally optional in games, but not here. No way. If you want to actually have a chance at slaying Dredge, then you really need to buff up your armor breaking. Also damaging an opponent will not only hurt them physically and take down their hp, but will also reduce the damage they do.I like the fact that the game forces you to weigh your decisions carefully, most of the time having to choose either damaging an opponent with a small burst for the moment or simply working your way until being able to constantly damage them for higher values.Cons:Voice acting - Although sometimes done well, a large part of the voice acting in the game could do with improving. Of course, it's understandable seeing how the actors were chosen and the fact that Stoic didn't exactly have an immense budget for this project.Decisions - This is the type of game which is, for the most part, story-driven. Generally the types of fans that play this type of game are the ones that expect their role and their decisions in the to be important. It is exactly the type of game from which fans expect every decision to be important and to have significant consequences. Don't get me wrong, they're important, obviously, but I wish that some of the decisions that ulteriorly end up with the same result to have some more depth to them. The fact that quite often anything you choose to do will lead you through the same events is not what bothers me. What bothers me is that the game is quite transparent about that and lets it off quite easily.Character leveling - I really think that they should have sticked to the standard form of leveling (Everyone who's still standing at the end of the fight will get exp), buuut they didn't. Instead you gain exp for dealing the killing blow on enemies. Normally that wouldn't be so bad, but it's just so much easier for some characters to get the kil than others, that it basically makes the process of leveling certain classes very, very difficult. There's always that one big guy, with the two-hander that comes in and beats the crap out of everything that's still standing.Equipment - Well, there's really not much I can say about the equipemnt section because it didn't actually stand out. I expected equipmented rooted into the lore of the game that can help an immense deal, but I actually got a lot of items which could situationally help... Somtimes. Some items are good, sure, but not really that much. The difference they make isn't all that noticeable if you spend your points properly.Conclusion:This is a great game, definitely worth buying if you enjoy your good ol' tacitacal turn-based. But it's more than that. It's actually a great buy if you simply enjoy a good story. Combat isn't all that difficult and it's easy to get into, even if it does, at times, get a bit tiring (I'm talking about you, people who want to try out every possible path and never want any characters to get knocked out.

												The Banner Saga is fantastic from start to finish. Been sitting in my pile of games to play for a while, and I'm glad I finally go around to checking it out. This game combines a rich story set in a nordic mythology, turn-based combat that harkens to X-com, and survival decisions that remind me of the old Oregon Trail.Three great things about the game:- Decisions matter. They shape the way your party forms over the course of a solid 12-14 hour story.- A solid combat system that keeps action interesting- Fantastic story of the end timesIt's not without a few faults however. The surival-ESQUE gameplay is definitely in service to the story. Things like caravan supplies and army size feel inconsequential at times. Sometimes you will spend a bunch of currency on supplies for a long haul... only to have the supplies made meaningless by cutting a long journey short due to a story element. Other times you make sacrifices to keep your army numbers high, only never to fight or encounter another large army. Why? Because the story didn't call for you to run into an army yet. I would have much rather used the currency buy items or upgrade my party members. But there's no way to know when supplies and army size are actually needed, before you actually need them... making their currency system a bit of random guessworkThe story is good, so the above points are forgivable, but I would have liked to see them strike a better balance between the story, and the game-y parts.You should buy this game. You will enjoy it. Can't wait to play The Banner Saga 2.			"

												Highly recommend this game for fans of tactical RPGs, or turn-based RPG combat in general. It makes some questionable design decisions at various points, but is well worth every cent of the asking price. (If you pick it up later on during a Steam sale, congratulations, you're winning.)Selling points: this is possibly amongst the most beautiful games I have ever played. Not in terms of ""graphical fidelity,"" of course, but the cel-shaded art style is extremely well-done all the way through and quite captivating. I would happily take games in this style over mainstream AAA titles living in the uncanny valley over and over again. My only complaint in this area is the extremely limited character animation during ""cutscene"" conversations; what is there simply serves to highlight how little there is. I probably wouldn't even have noticed if not for the few efforts they made on this front. (A very, VERY minor complaint, since the game is not relying on FMV-style, and even in still shots, the artwork is simply gorgeous)The tactical combat is engaging, and the mechanic which links a character's health to his damage output makes an otherwise simplistic system compelling (do I do limited damage against this enemy to lower the danger they bring, or reduce his armor to make my next turn that much more effective while risking him bringing the hurt in the interim?) and makes level-up decisions on characters agonizing. I went the route of ""specializing"" each character I used frequently, resulting in characters of similar class and starting stat reaching the end-game with vastly different skill sets (i.e. of the two archers I used every opportunity, one was the absolute best at knocking enemy armor out of the picture, while the other was a damage-and-willpower fiend who had my highest kill count by the last fight). Also, while I'm not huge on harping for realism in games, it has always somewhat annoyed me that characters with 1HP out of their 1,000 maximum were just as potent as at full health, and this is a nice way of remedying that.The story arc is compelling and kept me interested the whole way through without relying on many overdone tropes and archetypes, taking place in a very interesting setting I would happily p[ay to see more of. There is also quite a bit of background lore and information made easily accessible without forcing it to the forefront through excessive exposition, leaving its perusal to those willing to spend the time to enjoy it and letting those less interested mostly ignore it without detracting from the direct experience.The Renown system, which irritated me a great deal, but in a good way (as odd as that sounds). EVERYTHING in this game - level-ups, food for your tribe, items to supplement your heroes - is purchased with renown, which you gain from victory in battle as well as certain C&C moments in between. While it can be frustrating at times, after beating the game, I view it in a wholly positive light - rather than making something like EXP and Gold to be used for two separate purposes, incorporating both resource pools into one base stat increases the strategic element, and makes every expenditure that much more risky and demanding. I entered the final battle with three fully-leveled characters, and two weaker ones, simply because I had spent the renown necessary to do so along the way to ensure nobody in my caravan starved to death along the way. (Which can also say a lot about you as a person, I suppose, in terms of how you choose to spend it) At times, I would have preferred separate pools for the various resources, but only because it would have made my inherent min-maxing tendencies easier to oblige, and I cannot legitimately call out a design decision that increases complexity and the importance of a player's strategic choice.Detriments: the touted choice & consequence mechanic, while always nice to see, seems to mostly amount to extremely random and jarring consequences; each major decision seems to have one ""correct"" option which yields a positive outcome, and the negative consequences of ""incorrect"" decisions are never forewarned adequately, resulting in major impact up to and including losing substantial characters with absolutely no warning (on courses of action they themself recommend, even). Think the Witcher in terms of its unforseeability, but without the time delay or overall neutral tone which was par for the course in that game. (To be fair, there were a couple consequences - one VERY major one - which took half the game to  conclude and did have ample but not flagrant warning, so the game did this quite well in some instances, but failed in others)The combat never changes or develops in a significant way after the first battle outside of levelled-up abilities and new character classes with different special skills opening up different strategic options. What you see in the first battle is largely what you're going to get.In the combat mechanics, again, the game seems to settle in the middle; the endgame battles (especially the final boss) had me biting nails and languishing over every turn, and the beginning was not far removed, but I had comfortably established a routine throughout the middle half of the game which pretty much ensured I'd win any given battle ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥d-drunk with minimal unit injury in the process. A more level experience would be nice.A mechanic I rather like (linking health and damage output to the same attribute) has its flaw; in many situations, it is often tactically better to leave an enemy unit on the battlefield at very low HP rather than killing them outright. Due to the mechanic Il ike, their damage potential is next to nothing, but this goes against general gaming instinct and raises concerns in compliance with the point below...MIXED FEELINGS: the way the turn-based system is executed. Instead of some stat which addresses/influences initiative, the game will always go YOUR SIDE-ENEMY SIDE-YOUR SIDE-ENEMY SIDE until only one unit remains on either, at which point one side will execute all of its turns and then the other proceeds. On one hand, I like this to an extent, because it makes battles lopsided in terms of numbers not unwinnable; on the other hand, I think it's fairly backward in terms of a good mechanic; if it were kept the same throuh the last round, it would give that moment of despair when you haver one unit left against four an air of possibility, thinking if you execute well enough you can pull this situation out of the fire (or, conversely, keep you thinking your moves over in the last moments of a fight, as an enemy acting that quickly could turn your 4-1 advantage into a one-on-one exchange if you ♥♥♥♥ it up badly enough). While I do like the mechanic as a whole as opposed to the general turn-based style, it loses its punch with that particular element making the last few turns of any given fight a foregone conclusion when it could have served to bring each and every one down to the wire.ALL IN ALL: a very, very good game. I didn't catch this game's Kickstarter in time to contribute, but most likely would have, and do not at all regret spending full price for the experience once it released. I'm hoping it does well enough that multiple follow-ups/sequels are developed, so long as they equal or improve on the quality of the original. If you enjoy slower-paced games with combat more tactical and mindful than visceral and egoistic, this is a no-brain purchase that I wholeheartedly recommend. If Call of Duty is your favorite game series... 1. this is probably not for you; 2. please die as painfully as possible in a fire as soon as possible so as to possibly rectify the damage you have already done to the industry as a whole.

												Awesome art direction.  The combat put a great spin on the turn based strategy game with its use of health as your attack stat, causing combat to flow a lot differently than say XCOM.  It also has an Oregon Trail feel, as not combat parts of the game flow very similar to that.  The game tends to be very heavy, as you often make hard choices.  I found myself having to give it a break here and there just because the wieght of my decision got to me. In my opinion a must play.  Also, good replay value.			"

												Need refund! I thought this was the hit match 3 game with a candy theme. Too much confusion...But in all seriousness, The Banner Saga is an excellent game that no strategy fan should overlook. It tells a compelling story both on a grand scale and at a personal level.At first I thought I'd be disappointed by the lack of terrain features during the combat, but to be honest I didn't mind. Between the big bodies of the varl and the need to worry about managing armor vs strength there is enough going on in the combat to keep me satisfied for the length of the game.If I do have one complaint, it would be how arbitrary some of the dialogue choices' consequences seem to be. I felt like I was at the whim of one of the dead gods sometimes. And it IS an issue because half of the game is about making hard choices in-between the fighting. It keeps things interesting, at least.			"

Set in a world straight out of a metal album, the story is truly epic and does a great job of making all of your choices feel important.  Oregon Trail meets Final Fantasy Tactics meets The Sword.

												I rarely do this, but felt compelled to write a short review.I love this game. It feels like a hybrid between Final Fantasy Tactics and The Oregon Trail. Both great games I remember from my youth (I'm almost 30).Its tough! I finally finished the game on my 4th play through. And am starting my 5th play through (Alt Endings).It is not terribly long game, about 8 hoursish; a bit shorter if you rush through dialog and skip some optional battles.Most game reviews will highlight the Artwork and Music, both exceptional.  I would like to highlight the mythology and just sense of purpose the characters, dialog, story, give the overall feel of the game.Tons of fun, worth the price, and it is rumored its the first part of a Trilogy.  Ill be there for part II.A little backstory, the developers of the game worked on the original Star Wars: The Old Republic game. Another great title for its generation.  Was a Kickstarter.  Met its funding goal in about 24hours.  The 3 main developers were former Bioware employees.  Who doesn't love Bioware games.In a nutshell, if your on the fence, I highly suggest The Banner Saga.  Lots of replay ability (there are some conversation choices that literally have played out 4 different ways, for me at least). Tons of fun, especially if you enjoy the afore mentioned Turn Based Strategy, Oregon Trial like survival, or a great story focusing on a makeshift Norse mythology.4.5/5Cheers!			"

												An emotive and beautiful journey through Viking legend, this game stands out both as an excellent strategy game, and as a true work of art. The hand-drawn artwork is sublime, and highly original in today's 3D obsessed world. The cast of dozens are beautifully rendered and animated, and set in the backdrop of a beautiful world in turmoil. The gods are dead, the sun has stopped, and something evil is coming.The story sucks you in, and challenges you with difficult moral and tactical choices throughout the game. Not only must you prevail on the battlefield, you must protect, feed and care for a growing caravan of refugees fleeing the evil on your tail. As your caravan traverses the beautiful windswept landscape you watch the narrative unfold, with each choice impacting on your fighting capability, morale, and dwindling food supplies.There are no easy choices. I am writing this review after my second playthrough, and can better appreciate this. The story is essentially linear, but seemingly innocuous choices could end the life of your favourite hero, or leave you with a knife in your back. Most games give hints to possible outcomes; The Banner Saga teaches you that life is arbitrary, cruel, and that you can't save everyone. The only consolation is perhaps that no matter how bad things get, none of your choices can (I think) make the game unwinnable - but you will live with the burden of knowing that had you chosen more wisely, perhaps more lives could have been saved.Combat is turn based, and, until the get the hang of it, pretty brutal. In another nod to realism, health and attack strength is linked - an injury means your hero can't hit as hard. As your team is weakened, each successive wound compounds upon the last, spiralling you closer to defeat. Battles can be nail-biting affairs, but the tension this mechanic creates is delicious, and makes prevailing all the sweeter. My only criticism is that there were too many monotonous battles mid-game, but perservere, and your skills and your heroes will be honed for your ultimate confrontation in the last chapter.Despite its minor flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed this game; twice. Each path taken was another surprise, and deepened my appreciation of the thought, effort and love that went into this accomplished KickStarter project. A fantastic and memorable experience, and a big thumbs up from me.			"

												Although this is a great game, I am a little bit disapointed. I love the tactical part of this game and although I enjoyed the story and how it was told, there was too much reading (and I usually don't mind a good text adventure) and way too little tactical combat.I preferred the free ""The Banner Saga: Factions"" because of this, but I disliked that one because it is only online/multiplayer.I think what I miss in this game is a Factions-like, but single player experience.I don't think I will be buying part 2 & 3 (except maybe on big sale)Still, it's a good game, if you like a good story and are into the tactics, you should try it!

												I really loved playing this game, the story is engaging and even the smallest of choices feels as though it has meaning. The battle system takes a little getting used to (I kept failing to get my raned units within range of the enemy at first), but is very good. The story and choices are the main part of the game for me though, as they're more engaing than the battles. I definately agree wuth the comparison to GoT as you do feel characters may be killed off at any moment if you aren't careful.  One decision I actually decided to sleep on as I knew it would probably be a bit of a game changer and I was torn between two options.The only thing I would say is a big downside to the game is that it is the 1st part of a trilogy so the game stops very suddenly. The price and the descrition do not prepare you for this and some people may feel a bit ripped off by it as you aren't getting a full game. However I got it on sale so don't mind as much (although I am dying to know what happens next). I would say Steam should make a note of this being a ""Part 1"" so people know the emotional turmoil they will be in upon finishing the game.			"

												So this game....is great! I have many kind words to say about this and being a huge Final Fantasy Tactics(SRPG's for that matter) fan this was a real treat to see on Steam's front page one day. I have some things about the game I love and I have some things about the game...well that I actually hate. Yes, it has left that much distaste in my mouth haha but thats not to discourage you. It is most likely something formed from my biased and practically purist views of SRPG's. So first, the things I love ^_^1-The ArtCant say enough about this, its phenomenal and its like being in an interactive Disney game of brutality and brings me back to the SegaCD days and old PC of point and click adventure/exploring days. I could easily say; play this game to just be immensed inside this beautiful game. 2-The MusicIt's very well composed and suited for everything thats going on in this story and era its cast in. I'm a musician/composer myself and cant help but appreciate it from that sense, but I would imagine most people who arent into music would only be pulled into the feelings of this game easier similar to a Hollywood movie.3-SRPG ElementsWell..... I love this aspect of the game and its 90% of the reason I bought this game. I've played every SRPG I can get my hands on from Fire Emblem series and Final Fantasy Tactics to the overly diluted systems of Ogre Tactics and Disgaea. While I prefer a system that is well thought out with its boundaries and expansions within its systems, I do sometimes prefer a bit more of openness in the system such as Disgaea, but my mind tends to grow bored with endless options as everything becomes bland quicker than key roles that tend to shine within a system with some boundaries. Back to this game though, its set up a bit differently. The classes are chosen ahead of time, if you can even call them classes, more like roles from the characters backgrounds. Archers,Bruisers,Tanks,Lancers,etc are some things you can expect to see early game. All with their own special moves and ranges on the map as well as movement across the map.4-The Story TellingIts great and very reminiscent of a great game that allows you to feel as if you have some control of the outlook of the characters,story,and ending. Games that come to mind are those of the Bethesda Series of Fallout and Elder Scrolls. Killing of key characters, ignoring causes for better or worse, choosing to help yourself or others, choosing sides/factions, and moving your ""Army"" around the map to different encounters...well its all here. While I love this open book approach and multiple answer dialogue options I can definitely feel the sting of any choice I make afterwards.So onto ....the hated aspects.1-SRPG Elements ConstrainmentsThis game has control of your progression...very tightly. I'm only assuming the developers wanted control of how you progress and made this decision intentionally. Since I dont appreciate the restriction personally, I disagree with the direction almost entirely. I know building those mechanics would take a lot of hours to put in place and could have been a budget decision or they could have wanted this part to be light and not focused on heavily by the player. I just cant help but want to(ignoring the fact that i'm a veteran and have lots of things to compare this system to) considering you are fighting...well 75% of the time and you are always ALWAYS at a disadvantage. Not a single fight in this game are you evenly matched none the less above the enemy. So with no way inside their system to really cater to your playing style, I find myself getting irritated with the lack of in the system. Its presence is there, but its faint.2-No SavingEverytime I make a decision that affects something important, I prefer to be secure in my decision. I'm aware...Life doesnt have a pause button and once things are said and actions are done, the ripples around are permanent. But this isnt life, its a game. I prefer (personally) to have control over the game having control. So the lack of saving makes this...well a bit irritating. If you are similar to me then you too will be annoyed by the lack of this function. I dont play through Fallout 3 five times and make a different decision everytime I do something important. I would rather save and see what each option does. Personal way of playing and I wont claim its anything else. Its not right its not wrong, I just know I'm not the only person who does things this way with dialogue option heavy games such as this. On top of that, its an autosave system. So lets say you make a decision and you think things were going well, you win the battle, you lose it, whatever. A character you've placed an item on,used your points on to level up,etc dies and you find out through dialogue. They are GONE. Caput. Reload your previous save to try and win the battle? Nope. Reload to make a different decision in dialogue? Nope. Outcome permanent. Now that i've said that, I have to say there are some kind of ways around this. For one, it autosaves in multiple areas so if you can escape before the dialogue is done and reload there are more than one times I've used this to go back before the new autosave has saved the ripples in the ocean. Also it seems(if I recall right) when you quit abruptly(ouside of battle of course) it makes a save point at that direct point of leisure. So you can constantly quit the game and reload to beat this system. But this is....well redundant. There should simply be an intuitive save function in place to save yourself the annoyance. On a final note, its my impression that the developers wanted you to push past these losses as they are constantly letting you know you are in an ocean that you have no control over and you will gain/lose characters often due to storyline but when you lose an invested in warrior to a minor choiceits nothing more than annoying.Final Thoughts:Its a great game and one many will love. I'm very happy to play what I have of this game and I plan on finishing it all the way through. Do I plan on playing it twice or more to see the other options? No. No. and No. But I feel compelled to see the rest of the story and love looking at this game. Not to mention it actually plays flawlessly and is very well developed in all aspects minus my disagreements with the character progression system and resource management. Play it if you like games similar to FFT and Fire Emblem and make your own opinion, I strongly urge this. Thank you Stoic for your modern SRPG and I look forward to your future works and to see you mature as a developer.			"

												A good game with excellent art and style but a basic combat system. Nice to hear the authentic accents in the few spoken lines and the music is outstanding. The gameplay consists of dialogue choices and a basic turn-based, grid combat system. As with all the best choice based dialogue games, some of the choices are the sort that cause you to sit and think for 30 minutes before selecting something you immediately regret.The combat is repetitive and once I had a go-to team I found it difficult to break from a routine (giants at the front to smash some up the baddies, archers at the back to pick off the smashed). The combat almost feels like it was added to make the game a game instead of what could have been an excellent interactive story. It beats quick time events I guess but the lack of enemy types makes everything too easy. When got bored of the combat I bumped the Difficulty setting down to Easy only to find out it was the final battle in the game. So, it was good enough for my 10 hour play time.Everything about the game feels very much like a touch screen was always in the back of the developers minds. This is not a complaint, the play style is perfected suited for dropping in and out to extend what can be a pretty bleak story. The odds are certainly against all of the characters and a string of badly handled choices can result in some miserable  setbacks.I picked the game up in the Summer sale 2014, excellent value for money. I'm on board for the planned sequels. More spoken dialogue and improved combat would build on the excellent foundation set up with The Banner Saga.			"

												Impressive strategy RPG with beautifully hand drawn animations and travelling sequences. Choices in encounters during caravan travels add both to the story and battle strategy, introducing a population and resource management aspect which changes depending on how the player chooses to engage enemies in group battles vs using army reserves in a cautious or direct manner. The Banner Saga has turned out to be a far more charming and deeper game than I had ever expected. More and more mechanics are introduced as one gets further into the campaign. This is one of the most satisfying SRPG / adventure experiences in a long time. I had hesitated due to the price, but for the current midweek madness sale, $10 is an amazing deal. If you were holding off for any reason, now is the time to pick up this title. I see now that even the price of $14.99 or even $20 still seems very reasonable!			"

												Having just beaten The Banner Saga, I can now say that it will remain one of my favorites games for many years to come. The story/lore was superb, the soundtrack was fantastic ( I highly recommend getting the edition with the soundtrack), and I found myself protective of the games main characters Rook and his daughter Allete. The meat of the game revolves around balancing the level progression of your characters while also providing resources for your caravhan, which both use the same resource to manage. It can be a struggle depending on what difficulty you're playing on, but if you're just looking to enjoy the story it is very possible without sacrificing any fun. I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of turn based strategies, deep emotional stories, and worlds that are rich in lore.			"

												I'm a fan of tactical games and RPGs; and this one did quite well on both accounts.  It managed to do so with an amazing live score, voice acting, and beautiful artwork to boot.  I came to really appreciate the characters and even became invested in them as was revealed by certain turns in the plot.  I like the mechanic pretty well, but compared to other tactics RPG's the options for fighting seem somewhat limited.The whole game isn't based around fighting, though.  A good portion of it is spent ""Oregon Trail""-style journeying across a landscape and making choices which affect the fate of your group.Highly recommended.			"

												Amazing art and animation. Taking inspiration from Eyvind Earle (Disney's Sleeping Beauty) gives this game a classic Disney feel. The writing is a bit slow and drawn out, borderline amateur. But overall I'm pretty happy with the game so far. The battle system is simple and well explained. It's a bit slow overall so if you're one of those ""need it done now"" type of people this game may not be for you. Wish there were voice acting but I shouldn't expect much from a Kickstarter game. You play multiple perspectives from the different main characters each chapter. Overall it's a very Sleeping Beauty mixed with Game of Thrones story and vibe with a heavy Viking mythology sway. Overall a pretty cool experience and one of those games you'll play and be in awe of the art direction. I hope the story pans out a little better as I progress through the story.As it stands I have NOT FINISHED the game. But from this point I'd give the game a nice clean 8/10. Mostly due to the art direction and battle system.			"

												I highly recommend The Banner Saga to anyone with an interest in tactics games. It has two flaws, 1. the person with fewer units moves more often (balanced by the fact that a hit unit strikes back) and 2. experience points are the currency for everything - items, levels, and caravan supplies. But in my opinion everything else makes up for that. Aesthetic is amazing, story is great and Viking myths+Tolkien-like, with a little bit of Game of Thrones brutality in there. Music is outstanding.One of my favourite games from 2014, easly top 5.			"

												The most remarkable aspect of this game is presentation. From the soundtrack to the art direction to the interface, everything is immaculate and elegant. Nothing feels rough around the edges or half-finished as far as those elements go. The gameplay is unique- a combination of choose-your-own-adventure style frequent decision-making, an Oregan Trail-like survival and travel element that involves some resource management, and the battle system itself which involves tactical strategy and some interesting components like individual health and defense bars to attack, and the Varl race of characters who take up a lot of unit space in battle but have high attack power. There are so many characters to choose from during battle- as many as 20 are encountered by game's end and even character usage involves some decision-making as characters only level up by not only actively participating, but getting in a number of kills.Now for some of the downsides- though there are such a plethora of options and routes to go on, nearly all lead toward the same end and plot points seem black and white in nature- you either picked the ""right"" answer leading to hidden items or a surplus in resources, or you picked the wrong one which can set you back in progress. But making wrong decisions matters little since the difficulty level is low until the end, and the initially interesting tactics-driven combat is actually quite simplified compared to other strategy RPGs. Aspects such as equipment management involve collecting numerous accessories and each character can hold just one. Character classes and stat allocation is similarly straightforward. On the bright side, that makes this title a great choice for those new to the genre and not very interested in micro-management. The storyline is interesting and involved, but there is not much clarification of the lore. While the character and plot development is nicely done, it can be vague with some side characters receiving barely a line of exposition. While I compared the decision-making to a choose-your-own-adventure novel, it has nowhere near the verbosity of visual novels or many story-driven RPGs. The writing is of an appreciably high standard of quality though and the lack of meandering over any particular element (whether it be storytelling or the various types of gameplay present here) keeps the game fast-paced. I achieved completion at around 10 hours and do feel there is some replay value here, but the general asking price ($24.99) is very high for this amount of content. I would suggest waiting for a sale of at least 30-50% off. The exception being if the subject matter is particularly riveting to you, in which case I'd say go ahead as it is likely to impress.			"

The reluctant viking themed universe makes me giddy and jump at the chance of learning more about the lore of The Banner Saga. While there is no actual audio dialogue except in the intro, the game really allows your mind to wanter and the art and graphics of the game are amazingly beautiful.

												I wrote a bit about this game  here [hits.raygunsue.org], which I'll quote below for the super curious. Overall, I really enjoy it, but it gives you a funny feeling. Initially I felt a bit cheated by the twenty dollars it cost me, because so much of the game seemed extremely formulaic -- yet it burned through a Sunday for me when I really did have other things I needed to do. It seems like formulaic aspects of the game don't stop the choices you make from feeling important, even though you are constantly under-informed as to their consequences and nothing every seems to go right. That seems to be part of the point. It's a great game for winter, though I'd recommend having a precise time limit in mind.Here's the much longer version:Those old Hanna-Barbera cartoons used to have these funny tells. Velma Dinkley would be inspecting a book case for clues, and you could always tell, because of a marked difference between shelves, which one would have a trap door. I’m sure this was just an artifact of the animating process, such that there was a distinct difference between the background and moveable foreground items, but it also functioned brilliantly with the premise of shows like Scooby-Doo, the three-second anticipation of animation and the formula to every episode braiding together so that nothing really unexpected occurred. Dull, but delightfully so.

The Banner Saga shares some of these elements. Much of the game consists in the shift of a caravan proceeding horizontally across landscape and screen, and though there are animations, much of these are repetitive, glancing eyes and twisting hair. But though these are dull, in a sense, the effect isn’t unfascinating. The game is dull in an aesthetic way, in the way that wintry world would be, where it seemed at every point that my caravan was simply going from bad to worse circumstances, and when they would cut to those animations of the characters, glancing eyes and twisting hair, it seemed realistic, that people in a cold and godless world would address their inevitably sour options with little change in expression. Dull, like hit too much too often.

That safe feeling, in Hanna-Barbera and The Banner Saga, is tied to seeing nothing change except the foreground. Now, for the latter, this isn’t strictly true. Terrible things occur at various points in the game, directly affecting both the brave caravan and the landscape of the world around you. Yet so much of the game feels the same. You careen from danger to danger, watching food run out, watching the number of units following you ebb. Until a red pop-up tells you that two mothers are fighting over the marital prospects of their daughters, or that a varl, (a horned immortal) was found clawing himself in the woods — or, more dramatically, that someone important, to the characters and to your goals in the game, has died, or betrayed you. When things happen, they happen textually. Beyond that, the in-game visuals are limited to varieties of landscape, varieties of battlefield, and varieties of campsites. (And, as said, the occasional animated exchange, where this animation involves very little beyond glancing eyes and twisting hair and printed dialogue.) But these limitations don’t feel like laziness.

A Song of Ice and Fire has similar levels of dull-ness and bad-to-worse-ness and also occurs in a rich, historied world, where big things are happening. But, being a series of books, it happens entirely textually. And that seems important. When I played Final Fantasy 8, my actions scar the world, and I see it, in the world map or otherwise. Things change, and also you are constantly chased from bad-to-worse. Neither ASOIAF or FF8 offered me quite the same experience I’m having here, but for different reasons. Since I do not make choices in Westeros, I can empathize with the plights of the ASOIAF characters, but though I am certainly rooting for some, I am never anxious, usually simply in a state of proto-grief. Though I did make choices in FF8, there was never a sense (supported by in-game information) that this was all business as usual.

I think The Banner Saga provides a kind of game delicacy: the sense of making decisions in dreadful world, where your decisions have weight, yet so routinely lead to bad consequences, where one feels very ordinary and not up to the task, in just the way the characters do.

To get that sense, I think you need elements like formulaic visuals, but choices, too, presented textually. There’s something either very powerful or sadly impotent about one’s imaginative capabilities when reading: I rarely notice inconsistencies. Part of that might be because I’m invested too much mentally, such that I pull out everything I can to make it all work, or I’ve invested too little, such that I haven’t even really imagined things enough to notice inconsistencies.1 That a significant part of the game is textual, and that what is significant within the game occurs textually, seems important. When you pair the formulaic visuals with a rich2 imagined space, I think you get tugged in two directions. You’re anxious because of textually presented decisions, and yet you keep scrolling through the same-old-same-old. Even though there are terrible things happening in the world, the formula for game-play presented in the visuals never seems to reflect the anxious sense you get from the textual decisions, and so their weight never seems to be fully evidenced in the game play. It gives me a rainy-day feeling that literature usually lacks. “All these things need to get done!”, even as the years slip forward. "

												I'm lost at words to describe how much I thoroughly enjoyed The Banner Saga. This title has such a mesmorizing score and astonishing artwork. Let's not forget about the  characters. Combining all that with the impressively well done story leaves you with an immersion one would not expect from an adventure game.You are the leader of your clansmen and during your adventure you encounter numerious trials and tribulations, many which will leave you questioning your morale compass. To name a few: Starving strangers, backstabbers, gluttony, schemers, gender equality, racism. How will you deal with them in each encounter? How will you deal with troublemakers in your caravan? I found this to be very much like The Walking Dead mixed with Oregon/Organ Trail in terms of the choices you are make!The game eases you into the story and gameplay mechanics. The turn-based combat system is very easy to understand with a steep learning curve. Players who are familiar with tabletop, armor values, attack values, etc won't have as much trouble. The difficulty is in the risk factor. There are two values, Strength and Shield; Strength is for attack value and health while Shield is your armor value that reduces incoming Strength attacks. Despite how this all looks really simple, it's a lot more complicated. I had a very interesting time learning how to maximize the effectiveness of combat. There is also a limited resource called Will that you can exert your troops to more further or deal more damage. Do you weaken the enemy shield first before dealing a swift deathly blow or do you attack their strength and make them deal less damage in return?I am a huge fan of the story and setting. I love Norse mytho and Banner Saga has numerous hints of it as inspiration. I'm also fond of many of the characters personalities and how well detailed they are. They have layers of complexion and every single one of them have their own goals/motives/opinions; strangers can become allies, allies can become enemies. However, looking back, I wasn't able to bond with most of the characters...strange. I cannot applaud the developers enough. This here, The Banner Saga, is a work of art. I cannot sing enough praise.			"

												What a great RPG game. I kind of found this game by accident while navigating through Steam and after reading a bit about it online I decided to go ahead and buy it. It was a damn good decision. It is a bit of a different RPG as for most of it you are left with managing your caravan supplies and day to day problems. The game is linear so there isn't room for you to walk around and explore things like Skyrim or any other RPG out there. The thing about The Banner Saga is it story and how you go about it. Despite being straightforward regarding where you are going you have a say on how you are going to get there. The how in question is not about which route to take physically but rather emtionally and morally. As you travel with your caravan and your supplies dwindle should you threaten a farmer in order to obtain food? Or would you rather negotiate with him?  When a baby is born in your caravan do you stop and celebrate given people have been dying left and right? Or do you say, nope we don't have the resources to cheer, let's carry on? Another thing that really hooks you are the characters. Despite being rather short the game makes you care about each and everyone of the main chars. The problem with this is that no character is exempt from being killed during the game, and it ends up to you to choose weather to add a character to the lineup and potentially risk his/her death. At the end of the game, you end up feeling quite pleased of having survived the ride and also a bit depressed for all the bad things that happened to your party and caravan along the way. For me it was a sad thing to have killed Alette, the main character's daughter, at the final battle as she was my favorite character. Her funeral, in viking manner where her body is placed in a burning ship and sent along the river, was one of the most emotional moments in gaming for me.			"

Much of the game consists in the shift of a caravan proceeding horizontally across landscape and screen, and though there are animations, much of these are repetitive, glancing eyes and twisting hair. But though these are dull, in a sense, the effect isn’t unfascinating. The game is dull in an aesthetic way, in the way that wintry world would be, where it seemed at every point that my caravan was simply going from bad to worse circumstances, and when they would cut to those animations of the characters, glancing eyes and twisting hair, it seemed realistic, that people in a cold and godless world would address their inevitably sour options with little change in expression. Dull, like hit too much too often.

That safe feeling, in Hanna-Barbera and The Banner Saga, is tied to seeing nothing change except the foreground. Now, for the latter, this isn’t strictly true. Terrible things occur at various points in the game, directly affecting both the brave caravan and the landscape of the world around you. Yet so much of the game feels the same. You careen from danger to danger, watching food run out, watching the number of units following you ebb. Until a red pop-up tells you that two mothers are fighting over the marital prospects of their daughters, or that a varl, (a horned immortal) was found clawing himself in the woods — or, more dramatically, that someone important, to the characters and to your goals in the game, has died, or betrayed you. When things happen, they happen textually. Beyond that, the in-game visuals are limited to varieties of landscape, varieties of battlefield, and varieties of campsites. (And, as said, the occasional animated exchange, where this animation involves very little beyond glancing eyes and twisting hair and printed dialogue.) But these limitations don’t feel like laziness.

A Song of Ice and Fire has similar levels of dull-ness and bad-to-worse-ness and also occurs in a rich, historied world, where big things are happening. But, being a series of books, it happens entirely textually. And that seems important. When I played Final Fantasy 8, my actions scar the world, and I see it, in the world map or otherwise. Things change, and also you are constantly chased from bad-to-worse. Neither ASOIAF or FF8 offered me quite the same experience I’m having here, but for different reasons. Since I do not make choices in Westeros, I can empathize with the plights of the ASOIAF characters, but though I am certainly rooting for some, I am never anxious, usually simply in a state of proto-grief. Though I did make choices in FF8, there was never a sense (supported by in-game information) that this was all business as usual.

I think The Banner Saga provides a kind of game delicacy: the sense of making decisions in dreadful world, where your decisions have weight, yet so routinely lead to bad consequences, where one feels very ordinary and not up to the task, in just the way the characters do.

To get that sense, I think you need elements like formulaic visuals, but choices, too, presented textually. There’s something either very powerful or sadly impotent about one’s imaginative capabilities when reading: I rarely notice inconsistencies. Part of that might be because I’m invested too much mentally, such that I pull out everything I can to make it all work, or I’ve invested too little, such that I haven’t even really imagined things enough to notice inconsistencies.1 That a significant part of the game is textual, and that what is significant within the game occurs textually, seems important. When you pair the formulaic visuals with a rich2 imagined space, I think you get tugged in two directions. You’re anxious because of textually presented decisions, and yet you keep scrolling through the same-old-same-old. Even though there are terrible things happening in the world, the formula for game-play presented in the visuals never seems to reflect the anxious sense you get from the textual decisions, and so their weight never seems to be fully evidenced in the game play. It gives me a rainy-day feeling that literature usually lacks. “All these things need to get done!”, even as the years slip forward. "

												Banner Saga is a study in videogames as a storytelling medium. The score, the sounds, the visual style, and the writing all work together beautifully to tell the story of a merciless world falling apart. It's tense and you're always on the verge of annihilation, and the music alone could tell you so. It's gritty, and the crunches of axes breaking armor and the grunts and moans of the injured make you feel it. People are fragile and the perpetual march is exhausting, and the heavy shambling motions of bodies shows you so.  As the leader, you constantly have to arbitrate the problems of your followers, keep them optimistic, keep them fed, and keep them alive while a continent of panicking and desperate people is being overrun.  Everything harmoniously comes together to weave an atmosphere where feelings of dread and anxiety are constant. Your choice isn't whether or not people die, it's who dies now so that fewer will die later.  In every artistic regard this game is an achievement.Unfortunately it's not for everyone, though. Its roots are in the artistry, not the gameplay--people have some valid complaints about that. Only some. I didn't dislike the gameplay at all, but I was very wrapped up in every other part of the game. Play it for the experience.			"

												As a fan of turn based strategy games I can't say that The Banner Saga is a great game. The strategic part is very basic and isn't more complex than a game of checkers. Also the user interface is really abysmal, the worst I've ever seen in a strategic game. For example you can't inspect your team members attributes and abilities when choosing who to bring in battle. While in battle the interface isn't better and choosing the action to perform feels very cheap. Abilities are described ""with text"" like a game from 20 years ago, no icons and no visual aids. Very very basic.Despite all this I still recommend the game; why? Because the story is tragic and mature like it rarely happens in games lately. It is really up to Norse Myths standards... The music is a masterpiece that is alone worth the price of the game and the experience, as whole, feels like a work of love from its developers. So even if I can't fully recommend it as a game I still recommend it without hesitation as a work of ""art"".			"

												Though this game is not perfect, i had a blast playing it;-Amazing Visual Style-Enthralling story (as you would expect form this developer), choices that matter even though sometimes they feel a bit unfair-Very unique resource system where you have to balance buying supplies, items and upgrades-Decent combat, i honestly found it to be a little simplistic but you definitely have to be careful where you place your units or they can get 1 hit-Hard(?) - Actually didn't have a very difficult time on medium difficulty until the final sequence, which was absolutely impossible given the choices i made and the characters i had upgraded. Had to switch to easy for this. Cant even imagine hard difficulty for this fight.Overall, I had great time with this game and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fun story-driven strategy game.			"

												I'm lost at words to describe how much I thoroughly enjoyed The Banner Saga. This title has such a mesmorizing score and astonishing artwork. Let's not forget about the  characters. Combining all that with the impressively well done story leaves you with an immersion one would not expect from an adventure game.You are the leader of your clansmen and during your adventure you encounter numerious trials and tribulations, many which will leave you questioning your morale compass. To name a few: Starving strangers, backstabbers, gluttony, schemers, gender equality, racism. How will you deal with them in each encounter? How will you deal with troublemakers in your caravan? I found this to be very much like The Walking Dead mixed with Oregon/Organ Trail in terms of the choices you are make!The game eases you into the story and gameplay mechanics. The turn-based combat system is very easy to understand with a steep learning curve. Players who are familiar with tabletop, armor values, attack values, etc won't have as much trouble. The difficulty is in the risk factor. There are two values, Strength and Shield; Strength is for attack value and health while Shield is your armor value that reduces incoming Strength attacks. Despite how this all looks really simple, it's a lot more complicated. I had a very interesting time learning how to maximize the effectiveness of combat. There is also a limited resource called Will that you can exert your troops to more further or deal more damage. Do you weaken the enemy shield first before dealing a swift deathly blow or do you attack their strength and make them deal less damage in return?I am a huge fan of the story and setting. I love Norse mytho and Banner Saga has numerous hints of it as inspiration. I'm also fond of many of the characters personalities and how well detailed they are. They have layers of complexion and every single one of them have their own goals/motives/opinions; strangers can become allies, allies can become enemies. However, looking back, I wasn't able to bond with most of the characters...strange. I cannot applaud the developers enough. This here, The Banner Saga, is a work of art. I cannot sing enough praise.			"

												I highly recommend The Banner Saga to anyone with an interest in tactics games. It has two flaws, 1. the person with fewer units moves more often (balanced by the fact that a hit unit strikes back) and 2. experience points are the currency for everything - items, levels, and caravan supplies. But in my opinion everything else makes up for that. Aesthetic is amazing, story is great and Viking myths+Tolkien-like, with a little bit of Game of Thrones brutality in there. Music is outstanding.One of my favourite games from 2014, easly top 5.			"

												Impressive strategy RPG with beautifully hand drawn animations and travelling sequences. Choices in encounters during caravan travels add both to the story and battle strategy, introducing a population and resource management aspect which changes depending on how the player chooses to engage enemies in group battles vs using army reserves in a cautious or direct manner. The Banner Saga has turned out to be a far more charming and deeper game than I had ever expected. More and more mechanics are introduced as one gets further into the campaign. This is one of the most satisfying SRPG / adventure experiences in a long time. I had hesitated due to the price, but for the current midweek madness sale, $10 is an amazing deal. If you were holding off for any reason, now is the time to pick up this title. I see now that even the price of $14.99 or even $20 still seems very reasonable!			"

												A good game with excellent art and style but a basic combat system. Nice to hear the authentic accents in the few spoken lines and the music is outstanding. The gameplay consists of dialogue choices and a basic turn-based, grid combat system. As with all the best choice based dialogue games, some of the choices are the sort that cause you to sit and think for 30 minutes before selecting something you immediately regret.The combat is repetitive and once I had a go-to team I found it difficult to break from a routine (giants at the front to smash some up the baddies, archers at the back to pick off the smashed). The combat almost feels like it was added to make the game a game instead of what could have been an excellent interactive story. It beats quick time events I guess but the lack of enemy types makes everything too easy. When got bored of the combat I bumped the Difficulty setting down to Easy only to find out it was the final battle in the game. So, it was good enough for my 10 hour play time.Everything about the game feels very much like a touch screen was always in the back of the developers minds. This is not a complaint, the play style is perfected suited for dropping in and out to extend what can be a pretty bleak story. The odds are certainly against all of the characters and a string of badly handled choices can result in some miserable  setbacks.I picked the game up in the Summer sale 2014, excellent value for money. I'm on board for the planned sequels. More spoken dialogue and improved combat would build on the excellent foundation set up with The Banner Saga.			"

												Three things make The Banner Saga excellent:First, the setting is well done.  The plot is interesting even if, in a general sense, it is unoriginal.  It really shines in the details and nuances (especially how the plot and characters interact) and the feeling of desperation and struggle really comes through as the game progresses.  The music is exceptional.  It's epic when it needs to be without being over the top and subtle when it needs to be without being unnoticeable.  The visuals and sound effects are also solid, and I especially enjoyed the animation style that Stoic used for this game.Second, the choices.  Your choices really drive this game in a way I haven't seen in many others.  Sure you have games where you're faced with a choice that may have implications later, but they're usually easy choices that are morally unambiguous and where the repercussions easy to predict.  In the Banner Saga choices are not so easy.  Choices that seem to be clear and easily made result in unexpected consequences sometimes immediately, sometimes not until much later in the game.  Other choices are just difficult.  The consequences of your choices can be serious as well.  For example, one plot choice I made early in the game resulted in the death of two of my characters much later in the game.  There's also the constant choice of what to do with your primary resource in the game.  It's very limited and you have to decide if you are going to use it to make your characters more powerful or make sure your party can eat for another few days.  You'll be sitting there, sometimes agonizing over your choices and wishing the game were more obvious but loving the fact that it isn't.Finally, the combat.  I like the system a lot.  If you've played turn-based, party-focused combat games before, the basic mechanics are essentially the same.  But there's enough thrown in there to change how you fight and make things interesting.  For example, a unit's health and damage potential are linked (same stat) so the more a character is wounded the less damage that character can do to another character's health.  This alone is an interesting element but you also have another factor with armor mitigating damage to the point where, if a character's armor is high enough, you may not be able to damage that character at all.  This forces you to figure out if it's better to inflict less health damage on an enemy, making him weaker but keeping him in the fight, or if it's better to risk that same enemy being able to do higher damage to your party while you soften him up for a death blow.  Add to that special abilities that are varied and can take some clever playing to set up for maximum effectiveness and you have a combat system that is both consistent enough to get the hang of and become proficient at, but also varied enough to keep things interesting.But there is a bit of bad with the good:First, the game is pretty short.  I was actually surprised when I beat it, and for $20 I think this game could have included a bit more content.  I didn't time myself but it probably took me between 12 and 15 hours to beat the game.  There's some replayability with the fact that there are so many choices to be made and you could spend hours exploring them all but, being so plot-driven, once you've experienced the plot, repeated playthroughs become more mechanical than anything else.Second, this game could have benefitted greatly from a skirmish mode.  There is something of a skirmish mode with the Training Tent, but the only variables you control there are the party you bring and this is limited by where you are in the game, who you have in your party, what their levels are, and what items you've obtained.  A separate skirmish mode where you could set up your own custom battles would have been perfect and enhanced the replayability of the game by giving the player the opportunity to explore all the aspects of the combat system they're interested in, or just hop in and smash some skulls for fun.All in all, I really enjoyed this game and am excited for the sequel.  If an excellent setting and interesting plot are your thing, this game has them.  If you're interested in a game where your choices can have a serious impact on how your game plays, this game does that.  If you're even just into turn-based combat RPGs, this is one worthy of your time.			"

												I bought this game on sale for ten dollars, I played it like crazy and burned through it because I needed to see what happened next. I think for the length of the game it is a fair price, with plenty of incentive to play through the game again trying different combos in battle, and different story choices. I loved the combat, even if it took me a while to really get it, the story was incredible, and I was honestly hurt when certain events took place, and I had this feeling of absolute dread in my stomach when I was faced with three choices, none of which were good to me.My only gripe is how it ended, I won't spoil it, but while the ending I got, unsure if there are other endings, was incredibly powerful and hit me hard emotionally, I feel like it left too many questions, and I hope there will be a sequel because there are things I need to know, characters I need to see more of, at least some DLC would be nice.

												First of all, this is such a beautiful game. The art direction is fantastic and very memorable. I have played many games where developers claim that 'your decisions affect the overall game'. This is a very bold statement and most games never truly live up to it. The Banner Saga more than lives up to this statement. The story is brutal and the gameplay can be unforgiving (in a good way), which only adds to its charm. In a time where developers will often play it safe and produce what is sure to sell, The Banner Saga is an absolute breath of fresh air. What I found most interesting about this game was the world, lore and its characters. It's deep and very well structured. It truly feels like an epic journey and when tragedy does strike it's often a very powerful moment. I can't wait to experience more games within this saga. 100% recommended.			"

												(Disclaimer: The following review was done before playing the sequel(s) and is exclusively pertinent to it.)Banner Saga is the first chapter in a series that weaves nordic mythology and aesthetic with an interesting unique fantasy world that is quite apocalyptic in tone. It mixes tactical RPG elements with a survival ""on-rails"" traveling mechanic (the term ""viking orion trail"" describes it quite well), both dictated ultimately by a visual novel ""choice-based"" gameplay structure.This game's strongest qualities are by far its brilliantly crafted artistic elements: Story, graphics and music. The graphics are wonderful and seeing traditional hand-drawn 2d animation in a world where 3d animation is the norm is refreshing. The backgrounds are inspired by artist Eyvind Earle (they even named a character after him) and are quite breathtaking. The music sounds quite authentic in its attempts to complement its theme, as it mixes elements of traditional nordic folk music (with singing), and is very well composed and was recorded in an actual orchestra which brings it to a whole new level. The story is quite interesting and in parts quite brutal. The worldbuilding is well done and pulls you in quite intensely - though it feels a bit narrow in its scope, lacking a bit of cultural and political diversity at times. As for the plot, there are definately some ""game of thronesy"" ruthlessness (minus the outward adult elements to it), feeling like you're never really safe and anything can happen - except perhaps for some degree of ""plot armor"" that perhaps can't be avoided when you're writing a protagonist-driven narrative.Now for the gameplay, which is where the real faults of this game unfortunately lie:As I said before there are three elements that compose this game: A tactical RPG element that takes place in battles, a on-rails Orion Trail style travelling mechanic which takes place when going from one place to another, and a visual novel, ""choose-your-adventure book"" type of gameplay where the story and dialogue is presented to you and you have to make decisions to lead the game foward, decisions which can prove fortuitous or give you trouble. The problem and the biggest flaw of this game is the fact that it pretends that it is not linear. It constantly throws you game elements that tease you into a false sense of freedom - such as the battle system, which is the only part where the ""RPG"" element really takes place - like for example the map system, which shows you a richly detailed world with many places to go, but never giving you the choice to actively opt to travel to any of those places, but instead claustrophobically forcing you to follow a set trail from which you can never stray off (and from which you can't even go back - once you're going foward, there is no stopping). The resource system is quite simplistic, and the game ""money"" is only acquired in battle and is used for everything, including leveling up your characters. And to make it worse, it's in quite short supply, essencially robbing you with the pleasure of making your characters stronger in case you don't want to, you know, starve to death. This is where the Viking Trail element comes in - yes, you need food to feed your caravan. And not only it's difficult to find supplies, but you also lose them very easily, especially due to events that happen over which you have no control.The game also doesn't make clear what the advantage of having a large caravan even is.Now I have only played this game once, so I only know the extent to which choices matters from other people talking about it, but as far as I know, a lot of the choices don't actually change the story very significantly. Which can be kind of dishonest as it sabotages the feeling you get when first playing the game of you having crafted your own story.All in all, the game feels way too much like a book. A book where you sometimes play ""chess"" against, and a very good one at that, but still a book. But anyway, I really enjoyed playing it, and I appreciate the effort that went into it, so I'm giving it a positive review. But it could certainly be more of a ""game"", or at least be more honest about how much it isn't.			"

												TLDR: Banner Saga left me with an intense hunger for more, which is so much worse as the game is so awesome!If you like the Fire Emblem series, consider playing this game. It has some interesting takes on the tactical RPG genre, an awesome art style with beutiful scenery and rich characters. I found the story interesting and was especially impressed by the hardship and difficult choices of a refugee story arc. I was, however, also a little frustrated. The skill caps of your heros are very low, and I feel the leveling/customization choices  are quite limited. At least you get a lot of heros to try out but you don't get enough time and resources to explore them all very well. I also did not like that the narrative unnecessarily imposes that you play a certain character. Especially in a part, where Alette, a relatable girl, could easily be the main character you are forced into the role of Rook, her father, and have to decide her fate with some patronizing choices. And then the story ends very abruptly.			"

												The Banner Saga is an extraordinary game. Starting with the obvious, the landscapes and soundtrack are both breathtaking and plain epic. But what what really reeled me in, even more than the wonderful and immersive atmosphere, is the storyline. Twisted, and relying so very much on the player's choices. You often don't know where you're going, what to decide, whom you should trust or not, and must rely on your own judgement (often wrong !) and guts to advance. It is such a pleasure to feel like you're are actually choosing, or creating your own path rather than following the same patterns as always ; and it's not so often that a game really makes you think twice about a choice that will (maybe) haunt you until the end... The Banner Saga is really a refreshing creation, dark indeed, but beautiful nonetheless, and takes you in without mercy. I just finished it, and already want to discover all the other paths that lie ahead... I recommend it whole-heartedly !			"

												Although I wouldn't call the battle system equal or superior to the new Shadowrun titles or X-COM, the decision points you encounter as your caravan traverses the land give the title a unique and interesting flavor.  Every encounter can be a source of warriors, supplies, an item - but you may misplace your trust along the way.			"

												Fantastic game. I got it on sale after a D&D friend recommended I give it a whirl seeing as I rolled a Nordic barbarian.Beautiful backgrounds and artwork, engrossing storyline and great character design and development. The combat style takes a while to get used to, but it really pushes you to think tactically to take down the enemy. I understand why some people may not find the combat appealing, but everyone is different.In my opinion the only real downside was I got too attatched to some of the characters, and, well... I won't spoil anything.Protip: don't be so trusting of people.			"

												A true testament to the idea that games don't have to have amazing 3d graphics to be captivating visually. The Banner Saga has some of the most beautiful art I have ever seen in a video game, and with a fantastic soundtrack (which I can't get enough of), it's a great accomplishment. But that's not all at what this game excels, because it's RPG/tactic combat and difficult choices to make, are also something I strongly praise. However, even with such a great formula, I can't overlook the fact, that it feels rushed and incomplete. There are some rare moments of voice acted animated scenes, but only in the beginning, and are nowhere to be found even near the end of the game. Also in some parts of the game you just know that things were suppose to be much bigger, but due to some kind of constrains, they ended up as they are. Nonetheless, I enjoyed myself for the (too) short time I played The Banner Saga. I just hope the next installments are more complete products.			"

												Highly recommended. Great strategy game with an intriguing story. Been playing this with my non-gamer wife watching and helping me make the story decisions while I handle combat for the most part. 18 hours in  she's  telling me how to spec out the party and what to do each turn. Easy to get into but suprisingly deep while offering a lot of ambiguous choices with unforseeable consequences which can dramatically impact both the story and mechanical character progression/combat.Its not a game you can ace. It's a game where you have to live with the consequences of your choices, whatever they may be, and there isn't always a clear right or wrong decision for every situation.Did I mention it's gorgeous and the music is spectacular? Worth noting that it works well as a mouse-only game, making it a turn based strategy game that plays well on the TV from the couch. Most enjoyable turn-based strategy RPG I've played in a long time.			"

												Check out our full review at VGBlogger.com: http://www.vgblogger.com/discussion-review-the-banner-saga/25152/Parts of The Banner Saga feel incomplete or less fleshed out than they could have been, and in some cases outright and purposefully unforgiving in order to match the storyline's harsh tone and subject matter. But taken as a whole the experience is deeply fulfilling, thanks to well developed characters that you will actually care about and want to get to know, a narrative and game world of epic scope, and a tactically rich turn-based battle system that puts some smart twists on tradition. And what more can I say about the game's stunning artistry? Some of the cutscene portraits and landscape shots made me wish I could print them out and frame to hang on my wall, instead of only being able to capture them as screenshots to use for desktop wallpapers. If Disney or Rankin/Bass ever made a mature cel-animated movie about Vikings, it would probably look a whole lot like The Banner Saga.			"

												After completing this game once here's the best way to describe it:Breathtaking.Now I don't mean that in a lame metaphorical way specifically, but suffice it to say that there will be times where you will be caught completely off guard by the plot, and the fact that you had direct influence on it. I immediately started playing again, not for the sake of acheivements or even getting a ""best ending"" but just wanting to do things a little differently.I'm not really a connoiseur when it comes to music, but unlike other games I never listened to my own music on top of the game's.Visually this game is amazing. Boiled down, yea its a bunch of simply cycling illustrations, but those illustrations are brilliantly done, and never make you feel like you're watching some dumb gif loop. In line with that it is one of the only games I can play on my laptop's fan run like a jet engine, which is to say, it is in no way demanding for any computer to run.That said, assuming that the place where my first game ended is in fact the ending of the game, I think the loose ends did catch my attention. That didn't at all take away from the overall experience, and if anything it makes me think that they will (hopefully) be releasing a sequel, what with the girth of lore that was given to the game. Over your travels within the game you travel not even a fifth of the presented world, but it never feels like you're missing anuything. In actuality it just made me wish I could go farther, which is probably the right way for a game to make you feel.The combat is fantastic. I was amazed and enthralled with Factions, and the minor tweaks that were made to pre and during combat gameplay was done with this game in mind, not bending to any sort of predesigned border. Such a thrilling experience during every battle.A small thing that I really did appreciate was that RNG was in the hands of the player. Only by equipping certain items did RNG ever come into play, which is something I wish a lot of Tactical Strategy RPGs (or what have you) would do as well.TL;DR,A game with the smallest of blemishes that left me wanting more, 9.5/10			"

												I really loved playing this game, the story is engaging and even the smallest of choices feels as though it has meaning. The battle system takes a little getting used to (I kept failing to get my raned units within range of the enemy at first), but is very good. The story and choices are the main part of the game for me though, as they're more engaing than the battles. I definately agree wuth the comparison to GoT as you do feel characters may be killed off at any moment if you aren't careful.  One decision I actually decided to sleep on as I knew it would probably be a bit of a game changer and I was torn between two options.The only thing I would say is a big downside to the game is that it is the 1st part of a trilogy so the game stops very suddenly. The price and the descrition do not prepare you for this and some people may feel a bit ripped off by it as you aren't getting a full game. However I got it on sale so don't mind as much (although I am dying to know what happens next). I would say Steam should make a note of this being a ""Part 1"" so people know the emotional turmoil they will be in upon finishing the game.			"

												Although this is a great game, I am a little bit disapointed. I love the tactical part of this game and although I enjoyed the story and how it was told, there was too much reading (and I usually don't mind a good text adventure) and way too little tactical combat.I preferred the free ""The Banner Saga: Factions"" because of this, but I disliked that one because it is only online/multiplayer.I think what I miss in this game is a Factions-like, but single player experience.I don't think I will be buying part 2 & 3 (except maybe on big sale)Still, it's a good game, if you like a good story and are into the tactics, you should try it!

												""Choose your own adventure"" strategy game with Vikings, stunning graphics and an amazing soundtrack. The story unfolds brilliantly, although the beginning can be a bit confusing (There's a lot going on and it's not explained properly until later in the game).My only complain is about the battle mechanics, the combat is too slow and there's only one special skill per character class.A great game overall, totally worth it if you are looking for a different type of adventure game. In case you're more interested in the turn-based combat system I would recommend to try it first in The Banner Saga: Factions (it's F2P).			"

Playing similarly while being just as deep and as difficult to other famed turn-based tactical games of the past like Final Fantasy Tactics and/or Fire Emblem.

												Hello,I'm going to start off by saying that this is a beautiful game. By beautiful I mean soundtrack, artwork and story. It's really enjoyable and definitely worth playing. It has a very... ""Authentic"" feeling to it.Pros:Artwork - The artwork is beautifully drawn and everything is nicely animated. Even though a bit simple at times, even the simplicity of it all seems to blend in perfectly with everything.Music - The soundtrack is nice and gives off an appropriate vibe considering the setting, but it's not incredible. It's nice, really, but it could have been a bit more diverse.Story & Character development - The story and character development are amazing. Even though they have small flaws, everything seems somehow inevitable and most of the time you are basically doing everything to make the best out of an impossible situation. That's the real struggle. Doing the best you can - no matter how bad it is.The characters are nicely designed and some of them actually evolve in unexpected ways, even if they do scream cliché at times.Skills and attributes - These go hand to hand with their usability in combat (which I will explain below) and how much you really need to think about when you upgrade them.Combat - I assume that we've all seen this type of combat by now and its basics should come as no surprise to anyone. I like the general combat style, but what I love about it are some small touches that make it... Unique. Crippling the armour of an enemy is generally optional in games, but not here. No way. If you want to actually have a chance at slaying Dredge, then you really need to buff up your armor breaking. Also damaging an opponent will not only hurt them physically and take down their hp, but will also reduce the damage they do.I like the fact that the game forces you to weigh your decisions carefully, most of the time having to choose either damaging an opponent with a small burst for the moment or simply working your way until being able to constantly damage them for higher values.Cons:Voice acting - Although sometimes done well, a large part of the voice acting in the game could do with improving. Of course, it's understandable seeing how the actors were chosen and the fact that Stoic didn't exactly have an immense budget for this project.Decisions - This is the type of game which is, for the most part, story-driven. Generally the types of fans that play this type of game are the ones that expect their role and their decisions in the to be important. It is exactly the type of game from which fans expect every decision to be important and to have significant consequences. Don't get me wrong, they're important, obviously, but I wish that some of the decisions that ulteriorly end up with the same result to have some more depth to them. The fact that quite often anything you choose to do will lead you through the same events is not what bothers me. What bothers me is that the game is quite transparent about that and lets it off quite easily.Character leveling - I really think that they should have sticked to the standard form of leveling (Everyone who's still standing at the end of the fight will get exp), buuut they didn't. Instead you gain exp for dealing the killing blow on enemies. Normally that wouldn't be so bad, but it's just so much easier for some characters to get the kil than others, that it basically makes the process of leveling certain classes very, very difficult. There's always that one big guy, with the two-hander that comes in and beats the crap out of everything that's still standing.Equipment - Well, there's really not much I can say about the equipemnt section because it didn't actually stand out. I expected equipmented rooted into the lore of the game that can help an immense deal, but I actually got a lot of items which could situationally help... Somtimes. Some items are good, sure, but not really that much. The difference they make isn't all that noticeable if you spend your points properly.Conclusion:This is a great game, definitely worth buying if you enjoy your good ol' tacitacal turn-based. But it's more than that. It's actually a great buy if you simply enjoy a good story. Combat isn't all that difficult and it's easy to get into, even if it does, at times, get a bit tiring (I'm talking about you, people who want to try out every possible path and never want any characters to get knocked out.

												I absolutely loved this game, so simple and kind of reminds me of Hearthstone in the way that the Health/Armour works, although subtle differences.The artwork is pretty good although sometimes got a bit repetitive with all the snow, it made you unable to see most of the background other than the main path however when there was less snow it was beautiful atmosphere. Overall I love the cartoon feel to it.Enough of the graphics. The main thing I love about this game is the fact that the decisions you make, actually do have an effect. Not only that but it makes you think about what you want to say, Do you need another character? Do you need more suplies? What one should I choose to keep my character alive? Should I take a risk?All these questions I was asking myself as I progressed.However sometimes I felt that some decisions made no sense to me - personally - and that some were harsh as it sometimes causes some of the characters to die, it obviously has no effect on the story but it is annoying as you may have levelled that character to a high level and spent your XP points on him and then he is gone, seems like a waste.I also dislike the fact that one group of characters you get to play with are not as powerful as some of the other groups and I felt like some characters I was able to level up easier as they did more base damage, the ""archer"" type felt fairly useless in most circumstances as the space the ""Dredge"" can move is so great compared to the range of the arrows, it felt like a wasted character to me, they have low armour and low strength and it just did not gel with my preferred playstyle and also I felt like the Varl were FAR superior to the humans.However the storyline was interesting although fairly short, it also had me addicted for the 5-10 hours it lasted and I am on my second playthrough on a harder difficulty and choosing different options. It has replayability in that way.The final boss fight is extremely challenging and I enjoyed it thoroughly, with many retries, and many rages.Amazing animations in combat and although the Voice acting was scarce, it was effective when used. It could have been used more and there is A HELL OF A LOT OF READING, which I am fine with but you may not be. When speaking to people, it sometimes felt like it was drawn out and too much text but I liked it nonetheless. Requires patience.I would advise you to pick this game up, mainly if it is on sale. 100% worth $15 and less but I picked it up for $5 I think.An amazing game overall and I loved it so much while it lasted.

												Highly recommend this game for fans of tactical RPGs, or turn-based RPG combat in general. It makes some questionable design decisions at various points, but is well worth every cent of the asking price. (If you pick it up later on during a Steam sale, congratulations, you're winning.)Selling points: this is possibly amongst the most beautiful games I have ever played. Not in terms of ""graphical fidelity,"" of course, but the cel-shaded art style is extremely well-done all the way through and quite captivating. I would happily take games in this style over mainstream AAA titles living in the uncanny valley over and over again. My only complaint in this area is the extremely limited character animation during ""cutscene"" conversations; what is there simply serves to highlight how little there is. I probably wouldn't even have noticed if not for the few efforts they made on this front. (A very, VERY minor complaint, since the game is not relying on FMV-style, and even in still shots, the artwork is simply gorgeous)The tactical combat is engaging, and the mechanic which links a character's health to his damage output makes an otherwise simplistic system compelling (do I do limited damage against this enemy to lower the danger they bring, or reduce his armor to make my next turn that much more effective while risking him bringing the hurt in the interim?) and makes level-up decisions on characters agonizing. I went the route of ""specializing"" each character I used frequently, resulting in characters of similar class and starting stat reaching the end-game with vastly different skill sets (i.e. of the two archers I used every opportunity, one was the absolute best at knocking enemy armor out of the picture, while the other was a damage-and-willpower fiend who had my highest kill count by the last fight). Also, while I'm not huge on harping for realism in games, it has always somewhat annoyed me that characters with 1HP out of their 1,000 maximum were just as potent as at full health, and this is a nice way of remedying that.The story arc is compelling and kept me interested the whole way through without relying on many overdone tropes and archetypes, taking place in a very interesting setting I would happily p[ay to see more of. There is also quite a bit of background lore and information made easily accessible without forcing it to the forefront through excessive exposition, leaving its perusal to those willing to spend the time to enjoy it and letting those less interested mostly ignore it without detracting from the direct experience.The Renown system, which irritated me a great deal, but in a good way (as odd as that sounds). EVERYTHING in this game - level-ups, food for your tribe, items to supplement your heroes - is purchased with renown, which you gain from victory in battle as well as certain C&C moments in between. While it can be frustrating at times, after beating the game, I view it in a wholly positive light - rather than making something like EXP and Gold to be used for two separate purposes, incorporating both resource pools into one base stat increases the strategic element, and makes every expenditure that much more risky and demanding. I entered the final battle with three fully-leveled characters, and two weaker ones, simply because I had spent the renown necessary to do so along the way to ensure nobody in my caravan starved to death along the way. (Which can also say a lot about you as a person, I suppose, in terms of how you choose to spend it) At times, I would have preferred separate pools for the various resources, but only because it would have made my inherent min-maxing tendencies easier to oblige, and I cannot legitimately call out a design decision that increases complexity and the importance of a player's strategic choice.Detriments: the touted choice & consequence mechanic, while always nice to see, seems to mostly amount to extremely random and jarring consequences; each major decision seems to have one ""correct"" option which yields a positive outcome, and the negative consequences of ""incorrect"" decisions are never forewarned adequately, resulting in major impact up to and including losing substantial characters with absolutely no warning (on courses of action they themself recommend, even). Think the Witcher in terms of its unforseeability, but without the time delay or overall neutral tone which was par for the course in that game. (To be fair, there were a couple consequences - one VERY major one - which took half the game to  conclude and did have ample but not flagrant warning, so the game did this quite well in some instances, but failed in others)The combat never changes or develops in a significant way after the first battle outside of levelled-up abilities and new character classes with different special skills opening up different strategic options. What you see in the first battle is largely what you're going to get.In the combat mechanics, again, the game seems to settle in the middle; the endgame battles (especially the final boss) had me biting nails and languishing over every turn, and the beginning was not far removed, but I had comfortably established a routine throughout the middle half of the game which pretty much ensured I'd win any given battle ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥d-drunk with minimal unit injury in the process. A more level experience would be nice.A mechanic I rather like (linking health and damage output to the same attribute) has its flaw; in many situations, it is often tactically better to leave an enemy unit on the battlefield at very low HP rather than killing them outright. Due to the mechanic Il ike, their damage potential is next to nothing, but this goes against general gaming instinct and raises concerns in compliance with the point below...MIXED FEELINGS: the way the turn-based system is executed. Instead of some stat which addresses/influences initiative, the game will always go YOUR SIDE-ENEMY SIDE-YOUR SIDE-ENEMY SIDE until only one unit remains on either, at which point one side will execute all of its turns and then the other proceeds. On one hand, I like this to an extent, because it makes battles lopsided in terms of numbers not unwinnable; on the other hand, I think it's fairly backward in terms of a good mechanic; if it were kept the same throuh the last round, it would give that moment of despair when you haver one unit left against four an air of possibility, thinking if you execute well enough you can pull this situation out of the fire (or, conversely, keep you thinking your moves over in the last moments of a fight, as an enemy acting that quickly could turn your 4-1 advantage into a one-on-one exchange if you ♥♥♥♥ it up badly enough). While I do like the mechanic as a whole as opposed to the general turn-based style, it loses its punch with that particular element making the last few turns of any given fight a foregone conclusion when it could have served to bring each and every one down to the wire.ALL IN ALL: a very, very good game. I didn't catch this game's Kickstarter in time to contribute, but most likely would have, and do not at all regret spending full price for the experience once it released. I'm hoping it does well enough that multiple follow-ups/sequels are developed, so long as they equal or improve on the quality of the original. If you enjoy slower-paced games with combat more tactical and mindful than visceral and egoistic, this is a no-brain purchase that I wholeheartedly recommend. If Call of Duty is your favorite game series... 1. this is probably not for you; 2. please die as painfully as possible in a fire as soon as possible so as to possibly rectify the damage you have already done to the industry as a whole.

												I'm a fan of tactical games and RPGs; and this one did quite well on both accounts.  It managed to do so with an amazing live score, voice acting, and beautiful artwork to boot.  I came to really appreciate the characters and even became invested in them as was revealed by certain turns in the plot.  I like the mechanic pretty well, but compared to other tactics RPG's the options for fighting seem somewhat limited.The whole game isn't based around fighting, though.  A good portion of it is spent ""Oregon Trail""-style journeying across a landscape and making choices which affect the fate of your group.Highly recommended.			"

												This is a very hesitant thumbs up. See, what this page kinda neglects to mention is this is part one of a planned trilogy. I mean, I don't think I can verbally describe to you the look of ""what?"" on my face when the credits rolled just after what felt like the end of the first act. And while I don't generally mind multi-part stories, I think each game should at least have a satisfying self-contained story that ties in with the larger story. One series I like to point to on that is Harry Potter. Each book in that series has a self-contained story, but they also all tie in to the series-long story. This game... there's not much in the way of resolution by the end is what I'm saying. I guess in some ways that's a good thing, since if the game were much longer it would start to drag a bit, but... I just wish I'd known.Other than that, it's got a unique story, an interesting world, a unique visual style, the combat is decent (albeit a bit repetitive after a while), and I do genuinely think it's a good game; it just isn't a finished story.

												Only negative aspect i found in this marvellous game: it's lenght. Really way too short for such beatiful, well narrated story with such stunning visuals and sounds. Every single choice you make changes something, even if little; and there is so much to choose. The battles are hard and some tactics is needed. Enemies are evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that will ravage you. And if you lose the battle, the story will go on...unless you want to retry the whole chapter again. Your people will die if you choose to fight an hard battle, and so they'll die if your supplies aren't enough or simply you make bad decisions when out in the wild. They will either respect you if you prove to be a valorous leader, or pity and despise you if you only think about yourself. And this changes everything about how the story goes on.Harsh environment for a strong story, with quality narration and a mature theme. 7/10 for me, the 8-9 hours lenght really killed it. For such a masterpiece i expected like 20-30 gameplay hours atleast.			"

												Freaking loved this game. (And who doesn't love vikings?)It has a great story and quite an unique art style. People tend to forget how immersive animation can be in both video games and movies/series, I mean.. How often do you see an animated game these days? While you are travelling the land with your caravan you'll never get bored of the background.. it so addicting to watch at, same goes for your caraven which increases in size in time.. it is kind of satisfying seeing all those people march with you upfront.The music is incredible nicely song and again.. immersive, I did notice a lack off of it while travelling with the caravan sometimes though. But beautiful nonetheless it grabs all the dangerous and emotional moments.Choices are rather important in the story.. If you make a certain choice one of your hero characters can suddenly betray you or your army gets sick by picking fruit from certain trees. Also don't let too many people join your caravan no matter how nice it might seem. (You will run out of supplies and most of them will starve to death!)The combat gameplay itself isn't that impressive but.. It's fun and can be very difficult (depening on your difficulty ofcourse).I would certainly recommend this game to those who love good story telling, characters and immersion.			"

												This game is essentially The Oregon Trail, but with a Nordic fantasy theme and a rudimentary turn-based combat system akin to Final Fantasy Tactics or X-Com (but with substantially less depth). The art style is refreshing, and the lovingly crafted world is enjoyable to immerse in for a while. Unfortunately, it is a very short while; most players will find themselves wanting more content after the final battle. Buy the game if it is on sale for less than $20 and I suspect you will feel rewarded by the purchase. In my opinion, the $25 price point is just a bit too high for the amount of gameplay you get.I sincerely hope that a sequel is in the works; one with a hundred hours of gameplay and a more robust combat system. This is a world I'd like to inhabit again.			"

												Through its amazingly beautiful artworks, The Banner Saga unfolds its story before your eyes like a good book: It doesn't explain you everything firsthand, or spoil its world with ""explanations for dummies"" of why this story and where is what. No, it treats you as an intelligent reader (rather, gamer) and only leads you by hints, letting your imagination to fill the gaps between the narrative, like in a proper novel. Although you are not quite sure where the story is going, you know it's epic, desperate, and at the same time, contains enough rays of hope that let you long for your characters to reach peace and a better day. True, from a pure gaming perspective, although clever, its mechanics stay very simple, and could be seen as repetitive. But you don't want to win every battle out of cleverness, to ""beat the game"". You want to win them so that maybe, hopefully, this will save more of your clansmen, fighters and varls. Because the story infuses you with empathy for its likeable and complex characters, offers you few but tough choices, you end up really carring for them, not because you have level them up, but because of who they are: Rook, Alette, Iver, and all the others, struggling to survive, being doubtfull about their (yours !) decisions, hoping they will reach a happy ending.The Banner Saga is quite a unique game, because it manages something very hard to reach with this media: It conveys emotions.I can understand it's not a journey for everyone, but it definitely transported me...

												After completing this game once here's the best way to describe it:Breathtaking.Now I don't mean that in a lame metaphorical way specifically, but suffice it to say that there will be times where you will be caught completely off guard by the plot, and the fact that you had direct influence on it. I immediately started playing again, not for the sake of acheivements or even getting a ""best ending"" but just wanting to do things a little differently.I'm not really a connoiseur when it comes to music, but unlike other games I never listened to my own music on top of the game's.Visually this game is amazing. Boiled down, yea its a bunch of simply cycling illustrations, but those illustrations are brilliantly done, and never make you feel like you're watching some dumb gif loop. In line with that it is one of the only games I can play on my laptop's fan run like a jet engine, which is to say, it is in no way demanding for any computer to run.That said, assuming that the place where my first game ended is in fact the ending of the game, I think the loose ends did catch my attention. That didn't at all take away from the overall experience, and if anything it makes me think that they will (hopefully) be releasing a sequel, what with the girth of lore that was given to the game. Over your travels within the game you travel not even a fifth of the presented world, but it never feels like you're missing anuything. In actuality it just made me wish I could go farther, which is probably the right way for a game to make you feel.The combat is fantastic. I was amazed and enthralled with Factions, and the minor tweaks that were made to pre and during combat gameplay was done with this game in mind, not bending to any sort of predesigned border. Such a thrilling experience during every battle.A small thing that I really did appreciate was that RNG was in the hands of the player. Only by equipping certain items did RNG ever come into play, which is something I wish a lot of Tactical Strategy RPGs (or what have you) would do as well.TL;DR,A game with the smallest of blemishes that left me wanting more, 9.5/10			"

												Where do I start with this game. Well...it's amazing.The art and animation are beautiful, story is book worthy, and this is one of the rare games I've played where choices actually matter. I think of this as part Fire Emblem and part Oregon Trail. Fighting is turn based and requires a good deal of strategy as when to take off enemy armor or go straight for their health as well when to use your characters abilities. In the overworld you need to make sure you have enough supplies to get you from city to city and along the way events will happen from thieves stealing supplies to possible permanent character death. The same points you use to buy supplies are used to upgrade you heroes. Do you use the points to make your fighters better or do you buy supplies so that you can get to the next city? I had moments while playing where I felt acutal despair as I watched my supplies run dry hoping that maybe I could find some more supplies from an event and cursing myself for using to many points to upgrade units.Did I mention the art? Oh I did...WELL IT'S FREAKING GREAT!Though I only saw one animated cutscene in the game just watching your caravan walk across the plains and seeing beautiful mountains at your back. The God Stones with their elaborate designs that also give you a little insight to the lore of the world. The in-fight animations are also very good and I think there's something really cool about the way the magic looks in the game. I think this game was worth shelling out $25 but hey that's just me. With all of the choices you can make in the game I'm very willing to do a second playthrough on a harder difficulty.			"

												Raise your banners it's the saga... The Banner Saga.This game... There aren't a lot of fantasy settings that really get me, but this one was one of the few. It's a kind of desolate, nordic setting with some focus on a few political aspects. Love it.The game has a special art style which wasn't really my thing, but nevertheless very thorough and unique, it has a strong focus on story, but not in your typical fashion, and has a strategic HOMM/XCOM-like battle system with RPG features, like individual character levels, skills and Items.If you want about 8-12 hours of story-driven gameplay with a pretty good but not amazing combat system, this is a really good choice and the release price wasn't extremely expensive.

												Amazing game. It's like a cross between a turn-based tactical RPG like Final Fantasy Tactics or Shining Force, and King of the Dragon Pass. Basically, there's quite a bit of combat (which would be the FF Tactics bit), but between them you have a ton of story-based and random events that requite you to make a ton of (at times really, really tough) choices. The actual story is very good, although it's rather bleak (which is a perfect fit for the Viking setting, of course).Add to that a suberb art design, composed of breathtaking traditional 2D art like I've never seen before in a computer game; and a fantastic soundtrack, and you've got yourself a truly amazing game. It's not flawless, though: while some of those flaws (like lack of full voice acting) are completely understandable, given Stoic's small size, others (like the lack of subtitles, or being forced to replay the last five hours of gameplay due to some decision you took waaaay back that now means game over for you) are not. But even with these flaws the game is still a gem, totally worth the two years Stoic took to develop it since the game's Kickstarter campaign was funded in 2012.			"

The story is engrossing and revolves around a march to save your kinsmen from danger.  You lean to care about the people in your caravan, which make some of the decisions you have to make very difficult.  Although, this also gives the game a lot of replay value, as you strive to make better decisions, and protect more people in your caravan.  Decisions are more than just choosing when to fight, or dialogue choices; when it comes down to it the entire game is a decision of how best to spend your resources.  Do you buy supplies for your caravan to help you get to the next area? OR upgrade your combat team? Or buy items to have your combat team? They each use the same resource, so you have to decide where to put your limited resource.  Even choosing how often and when to rest effects gameplay.The combat is isometric turn-based, and involves a lot of strategy, and can at times, be surprisingly challenging.  There are three game modes, to provide more or less challenge to the player.  Hard mode being very challenging indeed.Overall an enjoyable experience that will leave you wanting more.  As soon as I finished the game, I began researching if there was to be a sequel, and I was pleased to hear the play is for this game to be part of a trilogy.Definitely worth playing, and highly recommended.

												If you're a fan of tactical strategy games, this is more than worth your time.  The grid-based fights are different from anything else I've played in the genre, tying your remaining health to your ability to do damage, incentivizing keeping your party in good health.  There's a real emphasis on fighting against a team, as a team, and once you start to hang back and create opportunities the strategic depth really shines through.The heroes/caravan/item system strung on top of the combat is well put together and systemized in a fun way, harkening back a bit to things like the Oregon trail.  There seems to be a number of decision points strung through the story that can create some interesting divergences, resulting in losing/gaining new heroes, as well as the permanent death of major characters. The animation style of the game is fantastic, 2d artwork in the style of say, old Ralph Bakshi movies from the 70s and 80s.  It's a fairly unique look for a game in this genre.  Music is fantastic, by the always on point Austin Wintory.Definitely worth your time.			"

												Banner Saga is starkly beautiful and moving and has an interesting combat system. It is a lot like Oregon Trail for sad vikings and horned giants. You will be forced to make tough decisions about who lives and dies, and who will be remembered as a hero or a villain. It is however, quite short and has zero replay value. Understand that you are buying a one-time beautiful experience and be satisfied with that.			"

												The Banner Saga ranks as one of my favorite games of all time. The reluctant viking themed universe makes me giddy and jump at the chance of learning more about the lore of The Banner Saga. While there is no actual audio dialogue except in the intro, the game really allows your mind to wanter and the art and graphics of the game are amazingly beautiful. Gameplay is almost like chess and once you get to the hardest difficulty, stratagy and character choice are imperitive to your success. Amazing game, recommended to anyone who enjoys this style or the immersive story telling.			"

												Probably one of the best looking games I’ve ever played. I wish these guys could make an animated full length film, it’s just gorgeous.

												First of all, I loved it. I think it is one of the most beautful games I ever played with immersive story where you constantly make tough decisions. And it gets emotional. Not many games have that. So my biased rating is 10/10. It was just the perfect mix for me. I love tactical turn-based combat and story driven games.Objectively, Banner saga is just ""choose your own adventure"" book with turn-based combat in x-com or fallout fashion on small simple maps. Reading other comments it is clearly not for everyone. Do not buy it just for the combat part. The good stuff is in the dialogues and atmosphere.			"

												Though this game is not perfect, i had a blast playing it;-Amazing Visual Style-Enthralling story (as you would expect form this developer), choices that matter even though sometimes they feel a bit unfair-Very unique resource system where you have to balance buying supplies, items and upgrades-Decent combat, i honestly found it to be a little simplistic but you definitely have to be careful where you place your units or they can get 1 hit-Hard(?) - Actually didn't have a very difficult time on medium difficulty until the final sequence, which was absolutely impossible given the choices i made and the characters i had upgraded. Had to switch to easy for this. Cant even imagine hard difficulty for this fight.Overall, I had great time with this game and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fun story-driven strategy game.			"

												The game is simply fabulous. A rare mix of a tactical combat with equal dose of text adventuring, where both parts are most interesting by themselves and manyfold so due to their interaction. Tactical combat is an exquisite work of visual gaming art by itself, a rare case when out of elegance of simplicity a stunning complexity of battle is wrought. Adventuring part is equally a first-rate experience, where the most innocent (or well-intentioned) decision may lead to disastrous consequences, and sometimes vice-versa. And, last not least, all of it set with lovingly (and as for me, also breathtakingly) made CG.Also, it is very reminiscing of a much older game with many similar moments (including somewhat similar nordic setting) - King of Dragon Pass[en.wikipedia.org], which I recommend to anyone who liked Banner Saga.

												Beware, you haven't known crushing despair until you've played this.It's actually a pretty amazing game, beautifully designed with an innovative combat system.The difficult choices you make are the defining feature. It does really well at building connection with the characters, then forces you to make decisions that can have gut-wrenching consequences. The plot twists are frequent, unpredictable and unforgiving.I'd heard mixed reviews, so didn't try it out until a sale. There's some valid points made against it, but overall its a well polished game especially for the price. It's worthwhile just as a really beautifully told story, but the turn based combat is fun and challening too. I hope they add DLC or a whole new chapter.			"

Final Rating: At $5.00 or less, 10/10. At $12.00, 6/10This is a great story-driven game. Combat is easy to learn but still requires some skill/strategy on normal difficulties. Beautiful artwork and pretty good music (especially during pivotal scenes.) My only gripes are a huge diffuculty spike during one fight in the game, and that only a tiny portion of the game has voice acting. Also, some of the choices you make seem wise but may have arbitrary/unintended negative consequences. Your party will only die through story events, not combat, and it can be frustrating to have your best fighter killed in a freak yox stampede because you chose not to let the traitorous yox herdsman live a few miles back. Overall a great game if you can get it on a good sale.			"

												Having just finished The Banner Saga, I'm simply in awe by its majestic, epic, sensitive, mournful, and haunting atmosphere that is conjured up and served to you by skillful writing, thoughful, believable characters, and gameplay that will lead you to test the tactician you always knew you secretly are. The art deserves an extra mention; I'm inclined to think the old-school 2D animation is able to capture character and spirit in a unique way. Don't forget to entertain yourself with the soundtrack, ""We are all guests upon the land"" is my favorite.Praise aside, the game could have used a hefty chunk more of the talented well-picked voice actors. Some cutscenes loose their edge because of it, but it does little to hinder the overall wonderfully positive experience.			"

												the Banner Saga does a good job capturing a nordic spirit: it's beautiful but harsh, and really soul-crushing at times.besides having to manage your caravan so everybody doesn't die, the game puts a somewhat different spin on the usual turn-based combat mechanics: armor has to be worn down before decent hp damage can be done, and hitpoints double as the attack strength characteristic. additionally, willpower lets characters push themselves further and execute special attacks depending on their class. it works well but can be a litte unforgiving of mistakes, tactics are important.the decisions you have to make outside of combat are harsh as well - things that look like they worked out fine at first can turn around to bite you in the ♥♥♥ later, and that includes character progression. the return of those points you spent on your hero isn't that great if they're dead or gone... you might start second-guessing a lot, but you won't really be safer for it. which makes for a rather captivating if depressing story.I really liked the art, and the soundtrack adds nicely to the atmosphere, becoming more prominent when it is fitting.the overarching story is interesting and makes numerous references to a rich lore - too bad that answers aren't something you'll get. this is part of what makes the rather abrupt ending somewhat unsatisfying, sadly one of the Banner Saga's weaker points. still...it's not a perfect game, but I'd definitely recommend it!

												This game puts off an Illusion of making choices that have real consequences but once you have played threw the game once, you realize that the game is more about reading forums and faqs to find the exact course threw the game because it’s a ♥♥♥♥ shoot otherwise. You could do everything right and the next move you could literally be starving your caravan to death. Not that that makes any difference because the amount of people you have with you means nothing to the game. The very few full scale battles you get into are staged because you haven’t gotten to a point where you could have lost members of your caravan.Being able to purchase items is also a joke because if you care about your people even in the slightest bit then you will just be using your renown to buy supplies and leveling up your characters, who just wind up dying off at the slightest whim anyways. Ill mention Egil as an example and I know that it’s supposed to be an achievement to keep him alive, but really? Is the life of people just a joke/game? How can I possibly create a bond with anyone when their lives are so trivial?I don’t know about you but I can’t stand games that are intentionally impossible to play for the casual player. I’m just saying that if you want to have any sort of success at this game, it is impossible to do so without some sort of walkthrough. Oh by the way, loved the combat, music and scenery. "

												Do you feel like playing an RPG that can punish or reward you for every single moral decision you ever make? Are you prepared to redefine what you consider ""moral"" as your mental and strategic mettle are put the the test constantly? And finally, can you handle the emotional consequences of your actions as you struggle to balance the needs of keeping yourself, your party, and the rest of your caravan alive?Banner Saga puts the questions to the test as you traverse through a gorgeous, norse mythological world...albeit on the run from dire enemies all the while. The game is fantastic overall, despite the rather monotonous and somewhat flawed battling system (e.g., an odd turn-based system that alternates your turn and the enemies every time; thus, even if you have 6 members alive and they have only 2, they still get to go multiple times while your characters only get to go once in turn). However, the real appeal is essentially the entire story itself: It is full of twists and turns, celebrations and mourning, and heart-wrenching choices through every step along the way. And the music! Oh, the music is simply some of the most aesthetically pleasing sounds you will ever hear; fitting seamlessly throughout the gameplay.This game is only part one of several (out of a total of three I believe that are in development), so pick it up now while you have the chance (and when it is on sale of course!). I believe this game cuts a well-earned 9 Varl (Viking) axes out of 10 Dredge heads. If you have any questions for me about the game, please leave a comment on this review and I will be happy to try to answer them.			"

												Usually, whenever things go wrong in a game that offers multiple-choice decisions, I tend to reload and pick a better option. And while I did succumb to that a few times in this game, for the most part I didn't, even when my decisions had really tragic consequences. Because that would have felt like a violation of the game's aesthetic of despair, loss, and hard choices.In fact, I do not even intend to replay this game. Don't get me wrong: it is a fantastic game, which would deserve a replay. I expect to make some of my friends sit down in front of it and play it while I watch.But I, personally, will not be replaying this game. The choices I made in it are what they are. As a consequence of my decisions, many characters died, and many characters survived. To play the game again, to change some of those choices, would feel disrespectful for all those who died, as well as to all those who survived.No other game has made me feel like this.			"

												Only negative aspect i found in this marvellous game: it's lenght. Really way too short for such beatiful, well narrated story with such stunning visuals and sounds. Every single choice you make changes something, even if little; and there is so much to choose. The battles are hard and some tactics is needed. Enemies are evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that will ravage you. And if you lose the battle, the story will go on...unless you want to retry the whole chapter again. Your people will die if you choose to fight an hard battle, and so they'll die if your supplies aren't enough or simply you make bad decisions when out in the wild. They will either respect you if you prove to be a valorous leader, or pity and despise you if you only think about yourself. And this changes everything about how the story goes on.Harsh environment for a strong story, with quality narration and a mature theme. 7/10 for me, the 8-9 hours lenght really killed it.

												I really liked that game. Firstly, its graphic stlye and musics are really good. (I am listening it's soundtracs when im working.) But its a pretty hard game, and your decisions can change your fate. For example a choice in a conversation can let one of your hero die. And some you need some specific heroes if you want to use different tactics. Also you need to calculate your meterials to fed your people etc. so you always need to think carefully before act. Especially in harder modes. its not like some RTS or other popular strategy games. Maybe some people dont like that gaming and graphic style, but it looks very special and rich to me. Especially when you think today's popular games...			"

												I love this game. It's a fairly unique fantasy that deals with tactical war and hard decisions. I got really hooked on some of the characters, I liked that I felt so involved with them. Some of the decisions are hard. It makes you wonder what you would do in their situation. The game has a great replay value and I can't wait to play it again to see what happens differently.			"

												The Banner Saga is genuine art in the way it presents the environment and characters wonderfully on screen. The combat system is not too flashy at all; very basic with a couple touches of effects. Characters do not speak, but for a game like this I had more fun reading their dialogues and imagining what they sound like. TBS is like The Lord of the Rings, but it stands on its own merit.

												An interesting and action-packed story, dialogue options which determine multiple possible fates, turn-based combat, and superb artistic direction make this a 'must have' RPG. True, 'upgrade' options can be narrow (max ranks of 5 levels) and the gameplay challenging, but difficulty can be moderated, and the limitations in skill-improving actually make this a more sensible game of strategy than a random hack-and-slash. Caravan management uses an economy of ‘renown’ (gained in battles) rather than coin to purchase supplies, upgrade characters, and buy items. This is a single-player game with no co-op or multiplayer options, but there is a ranked match version available for those who wish to purchase their way into games (Banner Sage: Factions). For $25 US you can expect to play the game through at least a few times and get your 'money's worth', but I would more fully recommend purchase of this game for $20 or less. 8.5/10 Gunjhars, with points being lost only for a lack of length and depth of world (fingers-crossed for an open-world version!) :D><			"

												Amazing game. It's like a cross between a turn-based tactical RPG like Final Fantasy Tactics or Shining Force, and King of the Dragon Pass. Basically, there's quite a bit of combat (which would be the FF Tactics bit), but between them you have a ton of story-based and random events that requite you to make a ton of (at times really, really tough) choices. The actual story is very good, although it's rather bleak (which is a perfect fit for the Viking setting, of course).Add to that a suberb art design, composed of breathtaking traditional 2D art like I've never seen before in a computer game; and a fantastic soundtrack, and you've got yourself a truly amazing game. It's not flawless, though: while some of those flaws (like lack of full voice acting) are completely understandable, given Stoic's small size, others (like the lack of subtitles, or being forced to replay the last five hours of gameplay due to some decision you took waaaay back that now means game over for you) are not. But even with these flaws the game is still a gem, totally worth the two years Stoic took to develop it since the game's Kickstarter campaign was funded in 2012.			"

												Raise your banners it's the saga... The Banner Saga.This game... There aren't a lot of fantasy settings that really get me, but this one was one of the few. It's a kind of desolate, nordic setting with some focus on a few political aspects. Love it.The game has a special art style which wasn't really my thing, but nevertheless very thorough and unique, it has a strong focus on story, but not in your typical fashion, and has a strategic HOMM/XCOM-like battle system with RPG features, like individual character levels, skills and Items.If you want about 8-12 hours of story-driven gameplay with a pretty good but not amazing combat system, this is a really good choice and the release price wasn't extremely expensive. My biggest complaints are the length and that I want a sequel to delve further into this fantasy world.			"

												The Banner Saga is an excellent turn-based RPG, where decisions you make affect the outcome of the story and changes the lives of the games characters.  The story is engrossing and revolves around a march to save your kinsmen from danger.  You lean to care about the people in your caravan, which make some of the decisions you have to make very difficult.  Although, this also gives the game a lot of replay value, as you strive to make better decisions, and protect more people in your caravan.  Decisions are more than just choosing when to fight, or dialogue choices; when it comes down to it the entire game is a decision of how best to spend your resources.  Do you buy supplies for your caravan to help you get to the next area? OR upgrade your combat team? Or buy items to have your combat team? They each use the same resource, so you have to decide where to put your limited resource.  Even choosing how often and when to rest effects gameplay.The combat is isometric turn-based, and involves a lot of strategy, and can at times, be surprisingly challenging.  There are three game modes, to provide more or less challenge to the player.  Hard mode being very challenging indeed.Overall an enjoyable experience that will leave you wanting more.  As soon as I finished the game, I began researching if there was to be a sequel, and I was pleased to hear the play is for this game to be part of a trilogy.Definitely worth playing, and highly recommended.

												If you're a fan of tactical strategy games, this is more than worth your time.  The grid-based fights are different from anything else I've played in the genre, tying your remaining health to your ability to do damage, incentivizing keeping your party in good health.  There's a real emphasis on fighting against a team, as a team, and once you start to hang back and create opportunities the strategic depth really shines through.The heroes/caravan/item system strung on top of the combat is well put together and systemized in a fun way, harkening back a bit to things like the Oregon trail.  There seems to be a number of decision points strung through the story that can create some interesting divergences, resulting in losing/gaining new heroes, as well as the permanent death of major characters. The animation style of the game is fantastic, 2d artwork in the style of say, old Ralph Bakshi movies from the 70s and 80s.  It's a fairly unique look for a game in this genre.  Music is fantastic, by the always on point Austin Wintory.Definitely worth your time.			"

												Banner Saga is starkly beautiful and moving and has an interesting combat system. It is a lot like Oregon Trail for sad vikings and horned giants. You will be forced to make tough decisions about who lives and dies, and who will be remembered as a hero or a villain. It is however, quite short and has zero replay value. Understand that you are buying a one-time beautiful experience and be satisfied with that.			"

												I didn't actually beat this game yet, but it's damn good. Think the Oregon trail meets Game of Thrones meets an actually good game, and you get this one. A lot of games talk about trying to make all your decisions matter, and a lot of games say they do, but in the end it simply doesn't feel like your actions really matter. Banner Saga is probably the only game I've played where I felt like it was true. When I need to make a decision in-game and someone dies, I feel like their blood is legitimately on my hands. Sometimes the only ones that die are nameless clansmen, and, honestly, that doesn't affect the game much, but one time I made the decision of trusting the wrong guy, and one of my best combatants, a centerpiece of my offense, was just straight up killed. From what I've seen so far (because I've started playing the game twice), the main plot doesn't change, there are no grand branching paths far as I've seen, but you definitely feel the weight of responsibility as decisions constantly have you weighing morality vs. personal survival, risk vs. chance of reward, and sometimes just posing a genuine question of morality. (Choices? 10/10. Your move, AAA studios)Now, without the choices, how about the story itself? The world is nicely built, the story is compelling, the characters are interesting, and there are some really good quotes. It gets trippy as hell, though. Like I said earlier, I never beat the game, so I can't attest to the quality of the ending.(Story? 8.75/10. Worthwhile.)Now that we got this girly nonsense talk about ""story"" out of the way, let's talk about combat. The real men's subject. It's a grid-based, turn-based rpg system, but instead of attacking you decide whether to strike armor or strength. Each does a thing we're not getting into now. How does this effect the gameplay? Enough to distinguish itself. It definitely gives a unique feel, and the tactical question of ""Should I attack strength or Armor?"" rarely has an obvious answer. So it adds a layer to strategy. It's not necessarily ground-breaking, but it adds a little spice. (Combat? 8/10: can't complain; pretty good) It adds just the right amount of spice, really. A classy amount. The Banner Saga is lIke something from a fancy resturant. Just don't actually eat there because the waiter poisons people at random.Overall: 9/10 I would easilly recommend this game to any strategy player, and some non-strategy players.			"

												Simply one of the most beautiful games I've ever played. The music, the art, the writing, the worldbuilding, it's all flawless. The story is deep and meaningful, full of emotional weight that never feels cheap or easy. The decisions I made had a direct impact on events in the game, and I really felt for the characters that I lost.The only issue I have is that the game is incredibly short. I'm more than happy to pay for The Banner Saga 2 - I love the game, and I'm attached to the characters and world and want to know what happens - but when the credits rolled I was a little shocked that the game was already over. I felt like I was just getting started, that the story was beginning to pick up and that I'd just hit the first major milestone in the game. But the first major milestone was the end, and now I'm forced to spend more money to play on (which, again, I'm happy to do, but I'm not a fan of this model). Overall I'd highly recommend this - just be aware that there are only a few hours of gameplay here.(EDIT: Having just posted this review I now see that I completed the game in 7 hours. It honestly feels a lot shorter than that. Knowing that it's longer than I remember means I'm less disappointed by the length, and more impressed by how immersed I was in this world while playing.)

												Generally, these are not the types of games I play, but after more than one person recommended it I decided to check it out. There are good points and bad ones to this game as there are with any, here are my general observations. First the good:- Game lasted longer than I anticipated- Animation was beautiful- Music was great- Difficulty levels were appropriate- Overall game play was entertainingThe bad:- Story ended abruptly and was somewhat anticlimactic - Regardless of your choices it forces you on a very obviously predetermined path- The story was weaker than it should be for this genre- Combat can get very dull and repetitive- Actual time playing is short (vs. watching the clan march around or clicking through dialogue)- Price is a bit steep for this kind of gameNot a bad start though for a newcomer indie company. Worth picking up during the steam sale if you are into turn based RPG type games.80/100			"

												Simply excellent.  A well crafted tale of sorrow, suffering, and sacrifice.  The unique visual style and easy playing controls help the narrative flow easily in a game more geared towards your decision making (and living with the consequences of those decisions) than fast reflexes or crafty maneuvers.  At its core, the game takes many classic RPG tropes and turns them on their head.  Expect to be forced to make a choice between two or more bad options and to have it cost the characters the writers are so good at making you care about.Well worth the buy, I hope to see more work from the same developers in the future!

												Achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s:This is not an easy game to get 100% completion (took me around 90 hrs.). However, it is easy to get half of the achievements, give or take, with one playthrough. It took me around 6+ playthroughs to get all of the achievements (I did NOT plan it out well), and some of them are pretty tough when doing the hard mode ones.Updated Review (07/2016):This game is worth buying if you like dark-themed, turn-based, and linear RPGs, but keep in mind some possible CONS: -The game is fairly short for an RPG (taking my time, I beat the game in 13 hours on normal difficulty for my first playthrough). -It has an abrupt and unresolved ending as it is episodic (The Banner Saga 2 continues the story but doesn’t finish it yet).-It is not an open world if that is what you are looking for—it is linear with auto saves (you cannot choose where and when to save, although each auto save has its own save to access if you want to try something different or screw up).-The game has a lot of reading involved (you rarely hear a person speak). In fact, this plays out similar to a point-and-click choices count story, but the turn-based fights in-between reading provide excellent strategic game play that typical point-and-click games do not.With that said, many PROS to the game include:-The story is dark but creative and refreshing with a unique feel and well-developed characters (be prepared to laugh, curse, and possibly cry). -The dialogue and choices are often entertaining and feel realistic for the setting (the little bit of voice acting in the game is excellent). -The art and score are beautiful. -The game play/turn-based fights are addictive, and the fights even get a little challenging on the normal setting (I cursed at my monitor A LOT on hard mode, but I also like the challenge). The game is worth multiple plays not only for achievements, but to also try out different choices as they can have a fairly large impact on the story that can transfer to the second game (The Banner Saga 2 gives you the option to continue your saves from the first game). Even though I have completed all of the achievements and played the game many times, I will probably play the game again. :]			"

												(Disclaimer: The following review was done before playing the sequel(s) and is exclusively pertinent to it.)Banner Saga is the first chapter in a series that weaves nordic mythology and aesthetic with an interesting unique fantasy world that is quite apocalyptic in tone. It mixes tactical RPG elements with a survival ""on-rails"" traveling mechanic (the term ""viking orion trail"" describes it quite well), both dictated ultimately by a visual novel ""choice-based"" gameplay structure.This game's strongest qualities are by far its brilliantly crafted artistic elements: Story, graphics and music. The graphics are wonderful and seeing traditional hand-drawn 2d animation in a world where 3d animation is the norm is refreshing. The backgrounds are inspired by artist Eyvind Earle (they even named a character after him) and are quite breathtaking. The music sounds quite authentic in its attempts to complement its theme, as it mixes elements of traditional nordic folk music (with singing), and is very well composed and was recorded in an actual orchestra which brings it to a whole new level. The story is quite interesting and in parts quite brutal. The worldbuilding is well done and pulls you in quite intensely - though it feels a bit narrow in its scope, lacking a bit of cultural and political diversity at times. As for the plot, there are definately some ""game of thronesy"" ruthlessness (minus the outward adult elements to it), feeling like you're never really safe and anything can happen - except perhaps for some degree of ""plot armor"" that perhaps can't be avoided when you're writing a protagonist-driven narrative.Now for the gameplay, which is where the real faults of this game unfortunately lie:As I said before there are three elements that compose this game: A tactical RPG element that takes place in battles, a on-rails Orion Trail style travelling mechanic which takes place when going from one place to another, and a visual novel, ""choose-your-adventure book"" type of gameplay where the story and dialogue is presented to you and you have to make decisions to lead the game foward, decisions which can prove fortuitous or give you trouble. The problem and the biggest flaw of this game is the fact that it pretends that it is not linear. It constantly throws you game elements that tease you into a false sense of freedom - such as the battle system, which is the only part where the ""RPG"" element really takes place - like for example the map system, which shows you a richly detailed world with many places to go, but never giving you the choice to actively opt to travel to any of those places, but instead claustrophobically forcing you to follow a set trail from which you can never stray off (and from which you can't even go back - once you're going foward, there is no stopping). The resource system is quite simplistic, and the game ""money"" is only acquired in battle and is used for everything, including leveling up your characters. And to make it worse, it's in quite short supply, essencially robbing you with the pleasure of making your characters stronger in case you don't want to, you know, starve to death. This is where the Viking Trail element comes in - yes, you need food to feed your caravan. And not only it's difficult to find supplies, but you also lose them very easily, especially due to events that happen over which you have no control.The game also doesn't make clear what the advantage of having a large caravan even is.Now I have only played this game once, so I only know the extent to which choices matters from other people talking about it, but as far as I know, a lot of the choices don't actually change the story very significantly. Which can be kind of dishonest as it sabotages the feeling you get when first playing the game of you having crafted your own story.All in all, the game feels way too much like a book. A book where you sometimes play ""chess"" against, and a very good one at that, but still a book. But anyway, I really enjoyed playing it, and I appreciate the effort that went into it, so I'm giving it a positive review. But it could certainly be more of a ""game"", or at least be more honest about how much it isn't.			"

												First of all, this is such a beautiful game. The art direction is fantastic and very memorable. I have played many games where developers claim that 'your decisions affect the overall game'. This is a very bold statement and most games never truly live up to it. The Banner Saga more than lives up to this statement. The story is brutal and the gameplay can be unforgiving (in a good way), which only adds to its charm. In a time where developers will often play it safe and produce what is sure to sell, The Banner Saga is an absolute breath of fresh air. What I found most interesting about this game was the world, lore and its characters. It's deep and very well structured. It truly feels like an epic journey and when tragedy does strike it's often a very powerful moment. I can't wait to experience more games within this saga. 100% recommended.			"

												I was engrossed from beggining to end. The Banner Saga delivers an engaging story, amazing bee-you-tee-ful art, and turn-based combat goodness amid an original and interesting setting/lore.As the game starts, an ancient race of stone men that have mostly kept to themselves for centuries, are coming from the north en masse, killing, maiming and destroying. Thus, you are forced to leave your viking hunter-gatherer days behind and start a haphazard perigrination carrying your banner and leading your caravan. As you move on, you will be forced to make difficult decisions, manage supplies/people/morale and battle when necessary (or unavoidable).Along the way, events will arise and you'll be faced with tough decisions. This is not Mass Effect 3 where you just choose in which way you kick ♥♥♥ even though the galaxy is supposedly being extinguished... here the severity of the situation means you'll be time and again counting your loses and licking your wounds.It has minor drawbacks. Don't expect mindless AAA spectacle, I'm sure some people may find dialogue parts or other elements a bit sparse. You'll also jump between playable characters a couple times in an awkward, non-organic way. There was one instance where I was really getting into the story only for the game to yank me away to the other side of the map into some other character I had barely noticed before.All in all, a great game that leaves me expectant for the sequels.

												I didn't actually beat this game yet, but it's damn good. Think the Oregon trail meets Game of Thrones meets an actually good game, and you get this one. A lot of games talk about trying to make all your decisions matter, and a lot of games say they do, but in the end it simply doesn't feel like your actions really matter. Banner Saga is probably the only game I've played where I felt like it was true. When I need to make a decision in-game and someone dies, I feel like their blood is legitimately on my hands. Sometimes the only ones that die are nameless clansmen, and, honestly, that doesn't affect the game much, but one time I made the decision of trusting the wrong guy, and one of my best combatants, a centerpiece of my offense, was just straight up killed. From what I've seen so far (because I've started playing the game twice), the main plot doesn't change, there are no grand branching paths far as I've seen, but you definitely feel the weight of responsibility as decisions constantly have you weighing morality vs. personal survival, risk vs. chance of reward, and sometimes just posing a genuine question of morality. (Choices? 10/10. Your move, AAA studios)Now, without the choices, how about the story itself? The world is nicely built, the story is compelling, the characters are interesting, and there are some really good quotes. It gets trippy as hell, though. Like I said earlier, I never beat the game, so I can't attest to the quality of the ending.(Story? 8.75/10. Worthwhile.)Now that we got this girly nonsense talk about ""story"" out of the way, let's talk about combat. The real men's subject. It's a grid-based, turn-based rpg system, but instead of attacking you decide whether to strike armor or strength. Each does a thing we're not getting into now. How does this effect the gameplay? Enough to distinguish itself. It definitely gives a unique feel, and the tactical question of ""Should I attack strength or Armor?"" rarely has an obvious answer. So it adds a layer to strategy. It's not necessarily ground-breaking, but it adds a little spice. (Combat? 8/10: can't complain; pretty good) It adds just the right amount of spice, really. A classy amount. The Banner Saga is lIke something from a fancy resturant. Just don't actually eat there because the waiter poisons people at random.Overall: 9/10 I would easilly recommend this game to any strategy player, and some non-strategy players.			"

												This is an exquisitely crafted game.  The visuals speak for themselves, and along with stunningly stark dialogue, they bring the Scandinavian roots of the story to life.  The solemn acceptance of difficult decisions shines in this grim context; choice and consequence have rarely been this profound.I'll try again:  If you took Oregon Trail, and then mashed it together with some Front Mission, borrowed the themes and flavour of Snorri Sturleson, and then had it lovingly painted by Disney's best artists, it might look something like this.Games which are this difficult to concisely describe probably deserve your attention.

												Simply excellent.  A well crafted tale of sorrow, suffering, and sacrifice.  The unique visual style and easy playing controls help the narrative flow easily in a game more geared towards your decision making (and living with the consequences of those decisions) than fast reflexes or crafty maneuvers.  At its core, the game takes many classic RPG tropes and turns them on their head.  Expect to be forced to make a choice between two or more bad options and to have it cost the characters the writers are so good at making you care about.Well worth the buy, I hope to see more work from the same developers in the future!

												The Banner Saga is probably one of the best games I've played in recent memory; the cast is made of characters who are dynamic enough to be difficult to explain in one sentence or trope, the aesthetics are a marvel for the eyes, and Austin Wintory's score for the game compliments the desolate nature of the game quite well.It's also quite nice to see a strategy game where--for the most part--turns go back and forth, almost like a game of chess, instead of moving your entire army and dominating in one turn. Many of the choices presented to you throughout the story are legitimately hard decisions to make, and the possibility of losing party members or forsaking rewards makes you think about your options, and makes each run of this game a little more unique.I do have my gripes with it though: some of the classes don't feel too unique from each other, special attacks aside, and for the most part, the story doesn't really branch out much. Your decisions do indeed affect immediate events, but you're still locked on the story progression the game wants you to take.Don't let that be a turn-off, however. I've poured nearly 12 hours into this game, and I've enjoyed each one of them.FINAL GRADE: A-Highly recommended, but there's considerable room for improvement.			"

												Basically, the game has three things about it that make it great:1: The visuals2: The soundtrack3: The storyAll of these things on their own are amazing, but its how they work together that really make this game shine. Throughout the game you're travelling through these vast, beautiful landscapes that make you want to hope in and explore them yourself. The soundtrack however, really drives home this bleak feeling of foreboding which contrasts with the visuals spectacularly. The story is filled with twists, turns, decisions which are going to pull at your heartstrings and characters who you care about. You're taking this long, ardous journey through this beautiful world, but you're being followed by something that won't stop until it has destroyed you. You're going to be making decisions for a lot of people and some of them are going to get hurt. When you combine these three things together, you're left with a game that you won't forget anytime soon.I'm really, really looking forward to what the next chapter will bring.  "

												One part tactical combat, one part RPG, one part Oregon Trail. The game has an intense storyline that makes the player really feel the urgency of the characters. Part of this is due to the way ""renown,"" or the game's version of XP works. Renown can either be spent leveling up your characters OR on supplies to keep people alive -- and there's never quite enough renown to go around. The use of scarce resources works really well into the storyline and even more into the player's decisions of what to do. I'm not really much of a tactical combat fan so I was surprised by how much I really enjoyed the game. The best part, however, are the really amazing visuals (outside of cutscenes). I plan on playing through the game a second time just so I can screencap some of the scenes. And even better than the graphics? The music. Really the only thing I could complain about is that the end of the game doesn't really feel like an ending. It's more of a resolution to the current situation than a resolution to the entire storyline. Of course, this may mean a sequel in the future!			"

												Don't get me wrong - I am not dissing the game. Let me say that this game is pretty cute, it has a nice story and a few intuitive dilemmas... but more non-intuitve or at least not intuitive and a lot of random in the effects. All in all the choices you make doesn't really influence the story at all.A game that claimed that choices matter is the walking dead games. The graphic there is more advanced so I kind of realized that wouldn't work. The bragging of my choices being important turned out to be m00t to the point I felt it was dishonest as it never mattered who I saved, or even if i made smart choices. The only thing that changed was a few lines of text or audio about other peoples attitude.Ok, back on topic. The banner saga doesn't brag itself to death, but have the same marketing and consequence issues. It really doesn't matter much what I do, the game will end the same and mostly it will play out the same. As someone else pointed out, not caring about the caravan doesn't really matter either. This makes me get bored in conversations AND mostly in dilemmas as it really doesn't matter for my success. Now, success isn't the only thing that is fun... but to me asking me to make choices that are purely or 95% cosmetical makes me think that they could have skipped it and showed me a movie instead.Another thing that annoys me is when the game makes me feel that I have failed due to random events. I spend renownd to level people that simply just die on me 8lr leave like Elof). Not because I made the wrong decision, but because the movie ..ehrm.. the game I *cough* is scripted that way. So I end up losing hordes of renown and cannot level the character the game arbitrary let me keep because the developers choose to kill off character in the story.I have nothing against the story telling aspect of killing off characters... but then I shouldn't lose because I choose to level those characters and not others. That is just... random. The same issue goes with new characters. To be able to use them I should not have leveled the others so much. The point of having many to choose from is m00t as you cannot leve everyone so you are better of sticking with the generally best characters (that you guess won't die or replay after you know which will) and optimize from there. That makes the game poorer from a tacical and diversity stand point.The game is (again) a nice story telling game, with feeling. Too much time sinks for me and unfortunately too little consequence of my actions that make me care enough to read the conversations. I would give it a 6/10 (well not compared to normal judgin where people seem to always give 9 or 10 if they like something. I use the full scale) for those who cares about my opinion. I don't regret buying it, but I am not longing for a sequel.			"

												The Banner Saga's art style is what initially drew me to the game. I loved the beautiful hand drawn backrounds and 80's cartoon style cutscenes. However few and far between they were.  The characters in The Banner Saga are also all hand drawn and look fantastic, With slight movements to give each of  them some life and characteristics. The only frustration I have with the art style would be that I wanted more. More animation. More cartoon style cut scenes,. I guess wanting more is a good thing.There is not much to say about The Banner Saga's music exept that it is incredible. A perfect soundtrack.  If you really like the music on offer the soundtrack is avaliable to purchase alongside the game.The Banner Saga's story is one of doom and glome. A dying world under siege. You will play as aViking leader in charge of a caravan. Trying to outrun or defeat the drege menace, who has begun to poor across the world (again). It will be your decisions that decide the fate of the 100's of people in you company. including main story characters who can die perminatly and will not show up in future Banner Saga games.From the first moments of the game you will notice that Banner Saga's overall story is pretty weak, The overall narative it is trying to tell is fuzzy at best. leaving to many unanswered questions and plot points that pop up out of nowhere.  That said, the game regains most of its glory in its character stories. Making you care at least a little about the people your are in charge of. Watching one of the main chracters charge head long into certain death. Axe at the ready. Was one of the best feelings I had in the game. It's  the decision making and tense moments between life and death of a chracter that will keep the story intresting.The games ifficulty settings can make The Banner Saga a brezze. Or an absolute chore. On easy difficulty the game is basicly story mode. Allowing players to march through the various battles and challanges without having many wounded characters. On Hard mode however the games difficulty ramps up so much so that the game can feel unfair at times. In my playthrough for example. I had so many playable characters, that I couldn't level them all effectivly. Leaving four or five of them far to weak to help in combat. This is a small gripe considering that you can simply prioritize a few characters, but it would have been nice to see some of the other bad ♥♥♥ vikings swinging thier axes in battle.That brings us to the combat . On offer here is a Tactical Turn Based system. In which the player,  alternates moving or attacking with one of thier characters, then the enemy takes a turn,. Moving and fighting this way until the battle is over.  Combat uses some unique mechanics I will not delve into here, but veterans of turn based games will pick them up quickly and new comers to tactics games will learn durning early few battles.Now Don't get me wrong combat in The Banner Saga is fun and most of the time engaging and tactical, but some of that is taken away toward the middle and end half of the game. I played The Banner Saga on hard Difficulty, and boy was it ever a challange. I lost so many seemingly unbeatable fights that I 'll admit I Iowered the difficulty a few times just so I wouldn't have to play some battle for the 30th time. This could just be my lack of game knowledge or not leveling my characters effectivly, but it was an annoyance that got old fast. I would suggest playing the game on medium difficulty. It's a nice mix of strategy and forgivness that makes you think without punishing you for minor mistakes.I  very much enjoyed my time with The Banner Saga. It's characters were odd, unique and badass. IIs world was bright, beautiful and engaging. And although the game can be frustrating at times,  I think the reason I like The Banner Saga the  most is becuase it's  somthing diffrent. And for  only 20$ The Banner Saga is a must own .			"

As I said, you'll love it; that is if you like the idea of a role-playing turn-based strategy game in which almost every character has their own unique abilities, and thus worth to a battle. Characters level up like in typical RPGs and you can equip them with stat-enhancing gear (only one though, and the highest level is 5). You'll quickly decide your front 6 and rarely deviate from it.You will also learn that this game outright hates you, dealing you pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cards when you are called upon to make a decision. Not always ♥♥♥♥♥♥, however - some lead almost nowhere. But this where the story is primarily told, and because of these infrequent horrible decisions, and the occasional story-affecting choices, the saga feels like it's yours. I'm quite confident that someone out there has done precisely the same things as I did in this game, but, whilst I was playing it, it didn't feel that way.The art style is pretty. Think 50's-80's Disney style stationary art with basic movements programmed in for battles, but with the minimal, yet highly appreciated, foreground and background falling snow to give it an easy 3D effect. Nice all around.My only beef with this game is it's story, particularly the ending. It just ends to soon to put it plainly. Any self-respecting storywriter (who knows or does not know that they may be writing a trilogy) would not have ended it in this way. So many great and interesting angles are left unexplored and hardly explained! The Gods are dead (not much of a spoiler as it's right at the beginning of the game) and yet no explanation is offered. The sun has stopped moving (again, beginning) and no explanation is offered. The (apparent) main boss is introduced 2/3 of the way through without any previous hinting of how significant he's going to be. Why? Because his significance is paired with his existence. Very poor. And it's not even like he's a good main boss: there is a literal earth-shatterer that would have made for a killer main boss!The storywriters need firing for this one. Actually, just fire the ones who argued that it should end in this way because they need to go back to junior school. I don't care if a trilogy had been in the plan the whole time, a good story does not introduce a key aspect of the storyline and then just do nothing with it.I do recommend this though. It's a great game. The tone is excellent and it really feels like your saga. When you finish in a day (if your dedicated enough) you'll see what I mean by just how ♥♥♥♥ing disgraceful the ending is.			"

												When i first got to play this game at the beginning, i just got this really good and amazing feeling. This game is like a medieval disney style RPG and i really, really like that! I have never played a RPG game that is drawn. But i hope they are gonna do some DLC type things, maybe additional story line and new races and classes. Hope this recommendation has showed my feelings about this game.			"

												This game is, quite simply, fantastic. It has a fairly unique mechanic that, while not the most entertaining in the world, is paced well, and both thought provoking (to ensure that you can keep functioning well as a party you have to think about what you do in each and every combat) and fun. Outside of combat, the ""overland"" mechanical business of actually running a caravan is a very interesting challenge that really made me think about my choices. Especially towards the ending where the choices get significantly harder to make, and it becomes much more apparent that being the ""good guy"" won't always be the best choice of action. The story is excellent and well written. To be quite honest this is one of a very few games that has actually made me cry. Artisitically this game is stunning. It is very obvious that those who worked on visual assets had both talent and actually gave a damn about how the finished product looked, making this probably the most visually beautiful game I've played in a while.Overall I highly reccomend this game to anybody who enjoys a high quality storytelling game, and to those who still enjoy a turn based tactics game.

												This game is immaculate, from the artwork and gameplay, to the way you manage supplies and your clans happiness during travels.  Every decision you make in the game is important and a lot of the conversation choices could result in the death of a character over another in some cases.It shows this was made by some of the oldschool Bioware guys who have since left that company.  The story and characters are all very interesting and I've only scratched the surface of the game.The artwork and music stand out in this game more than any other I've played.  The art is only 2d but it's some of the most beautiful 2d artwork I've seen.  The music is perfect and fits the art with a very viking feeling to it.  The incombat animation is very smooth and looks great.The gameplay reminds me of old FF and Suikoden games where you have many different heroes with different job classes.  There are as far as I can tell about 17 different job classes each with it's own special abilities.  Every character you get can be ranked up, have an item equiped etc.  If you are a turn based strategy, with a bit of RPG fan I highly highly recommend picking this game up.Final Note:  This game has an auto save feature, which means not being able to save the game at every decision, making them far more important in the longrun.  Save Scummers beware, this is not the game for you.			"

												Well.First things first: it's short, it's part of a trilogy so this is merely chapter one. Kind of irks me that the price for a single chapter is the better part of $25 but I also hope they're going to offer the following chapters as DLC. Otherwise this is a massive cash-grab.That being said - wow. An amazingly well-constructed world and lore out the wazoo. Grammatical errors and switching from second- and third-person narratives willy-nilly aside, the story was also very well written. My skin crawled and shivered several times during the playthrough.I had moments where I wanted to throw my keyboard at the game. I wanted to quit, to uninstall it and leave it to rot in my basement where I would keep it until such a time where I had forgotten the injustice it had done to me and I would allow it a glimmer of sunlight once more. But I didn't. I decided it wasn't the game, it was me. I felt like a victim of household abuse. If the companions I had fought so hard to keep alive suddenly died because of a wrong decision by me, then it's my fault. Mine and mine alone. I learned to live with my regrets, learned to cope with them and keep going; by far, the best thing the creators of the game could have done was not have a savegame feature. You live with the consequences of your choices - and more often than not, there's always a second side to the story. The story ended just as it had begun to make a small portion of sense, though by asking more questions than answering them. I went back to the title screen and was about to hit ""Restart"" when a message popped up - ""If you restart the game, all your previous decisions will be overwritten"". I stopped. Yes, I can go back and play the game and know what to expect now, and probably make a lot less of a fool of myself by making better decisions. But then, it wouldn't be the experience it was meant to be. The experience of putting you in a world that is dying, possibly already dead, where your only hope is to survive; to save a few lives on the way is a bonus, but hard decisions will need to be made. Hard decisions that will stick with you, long after you've finished playing the game. So I didn't restart it, and my ill-conceived decisions are going to sit there until Chapter 2, where I can relive them again. And I will miss some characters dearly, while others I will not bat an eyelid to. This is what a great game is meant to encourage. In a bleak world where the hopelesness and fear seem to be the only constant, where even mountains can be torn asunder, you cling on to the fact that though you may have sacrificed a few men, you survived. And that's all that matters.Because don't you know, the Gods are dead?			"

												This game is one of those ever increasingly rare games that prove video games can be more than just a few hours of entertainment, they can be interactive art. the art style is incredible and animations are pretty well done, and the decisions you make the whole way are gut wrenching and could either help save you, or cause you problems. Trust this person, or this person, and if you trust the wrong one, then you could get betrayed. Sacrifice your travelling companions for your combat party, or risk yourselves for the better good. It truly started making me start questioning every decision, and really makes you question yourself as a leader.Rook, basically the main character (theres a bunch of little storylines in there, but you are mostly playing as Rook), was simply a hunter, seeking to live a safe quiet life while protecting his daughter, when suddenly you are attacked and the leader of your small village is killed, and suddenly, everyone looks to you as the new leader. Thrust into your sudden leadership role, you must make tough decisions, that only get tougher as you go from leading a mere couple of dozen people to leading over 300-400+, all while seeking to protect the group and your daughter, and seek salvation.As for the combat, the strategy is a bit tough to get used to, but incredibly well done, and makes you start depending on your team, but that can go badly if you make a poor decision and get one of those main allies killed. Leveling up is well done, especially since your ""Renown"" which you have to spend each time you level up and buy stuff like supplies and items, is not gained in huge amounts, but not gained in small amounts, making more decisions on whether you want to level up now, or spend some renown to get some more food supplies, which you might need, or risk running out of food before the next opportunity to get more.As for the length, I found the game pleasently long, but not too long as to feel boring. The interesting interactions going on between characters made me not even notice how long I'd be playing, and that is something I really like. The other thing is that due to the sheer amount of choices you have, I almost want to go back through and play again just to make different choices.However, about the one issue i had with this game is whenever you are travelling, all you can do is simply watch, and the environment is not much to watch, and there are times where you will travel for like 2 game days without anything happening, which kind of kills the pace of the game at times.Overall, I very highly recommend this game. It's more than just a game, its truly what makes gaming great, showing that games can be art and entertaining.			"

												Solid character writing, art, sound, and classic turn-based tactical gameplay.  I LOVED the art.  I'm halfway through my second playthrough.  The plot was confusing for a while, with many characters and locations introduced in quick succession, but I got into it after an hour or two.  Waay too many loading screens.  The game (when you aren't in combat) is all dialogue, or ""choose your own adventure"" style dialogue choices, or uninteractive video of your caravan moving from place to place, or a picture of a location you're temporarily staying at with a few locations to click on and visit.  Character and inventory management is simple.  Lots of character classes, each with their own unique power, which keeps the combat fresh throughout the game.  The ""caravan"" mechanic is unique and interesting but shallow.  There are several events that only occur if your caravan has high/low morale, and ""war"" battles are easier or harder depending on how many fighters you have, but that's pretty much it.  The game has a pretty short campaign that ends abruptly with no resolution to the major plot threads.  There are some unexpected plot twists and upsets and hard choices where the outcome can be permanent loss of characters in your party.  I enjoyed the story so I didn't care, but I could see getting irritated when you lose a character you like because of a single dialogue choice.  You have no warning about what characters are going to show up in later parts of the game, so you will likely waste points leveling up characters who will disappear later.  This game doesn't even visit half of the locations listed on its large detailed map. I only played single-player.  I hope they release followup campaigns.			"

												The Banner Saga: a good game that could've been great (tl;dr version at end)Don't let that give you a bad impression; like I said, it's a good game. The turn-based combat is satisfying and provides a nice balance of challenge and complexity. The soundtrack is sweeping and epic. The visual design is absolutely gorgeous, very reminiscent of early 90's Disney. The writing is pretty good too, with an pretty interesting and varied cast of characters, as well as a pretty cool setting influenced by Norse mythology.That said, I felt the setting was a bit clumsily introduced: the game throws a ton of lore and proper nouns at you without adequately explaining a lot of them (for the first half of the game, I had no idea what the hell a ""Mender"" or ""Valka"" was). My biggest complaint is the way the turn system worked: rather than having one side move all their units, then the other side move all their units, it alternates between the two: you, enemy, you, enemy, you, enemy, etc. This means that if you have six people active and the enemy has three, those three will be getting two moves each for each one move for your own people. It's kinda hard to explain in text, but the game essentially punishes you for doing well in combat by giving the enemy more moves the more you whittle down their numbers.The save system is pretty frustrating too: You only get one uncontrolled autosave file. That's it. No manual saves or multiple save files. Is that too much to ask for, especially in a game like this that features so many different outcomes based on your choice?tl;dr Great combat aside from the crappy turn system, damn gorgeous visual design and soundtrack, pretty good writing and setting, albeit one that was clumsily introduced. Would benefit greatly from having manual saves.I still give it a solid recommendation in spite of its flaws			"

												I have literally no bad thing to say about this game. I loved it.The gameplay is just rock solid in all respects If I had to describe how the game plays in one sentence, I would have to say it plays like ""Xcom"" meeting the dialouge trees of ""Mass Effect"" with small bits of ""Monster Loves You"" wrapped in a giant Norse blanket. While it sounds stupid, it is the best description I could think of. The game has three basic activities: fighting, talking, and caring.Fights are handled as a turn based strategy game. There is a large grid and you have an overhead view of your units (usally around five or six units) and your goal is to kill anything that is not one of your units. Units of course have varied abilities, sizes, and each unit can level up. Overall, the strategy part plays into the strengths of the genre and doesn't venture to far outisde of them. There is no permadeath, but on difficulties above easy players that are knocked out on the battlefield will require time to heal and be at there greatest strength.Now what helps this game stand out are the dialouge sections of the game. Between fights you will engage in conversations with the people around you and make decisions about, well, many things. This can determine the kind of fights you get into, the members in your party or how other future events play out. It helps that the dialouge is well written. Just keep in mind that it is presented in mostly drawings with no voice acting. It did not bother me in the slightest, but it may bother some possibly.The other part of the game is traveling on the road and taking care of the day to day events. In these sections, your caravan is shown traveling across a large landscape and blocks of text popup every once in a while describing something that has happened and giving you choices of how to react to it. These sections also can change the fights you have and your party members among other things. They are nice down times between the action and help give the game the feeling that the journey really is a struggle.I overall adored this game. While the presentation was simple, it was strikingly beautiful and bolstered up by the strong mechanics surrounding it. If you like story based games and don't hate strategy games either, pick this up.			"

												Overall - amazing. Although it may feel like a guessing game at times, hard decisions must be made and the ambiguity of choosing the ""correct"" option simply  adds to the stark ambiance. Often times, there is no correct answer and although people may die, that just further illustrates the cynical nature of The Banner Saga. Many negative aspects of this game are valid (for example, the strange combat initive system) but I didn't find anything actually bothersome. The story is fantastic, the mise en scène is captivating, and overall - this is just a great game. It also may be the first game I ever justify a second playthrough with!			"

												Amazing art, soundtrack, story, and characters. Fun combat. Harsh choices, though wish there were more of them with not so many just related to losing battles. The caravan portions could use some fleshing out in the next game. Supplies don't do anything too meaningful, and you can easily win with low morale. Despite that it was hard to keep stocked, and I only kept buying them to satisfy my own personal sense of accomplishment from not letting people starve. There should be greater story consequences when you run out of supplies...because you probably will. Took me 14 hours, taking my time, and will probably replay near the release of a sequel to try and get a better carryover file.			"

The art, story and music completely pulls you in to this dark and wintery world full of beared humans and horned giants struggling to survive. Getting use to the combat takes a bit of trial and error, but there is something about the mechanics that i prefer over other grid based games. There are minimum dice rolls, so it feels much more like chess where positioning of units are vital.The game does have some flaws though. Keeping your caravan alive and well fed while leveling up your units is a pain.. yet there is little consequence other than low morale when you start losing clansmen due to no supplies.

												A game that truly is a work of art from a developer that is just getting started. Some things that really stand out - the pace is slower, more thoughful and deliberate than other strategy games. Progression happens at a slow, steady march. Battles are fought with fewer units, and higher stakes.  - The map is extremely tolkien-esque, and packed with exquisite lore. This is a detailed, reactive world that you can get lost in. The developers understand that the more you know about a setting, the more emotionally invested you'll be. - It's a joy to retrain your strategy instincts for this game. The mechanics are innovative, unusual. Character stats such as strength, armor and willpower don't mean what strategy/RPG game veterans might assume they mean.    - The game is balanced very, very well. Persistently difficult, but fair, with a long smooth learning curve. The feature of the game that is most obvious is the art. Almost every screen from the battles to the menus looks and feels like a high-resolution, blu-ray remastering of a rotoscoped 80's animated film. What strikes me, though, is how well the art, the writing, and the game are unified in their artistic vision. This really is a masterpiece, and I will be waiting with baited breath for the next two entries in this trilogy.			"

												This game is a combination of beautiful artwork, wonderful music and sound stimulation, and several different gaming style compiled into one. it successfully combines the tactical, almost chess-like gameplay that other games such as Fire Emblem are known to use in one way or another, as well as the caluclating numbers games that have been a staple to the gaming world for ages. A well constructed choice system with consequences that are not always obvious allows for some leeway and flexibility in the end result, as well as the replayability within the game.

												Beautiful game. The art and the music of this game is just breath-taking. Once I started playing I just kept on playing, which very few games are ever that highly addictive for me. The game play is very fun once you get the hang of it. What I enjoy the most is the varying levels of difficulty you can play at, as most strategy based games tend to be a default hard. The story is fairly well done and does lend itself pretty well to replayability. The story does seem fairly short though and the choices presented do make a bit of difference, but don't seem as life or death/story altering as say a game like Wolf Among Us.			"

												First off, this game is amazing. Great visuals, great story, combat system that is fairly entertaining (not terribly deep, though the character abilities can really change up your playstyle), and a score that, while it isn't as expansive as I would like, is fantastic. Don't read a walkthrough your first time through the game, just pick the decisions for story/random events the way you think is best. These decisions you make may not change the grand scope of what happens, but they leave you agonizing over which decision you think would be best, and they do have an effect on who lives and dies, and many other factors. Characters are fantasic.Now, I need to mention the things I disliked. While I liked the oregon trail aspect of keeping your caravan going, it is annoying that, outside of story events or random events, you can only get food using the same currency as you use to upgrade your troops. Would have preferred an additional option to get food along the way, maybe go hunting or something, idk. Just felt there wasn't much proactive you could do on that front.Also, the music, as mentioned above, is excellent, but there isn't enough of it. Tracks do get repeated, though not so much that it got on my nerves. And again, it is great music.The story ends at a good enough point to have some conclusion before the next installment, but I can't help but feel it ended a bit too soon.The clansmen were really just a useless number. I kept them alive and fed because that's what I wanted my character to do, but there seemed to be little incentive to save people besides ""be a decent person"". Maybe that was intentional? Fighters and Varl only matter in battles, which is kinda lacking, but it still rewards you for keeping your warriors alive so that your subsequent battles are easier.I also encountered a few bugs. Nothing serious or game breaking, but one is at the end, to activiate an ability that is needed to advance, I fulfilled the requirements (reduced the target's armor to the point that I wouldn't miss), but it wouldn't let me use it. Reloaded and tried again, worked just fine. Another happened only in battles I had Egil in, but the character it happened to wasn't constant. I would order a character to move or attack, and suddenly they would move in the OPPOSITE direction and end their turn. This only happened to me rarely, but still irked me.Still, I loved it. Played it twice (three times if you count when I lost my save data [my fault] and restarted).Edit: A few things I'd like to add. First, the lore is fantastic, a lot of thought went into creating the places, people, and things in the world.Also, if you like Fire Emblem, I'd highly recommend this game. I like it better than Fire Emblem, because characters don't permadie if they fall in battle. I felt like having that happen in Fire Emblem necessitated restarting the chapter, as you'd miss out on any character specific convos, endings, etc, all because a stupid enemy critted a 11% chance to hit, 3% chance to crit. Banner Saga, if people die, it's because of decisions you made.			"

												[+] Interesting blend of convoy management, adventure game dialogue choices & turn-based tactical combat[+] Beautiful art & animation via rotoscoping[+] Expansive lore, spent a while poking around the immense map of the world[+] New take of tactical combat with concept of health & armor as well as bigger-sized units[-] 2D art style prevents rotation of scene, often resulting in smaller units and enemy traps being obfuscated[-] Convoy management meta-game seemed pointless[-] Lack of quality-of-life features such as inventory management before battles & enemy team movement/combat range during combat[-] Frustrating difficulty spike in final battle that resulted me lowering the difficulty to complete the gameDespite what seems like a mixed bag, the game, which I bought initially to support Stoic's stance against King.com, hooked me in for hours of fun. I'm still looking forward to the next part of the Banner Saga.			"

												There is so much that made me want to love this game. However, the strength system is horribly unbalanced heavily favoring units like warhawks while units like archers have little recourse once an enemy is upon them. Couple this with the fact that units you invest in can very abruptly die via text menu decisions and you've laid the path for a brutally unlikable experience. I'm also not terribly fond of the inability to move after issuing a command nor am I fond of chain battles when there isn't any sort of healing. Not being able to move through my own units was also not well thought out.While you can advance units by spending Renown on them it quickly becomes expensive and the stat points you're allowed to allocate are sparse at best. Couple this with the fact that a unit can leave or die at any time and I have to wonder why anyone would bother. As well, the save system is janky as hell. Want to save and come back whenever you like? Too bad - you're back at the start of the chapter. I guess now you can maybe stop that party member from abruptly dying. Sloppy decisions. It's a shame - the game is beautiful.			"

												This game is a combination of beautiful artwork, wonderful music and sound stimulation, and several different gaming style compiled into one. it successfully combines the tactical, almost chess-like gameplay that other games such as Fire Emblem are known to use in one way or another, as well as the caluclating numbers games that have been a staple to the gaming world for ages.

												Beautiful game. The art and the music of this game is just breath-taking. Once I started playing I just kept on playing, which very few games are ever that highly addictive for me. The game play is very fun once you get the hang of it. What I enjoy the most is the varying levels of difficulty you can play at, as most strategy based games tend to be a default hard. The story is fairly well done and does lend itself pretty well to replayability. The story does seem fairly short though and the choices presented do make a bit of difference, but don't seem as life or death/story altering as say a game like Wolf Among Us.			"

												The game is beautiful, has a great soundtrack, is well-written, has choice and consequence, features incredibly deep and challenging turn based tactical combat, and is epic in its scale (in terms of the story, at least).  Everything about it is really well done, with the exception of a few odd UI issues which are too specific to list in this kind of review.  Character deaths, betrayals, and all sorts of cause and effect.I must admit that there are two problems; the first is that there are some choices you make which you think will lead to other options, but there are none.  You're confronted with scenarios and choose a few different things, such as ""investigate,"" or to take action.  Sometimes, however, what I think is the same as an ""investigate"" option actually IS the action I take in response to something, leading me to feel like my character should have been given the chance to do more.  It feels really gamey in these moments because in real life I'd have been able to do what I wanted.Not giving too much away, there's just parts where you can ask a question of somebody and somehow that is an equivalent response to posting more guards at the supplies based on the game's logic.  That really sucks.These situations pop up while your caravan crosses the vast world, which you spend most of the time watching them do.  And these situations are based on what you've done before or sometimes just new things entirely.  But the other problem is that you'll often lack context for how you should act based on a lack of information provided.  There are times when you'll be given the option to perform 3 different actions and you're basically just guessing based on nothing, sometimes being rewarded and other times not.  This doesn't always happen, but it does enough that it gets annoying.  And it's fine sometimes for seemingly random things to happen but sometimes you're acting without much info.  I can't get into better detail or else I'd spoil stuff.Overall this is a great game which you should play in spite of the minor flaws it may have.  It isn't very long, nor is it very replayable in spite of the choices from my understanding, because the consequence I don't think can be widespread enough to actually change things too much.  Or at least enough to warrant a 2nd playthrough.			"

												Pros: Art, style, character, unique special abilities, fun game play for the strategically mindedCons: Short game, if not for long strategic battles the whole thing would have been over in a handful of hours. It can feel slow and some might get bored if they don't know what they are getting into, but this game is not meant for your ADHD RTS players counting their clicks per minute. So simply be prepared for what this game is, a ""graphic novel"" with interactive story elements that have direct repurcissions on the story, intermixed with solid turn based strategy combat._______________________________________________________________Loved the look of this back on kickstarter where I first saw it when it was already funded. Then I was thrilled to see it one day on sale on Steam. I can tell you without shame or regret that I've poured a few hours into this one (multiple playthroughs) and my only complaint is that the story ended, too soon perhaps, but if it were one long play through I think I'd still have the same complaint, which is really a compliment more often reserved for great literature than video games. So I tip my hat to Stoic. Now be good and go make me more adventures to have on that vast and storied looking map!The Banner Saga has a lot of potential for more content (though I don't know of plans for any) but regardless of that I have read the developers are working on a second title, so the adventure will continue one way or another but it would be nice to have additional content within this version, I'd be all over that. So assuming those *explitives* over at King (the makers of bejewelled clone: candy crush) haven't managed to somehow own the word ""Saga"" (since they are seeking a trademark and disputing people using the word ""saga"" in their game titles) which is nearly as ridicioulous as it is sad, I'll expect to be throwing my money at the boys and girls over at Stoic ASAP.All the best and good luck with the completely unnecessary issues with those tap app jockeys. They wouldn't know a saga if it slapped them on the ♥♥♥ on the way out of their mothers bedroom.			"

												First off, this game is amazing. Great visuals, great story, combat system that is fairly entertaining (not terribly deep, though the character abilities can really change up your playstyle), and a score that, while it isn't as expansive as I would like, is fantastic. Don't read a walkthrough your first time through the game, just pick the decisions for story/random events the way you think is best. These decisions you make may not change the grand scope of what happens, but they leave you agonizing over which decision you think would be best, and they do have an effect on who lives and dies, and many other factors. Characters are fantasic.Now, I need to mention the things I disliked. While I liked the oregon trail aspect of keeping your caravan going, it is annoying that, outside of story events or random events, you can only get food using the same currency as you use to upgrade your troops. Would have preferred an additional option to get food along the way, maybe go hunting or something, idk. Just felt there wasn't much proactive you could do on that front.Also, the music, as mentioned above, is excellent, but there isn't enough of it. Tracks do get repeated, though not so much that it got on my nerves. And again, it is great music.The story ends at a good enough point to have some conclusion before the next installment, but I can't help but feel it ended a bit too soon.The clansmen were really just a useless number. I kept them alive and fed because that's what I wanted my character to do, but there seemed to be little incentive to save people besides ""be a decent person"". Maybe that was intentional? Fighters and Varl only matter in battles, which is kinda lacking, but it still rewards you for keeping your warriors alive so that your subsequent battles are easier.I also encountered a few bugs. Nothing serious or game breaking, but one is at the end, to activiate an ability that is needed to advance, I fulfilled the requirements (reduced the target's armor to the point that I wouldn't miss), but it wouldn't let me use it. Reloaded and tried again, worked just fine. Another happened only in battles I had Egil in, but the character it happened to wasn't constant. I would order a character to move or attack, and suddenly they would move in the OPPOSITE direction and end their turn. This only happened to me rarely, but still irked me.Still, I loved it. Played it twice (three times if you count when I lost my save data [my fault] and restarted).Edit: A few things I'd like to add. First, the lore is fantastic, a lot of thought went into creating the places, people, and things in the world.Also, if you like Fire Emblem, I'd highly recommend this game.

												Prior to playing this, I didn't really know what to expect from ""The Banner Saga"". All I had seen was TotalBiscuit's ""WTF is..."" video and I knew it was something of a Tactical RPG... with a lot of story involved.Now, after have played the game from beginning to end, I don't regret buying it. Not a single bit. I love storydriven games and this game has got a GREAT story that keeps the player engaged in the characters and the world the game takes place in. The story is mostly told through text so it is somewhat of a visual novel at times, but that didn't bother me just because of the great... yeah, you get it.Often do you run into enemies who wants to kill you and you have to take part in turn based combat. I read that some players found the system in the game to be bad, but I found it to be pretty good and kept the tactical aspect of the game alive, it never came down to a battle being TOO easy or anything like that.The graphics are hand drawn and looks A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I LOVE IT! The soundtrack is great as well, the voice acting (the little there is) is great. Nothing to complain about here. Well... maybe we could ask for some more animations in the dialogue scenes but hey, you can't have everything, right?I've heard there will be a ""The Banner Saga 2"" this or the next year... I'm so looking forward to that and I will totally pre-order that game so I won't miss the continuation of this dramatic story. I truly do recommend it.			"

												Background: It is in the realm of games like Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics.Replayability: Some story changes can allow you to bypass or experience new things but overall the game shines in its Storyline.  Low Replayability.Combat Mechanics:  Standard Grid based, range oriented, simplified stat mechanical battles. Each character has a specific set of abilities and death and failure are very easy to attain even on Easy Mode. Not much Class overlap as the cast of characters is Small but this makes them memorable as you progress through the 10-15 hour story.Social Mechanics: Social interaction plays a big part in who you recruit, battles you fight, who dies...sorry for the minor spoiler, but look you're humans running from an unstoppable horde of shadow soldiers and its dead Winter.  People are gonna die from swords and starvation.Notable Notes: Oh my gosh the Artwork in this game is RIDICULOUS. Like I got distracted by the look at feel of the paintings. Even the Combat Grid and atmosphere is just a thrill ride of pure unadulterated Artistic Expression.  It reminds me of the same feeling I had when I first picked up Okami back in the day.Final Thoughts: Those of us old guys from the 90s who have fond memories on the GameBoy Advance slugging through the massive influx of Grid based JRPGs will find a ray of light in the Banner Saga. <3 Play well my friends.

												The storyline and artwork to this were done really well. The big drawback to me was the combat which i didnt find all that exciting. You play as two seperate factions, the Giants who seem to be on easy mode, they always have plenty of food and morale and smash the enemy in combat easily, and the humans who seem to be constantly on the verge of starving with poor morale and much harder in combat to get by with. All in all it was a fun game that i would reccomend, i just hope they make combat more exciting with the next one, and they dont make you choose between the cool item or feeding your caravan ;)Another drawback i found to this game after getting my new ultra hd monitor is you cant change the resolution manually anywhere. It displayed well enough with my old one which was 1920 x 1200 but with my new one at 3840 x 2160 the game is just a small box in the middle of your screen. Roughly 1/4th the size of your screen which is pretty gamebreaking.			"

												The game is essentially Oregon Trail, but instead of pioneers, it's vikings, and instead of hunting ducks, you fight monsters. The story is so damn good and the art is so beautiful that it's pretty much impossible not to get sucked in though, and combat system is fun, with enough strategy in it to keep things interesting.Although it looks like an animated movie, it's pretty dark at times, and some of the decisions I've had to make have made me feel legitimately guilty IRL. And I can't say enough how beautiful the art in this is. I would legitimately put up some of the backgrounds from this game as art on my wall.			"

												Verdict: Many of the reviews on Steam do this game a massive disservice. I understand, I do. It's not what they were expecting. Like most gamers, they want to feel empowered, feel like they are affecting the outcome in meaningful and tangible ways. This is not that kind of game. This game is about disempowerment and despair, accepting consequences you cannot change, and showing resilience in the face of the end of the world. Most of the choices are between outcomes that are bad or worse, and you will feel like you have chosen poorly very, very often. But therein lies the magic of this game; when you fail 9/10 times, the 10th time brings incredible pathos when you miraculously succeed against terrible odds, when a comrade unexpectedly returns, when you find that timely cache of supplies to sustain your march just one more day. It is an emotional antidote to the automatic success meted out by most video games these days. I can't recommend the Banner Saga enough. It is one of the most engaging and affecting experiences I have had in a game. 10/10Story: This game is driven far less by the story as defined by specific plot elements, and far more so by the general feeling it engenders through its overall presentation. Information is seldom just handed out; as the player you have to infer a great deal from subtle hints. Characters are elusive and rarely forthcoming but, even if their role is brief, most hint at significant hidden depth. Many things are left open and unexplained in the end, and that is exactly how it should be. 9/10Gameplay:  There are two main elements to the gameplay: the simulation element where you manage resources and make decisions for your followers, and the turn-based (and sometimes punishing) tactical battles. The simulation part is simple, but wrenching. There are never enough resources to go around, and never a simple choice. Consequences are unforeseen and permanent. The tactical part is standard but given added depth by the armour-break system. Some players will be frustrated by the criminally short range of archers and other distance fighters, but it feels right that there is no hiding on the battlefield. Battles often feel unfair, but that fits the game perfectly. It’s one of the first games where, when a hero dies, I accept and mourn the loss rather than reloading an earlier save. 8/10Graphics: The art and presentation is the soul of this game, and it would not feel the same without it. Everything is rendered in a beautiful, hand-drawn style, with layered backgrounds to add a sense of depth and distance. 10/10Sound/Music: The sound and music are both excellent, and the soundtrack is worth downloading. The ambiance in every scene is incredibly atmospheric and immersive, despite its simplicity. Less is more in this game, and sometimes there is nothing more solemn than a winter wind.  10/10			"

The ambiance in every scene is incredibly atmospheric and immersive, despite its simplicity. Less is more in this game, and sometimes there is nothing more solemn than a winter wind.  10/10			"

												The wellwritten story sucked me deep into the game's world and characters. I thoroughly enjoyed playing it through. Both the soundtrack playing and setting the atmosphere and the casual simple yet changing gameplay from story to strategic battle along with getting to know to characters and their capabilities kept me at it. I loved the nordic scandinavian mythological inspired setting and the options in it. What I sit back with having finished is a feeling of wanting to try it over again some time, see if I can alter the things I did in my past game and how it will change the experience. I'd recommend this to any of my friends who enjoy a good story, a casual game, a grasping and nice story along with a track of music that will make you love the game even more.			"

												This game is outstanding. The art and story are among the best I've ever experienced in video games. I'd recommend this to anyone who puts story first in games, because the Banner Saga is heavy with conversation and exploration - that said, the combat is great and there are plenty of opportunities to choose diplomacy by sword over conversation if that's more your style.I'll never grow tired of looking at screenshots of this game. Absolutely incredible.			"

												Awesome game. :)I backed this, during its Kickstarter run, primarily because of the art style. I'm very, very happy with the end result. The visual style in-game is amazing. The vista while the caravan is travelling is just a treat to see, and there are so many portions which could stand alone as works of art in themselves. The character designs and combat animations are all great, IMHO. The only thing that could, perhaps, make it ""better"", would be if they had millions of dollars to spend on full animation and voiced dialogue...but from what I've seen and played through, that wouldn't really be necessary, and may even detract from the experience. It took me around 12 hours to finish. Normal Difficulty.I enjoyed the gameplay, overall, particularly the story choices (and, well, the story itself). The management of the ""resource"" you can earn and spend, Renown, keeps things interesting: do I use it to level up my characters? to buy my characters items to buff them? or do I spend it all on supplies for my caravan?Combat itself is quite well done. It seems relatively simple, at first glance, but turn order, unit placement (both during setup and combat) and target prioritization soon become quite important and can make for some very engaging and even stressful fights.The armor and strength stats mechanic is also an interesting feature: Each character has an armor and strength value, with armor reducing damage, and strength acting as both health and damage capability, with the latter decreasing as strength is damaged.Taking all that into account, along with each combatant's innate/passive ability plus their activated abilities, along with the willpower mechanic (which boosts damage, or movement, or pays for ability use)...and it may not seem so simple anymore. Which isn't a bad thing. :)The soundtrack's great. I loved Austin Wintory's work on ""Journey"" (I wish it'd get ported to PC; I'd gladly buy it a second time if it came out for PC). From the softer, somber tones of some of the caravan marching tracks, to the faster and heavy beats of the combat track...all great. I love the tracks with the strong vocals in them, and the last piece in the game was amazing (the credits song/music, too). I'd definitely recommend getting the Soundtrack.Bugs? Glitches? I had one freeze after several hours of play, but I was alt+tab'ing a lot and had stuff running in the background. I also had one combat glitch that required me to load a game, but it was a one time thing.Complaints? There's only one save ""track"". If you start a new game, it'll overwrite your previous saves. It's an autosave system that saves at key points (like entering/leaving a town, after an encounter, etc.), which may also be a problem for some. I'm fine with it being autosave-only (since it keeps every autosave point), but the lack of extra save ""tracks"" or profiles is kinda annoying, esp. since I'm now thinking of a new playthrough and, this being the 1st chapter (of an intended trilogy? still fuzzy on that. I should re-read my backer emails...), saves could carry over and other stuff like that.Volume control. There isn't one. It's either you have music/sounds on, or you have them off. There are also no subtitles. It's not really that important, as the voiceover parts are few, but it'd still be nice to have 'em.TL;DR:I loved the game. I'm looking forward to the next installment. Amazing art (waiting for my digital art book) and soundtrack (if you're going to get it: get the one w/ the Soundtrack), and engaging combat and gameplay. I'm very glad that I backed this game's Kickstarter. :)			"

I started playing when it came out, had to force myself to stop so I could get a couple hours of sleep before work and went right back to it the rest of the day when I got home.  You really get connected to the characters and it is really intese worrying about how you are going to get your parties through their troubles while balancing supplies, leveling, and gear with your resources. Turn based strategy games are my favorite type of games, and this one is near the top, beaten only by Vanguard Bandits, Fire Emblem, X-Comm, and Final Fantasy Tactics			"

												This game was so much fun when I played it. I actually played it twice to see some alternative choice consequences and both time I got engaged in the game so much. You  must keep in mind that this is NOT a fairy tale RPG. The advertisement slogan for the BS2 applies just as much to the first installment. You can lose heroes you got attached to not because a battle went wrong but because you made a wrong choice during the storytelling sequence. Sometimes it can get you down but all in all it’s still a great entertainment.I think adult players will have more fun with the game just because they can see the second bottom to the story and the message of the game better than younger audience. This being said I think all players that enjoy difficult (!) turn based strategies will enjoy this game.Game mechanics are fairly easy to learn and flexible enough that you can replace any fallen hero (in battle or outside of it). Thou incorporating a new class to the battlegroup might force some tactics adjustments.All in all I enjoyed this game very much. The story is sad and a bit emotionally heavy if you engage heavily into such things (as I do) but hey – it’s just like life. Not pretty all the time ;)			"

												What a pleasant surprise that was. After forcing myself to finish some AAA titles lately, just because I've already put some hours in, it was nice to get sucked into a game and dragged all the way to the finish line for a change. The presentation might be simple, but what it lacks in budget it more than makes up in style, coherence, and genuine heart. Interesting story, great combat system, and a really dense, end-of-the-world atmosphere. Must play for any fans of tactical combat, narrative-heavy games, or anyone looking for a well-made, creative title. Aside from ridiculous difficulty spike in the final battle, there's nothing here to complain about.			"

												The Banner Saga - A Viking Tale of Tragedy and Survival----PROS-----Art. The art is the most striking part of this game. It shows you the beauty of hand drawn creations coming alive in what one could only assume is a painful effort to create wonderful animations that flow well. The backdrops show you snowy mountains and barren wastelands to ravaged villages and burning cities, all colored in to show the intense to the calming.-Music. Wonderful pieces that fit each scene quite well. Loud drums and deep bellowing for combat, and soft orchestra-styled music for traveling and such.-Story. It's difficult to find a game where your choices truly make a diffrence. In the Banner Saga, you could make the choice to invite more people into your caravan only for your food to run out in a wasteland and have so many starve. Choose to have your heroes charge head first into the stony masses of your enemies and end up being dragged back on the backs of your friends wathcing the rest of the battle fail.-Characters. From the proud Varl, a group of horned giants who have no women or children to hold them back in battle to the Dredge, a mysterious horde of stone men that never cease in their equally enigmatic plight, every race, character, and hero is wonderfully written.-Troop Management. Ah, the troop management. Keeping your caravan alive in this masterpiece is... unique, for lack of a better word. Your troops have to be promoted (leveled) by killing troops, however each soldier requires renown (the game's universal currency) to level up. This means you must choose between promoting your heroes, buying life-sustaining supplies, or purchasing trinkets that could keep the battle going in your favor.-Good Combat. The combat feels like a mix between chess and final fantasy tactics advanced (thats the only ff I played). The player must use each hero's special abilities to break through an enemy's armor (a seperate health bar) to get to their strength (or health and hitting power), creating a nice style of combat that forces players to use armorbreakers alongside tank and dps units.-Length. Yeah, it's a good sized game.-Flow Between Games. Your save carries over into the next like Mass Effect. I like that alot.----CONS-----Bad Combat. Yeah, I had to split it into two groups. The combat gets unwieldy as you kill enemies. Say the enemy has 5 units and you have 5 units: each player swaps off every time they ""use"" a hero (ie moving and attacking). Now say you killed the ♥♥♥♥ out of two of their units (5 to 3): they still get to move every other turn, meaning they get more movement per hero. This could be considered good, which I can definitely see, but it causes alot of problems. I see this as a neutral, but alot of people tell me they think it corrupts the rest of their experience. I decided to put this in the cons as a warning for those who would like to avoid this. For these people, I suggest easy mode which strips the need to let your heroes heal up after battle.----Summary----This game is clearly a work of art. I have personally introduced this game to many people (some of which think video games are a nonsensical hobby) and all have said it is breath-taking. This game is beautiful in so many more ways than one. I hope you enjoy your adventures as much as I have. See you in Abberang, my viking amigos. My Final rating: 9.7/10			"

												I backed the Kickstarter, donating twice the value of the retail game (fifty dollars), because even at that early stage it was clear that this was a game with two of the ingredients required for greatness: a story worth telling and the people capable of telling it. All they lacked were the funds to bring it into being.So, what did I get for my money? Was it worth paying double? In a word, yes. The Banner Saga is clearly influenced by Bioware's golden age of games in the social aspects with your followers (Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect), as well as the Oregon Trail, oddly enough,  but for the most part it is its own being. The art and music are achingly beautiful. The characters are written robustly, so that we get to know them slowly, over this chapter of the saga. I was actually surprised at how much I cared about them, and how much more I wanted to know. The combat, once you get the hang of it (I jumped right in since I played a lot of the multiplayer) is fun, and the addition of magic items that allow you to tweak your characters is welcome. The choices you make along the journey, whether to rout or regroup, how much food to buy, when to train your followers, have definite consequences, made all the more dear by the fact that you cannot jump back to old saves if something goes disasterously wrong.Having already finished the game on normal nut the climax on easy, I am now going to play it again, which is, you'll agree, the test of great game. I want more! The developers have created a new world of in gaming, populated with their own unique population of giants, men, and magic. I very much hope that this is the first of many chapters in the Banner Saga, and that future iterations with expand and enrich the spectacle and vibrance of the world they have created with voice actors and longer sagas.

												The Banner Saga pulls you in immediately with its perfect illustrations, then plunges you into a world of heavy responsibility and grey melancholy. But this is a good thing - it pushes the story along and keeps you wanting to make things work out for the poor Norsemen in your caravan. To top things off, The Banner Saga has one of the best strategic combat systems I've ever played with. Combat keeps you on your toes, as there is not a single round to waste. Every decision you make is crucial in this game, both in combat and out of it.The soundtrack is also riveting. It is so earthy and yet so grandiose, and to add to the Norse flavor of the game, the lyrics are in Icelandic. Buy it. It is one of the few games ever made that is a unique experience rather than just another color of the same thing that's been done a million times. It's definitely worth your money.			"

It's all a matter of playing footsies to gain an advantage and then surrounding your opponent.The story and world are cool. The design is beautiful in my opinion. The single biggest problem I have with it is that it gives you a bunch of options to choose from but in the end the decisions don't make that big of a difference. They try to make it seem like Oregon Trail with turn based battles. It's not. It's a series of turn based battles with interactive travel cutscenes between them.It's cool and I like it a lot, it's just not exactly what I was expecting and I think it could potentially be a lot more than it is.

												The art style in this game... The music in this game... The Banner Saga, I was not ready. This game is incredible. Simplistic yet challenging turn based combat with enough character variety and build types made this an easy game to play through multiple times back to back. Did I mention that this game has choices that while not affecting the linier progression of the game still hold a huge amount of value? Overall I loved this game and found myself with only one small and honestly pointless complaint. The achievements are quite buggy. When I decided I had finished with this game, I had finished it twice through on hard difficultly and both times was not awarded the last two achievements I had left to collect for this game. A couple of others were buggy and required multiple attempts at the same thing to unlock them.This game is great and I couldn't recommend it highly enough. You should get roughly 10-15 hours out of a play through and should easily have the desire to play it again. I am looking forward to the second instalment and you will be once you have tried this game. 9.5/10 "

												This game was so much fun when I played it. I actually played it twice to see some alternative choice consequences and both time I got engaged in the game so much. You  must keep in mind that this is NOT a fairy tale RPG. The advertisement slogan for the BS2 applies just as much to the first installment. You can lose heroes you got attached to not because a battle went wrong but because you made a wrong choice during the storytelling sequence. Sometimes it can get you down but all in all it’s still a great entertainment.I think adult players will have more fun with the game just because they can see the second bottom to the story and the message of the game better than younger audience. This being said I think all players that enjoy difficult (!) turn based strategies will enjoy this game.Game mechanics are fairly easy to learn and flexible enough that you can replace any fallen hero (in battle or outside of it). Thou incorporating a new class to the battlegroup might force some tactics adjustments.All in all I enjoyed this game very much. The story is sad and a bit emotionally heavy if you engage heavily into such things (as I do) but hey – it’s just like life. Not pretty all the time ;)			"

												The Banner Saga... Where to begin? I've made many choices,lived and survived to regret it...yet....it had to be done... The game has such a great story and great atmosphere. Decisions you make in the game are crucial and may haunt you or bite you in the back later. I was playing the good guy.... Accepted or helped as many people as I could along the way. I let people join my caravan, assisted those who stayed behind. Until.... Someone turned traitor after a long while. Perhaps it was due to the low morale from our dwindling food supplies... or was it my leadership? I was accused of letting anybody from the road join the caravan. There was mistrust and there was alot of squabbling amongst the clansmen.My logic was this: The common enemy was the dredge. No point fighting amongst ourselves.And that was how i rolled throughout the whole game. Pretty much like Game of Throne's Nights Watch style. I'd willingly accept anyone whose willing to join and help those that decide to stay, despite their lost cause. I've made a few good friends that way, lost a few too.The ending...I think I made the right choice. Though sad, but I felt that whatever that had happened, the great journey, was all just to get that 1 character to the end. Bittersweet indeed.TLDR:  I felt like Ned Stark in Game of Thrones. Sometimes the best decisions aren't always the morally righteous ones. The game really shines in this part as well. The fighting is similar to XCOM styled games....its decent. You really have to decide your hero placements tactically and their moves too. One wrong move could cost the whole battle.			"

												The Banner Saga - A Viking Tale of Tragedy and Survival----PROS-----Art. The art is the most striking part of this game. It shows you the beauty of hand drawn creations coming alive in what one could only assume is a painful effort to create wonderful animations that flow well. The backdrops show you snowy mountains and barren wastelands to ravaged villages and burning cities, all colored in to show the intense to the calming.-Music. Wonderful pieces that fit each scene quite well. Loud drums and deep bellowing for combat, and soft orchestra-styled music for traveling and such.-Story. It's difficult to find a game where your choices truly make a diffrence. In the Banner Saga, you could make the choice to invite more people into your caravan only for your food to run out in a wasteland and have so many starve. Choose to have your heroes charge head first into the stony masses of your enemies and end up being dragged back on the backs of your friends wathcing the rest of the battle fail.-Characters. From the proud Varl, a group of horned giants who have no women or children to hold them back in battle to the Dredge, a mysterious horde of stone men that never cease in their equally enigmatic plight, every race, character, and hero is wonderfully written.-Troop Management. Ah, the troop management. Keeping your caravan alive in this masterpiece is... unique, for lack of a better word. Your troops have to be promoted (leveled) by killing troops, however each soldier requires renown (the game's universal currency) to level up. This means you must choose between promoting your heroes, buying life-sustaining supplies, or purchasing trinkets that could keep the battle going in your favor.-Good Combat. The combat feels like a mix between chess and final fantasy tactics advanced (thats the only ff I played). The player must use each hero's special abilities to break through an enemy's armor (a seperate health bar) to get to their strength (or health and hitting power), creating a nice style of combat that forces players to use armorbreakers alongside tank and dps units.-Length. Yeah, it's a good sized game.-Flow Between Games. Your save carries over into the next like Mass Effect. I like that alot.----CONS-----Bad Combat. Yeah, I had to split it into two groups. The combat gets unwieldy as you kill enemies. Say the enemy has 5 units and you have 5 units: each player swaps off every time they ""use"" a hero (ie moving and attacking). Now say you killed the ♥♥♥♥ out of two of their units (5 to 3): they still get to move every other turn, meaning they get more movement per hero. This could be considered good, which I can definitely see, but it causes alot of problems. I see this as a neutral, but alot of people tell me they think it corrupts the rest of their experience. I decided to put this in the cons as a warning for those who would like to avoid this. For these people, I suggest easy mode which strips the need to let your heroes heal up after battle.----Summary----This game is clearly a work of art. I have personally introduced this game to many people (some of which think video games are a nonsensical hobby) and all have said it is breath-taking. This game is beautiful in so many more ways than one. I hope you enjoy your adventures as much as I have. See you in Abberang, my viking amigos. My Final rating: 9.7/10			"

												Very compelling story and atmosphere that kicks off pretty immediately. Game play is tatics style turn-based with some leveling up. I really liked the gameplay, but I definitely feel as if they could have rebalanced the leveling features a little bit. It led to me scattering my levelups too wide, so I was able to get through the entire game no problem, and then the final battle was impossible. That doesn't detract from the game for me, though, especially with a sequel out. I strongly recommend this game, especially on sale!			"

												The Banner Saga pulls you in immediately with its perfect illustrations, then plunges you into a world of heavy responsibility and grey melancholy. But this is a good thing - it pushes the story along and keeps you wanting to make things work out for the poor Norsemen in your caravan. To top things off, The Banner Saga has one of the best strategic combat systems I've ever played with. Combat keeps you on your toes, as there is not a single round to waste. Every decision you make is crucial in this game, both in combat and out of it.The soundtrack is also riveting. It is so earthy and yet so grandiose, and to add to the Norse flavor of the game, the lyrics are in Icelandic. Buy it. It is one of the few games ever made that is a unique experience rather than just another color of the same thing that's been done a million times. It's definitely worth your money.			"

												If you are in storytelling and turn-based combat this game is just perfect for you. At the beginning I was a bit sceptical because of the few animations during conversations and the very slow soundtrack at the first hour... but later I was so much into the story and the soundtrack changed that i did not care. The art in this game is drawn with love. But the thing that impressed me most was the handling of saving in the game... you cant choose where to save or just reload the game when you made a desicion and you did not like it's outcome. You just go on with that bad feeling that you lost one of your favorite. You have to handle the results. Even if you lose a battle, the is no rewind button. You have to live with it and it's results, which infulence your caravan, your supplies and the life or death of your clanmen and heroes!The story unfolds with time and you reveal the secrets of your partymember with some time (if they survive). The story waits with some unexpected changes and outcomes.			"

												The gods are dead, the sun stood still and the world, inhabited by humans and giants, is on the brink of destruction - these are the first words of the Banner Saga introduction. The game was created by Stoic Studio, was founded by people from the famous BioWare Studio, gave the world such great role-playing games like Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect and Dragon Age.World of Banner Saga is gloomy, harsh and designed to the last detail. Inspired by Scandinavian mythology and stories about the vikings. Before the player unfolds a fascinating story, will be given the opportunity to observe developments from the point of view of several different main characters. Hunter Rook with his daughter Alette are saved from their village, which was attacked by dredges, dark warriors, whose armies are threatening to destroy all life in this world. Giant Hakon leads an army together with the human prince Ludin to help Grofheim, besieged the capital of the Kingdom.Banner Saga is role-playing game (RPG) with turn-based battles. During the 8-9 hours of the game player will have to make the hard decisions and none of the proposed options will be not definitely good, you always have to face the consequences of your decisions. The player will lead to the final goal not only the main characters, the number of which is constantly changing - someone will come, someone will leave, and someone will die. Also player will be responsible for the people, who walking in the caravan with him: refugees fleeing from dredges, who destroyed their home. Especially I want to tell about plot and dialogues. All dialogues in the game are presented in the form of large amounts of text. The text is extremely high quality, it is like you situate in an interactive book where you decide what and how will happen next.Music plays a huge role in creating the atmosphere of the approaching end of the world. Scandinavian themes  plays on the background of colorful snowy scenery and it is just incredible. Under calm music caravan covers the distance from one village to another, under the anxious music soldiers and giants go to the last battle against horrible dredges to protect their families. Under such musical compositions I would like to sincerely empathize with the characters.For this game I would waste my free day, wrapped in a blanket with a cup of warm cocoa. The music and visual style of  Banner Saga make the game like complete artwork, which I will replay several times, to get new impressions.10 brave vikings out of 10. Excellent.			"

												It's by no means a bad game, but I was actually disappointed with The Banner Saga, despite everything about it seeming like it would be a perfect fit for my tastes. An epic tale with branching paths, some tactical RPG combat, a hint of managerial simulation, and of course the breathtaking visuals and music.For me there were two main issues: combat isn't deep enough, and the caravan management seems tokenistic. Combat is a rare occurence in the game, which is rather short in comparison to most tactical RPGs. As a result, characters don't get much of an opportunity to grow. There's no way (that I know of) to go out and farm battles, so using newly-acquired characters that haven't had a chance to gain levels is often just asking for trouble. There are only five levels, however, so it's not a huge risk, but in most cases your characters won't get a chance to develop fully. Gaining xp is only achieved through kills, so this is also a problem for some of the more support-oriented characters.The other ""half"" of the gameplay is managing your caravan, but this can almost be completely ignored, and is probably the most efficient route if you want your characters to get as strong as possible. There is a small penalty in it reduces your characters' willpower (extra moves you can make in combat), but compared with additional stat points it's a minor inconvenience. In the end, I found myself just clicking to go through the motions of combat and reach the end as soon as possible, which was about 8 hours. It's a worthy game but it has its flaws, so while I recommend it, I suggest waiting for a price drop.			"

												This was a very enjoyable game, It has a very gripping, sad story that made me want to continue playing. Even though the game was amazing, i felt like no matter what i did, it was wrong, which im sure was the point of the game. I think spent more time thinking about what couldve happened than i spent on making the decisions that led to the bad outcomes.Overall, probably one of the best games ive ever played,with a story comparable to Telltale's Walking Dead. Pick it up when its on sale.			"

												This game was so much fun when I played it. I actually played it twice to see some alternative choice consequences and both time I got engaged in the game so much. You  must keep in mind that this is NOT a fairy tale RPG. The advertisement slogan for the BS2 applies just as much to the first installment. You can lose heroes you got attached to not because a battle went wrong but because you made a wrong choice during the storytelling sequence. Sometimes it can get you down but all in all it’s still a great entertainment.I think adult players will have more fun with the game just because they can see the second bottom to the story and the message of the game better than younger audience. This being said I think all players that enjoy difficult (!) turn based strategies will enjoy this game.Game mechanics are fairly easy to learn and flexible enough that you can replace any fallen hero (in battle or outside of it). Thou incorporating a new class to the battlegroup might force some tactics adjustments.All in all I enjoyed this game very much. The story is sad and a bit emotionally heavy if you engage heavily into such things (as I do) but hey – it’s just like life. Not pretty all the time ;)			"

												What a pleasant surprise that was. After forcing myself to finish some AAA titles lately, just because I've already put some hours in, it was nice to get sucked into a game and dragged all the way to the finish line for a change. The presentation might be simple, but what it lacks in budget it more than makes up in style, coherence, and genuine heart. Interesting story, great combat system, and a really dense, end-of-the-world atmosphere. Must play for any fans of tactical combat, narrative-heavy games, or anyone looking for a well-made, creative title. Aside from ridiculous difficulty spike in the final battle, there's nothing here to complain about.			"

												Very compelling story and atmosphere that kicks off pretty immediately. Game play is tatics style turn-based with some leveling up. I really liked the gameplay, but I definitely feel as if they could have rebalanced the leveling features a little bit. It led to me scattering my levelups too wide, so I was able to get through the entire game no problem, and then the final battle was impossible. That doesn't detract from the game for me, though, especially with a sequel out. I strongly recommend this game, especially on sale!			"

												I backed this game on Kickstarter back in 2012 and it's one of the few projects I donated to that I feel lived up to my hopes. It's a beautiful game and a memorable experience, and you can easily forget what a small budget it was developed on. The combat is not what you'd get from an AAA title, but the beauty of the game's aesthetics and the experience of the story were a  truly fresh experience to me after 25 years of gaming. I especially loved the feeling of responsibility and the weight of the decisions you have to make. So many games these days play up war as a glorious and fun adventure, which is fine, but so much of what people experience in times of conflict is glossed over. The uncertainty and the dread out in full force in this game. I see some people complaining about the very limited saving system, but really I feel like you're only cheating yourself if you try to redo everything in this game to get the optimal outcomes. It's an experience, and part of that experience is spoiled if you don't feel any real danger, risk, or consequences. I recommend this game to people looking for an amazing story, beautiful aesthetics, a gripping experience, and something entirely novel. If you're only looking for combat, you probably won't appreciate it, but it's really your loss.			"

												Fun and filled with the ""Wait, what!?"" jaw dropping moments; your decisions have serious impact on the merry members of your caravan. A game filled with wonderful storytelling, beautiful decisions and angst filled choices...If your anything like me each time you are presented with a choice you will cringe in making your selection; do I hold to high minded ideals and place a trusted character, whom I have invested heavily in, at risk of a gruesome demise? Or do I choose the safe yet less heroic path and walk away slightly tarnished, yet with all my parts still attached?All I can say is for the cost of a movie ticket you can have all that fun and more!

												Banner Saga...A cold wind blows across your face as you survey the battle-hardened warriors and their kin huddled around a hastily prepared bonfire. There are fewer of them now, a product of your leadership, though, you are resolute in knowing that your courage and pragmatism saved many of them. Despite the hardship you have endured, you can hear laughter and merriment in the distance, dancing and joyful music. A smile graces your chapped lips.Your daughter stands besides you, clinging to your tunic, and with a gentle word she speaks looking on with you,""I think it's time, Father.""With a bellow from your lips the camp is broken down, and once again you find yourself on the road headed toward adventure, your banner, telling the story of your people all the way back to the beginning, flapping defiantly in the wind. This is your time. Banner Saga is a game about the burden of leadership in the face of adversity. The tale is told from many points of view and unlike other games, I have yet to find a game over screen. Your choices are permanent & resounding. Failure sticks and has consequences. If you're familiar with X-Com, this is Ironman. If you're interested in a great norse inspired story of men, beasts, and giants, in a time where the gods are thought dead, then this is the game for you. You won't be disappointed.			"

												I just completed the game and I have to say, that it was a beautiful experience.The plus points of this game:- Rich and Vibrant 2D graphic-novel style artwork.- Haunting and Melodic Musical Soundtrack.- Well-written dialogue with pretty well rounded characters.- Combat reminiscent of old-school games like Vandal Hearts (set number of unique characters instead of armies).However there were a few things that I did not enjoy, so please take these into account (these are just more wordy... not that I think the bad outweighs the good!):- Very Short Game; I have no idea why the game ended where it did. The Store doesn't say it's an episodic game or anything like that, so I've no clue why through the story you're characters are talking about doing something... then the game ends before that even happens. I'd like to think either DLC or a second chapter will be coming at some point.- Heraldry; on the game menu there's an option to choose your banner, but it doesn't really go into detail. I see that it's for the multiplayer called ""Factions"" but I see no way to access that through the game menus. Has to be installed seperately.- Difficulty; not too easy, not too hard. Until the final fight, where it's like ""Well I'm putting this on easy, hell with that..."". Aside from that, perfect difficulty until the end (so this is a mixed point), may even try it on hard.So to sum up... play it. I don't know why you're still reading this. Go on, hit play!			"

												This game was amazing for me, quite clearly something that needs to be in line with your personal tastes, but for what I wanted out of the game my only real complaint is like anything good I want even more. With a sequel on the way I'll get my  wish eventually though.This game is pretty story driven, it would have made a fantastic free roam rogue-like (or rogue-lite, honestly the original term has expanded it's scope just like rpg has over the years, get over it) but I'll take a story driven game when the story at least for me was this good. I've seen some criticism about the choices you make not mattering. I can't say for certain yet, I've just now played through once on hard forbidding myself from reloading to change my choices. As such I can't comment on how much the choices actually mattered HOWEVER, the 'illusion' of choice presented here at least made it feel like so much could have gone differently, my bad choices seemed to kind of snowball on me towards the end ramping up the difficulty quite a bit. It made me ache for the version of this game that could have been like FTL but better.Bottom line:+The art is great, I absolutely love games that go so far to present a unique visual style such as this.+The combat seems super simple at first, but has surprising depth, appealing to the part of me that grew up playing final fantasy tactics. (No real character customization with classes or anything like that though.)+The oregon trail inspired travel from place to place is not only so much better and more immersive than how similar games simply move your little dot along the lines on a map, it lends itself toward making the world and the things in it feel massive. You will probably feel tiny by the end of this.+The story struck a chord with me at least, I got very attached to some of the characters and seemingly through my own mistakes lost a few of them. I found myself spending time reading about the locations I might be headed to on the map when I got the chance. I feel it was very good.-They use the same character shots on different backgrounds while flashing between them during dialogue portions of the game. It oddly works pretty well and isn't too jarring, but full animation or cutscenes would have been very welcome. I fully understand why they couldn't or didn't, but I kinda wanted to see the character's body language a bit, and see some of the scenes described actually shown.-I almost would rather they released a series of expansions to the game rather than a sequel. It really feels like even more could be done with what's here.			"

												From what I have played of The Banner Saga it is truly fantastic the fact that King.com have filed a lawsuit to patent the word saga is truly disgusting. If that lawsuit was to stop this game from getting a sequel, ♥♥♥♥s me off to very high lengths for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ candy crush saga game. The game is exquisite to look at the game's animation is just fantastic it looks like something straight out of a painting. The gameplay is turn based combat and it has a few mechanics to it that make you have to plan your moves and pick your enemies carefully as defeat can happen incredibly quickly. There are also choices you make throughout the game game and don't think you can decide you want to be a hero or villain as there tends not to be a fine line for each you have to decide for yourself what you want whatever that makes you. I'm 4 hours or so into this game and I can see myself playing a lot more, please support Stoic by getting this and if you do play Candy Crush just remember that the company behind them is trying to patent the word saga, how ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous is that.

The art style I found amazing. Think western animation before it was influenced by Japan with Vikings and you are close. It was beautiful and cohesive in all parts of the game and this is a rare thing to find. I played the game on normal and it has been some time since a game on normal challenged me. This one did and it was that much more rewarding when I finished it. I will be playing this again more times to explore other choices and I am looking forward to the next parts they will be releasing.The game drops you in the middle of a story but that did not bother me and by the end I was very much invested in it.

This game succeeds as an experience greater than the sum of its parts.The combat is fun, but there's better. The caravan Oregan-trail gameplay is enjoyable, but there's better. What makes The Banner Saga worth playing is that everything works together to create an immersive experience, more like binge-watching a TV show than working through a strategy game. Sure, the game's linear, but it allows them to make a tighter narrative experience.Impressive things to look out for:- Outstanding artwork- Outstanding narrative- Expansive soundtrack- Beautiful combat animations- Wonderfully characterized worldNot so impressive things you'll encounter:- Underdeveloped RPG elements- Underdeveloped caravan gameplay- Absence of voice acting, even for important parts- Main villain missing some pizazz. He looks like a boss creep from Warcraft III.I have not played the second one yet, but I'd recommend starting with this one, as so much of the world is established. Can't wait to get the next one!

												It's Oregon Trail + Final Fantasy Tactics lite. The combat seems pretty simple on the surface, but they way they use Armor and Strength is neat. A unit's Strength is effectively their HP, and the damage a unit can do is Strength - Armor.  If a unit's Strength < opponent's Armor, they have a (Armor - Strength)*10% chance to miss completely.  If you ignore armor and go for strength attacks, you run the risk of missing with your weaker characters, but if you only focus on armor, they can do more damage to you on their turn.Between fights, you're on an oregon trail style adventure after the invasion of your village by Dredge, a race of heavily armored people from the north. They're the main antagonists of the game, forcing the main characters to flee from city to city looking for refuge. The number of supplies you have determine how many days you can travel before your clansmen and warriors begin to die. In addition, the longer you travel, the worse your clan's morale gets, meaning you have to balance supplies with camping and resting. Various dialog and story events play a part in the number of clansmen you lose or gain if they decide to join your caravan.The story mainly revolves around a hunter named Rook, who falls into the leadership role in a caravan of refugees. You and the other characters are attempting to find refuge between two separate apocalyptic events and a horde of invading warriors. Similar to Game of Thrones, the story is barely ever not dark, but it fits the tone of the world. You're not on a quest to save the planet, you're just trying to get your people to safety.Only downside is that it lacks closure on some of the bigger story elements. Looking forward to the sequel.

												I never leave game reviews but thought of leaving one since I bought this game on a whim after a Steam sale. This is a gem of a game that combines a story guided by your decisions with turn-based strategical combat (think XCOM/Advance Wars/Fire Emblem/etc.) The story-telling is awesome, with good animations and voice acting making the world pretty immervise. It's relatively short (~10 hours of gameplay) but has good replayability since you can choose other actions in a second play-through.

												The Banner Saga is not only a gorgeous and visually impeccable game, with its crisp artwork and breathtaking world; it is also one with beautiful sound design and original soundtrack. Gameplay-wise, TBS is a fresh take on the grid turn-based format, by awarding archetype-locked abilities to your heroes. Story-wise, the enriched norse mythlogy-based world offers a lot of lore and interesting characters to fall in love with.I highly recommend this game, even if the lack of voiceacting in dialogue (apart from voiceovers) and AI weak combos make it a slight bore at times.

												Breathtakingly gorgeous game. The art is wonderful to look at and vibrantly colourful, allowing characters to stand out against the often snowy backdrops.The story and soundtrack are both exceptional, and do an amazing job of drawing the player into the frigid environments of the game, and the desperate struggle for survival. The world map contains a great amount of lore on every location, even those which are nowhere near the events of the game. This makes the world feel like it has history, helping fit the game's narrative into a larger tapestry. Characters are well-written, but could have used even more dialogue to flesh them out even further. Combat is tense, and the battle system has a few unique quirks. First, strength is based on a unit's health. Second, turn order alternates between allied and enemy units in a set order. The combat classes are well-balanced and there are interesting synergies when using special skills in tandem. Battles are tense, especially when outnumbered and surrounded. Units level up based on how many kills they get, which can cause a snowball effect and leave many of your units underleveled. Out of combat, there is light resource management in the form of supplies for your caravan. There are also many decisions to be made, some more difficult than others. Also, your party members can die permanently based on your decisions in these events. On one hand, this feels a bit cheap, since these deaths are unpreventable. On the other hand, this ensures that decisions feel weighty and meaningful, and does not allow choices to be made without care.Unit upgrades and purchasing supplies and items are handled with the same currency: ""renown"". This is earned by killing enemies, winning battles, and sometimes through other choices. This resource can get very tight, leading to even more tough decisions. Overall, an outstanding game that I would recommend to anyone who likes strategy.			"

This game is a tribute to this technique and the art of Eyvind Earle.  Earle did backgrounds for Disney movies such as Sleeping Beauty and Peter Pan.  I had no idea of this when I purchased the game, but after playing through and seeing Earle's name in the credits, (and a google search), it all clicked.  The turn based options are limited, as well as resource management of supplies on a blind play through.  I was pretty anxious the entire time, there were only a few moments where things went well, and several where they went terribly wrong.  I loved this game.

												This is a game that actively makes wants the player to believe that it is a dynamic story where your conversation choices (and oh are there so many of them.) matter. This game hinges on this, with passable and often ill defined combat mechanics, yet has unchangeable plot points. There's one junction in the game where no matter what you say, you do the same thing. It's blatantly to move the story and hinges on this stupid idea that someone's CONTROLLING YOUR THOUGHTS (Cue conspiracy theorist's music.) and forcing you to do this. This is compounded by the fact that the point at which this happens, you're thrust into a situation where you can't better your position. You're stuck with wounded party members and with low morale. You are not allowed to change this, even though the game has previously always allowed you to do what you want. It seems as though this game was rushed towards the end. There even begin to appear characters who are identical, but wear different coloured tunics. All of this would be acceptable if they didn't force you into fights you can't possibly win without either re-loading an earlier save (and I don't mean 5 minutes before the problem, I mean two to three hours.) or lowering the difficulty. A beautiful game with a nice combat system and, for the most part a brilliant story, is ruined by a forced plot progression that seems neither reasonable nor feasible.			"

												It is amazing what story you can tell in such a relativly small production.This game takes you on a real adventure, which lets you experience so much and lets you feel various emotions from anger and sadness to joy and a feeling of success. All incited through a gripping main story, which unfolds beatifully, and the small decisions you can make along the your adventure. They really have an impact, at least it gives you the feeling they have. To be honest I have not expected this gmae to be this good. Things get really grim when you run out of supplies and oyur fighters start dying, your numbers dwindle and the enemy is at your heels. Very intense and well done!The setting is so cool, I would like to know more about the lands, vikins, varls and dredge and also what nordic mythology was frame for them, havent found much yet though.Game mechanics are also very exciting. It takes some time to figure out how the battle system works but it is very well thought through and one really needs some good tactics to prevail. Battles can be hard but they are also very rewarding.The only that comes to mind when thinking about problems, is that departing characters take the items you gave them with them. Thats a bit frustrating because some items are pretty expensive.All in all this game is easily a 10/10 points due to it being so surprisingly good!			"

												What a wonderful game!The beautiful music and art style aid in telling The Banner Saga's fantastic story. Tough decisions are frequent and have significant consequences on the course of the game. I would definitely recommend it to any turn-based strategy fans.Some considerations:-There is minimal voice acting - most of the story is told in text. This sounds much worse than it actually is though - the story remains very gripping!-The gameplay has its flaws, and can get repetitive. The hard difficulty offers a great challenge!-The story is rather short and with a disappointing ending, though easily replayable. Thankfully the story will be continued in Banner Saga 2, with multiple characters reappearing. The sequel will allow the importing of save states giving even greater importance to the decisions you made throughout.Experience: 9/10, Gameplay: 8/10			"

												Well, this isn't a run and gun action game. There is a ton of dialogue, and reading set in a rich viking-esque themed world, if you love a good story, and the ability to interact with the story.. well, look no further as The Banner Saga delivers, and it delivers greatly. The combat is interesting, and the decision making is even more enthralling, look no further.			"

												This game was a huge letdown. The combat is bizarre because a single enemy and a single member of your team will alternate. This means that when the enemy has lower numbers, they get more turns. It lets them get in and beat on your weaker people several times and you may not even have a chance to react. Since losing a character in combat means that you have to rest and that he or she will be weaker in additional fights, it is sort of annoying when there are two enemies left and they both get to move over and over again to take out your weakened guys.The maps are all flat. There is no terrain at all.Between battles, there are story portions that play out like a really well illustrated choose your own adventure book. A situation will arise, you choose between two or three options, and then you get a result. There is no indication whatsoever of how the choice might play out, so you might as well just pick the choices at random. There is one currency in the game and you have to spend it to level guys up. Of course, you never know when one of these random story instances is going to kill someone that you spent that currency on.It's really not a good game. If you buy it, buy it for the art, which is quite good.			"

												Oh the hype train for this game. I put off buying the Banner Saga for a while due to some sceptical comments i read about the game. I had heard it was fairly lengthy and the story was relatively good so in the end that was enough for me. The positives really are in the way this game looks its very much like playing an old disney fantasy esc film. Its stricking in its colour scheme, that much is sure however during ""cutscenes""  if you can call the coversations of text, cutscenes the still characters portraits dont respond physically to anything going on around them and this can create a disconnect between their expressions and whats actually happening.  The game is broken up into three parts the camping which is where the covos/levelling take place, the trekking, which is basically just you watching your little ant party move left or right.  And the combat which is about deciding whether to damage health or armour. Attacking armour first means more damage can be inflicted to the health while attacking health first will mean the enemy wont do as much damage with less health. Simple.Turn based strategy how i love it! most of the time. This game quickly becomes dull, the enemies are the mostly the same and the action doesn’t leave much to the strategic eye compared with say, X-com or Civ. You will quickly find the best strategy and the many unused characters in your party will soon become useless because why would you use anyone thats woefully underleveled and under powered. While there’s something relaxing about the trek across the frozen tundra there is also a tedium to it. Sure random events pop up but they do little to effect the course of the game. Alot of big decisions are actually arbitrary and change little in the narrative. This game feels less like an RPG and more like a adventure game with RPG elements tacked on.Final thoughts, I don’t get the hype I really don’t this is an average game it really is, to me at least. The lore in the background of the story seems awesome , the map is huge! But neither are utilised to there potential, you just get carried through the story down a linear path and don’t really influence it in any great way. The art is lovely but beyond that what is there here to become engrossed in? By the end I really couldn’t be bothered It took me 7 hours and it was a slog for the last 3 the combat just didn’t go anywhere beyond its simple mechanics. The story was interesting to begin with but soon became flat at the half way point, no questions I had were answered, and at times it became rather predictable ( think game of thrones). When I have to force myself to finish something I cant recommend it, its as simple as that.			"

												If you love Strategy RPG games like Final Fantasy Tactics you will enjoy this game. The music and artwork are phenomenal. The Mythos is inspired by Norse mythology and Viking Culture. In the beginning, some of the fights will be quite difficult. Later on, units will increase in HP/Armor slightly and it will be the numbers which can overwhelm you. Unit position is key and it can mean the difference between victory or a party wipe.I highly recommend this game.			"

												There's absolutely no certainty to be had in The Banner Saga; there's exactly no right choices that lead to a happy ending, and this runs throughout every decision and choice you make in your journey. Every time you're called on choosing how much food to purchase, which path to travel, when to fight and when to flee -- it's haunting. The game does away with manual saves, check-pointing your journeys at set points so, if a wrong decision is made, you need to reload a file sometimes several hours back. But you will. I went right back to the start; I thought I could save them all. I couldn't.Full review - http://www.honestgamers.com/12181/pc/the-banner-saga/review.html "

												STOP! Yeah, for those of you like me that go straight to the negative reviews, I would like to state something very important.THIS GAME IS THE FIRST PART OF A TRILOGYThat's why you may read in some of the reviews that ""the end boss has nothing to do with it"" or ""the story is meant to be epic but it doesn't deliver"". Those reviewers didn't know (because the game was not properly labeled - looking at you Stoic) that this is Banner Saga 1, and Banner Saga 2 is coming in 2015. Believe me, play this, enjoy, focus yourself on the story, imagine this as a very cool sort of Bernard Cornwell Saxon Chronics book in wich you get to PLAY the battles and act as the main character, then you will finish the game, replay some different choices to see how they affect the game, then you gonna be like RELEASE THE NEXT ONE ALREADY!Thanks.

												I don't tend to write reviews, but after finishing this game i feel really inspired to do so.For me this game was a really nice experience, since the start i felt engaged just by the art, even if the game doesn't have a voiceover u can really shape the voices and the personality of each character in your head, the story is well made, really spicy with the decision making. Every time i had to make a decision i took like 5 minutes, because i felt that every decision was really decisive in the end and in some way it is!.Since the start i felt a really deep connection with each character, regreting some decisions that i make down the road. The music also suits the game ambient pretty well, i enjoyed this game so much and i hope that everyone that reads this review does the same, this is a really awesome an emotional ride for everyone that enjoys really good turn based games with a good story and a vast variety of characters to choose from.

												As many have already mentioned: Utterly fantastic art, especially in landscapes. Beautiful, high-res, hand-drawn. It's just gorgeous to look at. The in-game map is beautiful, too. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the soundtrack here, which is excellent and fits the world and the story incredibly well. The lore is pretty deep. A lot of work went into the world-building, and it shows.As far as tactical gameplay, health and strength occupying the same function is brilliant, and the way armor and strength affect damage dealt is ingenious. Willpower and exertion are further interwoven, creating depth. It's fantastic and it works to provide the best tactical aspect of the game.However, combat design overall often feels a too raw and underdeveloped at higher levels. For example, why can't I check out my characters' stats while deciding who to use for the battle? Isn't that sort of important? Why isn't there a range attribute? Am I just missing it? I understand that shieldbangers move more slowly and have less range than other units due to their heft, but it'd be awfully handy if I could tell just how far they'd be able to move when placing them. Same with enemy units. There's just too much missing here. The basic premise involving strength, armor, exertion, and willpower is solid and incredibly innovative to the genre, but some major fleshing out needs to happen in order to get me more invested into the tactical combat being presented here. I often feel like I'm floundering, like I don't I have enough information to even begin to approach a battle tactically. It takes me out of the experience and I just tend to float through battles rather than plan and execute an actual strategy. And that's a very, very bad thing for a tactical RPG.I also question the system of having each side alternating moves, rather than assigning characters a speed attribute and having that govern when turns are taken and by whom. There's a huge missed opportunity here that would greatly affect the Man vs. Varl unit selection and it would help to balance the two units. Instead it seems they tried to balance them by making the Varl bigger and less maneuverable, but I don't think this works nearly as well. I ended up selecting mostly Varl units in each battle simply because they were the hardiest and I often didn't feel the desire to try and play tactically. Just roll the Varl out there with an archer or two and have them smash heads while the archers wear away the opposing units armor. A speed attribute would have added a great deal of depth: Do you opt for speed and maneuverability and quickly bring the fight to the opponent? Or do you go with a solid front line, advance slowly, and wear the enemy down while tanking through whatever damage they deliver? It would have added a ton of tactical depth that this game is missing.The interface has some issues. You'd better be 100% on-point with your mouse clicks, otherwise you'll have to try and figure out where you went wrong, select the same unit again, and start from scratch with whatever you were trying to get him to do. It's way too easy to click the wrong thing, and just not intuitive enough to prevent regular frustration from occuring when you're trying to get your units to do what you want. There are similar issues with selecting units and placing them prior to a battle. This is a minor gripe, but by the end of the game it was incredibly frustrating to miss a click on a willpower star by a fraction of an inch, and have to select the character and tell him what I wanted him to do from scratch.Though the art is very well-done, I felt some of the character designs were too generic and too difficult to tell from one-another. There are a few Varl units who are basically just palette swaps from one another with very minor differences in facial features. Due to this, and not being able to view any details about a unit prior to selecting them in battle, I had a lot of trouble keeping the characters straight and often made mistakes during deployment that could have easily been avoided had I been allowed to view more details about which units I was actually selecting for battle. I mean, it doesn't even tell you which class a unit is on the pre-battle screen -- Just their name, level, and a picture of their face. No class, no stats, nothing. Weak characterization makes the problem even worse. I often confused Griss and Bersi, and by Chapter 5 I had no idea which one was which and often made mistakes in deploying them. I found it hard to get invested in any of the characters. None of them show any depth, and the only one written with any panache at all was Ludin. Poor dialogue exacerbates the characterization issues. Decisions are too frequently unclear about what you're actually selecting. I don't mind having things blow up in my face, but I need to be adequately informed on what it is I'm choosing to do. For example, you arrive at a fortress and enter, only to have enemies immediately attack it. You are given a choice as to whether to rest in the fortress, or immediately attack and attempt to break out. This choice is followed by another, in which you choose the actual tactics of your breakout. So you've got two choices to make at the same time, but you have to choose whether or not to rest before you're able to see what your options will be during the actual attack. Jeez, this is getting complicated... Still with me? Basically, you're forced to make an initial choice (whether or not to rest first) without adequate information to make the decision. If I had known that I'd have liked to charge the enemy and attempt to eradicate them all, I'd definitely have rested first. If I was going to try and distract them and get away, I'd have chosen to attack immediately to prevent more from arriving. The character I'm playing would have had all of this knowledge in his mind while making the initial decision as to whether or not to rest -- Why don't I? This kind of thing is present too frequently, and it leads to way too much frustration. It cheapens the decisions you're making.Losing characters to decisions made through the game, rather than in battle, is something that keeps the intensity up, but overall I don't think it works nearly as well as Fire Emblems system of permadeath within combat. It puts too much of the onus on the story sequences and takes away from the importance of the battles. If you're in this for the story, that's fine, but it lessens the importance of the tactical game and makes it too easy simply to trudge through battles without really caring what happens. Halfway through the game I began to just autopilot my way through battles. I lost my sense of investment in my units and my tactics and started to get bored of the entire actual game. I bought this for the tactical gameplay, not the story, and so I came away very disappointed.Summary: The landscapes are beautifully rendered, the lore is surprisingly well-written, and though the characters are pretty weak, the story is engaging. Unfortunately, the tactical combat as a whole leaves a lot to be desired. It's solidly constructed at its base and its key gimmick (strength and health occupying the same stat, and weaving armor into the mix) is incredibly innovative, but too often I felt there wasn't enough detail or I didn't have enough key information to dig in and play tactically, which lead to me becoming utterly disinterested in the actual tactical gameplay about halfway through. I ended up switching it down to easy and blasted through the game just to see the story.If you're looking for an engaging story framed in a beautifully constructed world, then you'll probably enjoy your time with The Banner Saga. As a tactical RPG, though, it's seriously flawed. The systems in place are intriguing but ultimately too raw and undeveloped for me to really endorse. So as a longtime fan of the genre, it's hard for me to recommend this game.			"

												A few words/short novel on the Banner Saga, one of my favourite games of the year, now that it's on sale.Bought it on sale and heard some good things about it, but definitely liked it more than I expected to.The game plays in turnbased combat system and conversations and cutscenes and it's a slow game. Not slow in a bad way (for me, anyway), as you sit and for small portion of the game just sit and watch as your group travels slowly through the snow while you listen to the music and admire the landscape.The game is set in a Viking-setting, though in a different world where the gods are dead and the sun is stuck in the sky. In the game you play named commanders of one-two caravans, travelling in snowy landscapes to lead your people to safety from war as they are attacked by a race called the Grudge. Your caravan will be affected by supplies(starvation and morale that you must take into consideration while playing.The combat is turnbased and your characters can choose to hit the strength/hp or the armour of targets,each class/characters has a special ability and otherwise have standard melee and/or ranged attacks. The ""currency"" Willpower is used to make characters move further/hit harder and is gained through levelling up characters and defeating enemies in combat. Now the progress. The game only saves in the beginning of chapters and then has fixed savepoints in the chapters so if you fcked somethig up, you might have to reload from a good while back. Importantly; some characters die because of your choices in text events. In my first playthrough I let things happen as they did and personally enjoyed being responsible and having a few ""war sucks"" moments and having to make tough/wrong choices and getting a more personal feeling of the game.The currency Reknown is used to level up characters and buy items and supplies. It is gained through winning combat. It's hard to juggle the spending on all those things, so I ended up buying exactly no items, few supplies and spending it all on levelling. (Adding gold (or something) as an additional currency to use on buying things and adding it to loot and lowering the reknown gains from battle would be nice, please).Difficulty; it's possible (at least on easy mode) to leave your entire caravan to die (your fighters will not) to starvation and poor morale. In the higher difficulties the morale will count towards your fighters strenght and hp in battle. The game is however deep you want it to be; the map (thought sadly useless) is incredibly detailed with the entire map having names and stories for every forest/lake/mountain. You can also choose to talk to characters and how thorough you want to do the conversations. Therefore it's possible to rush the game or go fully into the story. A normal playthrough is 10 hours, all conversations included. I played through the game twice, once for making my own personal choices and story and once for more achievements.Buy for the story and for the atmosphere. Don't expect explosions and action all game as it definitely has its slower times. If you want a game with depth and a good feeling to it and can handle the slower bits; definitely buy. The games leaves you with that sad-good-feeling you'd get from surviving a war and having gone through some sht, but also been through an adventure.Tip; always click the flag sin the corner when combat starts as it will show you the hp/armour of enemies at all times and not just on hover-over.Extra points to Nordic players as the language used at some points gives a few chuckles.

												The game has wonderful artwork and music, a decent premise for its plot and the combat is passable for a turn-based game. However, the story is presented almost entirely through text and the dialog is often flat. You also spend maybe half of the game just watching a rolling background. Furthermore, some of the choices you make in the game have random outcomes; practically none of them are predictable. So it makes for a frustrating experience when you repeatedly draw a bad hand.I really hope Stoic's next effort is improved. Voiced dialog would have done much for the game, as well as abbreviated travel and more focus on stories as they occur in the villages and cities. I realize constantly being on the run was supposed to be a part of the plot, but Stoic needed to show more compelling ineractions between the members of the caravan to support that. I'm of the opinion they should have just faded to black, otherwise. Because I'm really not that interested in coming across random bandits that have no impact on the major story arc. Filler is not the way to go.			"

												Note that I only put an hour and a half into this game....An hour and a half into the game, I got through 3 or so battles, so, I could tell that this is trying to be a story based game. However, the problem comes in their presentation. There is no voice over, so you are reading everything and almost all the text is dialogue. So, you don't get much of a sense of the world or the characters while going through the story. The visuals during the dialogue will just show one or two characters on the screen. This creates the problem where you don't really know who is talking, or if you are talking, or who you are supposed to be right now (since you play as many different characters).What I am trying to get to... is an hour and a half into a game, most of trying to develope the story, left me uninterested in any of the characters and uninterested with the combat. It feels like it has potential to get better, but it falls short at the start of the game.			"

												A great game where your choices matter and have disturbingly huge impact at times. The replay-value is really high because of the choices, which makes up for the games length, which is around 10h on normal difficulty. The story is not something outstandingly uniqute, but it's well executed and the characters are quite likeable (or unlikeable), which is a definite plus.The combat can be frustratingly hard at times, although once you get used it, it gets a lot easer and more strategic. Still, the abilities could've been fleshed out a little more. Nonetheless, the combat is challenging and fun.I played through the game 3x times now, and there are still some things I want to try out.Go buy it, especially now that it's on sale!			"

												I'll start off by getting the obvious out of the way: this game is lovely. The art style and animations were very enjoyable for me. You can pan around in combat, with the isometric view, and there will be little tree limbs and stuff close to the screen, which are blurred since they're supposed to be out of focus. Yes, technically, there is no floating person or camera in the sky, but it wasn't invasive or distracting, and was a nice touch. So yeah, graphically, kudos to the development team, and I cannot complain at all here.The music seemed nice while I listened to it. Eventually I stopped listening, but that was more a case of the rest of the game leaving me too disinterested or annoyed to care that much about anything else in the game.The gameplay consists of reading dialog, watching people walk in one direction without input from the player, moving slowly, until something happens, making random decisions that impact you sometimes without any way to know or have a fair guess at the outcome or what's the ""safe"" option, etc. It's like FTL in that respect, except that in FTL, here's typically a no-risk option that's very obvious. The combat is strange. Your damage decreases every time you take health damage. Is it realistic? Sure. Realism does not automatically mean it's good, though. If my HP drops to 1, I want it to be intense, with me expecting myself to die but still thinking I could win. However, in this game, you're already guaranteed to lose, so continuing to play through the fight is just a waste of time, because your chances of survival dwindle more by the turn, and it's less interesting every turn because it's not a fair fight with a sight disadvantage any more, but rather, a curb-stomping of your party.Also, if a character dies in a battle, the character is straight up dead. It did not give me the ability to revive, and it was not a scripted death. I looked online and sometimes there are scripted deaths, apparently, but this was not supposed to happen at this time. Oh! And the game had just leveled that character up for me and gave me a big wink and a nudge that I ought to spend my points I'd earned on that character. So in a challenging game with random stuff that can negatively impact you out of battle in an instant, and they're adding character death in a game that's longer than a couple of hours, in which a full roster of characters in battle is kinda important to have.I found nothing I liked, whatsoever, about the gameplay in The Banner Saga. Not one thing. If I hadn't played Shadowrun: Dragonfall, I may have simply thought that I hated the entire genre of squad turn-based strategy gams, but that's not true. I loved Shadowrun: Dragonfall, and despite me being awful at it, I persevered and the combat was very intuitive with a lot of nice strategies involved. In The Banner Saga, however, the dwindling damage every time each party member is hit, the single action per turn when not moving, the inability to hit enemies with a bow and arrow unless you are within walking distance of the enemy so the enemy still hits me, thus negating the intention of ranged weapons vs melee enemies. I even had one time I had two archers who were together, and the system wouldn't let me fire at an enemy because the other archer was in front of me. Realistic? Yeah, but throw me a dang bone! The gameplay simply annoyed me from start to finish, in all ways.I can't remember the story, and I played for several hours today. I like Game of Thrones, so it's not like political medieval/fantasy stuff doesn't appeal to me, and like I said, the art during the story was great. That said, although a great story and make a game with ""meh"" gameplay pretty cool, this game's story just didn't stimulate me enough to get interested in it or want to keep playing the game. This could have been a cool 1980s-style animated film with focus solely on plot and real events, rather than random text events and interruptions of poor combat. Since I didn't care about the story, I can find screenshots and trailers online to showcase the art style and music of the game in a bite-sized and sufficient pakage, and the game was not fun for me to play, there is absolutely no reason for me to continue playing this game, and I cannot in good faith recommend it.

												My first experience watching my caravan slowly move accross the screen in The Banner Saga:Wow, this game is so gorgeous. I can't believe it's hand-drawn. And I  NEED this soundtrack.*watches for a minute, then clicks the mouse to skip the travelling animation**waits, watching the caravan**clicks furiously, trying to skip the caravan**Gives up and allows the slow, tiny figures lull me into existential despair* Basically, this game would be a thumbs up if it were a time-killing $5 cellphone game. As it is, the battles are fun if you like strategy RPGs, but they are few and far between, so you never have enough Renown, which you need to level up and buy supplies and items. The story and characters are not at all compelling. You're constantly having to make some low-stakes choose-your-own-adventure decision. I think you're supposed to try and save the refugees travelling with me, but I was happy when they starved--fewer mouths to feed.  Plus, this game is really short with very little actual gameplay. Don't pay $20 for this. "

												Good:1. Art style2. Story is pretty interesting3. Core concept is refreshing and intriguingBad:1. Game ruined by dumb choice system. Most of dilemmas are extremely vague and outcome is impossible to predict, Which leave you totally out of control. The most of the ""choices"" you are asked to do looks like this:    ""You have some free time at your hands, what should you do:          - Take a stroll to the forest          - Sleep          - Help around caravan""     Hmm, dunno lets help?     ""You tried to help farmers to milk cows, unfortunately you scare poor cattle off and they run away stomping your fighters""    -50 supply; -50 fighters, one of your best heroes is dead, haha.The game is forcing you to play Russian roulette and one random choice will cost you a good party member (and resources you spent on him will be lost forever). It has nothing to do with harsh challenges or survivor simulation, its plainly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.And of course there are no saves (only auto save), no fun allowed. I am totally ok to lose heroes or resources if it was my fault as player - bad decision making or whatever but this is just frustrating. 2. The game has no text backtracking or some sort of journal to keep all names and lore peace together. And overall introduction to the world is done badly.3. Caravan management is part of the game but you have no tools to predict how much food you need  and how long it will take to travel to the next city.4. Combat is a bit repetitive and has few major flaws in mechanic.5. No real freedom, the only things you can do is to save few your party members that's all. Game is story line driven.While I was not severely disappointing with this game I can't recommend it, especially if you don't like rogue-like games.But with good walk-trough in hands could be fine.

												I have to painfully give this game a No. The art style is nice, and the thematics of the game as a result are cool...but that ends any pros.This game is tedious to a large degree. There is little to no strategy in the fights, and even less balancing. Its short as far as playthroughs go, but even then it DRAGS out those hours to a painful degree.The story, seems interesting at first...but thats it. There is no real story played out, no real answers provided, not even any world building or minor lore. You are thrown into this, and given so much flavor text to maps and items...but no real connection or detail to them. Why should i care about a forest with a cool name on a map...when the game never visits it, nor mentions it. The story places you in a world with pretty details from a distance, but no substance when you examine it. Perhaps it is a manner to focus on the ""characters"", hence multiple POVs being used back and forth...but the characters are barely developed, and nothing more than colorful art pieces. The whole gameplay feels mostly like it revolved around the artist wanting to show how beautiful he could make the world, and thus you are forced into Scenery Porn the game for 10-12 hours.This game is full of promise and too many good intentions. So many interesting mechanics, ideas and thoughts...that it just falls squarely flat on its face. Many systems seem pointless, others seem broken, and some just poorly thought out. I really wanted to like this game, and the numerous positive reviews seem to have glossed over so many of its flaws that i felt i needed to be a voice on the other side of this. So you can make your own decision. Dont blindly go into this off the glowing reviews alone, think about what you expected from this game and plan accordingly.Chances are, it will not live up to much of what you want from it, unless what you want is some pretty art to look at.I sincerely hope the second game improves on EVERY aspect of the game here, as it has a interesting foundation and one hopes that could lead to a good game(eventually).

												How this game ever received such positive reviews is utterly beyond me. I really really wanted to like this game but was doomed to disappointment. After 12 hours of gameplay I decided this game deserved no more of my time. PROs:- The artwork is wonderful.- Music matches the atmophere.- It's nice that they tried something new (a viking saga intead of traditional orcs & elves).- The combat can be somewhat addictive if you're a person who gets addicted easily.And thats about it. We can next move to how this game tries to destroy everything that makes a game enjoyable:CONs:- The actual storyline is pretty generic. - The game is as linear as a railroad.- Characters have no depth or personality whatsoever. Dialogue with them is limited to few sentences. You really have no reason to care about who lives and who dies.- You're constantly lacking renown (a resource used for basically everything in the game) which makes you unable to level your characters even though they have enough kills to do so.- You're constantly lacking renown to buy any items (which you really can't get by looting either because you only receive items rarely or after extra-prolonged battles)- You're constantly lacking renown to buy supplies to your caravan which leads to them starving to death.- But your caravan starving has absolutely no importance whatsoever.- You can't make any significant decisions. The only somewhat meaningful results your decisions have is some of your characters dying but since they have no personality to begin with it doesn't really matter either way.- Every character has basically one active and one passive skill that get a little bit stronger with leveling up. No skill tree or any actual character developement.- 4 or 5 different types of enemies and repetitive combat.I'd give this game 5/10. If you've got way too much time in your hands feel free to use it on Banner Saga. If you're like me and don't have the luxury of hours and hours of free time each day play something worthwhile instead.			"

												Stepping into The Banner Saga was a journey well worth the effort. I was captivated by the story from the very beginning, and as it progressed and descisions became more difficult it gave a sense of great satisfaction. The game is swift to punish you for being overly trusting and kind, and after your first play through you cant help but have a ""trust no one"" mentallity. I would have liked to see a less linear campaign as playing it through more then once is kinda the same as reading a book more then once. If you could choose where your saga took you and your band of scallywags It would add a dimension to the game that it is currently lacking. The turn based combat system makes for a chess style straegy game, and again it's quick to punish you for moving into a bad position, I really enjoyed it overall. - 8/10			"

												I have very mixed feeling about this game.Art and music are terrific, but animation is basically not here. Story is gripping, yet your involvement in it is very limited. Essentially here and there game gives you list of choices, most of them are poor, and one allows minimizing casualties or getting some bonus. And checkpoint system literally urges you to read guides from time to time, otherwise you either will find that character you like dies from event you could not predict, reading choices, or you will replay last 15 minutes trying to make another choice. Combat system is quite entertaining, but at the same time too simple and not progressing well. On normal difficulty battles became really easy... until you hit final boss.Overall, I like that game more than I do not. Well spent 11 hours, another positive Kickstarter experience.			"

												A beautifully crafted turn based strategy game. This game has an innovative and fresh turn based mechanic where injuring many enemy units is more important than destroying one unit. This creates a tense and unique combat pattern which stands out from the likes of XCom. Accompanied by masterful story telling that expands upon themes of leadership and sacrifice, hand-drawn sprites and artwork, and a historical Scandinavian inspired aesthetic theme and soundtrack, this is a turn based rpg that, above all, feels complete. Highly reccomended if you enjoyed the squad tactics elements of XCom, or are looking for a good story that makes you feel involved.			"

												Ultimately this is a game with a ton of potential but falls short on many of its core aspects. So first I will start with the best a greatest part of the game and the sole purpose it gets a thumbs-up. The visual asthetic of the game is beatiful and is one of the best in recent memory. From the music, the animation (hand drawn), the backgrounds, and just the overall theme of the game is wonderful. Full marks. It pulls of the Norse/Viking  theme amazingly, which is pretty under represented in games it seems. The world it creates is one I would love to see fleshed out so I can learn more about it. The music is so good that it is worth listing to on its own outside of the game and it only enchances every aspect of the game itself. Soo good.However, this is just barely makes up for what the game lacks. Genuinely compelling gameplay. From the combat, to the player choices, and to the overall story, the game is a bit lacking that makes the experience more tedious then enjoyable. So I will go through each of these aspects and detail why I think so.Combat: The combat is a tunr-based, strategic affair that has become all the rage in many games lately. While the base mechanics are solid in The Banner Saga they are just that. Basic. And after the first few battles they quickly all become the same sludge of tired mechanics over and over with little complexity and even fewer variations. I found that many of the character abilities were irrelevant most of the time and that archers are all but useless. Purhaps the most frusterating partr of the combat is that in one of the core mechanics it is very counter-intuitive. This is that your characters and monsters get weaker the lower life they have. So this means that it is more beneficial to leave enemies alive in a very weak state then it is to kill them. If you kill them right away the stronger enemies get mulitple turns in as the tuirn order is always one PC, then one enemy, one PC, one enemy. If there are fewer enemies left on the board the remaining ones go more often. So if you leave a few strong enemies on the board they go more often and often wreck you own characters who are weakned by fighting the other enemies. The last gripe I have with this scenario is that the 1st hit in combat is by far the most important as it will significantly weaken the opponent. So much of combat is simply jockying for position so you can hit the enemy first. Otherwise they get in the first hit and you are that much weaker staight away for it. This makes tanks much less usefull then it  might seem.Player Choice: The Banner Saga is advertised as a player choice driven game. However, the outcomes seem almost random as there is no outside information for the consequences of them. These choices can range from small boons, small annoyances, or permamnently loosing main characters. This is a real problem as this can saverely cripple your party for the rest of the game, and with no input into the decisions this is beyond frusterating. However, after more then one gameplay you realize that these choices are  not random, all (or at least most) of them are hard coded and linear for when and how they occur. This only leads to more frusteration and leads to save scumming to find the proper decisions, which only trial and error or guides can solve. Worst of all the game auto-saves at certain points and you cannot save independantly. Meaning if you do have to reload due to losing a character you spent much of your resources leveling and also losing you best items, you have to replay a large section of the game over when reloading at the last save point. Lastly, since the choices and options are all linear, replay of the game is very limited and not really worth the time to go through again.Story: The story overall is actually pretty good, and for the most part I was drawn in. The game does an admirable job of creating a suspenceful and compelling story. As your resources dwindle you must choose between getting food for followers, leveling them up, or pushing farther in your travels. Seeing your fellow clansmen die of starvation is a pity. The problem is that once you learn the mechanics of the game, you quickly realize that there is no reason not to have people starve and save you resources for leveling your heroes. The heroes are independant of the other non-warrior people, who for all purposes seem to have no purpose in the game. Once this mechanic, or lack there-of, is figured out the game becomes less compelling and more tedious as you are simply left with a basic and boring resource management game, that only has one resource and the choices you make for those resources is largely random. Also since the game is very linear either learning or looking up guides for the right choice is the fastest way and in someways make the game more enjoyable as you can then focus on the better parts of the game.So over all The Banner Saga is a game of almosts. With a bit more time in the cooker and a little more design it could have been Grade A all the way around. Instead we are left with a game that we wish made the grade as it is so beatiful and the love that went into it is very apparent. So in my humble opioon I say while it is worth spending the 10ish hours to play it, save your money for a sale and your time for when you just wanna light non-commitment game. I give it 60/100 where 50 is average.  If possbile I would give it more of a side-thumbs but that unfortunately is not an option.			"

												The Banner Saga is a turn-based...fantasy battle game? I'm not sure how exactly I'd label it. But the art is beautiful. Do you remember Dragon's Lair? One of the video games animated by Don Bluth? Or how about some of the movies he did: The Secret of NIMH, An American Tail, The Land Before Time, All Dogs Go to Heaven, Anastasia? This game's art reminds me of him and his work. And I mean the entire game looks like this, not just title cards or animations. It's amazing that they even made the battle sprites look like this.As a whole, the game is a bit of a weird Oregon Trail meets high fantasy, with trying to keep your caravan alive between plot points. There are events along the way that you have to make choices on, either to you benefit or your detriment. I thought these were randomized but it turns out they're not so I'm a little disappointed in that regard.On the battle side of things, I don't think The Banner Saga will win awards for innovation. However, it's simple and it works. I only wish there were some way to train characters since the number of battles you have in a game seems to be capped at a certain number. By this I mean battles only arise out of event opportunities, so there isn't any real way to grind and whatnot to reach higher levels. Regardless, I think characters are hard capped at level 5 anyway.The story seems interesting and I am looking forward to what's in store for the future.			"

												This game is a remarkable creation. If any of you has played Icewind Dale when it came out: it evokes the same cold, hostile, stoic world, with giants, heroes and indomitable foes. I remember playing Icewind Dale as a kid, in wonder and I am thankful for The Banner Saga and its mythos. It portrays a rich new world beautifully. Can't wait for the next one.			"

												The Banner Saga has a tedious, crappy combat system that counterintuitively punishes you for killing enemies, incredibly scarce currency that makes it hard to level your units adequately while never telling you how many supplies you'll need for your current journey and a King of Dragon Pass style CYOA, which doesn't really work because you can lose the few units you've actually managed to upgrade out of the blue. I wish this game was better than it is.			"

												Music is really good, art and story is nice. But.. that's pretty much it. The gameplay is repetitive, combat is simple and not very interesting. Dialogue options mostly don't matter, and there's no way to predict what any of them will do, anyway. You kind of hope something like asking more information doesn't flat out kill one of your heroes.I'd kind of want to see the storyline to the end, but the game itself is so bad that's not really an option. This would've been way better as an animation, graphic novel or.. anything.			"

												Good game, 9/10+ Disney-like graphics+ interesting world+ good story (waiting for TBS2! hype hype)+ great map+ turn-based combat, similat to HoMM but entirely different+ choices really matter+ nice atmosphere of constant danger+ nice animations during combat- caravan management is hard as ♥♥♥♥- the road is almost linear, you travel only a small part of the map- too shortThis is a nice game which I liked a lot. Game is easy and provides a relaxing entretainemet. Only the last battle is extremely hard and stands out from the rest of the game. I've played it twice and for me, two gameplays were similar (maybe that's my choices fault). On the other hand, can become very tedious at times. If you wanna try something different from rpgs, platforms, fps/tpp, that focuses mainly on the story, simply buy the game. But take into account that it is almost a only-a-story game and could be easily made into an animated film.			"

												The story and music blew me away. I heard good things about this game before, now that I've played it I understand why. I was hooked on it from start to finish. Nice challange all around for resource management and the battle itself, and choices you make. They have consequences in this game.  With that said the 3 things that stood out the most for me for The Banner Saga is the Story, the art, and the music. A Masterpiece, well done. Highly recommended if you love SRPG, A nice mixture of 13th warrior, Vikings, Lord of the Rings.Updating this review for the nominations, this game is on my nomiation list for steam awards. Great Game.			"

												I got the game because i'm a big fan of tactical RPG and missed good one on PC, and i was disapointed.While the game have nice music a looks nice it started to feel frustrating after some time and the frustration kept growing. It may be a good game for some but not if you are interested in the tactical aspect.The things i didn't like:-The story jumps at a point and you have to play with an entirely different team before getting back to the first team.-You gain and loose characters based on story not because you played poorly and lost them. It's hard to build a team composition and then loose a key member without a warning.-The supply mechanic is irritating, at the end of the game i started to sacrifice lv ups and items to get more supplies only to get them stolen and have my peaple starve anyway.I felt more like watching a movie that keps asking me to click the play button. Yes you make decisions but you dont have any control. Everytime i invested items and renown to build a charcter I felt more fear tha he will soon leave the team due to some story stuff than satisfaction from empowering my team.			"

During the game you are journeying away from the baddies known as the, ""Dredge"".  You will consume food supplies each day.  Along the way stories develop and events comes up which you have to make decision.  Your decision affects your troop morale, etc. It reminded me of playing the Oregon Trail back in the days.

I cried multiple times while playing and in the ending  [Redacted for the review, don't want to spoil it] and then cried as the game ended. In a beautiful way though, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The sorrow of the story, a world that (may) be dying. A race that may be going extinct, the struggle to survive, I loved it.It played like an old choose your own adventure, or maybe one of those old text based exploring games (Zork?) but I was completely gripped.

												I REALLY wanted to like this game.  I love tactical turn-based rpgs, the art and music are beautiful, and the Viking theme is a breath of fresh air.  However, this game bored me to death.  The combat gets old after a couple hours because the strategy is the same in every battle (chipping away at the enemy armor while hiding your weaker units behind dudes with shields).  It doesn't help that the story and characters are both bland.  It's almost as if a bunch of artists got together with this great theme but forgot they had to (or didn't know how to) make a fun game in order to tie everything together.  What's disappointing is that there are so many similar games (that did it right) they could have used as inspiration: Fire Emblem, XCOM, Final Fantasy Tactics, Advance Wars, etc.  These games focus on gameplay first; story and theme complement gameplay but are ultimately secondary.  The Banner Saga does the opposite and comes up short because of it.			"

												It really is like oregon trail mixed with fire emblem with a viking aesthetic. If you don't like any of that, then this game isn't for you. Plain and simple. On your journey, you will encounter various scripted events and battles. Your moral judgment will be tested. Depending on how you answer events, the course of the story is slightly altered; but I'd imagine the majority of the game remains the same.There are some flaws here. The game feels rigid and half baked at points. You'll fight two major types of enemies, in two variations; ranged and melee. This bothered me a little throughout my time playing. You'd travel the world, but you'd fight the same enemies. As the game progresses, you get to fight slightly stronger versions of these enemies. Sometimes they might be palette swapped, but honestly if you've fought one raider you've fought them all.The story is one of the strongest parts of this game. I don't think I would've finished the game if the plot didn't suck me in like it did. I cared about these characters; especially after you got to investing so much into them to make them effective fighters. It makes the plot that much more interesting. On top of that, the gameplay is pretty solid. You're given an assortment of tools, and its up to you to make it work. It's all a matter of taste. If what I've described sounds interesting, then this game is more or less worth a buy. There's definite room for improvement, and I have some minor gripes with the game; but overall I'm pleased.

												The Banner Saga is an adventure game featuring basic RPG elements and a Norse/Viking theme, where the player leads a caravan of civilians and warriors across a wilderness while trying to escape constant attacks by a race of metallic creatures called Dredge.There's an enjoyable turn based combat system that has some tactical depth. Battles take place on a square grid, and the player has a party of up to 6 warriors. You'll often start the fight outnumbered, but the movement order is similar to chess where the player moves one unit, then the AI moves one unit, and so on, which means having less units isn't necessarily a disadvantage.Each warrior has two main characteristics - strength and armour. Strength represents both the amount of damage inflicted by a successful attack, and the health of the warrior. When strength reaches zero the warrior is knocked out of the fight, but it also means a warrior who is close to death will do less damage. Armour indicates how difficult it is to successfully damage a unit's strength - if their armour is higher than your strength, you probably won't hit, so sometimes you need to weaken the enemy's armour first before you can actually hurt them.Positioning is also important. Varl (giants) take up 4 grid spaces instead of 1 and can easily block the movement of both friendly and enemy warriors. Archers have weaker armour so its a good idea to keep them behind melee units. My one complaint about the combat is the lack of variety. Pretty much every unit for both your side and the Dredge, is either melee or archer. There's hardly any offensive magic, and no healing, so most fights play out the same way from a tactical point of view.Outside of combat you'll have choices to make when certain events happen. Most choices have consequences, which could be good or bad. For example you might encounter another group of people on the road who want to join you, and you can accept or refuse. If you accept, you might gain warriors, or they might steal some of your food. If you refuse, they might leave peacefully or they might just attack you.The story is okay. It starts slow but gets better after a couple of hours. I never really cared about any of the Varl characters, their personalities didn't develop beyond ""I'm a warrior and want to kill stuff"", but I did like the main two Humans, Rook and Alette. Their father/daughter relationship at least gave me a reason to care about keeping them alive.However, the game loses points for presentation. There are lots of nicely animated cutscenes of people walking in a straight line through the snow, but unfortunately as soon as any action happens, its either described by a wall of text, or through dialogue scenes between motionless character portraits - the majority of which has no voice acting.Overall The Banner Saga is a decent game, but I wouldn't class it as a ""must play"". If you enjoy turn based combat it should entertain you for the 10 hours needed to finish the campaign, but you might want to wait for a sale.			"

												Great artistic style, real consequences for your actions, challenging gameplay  and an enthralling story that seems to easily pull you in and keep you there. It's a game that's easy to learn but hard to master, which will keep you coming back for more. Over all it's a great game but it's not without it's flaws:The hardest setting can be a tad ridiculous and demands a bit of perfection... If you're looking to just enjoy the story it's best played on the easiest setting as I found the final battle and latter half of the game a bit unbalanced in terms of difficulty... I'm sure normal mode is equally as challenging as I found hard almost impossible to complete near the end.The story is also a bit long and there should of been a way to skip the boring walking segments but I suppose it's all part of the artistic style that's supposed to emerse you in the game.The leveling and reward system needs a bit of tweaking... I don't really enjoy how each character get's stronger based on their individual amount of kills... It kind of pigeon holes you in to using a single set up the entire game. Using a single strategy might not always work out in certain fights which can leave you kind of gimped in the late game.7 / 10			"

												The Banner Saga has a tedious, crappy combat system that counterintuitively punishes you for killing enemies, incredibly scarce currency that makes it hard to level your units adequately while never telling you how many supplies you'll need for your current journey and a King of Dragon Pass style CYOA, which doesn't really work because you can lose the few units you've actually managed to upgrade out of the blue. I wish this game was better than it is.			"

												Music is really good, art and story is nice. But.. that's pretty much it. The gameplay is repetitive, combat is simple and not very interesting. Dialogue options mostly don't matter, and there's no way to predict what any of them will do, anyway. You kind of hope something like asking more information doesn't flat out kill one of your heroes.I'd kind of want to see the storyline to the end, but the game itself is so bad that's not really an option. This would've been way better as an animation, graphic novel or.. anything.			"

												I got the game because i'm a big fan of tactical RPG and missed good one on PC, and i was disapointed.While the game have nice music a looks nice it started to feel frustrating after some time and the frustration kept growing. It may be a good game for some but not if you are interested in the tactical aspect.The things i didn't like:-The story jumps at a point and you have to play with an entirely different team before getting back to the first team.-You gain and loose characters based on story not because you played poorly and lost them. It's hard to build a team composition and then loose a key member without a warning.-The supply mechanic is irritating, at the end of the game i started to sacrifice lv ups and items to get more supplies only to get them stolen and have my peaple starve anyway.I felt more like watching a movie that keps asking me to click the play button. Yes you make decisions but you dont have any control. Everytime i invested items and renown to build a charcter I felt more fear tha he will soon leave the team due to some story stuff than satisfaction from empowering my team.			"

												Great Art style was what drew me to the game.  Just so happens the game is also good and addicting.  You will play from four different perspective from each of the characters.  During the game you are journeying away from the baddies known as the, ""Dredge"".  You will consume food supplies each day.  Along the way stories develop and events comes up which you have to make decision.  Your decision affects your troop morale, etc. It reminded me of playing the Oregon Trail back in the days.  Its nice I like it.  This is the Single player only.. the multiplayer is seperate and is free to play.  Just as addictive.			"

												Amazing, how simple graphics and a simple interface coupled with an interesting story and straight forward but still challenging strategical combat system can surprise you and create such a beautiful game. I had been reminded of some of the animated movies seen,  what seems now so long ago. The graphical concept and musical score go well together too. The combat is turn by turn basis with enough options to chose from to either achieve great victory or royally mess up. The storyline gives you some options and playground which do have an effect on how the story progesses.This is one of the few games that I don't regret buying. I loved it, recommend it and hope to have a lot of more fun with.			"

												This game is very poor. It is a linear procession of tactical turn based battles which have very little variety. There are very few choices to be made throughout the game and the consequences are trivial. The game moves very slowly through animations of caravan crawling through the landscape. There is hardly any management for the caravan except buying supplies and there are lengthy, unvoiced, character dialogues.I cannot believe the reviews this game has received and the £18.99 i spent on it was a total waste. The game is over in less than 24 hours and ends most unsatifactorily. It is a very poor game of little content and I have to describe it as an utter rip-off.			"

												A great game for the most part. The turn based system where each character has a turn and it alternates between you and the computer makes you think about each move. The parts between battles are interesting and the choices you make may seem of no consequence at first but later may turn out to be the difference between life and death for your caravan.The combat works with you and the computer taking it in turns to move a character on the grid based battlefield. You can only move one character per turn and the character you move is determined by the rotation order you set before the battle in the heroes menu. Each unit has two bars health, which dictates how close the unit is to being put out of action as well as how much damage you do, and defense, which dictates how much damage an enemy can do to that unit. Then there's willpower which is restored between battles, this can be used to move further and strike harder. Combat also has an effect on the narritive so you'll find yourself cringing to avoid losing a unit because each unit has a story and personality which have been quite well built.On the subject of the narritive you have a lot of decisions to make which all have consequences however significant. The world building all happens here and with a bit of help from the map you can choose how much you want to emerse yourself in the game world.All that being said I do have two main issues with the game first up, as beautiful as the graphical style of the game is, the rather long and frequent sections where you just watch your caravan roll on as the days  pass with an unmoving sun while relaxing for some can be tedious for others. My second issue is the end which I will not spoil but it feels abrupt like the devs just got tired of writing and so stopped, luckily I've heard of a sequel in the works so that's that problem solved. There are other elements I've not gone into such as managing the caravan and leveling units and buying items and supplies all done with the in game currency, renown.This game is as a good, solid, fun strategy rpg despite slightly tedious sections and an abrupt ending.I would give this game 8/10 you should buy it if you like a good story and a fairly challenging strategy rpg.

Combat could use a bit more terrain variety, and some of the dynamics of combat can be a little wonky, but these weren't major problems for me.Now that you can have multiple saves going, this is a game I'd suggest to anyone who likes this tactical fantasy type game.

												What a great game!Anyone with eyes in their head to look at the screenshots can see that it's gorgeous. But the gameplay is unique, too. You play the leader of a caravan of refugees trying to survive the end times. You constantly worry about supplies and survivng the next battle. And around every corner lurks another unexpected event.The combat system is turn-based and not too compliacted, but not too simple either. It's just right. There are a ton of character classes (actually, almost every character is their own class) and a lot of possibilities for tactics and building the core team you prefer.The story is very well written. It's got a lot of human drama and the lore behind it all is great. The game ends on a kinda sad note--at least for me it did, because the course of the game varies depending on your choices, and I don't know how drastically that is, but I assume not very much. After the cliffhanger ending, I'm looking forward to the sequel.Recommended!			"

Tonally it can be compared to Pillars of The Earth, Vikings or Game of Thrones.The game focuses on your caravan which needs to make the trek across the lands in order to help stop the Dredge, a race of ancient monsters. You can play as various Human characters and Varl characters, which are giant Vikings.Positive+ Good gameplay, reminds me of Final Fantasy Tactics.+ Large cast of interesting characters.+ Very solid storyline and cutscenes.+ Battles that focus on your ability to plan ahead and pay attention.+ Gorgeous art-style in vein of Ralph Bakshi.

												A couple of people have already asked me my initial impressions.. this game really isn't for me. While I love the animation and art style, the tactical gameplay for me has been a bit boring. The RPG system looks pretty light. Sure, you can build a party, but when the culmination of tactical party RPGs is Final Fantasy Tactics, and I *loathe* that game, I feel I'm not the target audience and should have read a bit more about this game before buying it. I've found the story so far somewhat forgettable (would have been a lot more enjoyable for me with full voice.. voice is sorely lacking).. or, honestly, even subtitles for the parts with voice.This is one of those few games that I can admit is very likely a very good game. It's just not a game for me. It's unfair of me to not recommend it, but I feel people who like this genre of game will enjoy the hell out of it.			"

												This immersive, story-driven strategy game will take you into the winter frostlands of kings and vikings. Beautifully crafted character animations and backgrounds make this game a moving work of art. The Banner Saga plays like a standard tactical strategy game, with tile squares and a good variety units with unique abilities. Your goal is to utilize your characters in the most effective way in combat to reduce casualties and ensure the longetivity of your clan.Morever, the game comes with a unique consequence system that obligates you to apply yourself to being a true leader of a fragile alliance between Varls (vikings) and humans, in the onslaught of incoming evil. However, it should be added, there are plenty of possibilities where you can evade those duties. These sequences brought out the most dramatic, seat-gripping suspense that will make The Banner Saga a rememberal experience. The only short coming to this game is that the storyline was too intriguing, and therefore when the story cut short, with much of the legacy untold, I was left dissapointed and wanting more. However, this is a similar feeling to most good games I have played, so this does not make The Banner Saga any less of a good experience.I hope you enjoy.			"

												I REALLY wanted to like this game.  I love tactical turn-based rpgs, the art and music are beautiful, and the Viking theme is a breath of fresh air.  However, this game bored me to death.  The combat gets old after a couple hours because the strategy is the same in every battle (chipping away at the enemy armor while hiding your weaker units behind dudes with shields).  It doesn't help that the story and characters are both bland.  It's almost as if a bunch of artists got together with this great theme but forgot they had to (or didn't know how to) make a fun game in order to tie everything together.  What's disappointing is that there are so many similar games (that did it right) they could have used as inspiration: Fire Emblem, XCOM, Final Fantasy Tactics, Advance Wars, etc.  These games focus on gameplay first; story and theme complement gameplay but are ultimately secondary.  The Banner Saga does the opposite and comes up short because of it.			"

												Yet another game that has been sitting in my Steam library for a while, and coming off the tactics/strategy of XCOM, I thought now would be a great time to dive in. It's always said when people talk about this game, but it bears repeating that the artistic design of this game is just superb. The OST by Austin Wintory is just absolutely fantastic, and definitely among some of his best work that I've heard. The visual style is truly gorgeous, particularly the caravan scenes which do such a superb job conveying the sense of scale of the journey. The setting itself is pretty darn great, as many games do a ""post-apocalyptic"" or ""end of the world"" setting, but very few manage to convey the sense of finality and hopelessness that The Banner Saga manages to. Even the way the game presents choices for you to make as you lead your caravan was pretty well done. The kudos aside, I did have some gripes about the gameplay. I understood what the game was trying to do with battle spacing, armor/strength gauges and the back-and-forth turn system it used, but I don't know that it ever really succeeded. Overall though, it's an experience worth having, especially if you love Norse themes as much as I do.			"

This game combined the elements which make a functional and fluid modern UI with its charming drawn styling.Along with its turn-based combat, providing an interesting challenge as you attempt to race to the end of the journey, the only disappointing aspect is that the banner doesn't get 'filled' with your exploits.

												When I first saw the Banner Saga: ""Looks like a pretentious kickstarter flashgame got a little big for it's britches. Whatever, it's on sale.""After playing the Banner Saga for several hours: ""IVER! NOOOOOOO!!!! Why God? WHY?""  ""Feed my caravan, or let them starve to level up my squad? hmmm..."" ""Onleiff! Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!""But really though, this game will suck you in faster than you can possibly expect. The artwork is beautiful, the lore is unique, the story is enticingly mysterious, and while the guts of the mechanics seem pretty basic, you'll find yourself getting a lot more invested and involved than you'd expect. If you enjoy RPGs, you shouldn't pass this up.			"

												Great artistic style, real consequences for your actions, challenging gameplay  and an enthralling story that seems to easily pull you in and keep you there. It's a game that's easy to learn but hard to master, which will keep you coming back for more. Over all it's a great game but it's not without it's flaws:The hardest setting can be a tad ridiculous and demands a bit of perfection... If you're looking to just enjoy the story it's best played on the easiest setting as I found the final battle and latter half of the game a bit unbalanced in terms of difficulty... I'm sure normal mode is equally as challenging as I found hard almost impossible to complete near the end.The story is also a bit long and there should of been a way to skip the boring walking segments but I suppose it's all part of the artistic style that's supposed to emerse you in the game.The leveling and reward system needs a bit of tweaking... I don't really enjoy how each character get's stronger based on their individual amount of kills... It kind of pigeon holes you in to using a single set up the entire game. Using a single strategy might not always work out in certain fights which can leave you kind of gimped in the late game.7 / 10			"

												Definitely worth a play, if you enjoy tactical RPG style games.The travelling part of the game is sort of like a choose your own adventure book, where your dialogue choices all have unique consequences and outcomes. That part of the game is uniquely interesting.The combat is above average difficulty. Some of your characters will die. It's a lot of fun to try out fifferent strategies, and find the playstyle that works for you.The character customization is very limited, but you do have a choice in how your party progresses in levels. There are basic stat distributions, and you have to really monitor your resources if you want your party to funcition optimally.Short and sweet version of the review; if you don't like tactical RPGs, then it's not for you. If you enjoy a compelling story and some solid tactical elements, then try it out.			"

												Ultimately this is a game with a ton of potential but falls short on many of its core aspects. So first I will start with the best a greatest part of the game and the sole purpose it gets a thumbs-up. The visual asthetic of the game is beatiful and is one of the best in recent memory. From the music, the animation (hand drawn), the backgrounds, and just the overall theme of the game is wonderful. Full marks. It pulls of the Norse/Viking  theme amazingly, which is pretty under represented in games it seems. The world it creates is one I would love to see fleshed out so I can learn more about it. The music is so good that it is worth listing to on its own outside of the game and it only enchances every aspect of the game itself. Soo good.However, this is just barely makes up for what the game lacks. Genuinely compelling gameplay. From the combat, to the player choices, and to the overall story, the game is a bit lacking that makes the experience more tedious then enjoyable. So I will go through each of these aspects and detail why I think so.Combat: The combat is a tunr-based, strategic affair that has become all the rage in many games lately. While the base mechanics are solid in The Banner Saga they are just that. Basic. And after the first few battles they quickly all become the same sludge of tired mechanics over and over with little complexity and even fewer variations. I found that many of the character abilities were irrelevant most of the time and that archers are all but useless. Purhaps the most frusterating partr of the combat is that in one of the core mechanics it is very counter-intuitive. This is that your characters and monsters get weaker the lower life they have. So this means that it is more beneficial to leave enemies alive in a very weak state then it is to kill them. If you kill them right away the stronger enemies get mulitple turns in as the tuirn order is always one PC, then one enemy, one PC, one enemy. If there are fewer enemies left on the board the remaining ones go more often. So if you leave a few strong enemies on the board they go more often and often wreck you own characters who are weakned by fighting the other enemies. The last gripe I have with this scenario is that the 1st hit in combat is by far the most important as it will significantly weaken the opponent. So much of combat is simply jockying for position so you can hit the enemy first. Otherwise they get in the first hit and you are that much weaker staight away for it. This makes tanks much less usefull then it  might seem.Player Choice: The Banner Saga is advertised as a player choice driven game. However, the outcomes seem almost random as there is no outside information for the consequences of them. These choices can range from small boons, small annoyances, or permamnently loosing main characters. This is a real problem as this can saverely cripple your party for the rest of the game, and with no input into the decisions this is beyond frusterating. However, after more then one gameplay you realize that these choices are  not random, all (or at least most) of them are hard coded and linear for when and how they occur. This only leads to more frusteration and leads to save scumming to find the proper decisions, which only trial and error or guides can solve. Worst of all the game auto-saves at certain points and you cannot save independantly. Meaning if you do have to reload due to losing a character you spent much of your resources leveling and also losing you best items, you have to replay a large section of the game over when reloading at the last save point. Lastly, since the choices and options are all linear, replay of the game is very limited and not really worth the time to go through again.Story: The story overall is actually pretty good, and for the most part I was drawn in. The game does an admirable job of creating a suspenceful and compelling story. As your resources dwindle you must choose between getting food for followers, leveling them up, or pushing farther in your travels. Seeing your fellow clansmen die of starvation is a pity. The problem is that once you learn the mechanics of the game, you quickly realize that there is no reason not to have people starve and save you resources for leveling your heroes. The heroes are independant of the other non-warrior people, who for all purposes seem to have no purpose in the game. Once this mechanic, or lack there-of, is figured out the game becomes less compelling and more tedious as you are simply left with a basic and boring resource management game, that only has one resource and the choices you make for those resources is largely random. Also since the game is very linear either learning or looking up guides for the right choice is the fastest way and in someways make the game more enjoyable as you can then focus on the better parts of the game.So over all The Banner Saga is a game of almosts. With a bit more time in the cooker and a little more design it could have been Grade A all the way around. Instead we are left with a game that we wish made the grade as it is so beatiful and the love that went into it is very apparent. So in my humble opioon I say while it is worth spending the 10ish hours to play it, save your money for a sale and your time for when you just wanna light non-commitment game. I give it 60/100 where 50 is average.  If possbile I would give it more of a side-thumbs but that unfortunately is not an option.			"

												I REALLY wanted to like this game.  I love tactical turn-based rpgs, the art and music are beautiful, and the Viking theme is a breath of fresh air.  However, this game bored me to death.  The combat gets old after a couple hours because the strategy is the same in every battle (chipping away at the enemy armor while hiding your weaker units behind dudes with shields).  It doesn't help that the story and characters are both bland.  It's almost as if a bunch of artists got together with this great theme but forgot they had to (or didn't know how to) make a fun game in order to tie everything together.  What's disappointing is that there are so many similar games (that did it right) they could have used as inspiration: Fire Emblem, XCOM, Final Fantasy Tactics, Advance Wars, etc.  These games focus on gameplay first; story and theme complement gameplay but are ultimately secondary.  The Banner Saga does the opposite and comes up short because of it.			"

												I got the game because i'm a big fan of tactical RPG and missed good one on PC, and i was disapointed.While the game have nice music a looks nice it started to feel frustrating after some time and the frustration kept growing. It may be a good game for some but not if you are interested in the tactical aspect.The things i didn't like:-The story jumps at a point and you have to play with an entirely different team before getting back to the first team.-You gain and loose characters based on story not because you played poorly and lost them. It's hard to build a team composition and then loose a key member without a warning.-The supply mechanic is irritating, at the end of the game i started to sacrifice lv ups and items to get more supplies only to get them stolen and have my peaple starve anyway.I felt more like watching a movie that keps asking me to click the play button. Yes you make decisions but you dont have any control. Everytime i invested items and renown to build a charcter I felt more fear tha he will soon leave the team due to some story stuff than satisfaction from empowering my team.			"

												Great Art style was what drew me to the game.  Just so happens the game is also good and addicting.  You will play from four different perspective from each of the characters.  During the game you are journeying away from the baddies known as the, ""Dredge"".  You will consume food supplies each day.  Along the way stories develop and events comes up which you have to make decision.  Your decision affects your troop morale, etc. It reminded me of playing the Oregon Trail back in the days.  Its nice I like it.  This is the Single player only.. the multiplayer is seperate and is free to play.  Just as addictive.			"

												This is a tactical game about minimizing damage by looking at the turn order and weakening the strength bars of whatever will be attacking soon and keeping out of attack range of whatever you can't weaken as much as possible. Even if one side has 15 units and the other has 5, each side alternates moving 1 unit at a time, so you'll find yourself weakening enemies down to very low strength and ignoring them until your finale, because killing them would mean their unweakened units get to attack more frequently. This is strange and even stupid, but the game would be incredibly simple without this extra layer of management.It's a lot more mathematical than similar tactical games such as Advance Wars, Fire Emblem, and King's Bounty. You can often find your turns being mostly wastes because you didn't look forward enough or you overspent your willpower. Most tactical games become puzzle games once you boil away enough intuition. It takes very little boiling for this game to reach puzzle status. The story and choices and dialogue are quite alright but are almost entirely flavor and affect gameplay marginally. It starts out with an ""evil swarming monster apocalypse"" trope, fortunately developing into something much less simple towards the end. The ending brings zero conclusion and sets up the sequel in no different way than any other arc in the game.I can't say this game is on par with any games from the aforementioned franchises. It is okay. I will likely play the sequel for the story someday when it is very cheap and I have enough alcohol to tolerate the gameplay.			"

												The story and lore are all there, and its very cool. Theres some plot hooks they raised and never used but i guess there is supposed to be more games in the series(?) so i can't say thats a bad thing. The visuals, despite being rather simple in their animations, are beautiful for the most part. The story does have the problems that rise from serial(?) games, such as story points that dont really go anywhere this game and leave you wanting more, ie romance subplot (if you can call it that. Not really in depth, but admittedly cute) and just standard problems like despite little choices, the game is still very much on rails. The choices are mostly quite small, only effecting how many soldiers you have, and how much you have to supply them with. It also does something i don't like in multiple choice games where there is no sequence of events that can keep bad things from ever happening. I like to have a path, however hard to achieve, that will result in bright sunshine land everything is ok, but again this isnt a mark down just a warning. Also the final moment is a little too predictable, but still beautiful and kind of emotional. Combat is good, quite simple. They have health, they have armour. Armour protects health, take it out to do more health damage. Simple, good. I wish there was some form of Zone of Control that would stop people walking through 5 of your ammassed crew to hit the squishy in the back but the giants are OP enough so it doesnt particularly matter. The ""war"" aspect of the game is Rush them, Play defense, or run pretty much and you can fight to save casualties. I was rarely out of the advantage though cause i picked up every village, though this meant i used my renown on supplies rather than good items or levelling Fun game, buy it on sale and watch out for possible new ones.

												The Banner Saga combines a rich and original mythology with an immersive soundtrack and some stunningly animated vistas to create an engaging and heartfelt story of travel across a vast and desolate landscape. The Banner Saga throw mny decisions your way and it s hard to gauge what effect they will have, it can cost the lives of key characters or prove to crush the morale of the people that follow you. The writers have done a wonderful job of ensuring that you care enough about the long-list of characters that you will labour and sweat on key decisions. It is all backed up by a servicable, if not overly complex turn-based combat sytem that throw plenty of different unit types, with different abilities at you that will enable you to face combat situations in whichever way you feel comfortable. I'm looking forward to seeing what they do next with the sequal.			"

												The Banner Saga is, quite frankly, a tour-de-force in storytelling. It uses a very simplistic style and point of view for cutscenes, but that is in no way a knock against it. The game manages to bring life to still images, by simply adding a little animation to them, such as the wind blowing on a character's hair and beard or someone's eye twitching.Even with 2D graphics, the techniques mentioned up add more depths and character to the setting. In addition, the impressive landscapes and the immeasurable scale of all the vestiges of an old civilzation where Gods walked the earth, makes the world simply breathtaking to look at. Combined with the outstanding soundtrack by Austin Wintory, you'll almost feel like the snow is falling on your head, that your feet are soaked from walking in the forest, and sometimes you'll even feel, much like the characters, that all hope is lost. The game has a pervasive sense of dread to it, as you are just a ragtag crew of norsemen and women, trying to beat seemingly insurmountable odds. Even on Easy, I found the game quite difficult, but it could be just me making bad tactical decisions. The game is very punishing and the AI, a lot of times will take advantage of errors in your tactics. While it can be a little frustrating, I found this dynamic to be quite enjoyable and it kept me coming back for more.			"

												First take notice of the amount of hours I have played. Realize that some portion of those hours actually was from me banging my head on the keyboad trying to beat the last boss battle during my first playthrough, which was on the hard difficult setting where I limped my way to the ending in the final chapter due to a few ""bad"" choices along with a flawed supplies mechanic that is still manageable for the most part. The battle was so difficult that subsequently in an update through various aspects the bellower was nerfed a bit primarily on lower than hard difficulty, but also characters brought into the final boss battle are no longer injured beforehand. Given this realize that I definitely am aware about the flaws of this game and that this review is based on the updated version having done multiple playthroughs. In short here are the positivies and negatives about the game:Positives: 1. In many ways an ehanced Oregon trail type of game. 2. Interesting world environment, plot, characters, and ambiance from music selection3. Combat can be challenging and fun (look up combat gameplay before hand though as this opinion could vary)Negatives: 1. Poor resource mechanic where renown earned from choices and battle is used for both upgrading characters and purchasing supplies to prevent starvation (managable largely except special care should be taken in chapter 2 to avoid buying supplies as much as possible until chapter 4.)2. Oversights such as supplies in Frostvier during chapter 4 automatically being about 3 days worth regardless of what supplies were in chapter 2. Also renown spent and items can be wasted if characters die or leave... you can load though.3. Hard difficulty is unforgiving especially given negative # 1 and certain poor choices so avoid until after first normal playthrough (trust me). Normal difficulty should still be fine for most people and easy should be... well easy.4. This one is not that negative, but can be annoying. You can not save manually it saves automatically over time. There are plenty of places to load though, which I know from... first hand experience.False Top Review Complaints: 1. Choices don't matter/impact the game. 2. The story goes nowhere1. Your choices have a direct consequence on the size of your forces, the difficulty of combat, certain limited character dialogue, what events occur, and whether characters live or die. Obviously as in any RPG choices only matter as much as you asign them. If you don't care about your caravan or the characters in your party then of course they don't matter, but to claim they don't impact the game (or in a way you would like) is ridiculous. There is a difference between choices impacting the game and not being satisfied with what one expects or wants out of a choice's impact. I would agree choice impact regarding camp dialogue is limited and not as deveoped as I like, but it's not game breaking.2. This first banner saga game is soley about surviving the dredge threat. The varl perspective portion of the playthrough, which involves completing a certain objective despite the dredge threat is actually no different. If you make certain dialogue options you realize your actions are actually helping/attempting to end dredge threat albiet indirectly. To complain that the game is about running from the dredge then making a final stand is similar to complaining that the reapers were not eliminated as a threat in Mass Effect 1 or that Oregon trail is about surviving until reaching a certain city. The first game of any trilogy is about setting up the environment and getting gamers to know and bond with characters and the story. It is about concluding a portion of the story, while leaving enough open for there to be more. The bellower isn't some random boss. It is some sort of champion of the dredge that is primarliy a large part of how the dredge are able to win against (almost) any threat. I really don't want to spoil certain story elements about the dredge or the reasons behind what is going on. Just know that there is a lot more than get to point a and fight some boss.    Recommendation: Buy this game at a price you find acceptable. If you are used to paying $60 for a game then the $20 price should be fine. For everyone else used to steam prices I am sure this game will be on sale at some point as it was in the past especially during steam summer sale. If the price is $10 anyone should buy it, while $15 or $20 is probably more for RPG fans looking for a good story, with some mechanical game flaws as mentioned, that will only be even better in the sequel.

												Tactical RPGs are some of my favorite games and this one did not disappoint. It had some unique battle mechanics such as the ability to break the opponent's armor, and the unit's strength serving as both HP and damage (so units who are hurt will deal less damage). Also turns always alternate between you and the enemy even if you have more troops than him and visa versa. This called for some unconventional strategies such as leaving certain opponents crippled rather than dead.There is an economic element to the game where you have to spend renown (experience) to develop your characters, buy stats-increasing items and buy supplies for your caravan. Balancing between those three actions was quite challenging and interesting to do.The story is reminiscent of the old Viking sagas (even the word Saga comes from the old Viking heroic tales) with tales of great heroism among a bleak and severe environment. It's you and your small party against an unforgiving world and bad things happen to you. Yet, there is great beauty and nobility in the actions of the characters who remain hopeful and honorable despite great adversity.The graphics are gorgeous and the soundtrack complements the feel of the game quite nicely.Overall this is a very solid, entertaining and engaging title. Looking forward to part 2!			"

												A great game for the most part. The turn based system where each character has a turn and it alternates between you and the computer makes you think about each move. The parts between battles are interesting and the choices you make may seem of no consequence at first but later may turn out to be the difference between life and death for your caravan.The combat works with you and the computer taking it in turns to move a character on the grid based battlefield. You can only move one character per turn and the character you move is determined by the rotation order you set before the battle in the heroes menu. Each unit has two bars health, which dictates how close the unit is to being put out of action as well as how much damage you do, and defense, which dictates how much damage an enemy can do to that unit. Then there's willpower which is restored between battles, this can be used to move further and strike harder. Combat also has an effect on the narritive so you'll find yourself cringing to avoid losing a unit because each unit has a story and personality which have been quite well built.On the subject of the narritive you have a lot of decisions to make which all have consequences however significant. The world building all happens here and with a bit of help from the map you can choose how much you want to emerse yourself in the game world.All that being said I do have two main issues with the game first up, as beautiful as the graphical style of the game is, the rather long and frequent sections where you just watch your caravan roll on as the days  pass with an unmoving sun while relaxing for some can be tedious for others. My second issue is the end which I will not spoil but it feels abrupt like the devs just got tired of writing and so stopped, luckily I've heard of a sequel in the works so that's that problem solved. There are other elements I've not gone into such as managing the caravan and leveling units and buying items and supplies all done with the in game currency, renown.This game is as a good, solid, fun strategy rpg despite slightly tedious sections and an abrupt ending.I would give this game 8/10 you should buy it if you like a good story and a fairly challenging strategy rpg.

The overall story was also intruiguing, though could have used clarity in parts, such as identifying perspectives and the interweaving of the groups.

												Good game, 9/10+ Disney-like graphics+ interesting world+ good story (waiting for TBS2! hype hype)+ great map+ turn-based combat, similat to HoMM but entirely different+ choices really matter+ nice atmosphere of constant danger+ nice animations during combat- caravan management is hard as ♥♥♥♥- the road is almost linear, you travel only a small part of the map- too shortThis is a nice game which I liked a lot. Game is easy and provides a relaxing entretainemet. Only the last battle is extremely hard and stands out from the rest of the game. I've played it twice and for me, two gameplays were similar (maybe that's my choices fault). On the other hand, can become very tedious at times. If you wanna try something different from rpgs, platforms, fps/tpp, that focuses mainly on the story, simply buy the game. But take into account that it is almost a only-a-story game and could be easily made into an animated film.			"

												The story and music blew me away. I heard good things about this game before, now that I've played it I understand why. I was hooked on it from start to finish. Nice challange all around for resource management and the battle itself, and choices you make. They have consequences in this game.  With that said the 3 things that stood out the most for me for The Banner Saga is the Story, the art, and the music. A Masterpiece, well done. Highly recommended if you love SRPG, A nice mixture of 13th warrior, Vikings, Lord of the Rings.Updating this review for the nominations, this game is on my nomiation list for steam awards.

												I REALLY wanted to like this game.  I love tactical turn-based rpgs, the art and music are beautiful, and the Viking theme is a breath of fresh air.  However, this game bored me to death.  The combat gets old after a couple hours because the strategy is the same in every battle (chipping away at the enemy armor while hiding your weaker units behind dudes with shields).  It doesn't help that the story and characters are both bland.  It's almost as if a bunch of artists got together with this great theme but forgot they had to (or didn't know how to) make a fun game in order to tie everything together.  What's disappointing is that there are so many similar games (that did it right) they could have used as inspiration: Fire Emblem, XCOM, Final Fantasy Tactics, Advance Wars, etc.  These games focus on gameplay first; story and theme complement gameplay but are ultimately secondary.  The Banner Saga does the opposite and comes up short because of it.			"

												This is a great game, with annoying mechanics. The story and design is fantastic, but the rules of the turned based combat is...unfair. You and the enemy team alternate, no matter how many units are on the field. If you got 10 units and the enemy got 3, its still every second turn. This leads to some units becoming very vulnerable on account of not being able to move, since the enemy can pummel them with few units.I can imagine this will balance it out later if you yourself have a smaller army, but it makes me feel like the tactic of the game is constantly screwed up by chaotic turns, that gets bumped around as units die and enemies gets more moves than you. This is absolutely devastating if the enemy has a couple of big units. A bit more polish on the tactic side of the game, making it more balanced would be better. The whole point about strategic combat is that strategy should pay off. It doesnt always in this one. I will still recommend it though since it is an interesting world that is sparesly but well presented.			"

												Good points: great visuals, rich in details; good history, well explained, makes you entertain; good music and sounds, makes you relax and get into the viking scenario; choices matter, and sometimes you really regreat them, so you have to choose wisely; the whole estrategy based on a battle group, including no combatents, so you have to think about resting, food, how well do you spend your ""money"". Bad points: a battle where you have no numerical advantage at all, because you and the enemy always alternate turns; you can't attack and move after; too many characters makes you forget which one does what. So if you think about a game just to enjoy the design, music and the camp experience, go for it. If the battle part matters, run always. The RPG part is very important to me, so I'm giving a negative review. 5/10			"

												I've spent quite a few hours playing this game and can safely say that it's good. Although I was apprehensive at first, mainly since it is a turn-based game and I've had bad experiences with these (namely Final Fantasy, which grew boring after some hours), the characters' different moves and optional dialogue choices interested me greatly. Ludin and Hakon became my favourite characters quickly, and I adore the fantasy aspect of creating the varl people within the Viking legends.I played the game throughout on normal, and the only tough battle I came to was the end, as I couldn't work out that you only had to take down it's defences before then shooting it with a special attack. But I attained the 'normal' achievement eventually :) Another problem I spotted is that there are mistakes in the dialogue. I took screenshots, and, although this game has fighting elemets, it is essentially a dialogue-choice game, which made the discovery of the sentences that lacked proper endings all the more irritating. Further, unlike a visual novel game, you can't skip any text you've already read. Once you've completed this game, you will have to go through all the text again to replay it, which takes extra time.But in any case, if you're looking for a Viking game with endings that differ depending on the choices you make, then you've made an all right choice. Despite that you can't skip already read text, the sentence mistakes in dialogue, and it being a turn-based game, interesting doesn't even begin to decribe the game. You travel across a wintry wasteland, deciding whom you should attack whilst paying attention to your party and resources, and your decisions can ultimately cost people their lives!			"

												I really tried to like this game, but after its short lifespan (takes like a day to finish) I can't help being dissappointed. Things I enjoyed: Pretty much everything there is to see or hear. The graphics, music, the few parts of spoken dialogue. Story was also - if not great - at least good enough to be enjoyable.Now to cover the bad stuff: In a sad way this game represents one of the aspects that annoy me the most in modern day games. Games are investing heavily in cinematic storytelling, forcefeeding cutscenes and keeping the player in a tight leash from one scripted event to the next. After all of this is peeled off the actual gameplay is really shallow.So what kind of gaming content did the Banner Saga have? The game consists of two elements. Screens with text in them and turn based combat. As a method of driving the story the text worked well enough for me, however every now and then there's the occasional decision making. The decisions themselves are intresting and fine but every single time you're left to pick your choice based on gut instinct alone. If there's background information its one or two lines of text with little information value.  You can't see anyones facial expressions when they talk, you can't observe them outside of your encounter or anything. All you have is a short descrption like ""this guy looks at you funny and has a red shirt"", then you have to decide if he is to be trusted or not, or the game telling you ""situation is bad"", but you can't make your own judgement how bad exactly, like, say, in an rts game. So the first of the two elements of the game is just picking a choice pretty much randomly.The other element, combat wasn't enjoyable for me either. You have two different attacks and the game has but a handful of special abilities. The initiative system that forces you to weaken enemies evenly before wiping them out instead of quickly eliminating enemy combatants and reducing their numbers feels really counter intuitive and ""wrong"". Some people argued that this keeps the battle exciting longer instead of snowballing to your or the enemys advantage after good or bad first few turns. For me this initiative system really didn't change anything in this regard. Excitement comes from uncertainty of outcome and outcome is just as clear after first few rounds with this system as with a regular one where you aim to burst down individual fighters quickly. If I want turn based fantasy combat on a square grid I'll pick Heroes 6 over this game any day.So to sum it up: Nice art and story with a really poor gameplay core. I have enjoyed some of these ""playable novel"" -types of games that get by with the sheer quality of their art and storytelling alone while having boring gameplay beneath. Prime example would perhaps be Planescape torment and compared to that masterpiece this game is way out of league. In hindsight I would've considered this game worth 5-10 euros so wait till it comes out at discount price.			"

Story - 91%Graphics - 86%Gameplay - 68%Sound - 88%Replay Value - 52%TL; DW?The Banner Saga has an abundant lore, a very detailed story, a n awesome soundtrack and top-notch narration, a very atmospheric ambient, and a very nice graphics. But what went wrong? The simplistic and boring gameplay drags this game down, it’s way too basic and way underutilized. The battle system was average, and may even annoy you because how the turns are set to alternate. The random events are so scarce, it made the game painfully linear, the choices you make don’t matter at all and it’s more of a guessing game. Lack of a way to get food and renown, it’s just too boring and too predictable once you’ve played it once. Fret not though, this game is only the chapter 1 of a trilogy and hopefully the developers will make a better game and better gameplay mechanics. "

												I was super-excited for this game.  It's basically Oregon Trail with turn-based battles interspersed, plus a good storyline.  That would be a great idea, if it were well executed.  Unfortunately, some incredibly poor design choices early on ruined what would otherwise be a great game.The big problem is that most of the battles are very easy, but winning even the easiest of battles without losing heroes is nigh-impossible.  Most people, myself included, would assume that means the game is incredibly well-balanced.  Unfortunately, it's actually because of two game-mechanics which do not work well together AT ALL.The first game mechanic is that a unit's attack power is equal to its health.  This means as a unit takes damage, it becomes weaker and less useful.The second game mechanic is that turns alternate by side, rather than by unit.  In other words, if I have 4 units and the enemy has 2 units, each of the enemy's units gets to move/attack twice for each one of mine.Stop and think about what these mechanics mean together.  The weakest unit on the enemy team is always the one with the lowest health.  If you kill him, his turns don't get removed, they get replaced by a stronger unit.  That means every time you kill an enemy-unit, the opponent-team gets stronger.  EVERY TIME!This has three consequences.  The first is that you're basically guaranteed to lose some heroes in every battle.  Every time you kill an enemy-unit, their team gets stronger.  Once they're down to two units, they'll be attacking one of your units 3-4 times for every one time it attacks back.  Couple this with the fact that the AI seems to always target a single unit with all of its units, and it's basically impossible to survive without losses, even when you massively overpower the enemy.  That's not fun.The second is that most battles are very easy to win.  Every time you lose a unit, your team gets stronger also; so after losing a few units, the battle becomes much easier.  That's not fun.The third consequence is that the best strategy for almost every battle is to get all the enemy units down to 1-2 HP before killing any of them.  It's a very boring strategy, which leads to a boring game.  That's not fun!The game does have other issues (such as seemingly benign choices resulting in the deaths of your heroes outside of battle), but none anywhere near as frustrating as the broken battle mechanics.  If the devs would fix the broken battle mechanics, I would give the game a thumbs-up; but for now, I can't recommend this game for any price, even free.  It's simply not fun.			"

												The Banner Saga has a very entertaining and interesting story.  The graphics suit the game well and also allow it to run on older low spec systems.  The audio and soundtrack are very good and atmospheric.  Some of the tunes are awesome.The armour and strength as damage and also HP is an odd combat system, but is ok to manage once you work out the tricks.  The combat sections are very good but can get repetitive.The interactive story and its choices/impacts was very good and the frustration I felt at having made a bad choice leaves me wanting another playthrough.  I found I never realy got a character to a high enough level to use most of the items I found.  Infact all 3 characters that I fed kills to in order to progress all ended up dead due to scrpted events, and the choices I made.  One of which was not all that obvious.At  10 hours to complete my first playthrough it was perhaps not great value for money, but I am left wanting more and will play again so maybe it was.			"

												Beautiful, amazing game. Definitely for someone who enjoys a deep story where you control the outcome. Not for someone who wants action, because the majority of the game is reading. Combat, character classes, items, and leveling up all work really well, and combining it with a fantastic story creates a game you shouldn't pass up.			"

												If I'd ever rate a game positively it would be Banner Sage, a clear 9/10 in my opinion.Banner Saga is a mix of interactive story telling, a bit of micro management and turn based strategic combat.A large portion of the game you will be following your caravan around as it tries to escape from the faceless evil named Dredge. These enemies are really unsettling in a way, but to tell you more would be a spoiler for the game. While trying to survive you're going from town to town and will experience events on a regular basis. These sometimes change depending on your previous decisions, but for the most part they are isolated and scripted cases, meaning you will pretty much always encounter the same events in every playthrough, but the decisions you make can and will change the story. You will have to watch for supplies and morale while on the road as well as your actual people. Supplies can be bought for renown, which is earned in events and battles. When your supplies run out, morale is dropping and your people are starving. Morale itself determines how strong your heroes are in battle (stat boost willpower). And if your people keep dying, well I never found out, but maybe there IS a game over? In any case, losing too many fighters to starvation will mean you will lose even more in the big battles in which your ""army"" has to fight. To be honest though at least on easy and normal difficulty this doesn't really matter all that much. I wish there was a greater emphasis on managing morale and your army.The other half of the game is spent in tactical, turn based battles, in which you control up to 6 heroes. You can choose who to take into battle and who to leave behind. If one of your heroes falls, he gets injured, which may knock him out for the coming battle, but none of your guys or girls can actually ""die"" in combat, only through events, which is a good thing, since you can't save in Banner Saga. What happens is there to stay.Your units have 2 main combat stats: armor and strength. If armor is a lot higher than strength, strength attacks can be deflected. Strength on the other hand represents the direct damage your units can do, so you need to strike a balance between armor and strength attacks. Usually it is best to start with a str. attack to stop the enemy from damaging you too greatly, but depending on the enemy you may need to then wittle down his armor. However, your heroes can only destroy a maximum of 3 armor (if you've skilled it) per turn. If you did not invest in armor break you're screwed in the later stages of the game. You can use another stat, will power, to increase any damage (or movement) you made. What is annoying is that you can only move your hero ONCE, even if he has movement points remaining. Especially with special attacks (each hero has a unique special and passive ability) you don't always know the exact range.Generally speaking I would say that combat is perhaps a bit unbalanced or I'm just not very good at it. You have your basic human melee fighters who just get destroyed by big Dredge enemies, your human archers who need to get almost in melee range to shoot the enemy, opening them up to counter attacks in the next rounds, which can easily spell their doom, and the big Varl, bearded giants, who take 4 squares of space and can get in each other's way easily, but pack a real punch. The only human I found REALLY helpful on the battlefield was my main guy, Rook. Everyone else was obnoxious to use, but you just can't take 5 Varl with you, even if you have enough to fill your ranks. That just makes no sense. So you are stuck with fragile humans who can die in 1 or 2 hits to the stronger enemies. Since it's also a bit hard to tell which enemy moves when (you have to click the portrait to find out, because most look the same), this can lead to a battle quickly going south.After winning a battle you get renown and depending on WHO killed your enemies you can level up that hero. Herein lie THREE more problems:1. Only the heroes who actually finish an opponent off get the kill credit, so you always have to check who you want to level up and how many kills they need to do so. This can lead to you actively gimping your battles, because your stronger heroes do way more damage. They have better stats and can wear better items due to their higher level (max 5). In the worst case your weaker heroes who would need the level up wouldn't get them and since all your heroes start at level 1 this can become a problem, especially for a newer player.2. Renown is the shared resource to buy supplies, new items AND level ups, which get progressively more expensive. This means you can severely hurt yourself by levelling up a hero only to realize 10 days later that you didn't get enough supplies, because of negative events or because the journy is far longer than anticipated. Since only 2 of my heroes reached level 5 in the end on easy I think there might be not enough renown around. I only bought a few items at the start and even had to suffer starvation in between and it was still not enough.3. There can be points in the game in which you simply lose a hero. If that hero was high level, well ♥♥♥♥ you. Tough luck. Have fun with replacing him or her with a significantly weaker one. It is a bit irritating if you have no control over such events. Yes, of course, this is something that can happen in real life. In reality though you don't have a bunch of inexperienced losers that are only in the reserve, but only battle hardened veterans, since they are constantly fighting. This is especially annoying when the game FORCES you to use a hero, even if you told said hero you didn't want him involved! So in the last mission I was stuck with using a useless level 1 archer, who didn't survive 2 rounds and did virtually no damage...Those are my main gripes with the game out of the way. The story is beautiful and brutal, the graphics are pleasing to look at and the sound is haunting and epic. Now that BS 2 is out the end of BS 1 is also more forgivable ;)You should not skip this game!			"

												The gods are dead. The sun never leaves the horizon, shining on boundless wastes of tundra. The land is torn between men, giants known as varl and armored creatures known as dredge, neither carry any reason to trust each other. A new day dawns, and the world is at the brink of turmoil, weary of old wars, always anticipating new wars; nearly void of hope. In such a time, you take the role of leading a caravan across frozen wastes to its destiny.You play the parts of many characters, make their choices and endure the consequences while discovering the beautifully weaved tale of the realm. Each and every character that you lead tell a story of their own in this Nordic, war-thorn saga. Each choice that you make affects your chances of survival, and makes you approach one step closer to your destination. The setting is incredibly rich, expected from any proper RPG game. Every road, landmark, settlement, mountain or forest; every region depicted on the map contains its own local history. The lore is complete and refreshing.To begin with, the game contains a diverse gameplay, bringing together elements of adventure, role-playing and strategy games. The adventure elements are directly affecting the story, and the outcome of your choices twist and turn to present you alternative destinies. Combats are turn-based in isometric maps, and gameplay is fairly easy to grasp. Yet 'fairly easy to grasp' quickly turns into 'hard to master'. You are able to level up your characters with renown, a kind of currency that you may gain through heroism either in adventure choices or by slaying your adversaries in battle field. Alongside leveling, you are capable of gathering minor and major items to enhance your heroes furthermore.The Banner Saga presents a direct example for my reason to become a gamer: a story to be told. The game satisfied all my expectations thoroughly. I do not wish to present any spoilers, but it is safe to declare that the story of the realm is not finished in this game. Good news is that The Banner Saga 2 is in development. Cheers! "

												In a word: TERRIBLE.As usually, first the good things:The idea is really good, the graphical style is wonderful, the voice acting at a very professional level.Now, the review:The game it's one of the worst I've ever played. I can see a lot of good intentions in it, but the final result gives the same feeling as spending time hammering your own fingers.It says to mix RPG, turn based combat and choice driven plot. What you get, instead...Dumb RPG systemAll characters have a predefined class, each class has a starting set of attributes, but they all are already well defined and EVERY attribute has a maximum value that it's nearly reached just as you start playing.For example, you may have a PC of class ""really good with shields"":This PC could begin with Armour 12 out of 16, Strenght 8 out of 10, and other few useless stats. You will be allowed to choose on out of one active ability, and one out of one passive ability (just joking, you can't choose anything, each PC has predefined abilities)So in the end you will get all predefined PC with NO SPACE for any personalization apart from maybe buying an item for them.Honestly, this game is labeled RPG, but it has nothing to do with it. Instead, you are given a set of PC you have to use your better for...Untactical unstrategic turn based combatI can resume everything with just one sentence: you archers have 4 meters' range.That is, they need to stay so close to the enemy to shoot him, that the enemy can reach them next turn with its basic movement. Really. And enemy has slinger with the same range, too: yes, a slinger with the same range of an archer.But if this is not enough...- Movement is not quantified. You need to click on a PC to see where he can go.- You can move JUST ONE TIME. It doesn't matter how far you can reach, you can move only once. Now, it could be understandable to stop moving after attacking, but...you can't spend freely your movements and you have to move all at once? Foolishness.- Your archers has meaningless range, so you protect them with another PC. And because scale with archer has always been a problem in RPG and tactical games, every game has opportunity attacks. This one? Guess what...it has not. So you have your archer right in range of the enemy movement (otherwise he can't shoot him), another PC protecting him, and the enemy just going 'round the defensive PC without any proble,- The game can't do math. According to game's rules, damage is strenght minus armour, so e.g. a strenght of 10 vs an armour of 5 makes 5 damage.Usually.Sometimes is 6 damage.Sometimes is 3.And sometime 4 of strenght vs 4 of armour is 2 damage.And so on...- Combat is a classic interleaved turn based system: one of your PC, then one of the enemy, then one of your PC, etc. etc.So, special abilities aside, there is no ""retaliation phase"": you move your PC next to the enemy, attack, he gets the damage and do not reply; when its turn come, he attack your PC and your PC do not reply.Usually. When the enemy do not decide to reply to your attack, it goes the way above.Well, I wrote ""special abilities aside"", after all, right? Yeah. But the enemy has not that special ability listed O_o- You can't die during combat. No, really.Honestly, the combat phase is really terrible. Having played lots of tactical games (and lot of boardgames), The Banner Saga falls so short that it's embarassing. Because at least Farmville is just a casual game, while this one does everything to looks like a tactical game, and fail miserably.But...as the not-so-present RPG system is just a fake to bridge the game to strategy combat, maybe the the horrible and failed combat system is just put there for something else? Yeah, enter the...On rails blind-choice driven missing plotThe title pretty sums everything, and sincerly I'm a bit tired typing.The story proceeds on rails; I went trough half of the game before giving up after getting tired to not be able to decide any real direction. The plot is frozen, the path is carved in the rock, you just stand sit waiting for the game to show you a written dialogue, and asking you to choose if you want a battle or not. Just that, there is a map, there are two parties, and all you do is waiting for a dialogue, clicking on the next button after each sentence, then decide what to do.Most of the coices are ""do you want to battle or not?""; this in reality translate in ""do you want an easy battle now and an easy next, or do you skip this and get an hardest next?""Other choices are really...well, believe me, the entire system it's a mess. You are requested to choose without knowing what is going on, or without the minimum idea of what will come next. Most outcomes are not, in any way, linked to your choices, and you miss a lot of information too. And as a result of this, your PCs die in what often seems a random way (war council after a battle; you ask your allies what they think; you take a decision in disagreement with the young prince; for this he takes his few men and goes dumbly to battle against 820 fully armoured giants; you can stop him BEFORE he show signs of what he is going to do, or when he is already on the field; he dies)In the end, just a couple of last things:- I wrote ""you just stand sit waiting ""...well, that's not entirely true: as the game depict the travel of a caravan accross a land, I actually spent part of the afternoon cleaning my room while the caravan was moving on the screen.- The game claim to have a beautiful soundtrack. Well, that's just the biggest scam ever; game's sound is a collection of unremarkable background music and a bunch of sound effects thrown here and there.			"

												5/10Pros - Great 2d artCons - Some core design flaws: Scripted events may be ridiculously punishing; Gameplay is very generic with poor progression management; Story is paradoxically not too involving; Characters feel distant; Overall very restrictive.The art, particularly the background art, is really inspiring. I would almost recommend the game on that basis alone.Unfortunately, the game suffers from some major flaws as far as design is concerned. Fundamentally, it's essentially a sort of Choose your Own Adventure type of experience intersected with (frequent) turn-based fights.The problem is that the scripted events that play out during the campaign can be extremely directive and make you feel like you are more a spectator than a player. You may lose characters without warning, or make decisions at an early point that will screw you deeply way further down the road, and then you'll have no way out.Combat itself is hardly that interesting. It's a rather standard turn-based system. Meaning that after you've gone through half a dozen fights, any novelty, excitement or discovery is lost and it becomes a formality. The way combat handles progression isn't so good, as it's one of those antiquated systems that only rewards kills, meaning that a character who goes through 20 fights and scores 2 kills will be weaker than a character who goes through 4 fights and scores 5 kills. Even then, you get little say in terms of actual character build or development.Back to the story, the whole thing feels quite a bit cold and removed. The writing is very standard, everything feels somewhat uninvolved, as if you were a witness more than a driving force in the plot. Lots of characters who seem as though they know one another quite well, but not really much given to the player in terms of space to come in and connect.Buy it if it's on a sale and don't go in expecting much at all and you might have a good time. Buy it if you want to look at pretty artwork. Buy it if you aren't demanding in terms of traditional rpg components: story & characters; choice; exploration and stats/build/strategy development.Otherwise, skip.			"

												Before I start, I wanted to say that I have been following this project since it was announced on Kickstarted. Despite the fact that I have played just a few hours(Some people read reviews written by those who played the game at least 10 hours), I am ready to share my feelings. This game is a peace of art. Visuals are stunning. Sound is so perfect that when your caravan goes through the forest you can close your eyes and still feel the rustling of leaves under your feet and crackling of old trees above your head.The plot is like an old north legend, brutal and full of (dead) ancient gods, giants and greedy people trying to survive.The most important thing for me in this game is a feeling that you are in the last campaign in your life and perhaps the last for all mankind. The feeling that you are on the road all the time keeps me on the look-out.As for the gameplay, I never liked turn-based battles, but there are some exceptions to this rule. And Banner Saga is one of them. This is hard to explain, but every battle is like a chess match, so it can last up to 20 minutes each. Although it is incredibly intense.To sum up, I am proud to have this game in my library, play it and enjoy it.			"

												the game is just one horrible design decision after another. 1 resource for everything - do you want to upgrade your character? or buy an item? or feed your followers?  but not all 3, because to do either of those takes the same resource""decisions affect the game"" - yeah, unfortunately it doesnt really matter because every decision you make is wrong.  and if you want to go back to pick another decision, you dont get to choose the save points, you might go back about a half hour from where you were.the story actually had something going for it, but the game makes it so you dont even want to play to advance the story.

												I wish I could recommend this game, I really do. The artstyle if ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, the story and characters are interesting, BUT.... it just can't get over its need to keep kicking you. No choice you make is right, no choice you make will be good, no choice you do will not end with you getting kicked in the sack. The combat is frustrating to say the least as well. Why they went with a you go then they go, style WITHOUT being able to pick which of your dudes go is beyond me. It makes it where putting the enemy down is, often, a BAD idea as they will start being able to have one guy go two or three times before your roster goes through, making it impossible to pull people back.Its a damn shame as the game was fun for a few hours, but the need to just constanly kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of you just kills it for me along with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat.

												Steam really needs a ""meh"" option, but since there isn't one, I'll have to go with 'not recommended'.The story is interesting, and I really did want to know what happened... but the gameplay just killed it for me. I liked the characters, but the differents skills and enemies just weren't enough to make it interesting. The balance in skills on the grid was lacking. It felt grindy as hell, like you never had a decent answer to what was thrown at you. I never felt like I aced a battle. This could of course be deliberate, just giving you that feeling of a struggle... but that's not what I play games for.The story is nice so far, though. The decisions you get to make mostly have an effect on how strong your enemy is or the status of your supplies. It's not a bad game at all, it's just not for everybody, I guess.			"

												The art is amazing but the story is kind of lacking considering it's a 'story driven' game.  Your decisions barely matter and how well you protect your people doesn't matter at all.  The gameplay is alright, if you like final-fantasy-tactics style games and it's on sale maybe give it a go.  I didn't hate it, but I wouldn't recommend it.  Would like to see more by the creators hopefully with more choices and with those choices affecting the story more clearly, rather than faking it.			"

												Great turn-based strategy RPG game from former Bioware employees. With games like this you start to value games from Kickstarter.The game has really original battle system, where character's HP = strength - the lesser HP you have, the weaker your punches to enemy. Morale system can significantly boost your warriors in places when you need to hit first or run away from enemy's reinforcements.But most of all, I've enjoed the main plot. It's a legend! You have 2 parallel main stories, one with main protagonist and another with secondary protagonist. In every game event you can choose from several choices and each choice has different consequences for main hero and caravan.You have several heroes under your command: warriors, archers, mages, spearmans and other, so choose your party wisely.Cartoon graphics and soundtrack are also a masterpiece, I loved those ethnic songs from northern legends.The game is so damn hard even on Normal difficulty, lack of food, rest, equipment and army make you to think harder on every decicion - to fight those bandits, search for gold or try to find food for your caravan?Waiting impatiently for the second part of the story!+ Great epic plot (try not to cry in end of first part)+ Stylish cartoon graphics and soundtrack+ Original fresh battle system and skills.+ Wide variety of decisions+ Fair base price (only 5$ with 75% discount)+ Stunning game difficulty (if you tired from casual easy games)+ First caravan game I've ever played- Poor game budget (it was made by 3 developers)- Short first part of the story (~10-20 hours)- I wish if the game had more battles- Lack of food9/10 stars to Kickstarter blockbuster!

												So far the best I've gotten is chapter 6. I'm really not sure if I'm going to tough it out and finish this game, because there are just so many glaring problems with it.The combat is fun, don't get me wrong. It's easily the best part of the game, but the problems come in outside of the combat. Most games like this, for example, Fire Emblem, have you gain characters that can die in battle. In Banner Saga however, your units only get injured in battle and need to rest. This means that they instead die (or leave your party some other way) from scripted events outside of the combat. That is just so wrong. It completely prevents you from crafting the team you really want, not to mention any items equipped to a unit that dies or leaves the party is lost forever. This could be saved if these didn't happen often, but they happen TOO often. Hell, there's an achievement for keeping one character alive that has at least 4 scripted events in which he can die throughout the story.This gets worse because of one event in chapter 6 that essentially sums up to ""Rocks fall, everyone dies."" An unavoidable (by that point) scripted event that makes you lose 3 characters, just like that. From what I can tell, it starts in chapter 2-3, and based on very minute decisions you make then, 3 chapters later your characters will just die no matter what. That is seriously not okay.I want to like this game, I really do. But I am just being constantly frustrated by the complete lack of personal team building. It's really hard to get attached to your characters when you have no stable way of keeping them in your party.			"

												The game is mostly very good up until the end, really great choices to make, the potential for important characters to die early on, balancing the mix of your caravan and the combat is fun and engaging. The only real let down for the majority of the game is the vicous spiral of defeat you can fall into, if you lose fights, you need to spend supplies to recover strength or you continue to be at a disadvantage. However, the currency for supplies (reknown) is also the currency for leveling your characters, so resting to recover strength = lower levels, which means you lose more fights, which... etc etc. To compund this, if you run out of supplies your moral drops, this affects your combat performance significantly... which means you lose more fights, so you get less reknown, so you can afford less supplies... etc etc AGAIN.All of this would still not be enough to make the game drop too much in review, however right at the end you have a blatantly unsubtle ""pick who dies"" moment that is shoved in your face and are then forced to take specific characters you may not have leveled to the the final fight, which is... ridiculously tough. It is clearly meant to be tough battle and I would expect no less, but instead of being maybe 50% tougher than previous battles it is 150% tougher. Many people have ended up dropping the difficulty to easy, which is instead a 50% *drop* from the normal difficulty and ends up giving them a frustratingly pointless win. I persevered and beat it on 'normal' (which is, bizarrely, perfectly balanced the *entire* rest of the game to be challenging but winnable with tactics and forethought).I'd almost suggest simply stopping at the last city once you meet 'Juno' as the game after that point appears to have been designed and written by different people who haven't played any of the rest of it, but that would end up probably being just as frustrating as the end is anyways, which abruptly stops after the fight and a short cutscene and gives you absolutely no closure to any of the major plot points or characters except one (who's dead)... ultimately, I can't recommend anyone buy this (even on sale) as it will leave a sour taste in your mouth at the end and ruin the excellent gameplay that came before imo.

												This game is very pretty, and has lots of dialogue options. It has the makings of a fantastic Visual Novel.But then they shoved in gameplay. Gameplay that is absolutely atrocious. Do you like strategy? Then this isn't a good game. Do you like using a variety of units cohesively to take on challenges? Then this isn't a good game for you.I would give this game an overall 2/10 score, because while the story, art, and music are fantastic, the main purpose of a video game is gameplay, the main purpose of an RPG is decision making, and the main purpose of turn based game is strategy. There's no strategy, the gameplay is awful, and the decision making is filled with nonsensical negative consequences, as well as the player being given multiple choices with the same outcome. In addition, while the story is interesting, pacing does not exist, and the transferance between characters is random.Gameplay: 2/10To put it simply, there is no depth to the combat, the AI is easy to manipulate, and if you attempt any strategy except one, you will lose units for no reason. The biggest problem is that there's no engagement mechanic. That enemy that just needs one hit to die? walks away freely and attacks you from range. That archer hiding behind a literal giant? The enemy can walk around the giant with impunity and one shot your archer. Oh, and if your archer lives? They can't do any damage(because your health is your damage number), so your best strategical move is to use them as bait and get them killed.Story interaction: 1/10 Do you like losing a character in a conversation with no context? How about being given a false sense of choice?Basically, while the story is cool and interesting, every single scripted event can have characters die for nonsensical reasons, which then makes the already terrible combat worse, because you just lost your level 5 hero because half the options don't actually do what they say. There's a certain scene with an Ox cart that is the perfect example. A giant tries to hold it and prevent it from falling off a cliff. You get 3 options. All 3 result in the cart falling, and two result in the giant dying. So why the ♥♥♥♥ is this an option and not just a cinematic? So the devs can pretend they gave the player choice.			"

												Well, in my opinion this game is grossly overrated.Combat wise it lags heavily behind the best ones in the genre of the turn-based combat games. I'll mention few of them - King's bounty the Legend, Disciples 2, Fantasy General and Heroes of Might and Magic 1-3. Compared to these, its gameplay is practically non-existent.Having to keep enemies on low strength on the battlefield (which compared to other games doesn't have any terrain obstacles you can use to your advantage, etc.) just to make computer to waste it's turns might seem brilliant idea - but to me it's just plain silly.Many people said that the map is just a cosmetic and it's probably something which was abandoned at the early stages of development gameplay wise.This game as such is 5/10 at best. Get it for 5 bucks if you can, else don't bother. God damn mobile games!			"

												This game's combat has been compared to that of Final Fantasy Tactics. This combat system is no more like final fantasy tactics than checkers is to chess. Very dull with no real choices when upgrading a character. The combat system punishes you for killing off opponents expecting you to take most units down to low health before anyone is killed off. I notice a slight delay on mouseover on most menus, keeping in mind I can play most AAA titles on my rig with around 60 fps on high settings. While I kept hearing how good the story is and how varied it feels I find it to be linear and dull so far. I have serious doubts if I will give it another chance, and regret getting it even at summer sale prices. I think I will go play Final Fantasy Tactics again to get a satisfactory Strategy RPG experience. I really wanted to like this one.			"

The story however is impossibly hard to keep track off. You are bombed with 6+ character names at the start + several town names and you get not much of an explanation of who every character is. They seem to talk about unimportant stuff or stuff you have no idea of instead of actually giving important information. Now I get it, it's fine if the characters already know each other, but dont expect us as player to immediently know the entire cast. Trying to get something valuable out of the long dialogues I just stopped to actually read the story somewhere in the middle of chapter 2. Shouldnt happen in a storybased game.			"

												After careful consideration, ""pretentious"" is a good word here. While I enjoyed the time I spent with the game, there are things that drag it down. Pros:+Solid combat+Interesting world+ArtCons:-While the 'spin' (read: defense mechanic) on the classic tactics RPG formula isn't bad, it isn't enough to reinvent the wheel, and it's certainly not enough for the game to stand on alone-Character customization is sorely lacking-Extremely linear (literally: your warband moves in a straight line)-Typos and grammatical errors rife in the dialogue-Not overly original in terms of either plot or gameplayI have yet to play Banner Saga 2 and I fear that my interest will only continue to wane with time. If you really dig the art style, or are a huge fan of the genre, pick it up. If you're looking for a ""game made by ex-Bioware employees"" then go elsewhere. Hesitantly recommended.			"

												The dialogues are the worst part of the game. There are only names next to the dialogue text, so you better remember all those norse sounding names or you will get lost in the dialogue. You also ""play"" as several characters, which can make matters even more confusing. Some of the dialogue makes absolutely no sense to me at times, I find some of the decisions to have unclear consequences. For example you find a necklace and you can chose to return it or keep it. It doesn't inform you what stats the necklace has, even though you are holding it.TL;DR:The dialogues aren't voiced over.  Heaps of text written in awkward English between several parties who can be identified only through their weird names often makes it confusing just to identify who is talking to who. These conversations are followed up by choices that have completely unforseeable consequences.			"

												Plays like Oregon Trail meets Final Fantasy Tactics: Watch the wagons roll until a dialog box pops-up with a random event OR a cutscene and Turn Based Combat combat scenario. Really dislike the ""Eat or Level Up"" game mechanic. The currency for this is earned by selecting the right dialog/actions option during a random encounter (worth 5 pts) or by winning combat (10 points). The rewards for combat are really underwhelming. Characters only get ""experience"" if they land a killing blow. All other actions are valueless in terms of character progression. Game also appears written with the intention of penalizing positive moral choices as they mostly result in the protagonist  coming off as a naive fool.			"

												The story is very short and particularly linear, its random/influence events are minimal and usually dialogue-based, and has no side-path 'missions/objectives' that are really optionable. Additionally, the scenes/set/setting don't give any in-depth context or background narrative - at times I was left struggling to remember odd names from the other side of the divergent story and trying to figure out what was generally going on, most of which was unanswered even upon completion of the game and a semi-finished quick re-run.Lastly, I found that most of the resource mechanics are simply just trivial and pointless. The combat system is even more odd. It basically entails that if you enter combat with less heros you have an early-mid game advantage, among other issues, like 'tactically' keeping the enemy units alive on 1hp - which means the enemy has a useless unit (who cannot deal damage) taking a movement/attack que before their other units every cycle. I enjoyed aspects of this game which were refreshing and somewhat reminiscent of various browser-based Flash games, but I think the game essentially doesn't live up to what it attempts to be. All that said, I think if the development was more focused on incorporating more Roguelike mechanics, which were persistent *entirely* throughout the story and in all facets of game-play, and the campaign story was broadened a bit, this would title would go down as an undeniable cult classic. Realistically, the only re-playability this game has is just to gain a few new/different characters, perhaps some different dialogue-based decisions and some different cut-scenes or alternate endings.

												Pros: Very engaging and well written story. Good job establishing an emotional link to certain characters and a good amount of hard hitting twists that throw you for a bit of a loop. The world is very fleshed out, with a very clear attention to detail. Gameplay is challenging at the higher difficulty setting and in the later chapters it feels very desperate from the overworld/management perspective (which I mark as a good thing).Cons: Said overworld/management perspective is actually completely worthless and has little to no effect on gameplay, save for the highest difficulty setting. While the story suggests that decisions drastically alter the direction the narritive takes, its not necessarily anything huge, though to its credit it makes it seem like it. Combat can get repetitive towards the end. The purchasing of items through the in game currency is possible but the game is short enough where it feels that it could have been better spent on character upgrades. Which gives evidence to the unavoidable Major Flaw of this game.Important Major Flaws: This is not a full game. This is the first part of a series (presumably a triology), but it clearly did not have to be. You won't see it advertised anywhere, but this game is merely an episode of a larger overarching story that you are introduced to. While the story is very well done, the ending feels contrived, as if they forcibly stopped themselves from going further. This game will take between 8 to 12 hours to complete, but overall the time feels light considering its 30$ price tag off sale. All of that being said, I'll more than likely moan and grumble my way to buying whatever sequel follows it up, considering the great story and world that they had going, but then again, I got it on sale. I really, really want to press the 'recommend' button for this one, but I'm afraid I can't, as it steps a bit too far into the line of 'overpriced' as well as 'falsely advertised'. Still, a solid 7/10 all things considered.			"

Something that usually appeals to me in tactical games is the ability to perfect each encounter, but in this game replaying an encounter is not made easy and enemy placement and turn order is randomized.It's way too slow and frustrating. If manual saves were a feature maybe some of the tedium could be circumvented at least.It's pretty to look at though.			"

												What a beautiful game. Great visuals, gripping story with interesting and meaningful decisions to make, deep tactical combat. It's one of those rare games that I kept thinking about when not playing it. A truly epic start to what looks like to be one of the most evocative RPG experiences this year, as Stoic want's to do a trilogy of The Banner Saga			"

												Good idea, but I don't like how they did the turns. Instead of doing it by units, your enemy gets a turn for every one of yours. So lets say you have 8 units and they have one. Until you kill it, that unit will move for every one of your moves. It can just murder one of your characters if its attacking someone that isn't due up for awhile. If you kill enemy units your making the ones remaining move faster, which is stupid. It did have some good things though. The art style was very unique, there is good story, but it was just ruined for me by that stupid way their turn based system works.			"

												It'd be an awesome game when judging the graphics, the gameplay, the soundtrack, the story, the characters or anything else except for the game's stability.Yet, The Banner Saga is (currently) so horribly unstable, it doesn't make any fun playing it. The worst problems one can avoid by installing the beta version, but still it's just not acceptable that the game locks up regularly. Not that it'd crash or freeze completely, it just hangs and doesn't continue. For instance in battle often an enemy should end its turn, but never does. So, you have an NPC character that's out of possible actions blocking the initiative round. The UI is perfectly responsive, but your only option in that case is to exit the game, as you will never get control of any character on the battlefield.Or in dialogues. Sometimes two dialogue options pop up simultaneously, and the game doesn't continue, no matter what you do. Same for information messages.Ah, and there's a memory leak somewhere. The longer one plays, the more the animations stutter. Restarting the game helps.All this brings me to the next point of critique: It's not possible to save manually. So, whenever one of the aforementioned bugs strikes (quite often), one has to reload the last autosave which might be half an hour old, or even older...To summarize, I'd recommend this game, if it weren't so extremely buggy that playing it simply isn't fun.

												I bought this game due to the rave reviews it got and the fact that I love T-RPG's, however I was pretty disappointed with the game.I beat the game in ~7 hours, which is fairly short, even for a $20 MSRP RPG. At one point, I was given the illusion of choice where characters were killed no matter what I did (I ALT+F4'd out 3 times in an attempt to save the characters, the same thing happened no matter what choices I made). The end of the game feels more like a half way point more than an actual ending; nothing is resolved or finished, if this was a big budget game I'd expect DLC to pick up where the game left off.You control two separate parties, one of which feels really balanced, the other is so underpowered you'll practically lose every fight unless your RNG is VERY lucky. At first I really liked the Telltale style conversations mixed with the Oregon Trail style traveling, but both of which are implemented poorly, so your decisions don't effect much and you're constantly struggling to have enough supplies, which prevents you from leveling up your units.Upon finishing the game there's no New Game+ or anything, resuming your game simply takes you to the final cutscene and then the credit roll. So many names are dropped and places talked about during the game that you end up fairly confused unless you take notes, the game has a fairly large world map but you don't ever go to 90% of the places on it. The game feels highly polished but rushed, like there was much more content planned but they didn't have time to finish it.I got the game for $5 during a sale, and at that price it's a decent deal, but at full price I can't recommend the game as it feels incomplete and imbalanced.

												The Banner Saga would've been an AWESOME movie.  The writing is great, the characters are memorable, and the visuals are unique and interesting.Unfortunately, it's not a movie, it's a game.  And as a game, it's bad -- embarrassingly so, as if the developers are unaware of the progress and evolution in game design in the past 20 years.  The fights in Banner Saga are boring, repetitive, and frustratingly limited in options.  The overland travel (strategic level choices) are opaque and capricious to the point of randomness. By the end, I was so annoyed with how ham-fisted the gameplay was, that I wasn't even enjoying the wonderful writing and visuals anymore.  Which is a real shame, because they're the only things justifying playing it at all.Buy this only at deep discount, and keep your expecations very low.			"

												Combat is basic, but fun.  The do not recommend comes from the frustrating RPG elements.  You make many decisions throughout the game, some with immediate results, and others with no obvious pros or cons until much later.  Unfortunately, there is no logic to the outcome of your choices.  Poor morale, so you choose to celebrate a happy event and take a day of rest?  No morale bonus, but it does cost supplies.  Try to keep your caravan safe by avoiding an obviously dangerous option?  Morale penalty when it turns out that there was no danger.  The final straw for me was when a decision I made it chapter two came back to autokill a main character at the end of the game.  Your choices definitely affect the story, but not with any discernable pattern, rhyme, or reason.   In the end, your rewards are so divorced from your intent, that it doesn't really feel like you were playing a role in the story at all.			"

												While The Banner Saga has some interesting concepts such as the art and in-game fighting mechanics, it's real turn off is the three main deiceiving points that are apparent throughout the game.1. The game does not have any strategic elements aside the turn based battles - The battles are frankly very interesting and quite amusing, until you get used to them in like 15 battles. From then on you fight the same enemies in almost the same fashion over and over again. But The Banner Saga deceives you where it makes you think you have a choice in creating the outcome of the battle, such as charging in, or escaping. Truth be told, while the turn based fights are extremely difficult, the battlefield chocies has very little to do with the outcome of the overall game, meaning you can do mostly whatever you please to avoid battles to complete the game successfully.2. The Banner Saga deceives in that ""Player's choice drives your own narrative"", but realistically, whatever choice you make does VERY little to do with the outcome of the game. Sure, some unimportant characters might die off here and now, and you might lose some men and food etc, but it really has minimal impact on the actual gameplay and most importantly, it barely has any impact on the story. What this means for you is that whatever choice you make ultimately brings you back to whatever path (if any) the developers wanted you to follow, making the game extremely linear. Trust me, i've played the game three times just to check.3. Super short story - this is chapter 1 of the supposed trilogy, which I had no idea when I bought the game. But the troubling factor is that the game is full of filler elements: a vast array of unnecessary battles to make you feel like you've played a lot. By the third playthrough of this game, I decided to speed hack and cheat to make my characters god-like, and I managed to finish the game in two hours. That's how short the game really is. And no, there is nothing special about the story. the whole time you're trying to find out the reason behind your enemy's invasion and the game never succeeds in narrating why this happened, merely leaving you with... an unsuccessful cliffhanger meaning you aren't left curious of what will happen next because you don't really connect with any of the characters or the story.All in all, I wouldn't pay any more than $5 for this game.

												Esses eventos aleatórios que matam seus personagens são RIDÍCULOS. Você perde personagens que você investiu um monte de renome porque não queria jogar fora um carro de comida, por exemplo. Ah, mas é só dar reload né? NÃO, PORQUE ESSE LIXO DE AUTOSAVE NÃO TE DEIXA SALVAR E SE QUISER RECOMEÇAR, TEM QUE SER DESDE O INÍCIO DO CAPÍTULO. Os combates são todos iguais e quase sempre contra os mesmos inimigos. Simplesmente não tem cutscenes, apenas muralhas de texto dizendo o que acontece, o que tira toda a emoção, parece uma visual novel às vezes. O game te joga pra fazer decisões importantes e você não entende nem que caralhos tá acontecendo, que diabos são os dredges, o que eles fazem, quem você é, pra onde e por que você tá indo, é tudo muito mal explicado. Jogo HORRÍVEL, não recomendo a ninguém. Ah, e a tradução pra português é uma bosta, tive que jogar em inglês de tão lixo que é. These random events that kill your characters are RIDICULOUS. You lose characters that you invested a lot of renown because you tried to help them pick a food cart, for example. But it's okay, just reload, right?  NO, BECAUSE THIS STUPID AUTOSAVE CRAP DOESN'T LET YOU SAVE, IF YOU WANT TO RESTART, GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAPTER! Combats are all the same and almost always against the same enemies. The game doesn't have any cutscenes, just wall texts telling you what's going on, no emotion at all, seems like a visual novel sometimes. It also throws you into important decisions without you understanding what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on, who the hell are these dredges, what do they do, who you are, where and why are you going, nothing well explained.

												I gave this a negative review for only one reason; the 89% score represented by the whole of steam reviews is not a true reflection of the games quality. I think the nuance of this game is skewing the true score that this game should be rated as. This is a 6.5 to 7 out of 10 game; I still recommend playing it and buying it for a cheap price less than $10.Story:  6/10 (the thing that weighs on the story is that it’s very clear they are going to milk this game, very little gets revealed in this firs installment of the Saga, it is captivating,  but doesn’t reveal or progress anything.Music/Sound: 7.5 (Music is appropriate to the setting and art style, sound fx in battle are nothing special)Gameplay: 7.5 (The concept of having this caravan with limited resources and going on a trek in choose your adventure type of gameplay is a nice touch, and works well in this games environment. Combat: Strategy wise it’s decent and AI is fairly well done, although the actions, and special abilities leaves something to be desired.Writing/Dialog/Voice Acting: 4/10 ( Writing of dialog is bad, I can live with spelling mistakes, but there are grammatical mistakes that shouldn’t have passed QC especially since this is a story driven game. Sometimes the quality of writing dialog is putrid, its worthy of a high school student writing a short story. There is limited voice acting in the game, but when it does play you wonder to yourself why did they even bother…yes the dialog writing is bad in the game, but voice acting they have is even worse and it added nothing to the game.

The story was thoroughly confusing and unexplained.  The combat system was actively backwards, designed in the most maddeningly anti-strategic way imaginable.  The final boss fight was an unending slog of frustrating attempts that were much, much more difficult than my 'easy' setting should have been.  Choices were unintuitive and possessed seemingly random outcomes only designed to punish the player endlessly.  There's a rich, well developed world map that you don't get to explore at all.

												Simply put: ""Morale and clansmen don't matter, level up or you'll have to start over.""As a turn based RPG, The Banner Saga does a competent job, if somewhat shallow, with character leveling and strategy. The art style is good and the story is epic in proportion, however, as a game, it has some minor-major issues that hold the game back from a enjoyable experience for me:- There virtually no aggro control for the majority of the game, rendering tanks useless and the only strategy becomes pretty much free for all.- Although the art style is good, the game spends a considerable and unjustifyable ammount of time in loading screens, regardless of your PC specs.- The game saves automatically, which makes a short chain of defeats the first step in a dimishingly enjoyable sequence of battles. By what I take to be the middle of the game, I could not win a battle without losing at least half a party. And it just got progressively worse from then on.- By the time you hit one of the main bosses, you may not be strong enough to beat him regardless of your lineup and strategy. This leaves you with two choices: a) start the game over, which may take a dozen more hours to get to the same point or b) choose an easier difficulty setting. Both options represent a pretty evident flaw for the game design for me, and I find myself unwilling to choose any.I wanted to like this game a lot, and enjoyed part of it thoroughly, however, it simply refused to let me like it without wasting a lot of my time. If you're thinking of buying it, I'd recommend reading a guide before starting a game (one other option that I would not have chosen).Time to uninstall.			"

So much plot, so little game.Do I recommend this game...um....I feel horrible saying no to such a beautiful, well presented game, it's a fault of steam's binary system that I've only got yes or no. I'm pretty much on the line.It's a game for a specific kind of person. The emphasis here is on plot and art, plot, and more plot, not on tactical combat. I really enjoyed Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall, and this gameplay is almost entirely the same with tactical combat + read a lot of story + dialog choices. Banner Saga's got more plot:game, and much less detailed gameplay, than those Shadowrun games.It's REALLY pretty. I'm impressed by the art, it's quite a feat, hand drawn combat animations, but I think it's coming at the cost of gameplay depth. I think I'll be finishing it at least, though I might have to force myself.At least they found a way to do dynamic tactical combat without relying heavily on aim% RNG. That's refreshing, in itself.

												To put it simply, The Banner Saga is a beautiful game from start to finish.  The story, art, and music all come together to create an experience that is unlike any other in video games.  Yes, the actual gameplay is fairly simplistic, but everyother aspect of this game is so well crafted, that I barely noticed to relative lack of gameplay depth.  When discussion arise over whether or not some video games count as art, this game deserves to be right in that argument, as it is, as I said before, beautiful.			"

												Well I got this on sale and even though it has some issues in terms of mechanics it's pretty awesome overall.  Well worth the sale price and probably full price for most folks into this sort of thing. The good stuff- the art work is insane.  Love the characters and the landscapes are phenomenal.  The battle system gets a little repetitive but in other ways it's very cool and chess like. As beautiful as the landscapes are the caravan Oregon Trail choose your own adventure stuff gets a little old.   Especially when there is Renown riding on some of it  and this is what you use to level up your characters.  The Renown thing gets pretty old.   Also when characters just leave or die maybe possibly based on said paperback choose your own adventure style ""decision"" and then the resources you spent leveling them up go with them.  But you can't argue with how beautiful the game is.  The animation is gorgeous.  The Varl are cool and it is really a pretty relaxing experience to strategize and soak in the visuals.			"

												The Banner Saga is an epic fantasy tactics RPG with a fair helping of strategy in a style similar to Oregon Trail. The game's art is superb, as well as it's sound and music. Thematically, it leans heavily towards Norse/Viking lore and styles however it possesses it's own distinct and unique world. The game switches perspectives on occasion not disimilar to the style of Game of Thrones, and a concurrent storyline carries throughout the game. Gameplay primarily revolves around overseeing a caravan on it's perilous journey through an ever-darkening world. Without the option, (save in rare scenarios) to choose your own path, the game is fairly linear, but each playthrough can take on a unique life of it's own depending on your choices.The battle mechanics are unique and often unforgiving. It will make you relearn and redefine conventional tactics as you know them (for veterans of the genre) and it will take time to master strategy on the battlefield. Unlike tactics games such as Shining Force and Fire Emblem, having your characters defeated in battle does not translate to their certain death, but losing or underperforming in a battle carries with it it's own tragic penalties. This game is not easy and often an unfortunate chain of events can find your caravan spiraling into waste and ruin. I ended up starting over several times after some unfortunate events and bad choices lead my caravan to near certain doom and perennial misery. The game has a dark tone that intensifies as you get deeper into it and though you are offered a commendable number of potential ""party members"" for use in the game's tactics-style battles a loss here or a poor decision there can easily result in losing one of your favoured characters, and the game mercilessly proceeds at it's own pace while you are forced to mourn the dead quickly and keep your wits sharp for the fate of the rest of your caravan.I found myself often trying to be the ""good guy"" or ""hero"", doing my best to help those I came across in need and treat all I encountered justly, and the game tries to reward you for this when possible, but there were other times where being the good guy ended up feeling like a thankless job, wrought with unseen potential dangers and more of a burden than I could afford to expend. At a certain point in the game I was forced to turn down a group of villagers-trying-to-go-refugee with an enemy force bearing down on us, knowing quite certainly there fate was incoming but barely having enough supplies to keep my own group alive and well for the unknown journey ahead. At another time in my saga, my caravan encountered a group of bandits waylaying another group of travelers and when the bandits offered to bribe us with off with some of their victims supplies, I actually found myself relieved at the way it turned out,... then realized just how far I had fallen.10/10, it made a heartless monster out of me			"

												Prepare for an epic tale set in a world overflowing with rich lore. The first thing you will notice is the unique graphics - Parralax mapping with multilayers give this mostly 2d game a dazzling view of the landscape as your caravan and followers traverse through a godless and ravaged land. As the game starts up you will be captivated by the beautiful soundtrack that accompanies your saga, As you make your first hard decisions for your band of survivors you will come to the realization this story will remain with you forever, much like the Sun that never sets.I would highly recommend this game to anyone. 10/10			"

												Simply put, one of THE BEST games I've ever played. Pros:EVERYTHING, including:- Music. The score is beautiful and memorable. Beyond anything I've ever heard in a video game.- Writing. Subtle yet brilliant. The plot is simple, but it serves as a background for a multitude of themes. The pacing is also well organized, building up to an epic conclusion.- World building. The lore is well grounded and mature, yet still enchanting and engaging. Especially if you're into the cold, gloomy Norse stuff.- Characters. Well written and memorable. - Art style and visuals. Just look at the screenshots, it's beyond beautiful.- Gameplay. The tactical combat is deep and well thought-out. The random encounters are interesting. I never thought that watching an animated caravan rolling through the screen (for hours on end) would make for such an enjoyable and thrilling gaming experience. It does.- The general atmosphere of the setting. - The ending and the final scene. Cons:- None.- Yep, not a single thing.This game is nothing short of perfect. This is the Silmaril of video games - a flawless gem, plain and simple in shape, refined in proportions, but filled with radiance and light of its own. Verdict: 11/10			"

												I have just finished the game and I have to say I am so in ♥♥♥♥ing aw that I have to write this review.The good:+ Art style and animations: The game is visually incredible. The hand-drawn animations are splendid in cut scenes, dialogues and combats. + The atmosphere: The Banner Saga’s mood is somber overall and it goes perfectly well with the art direction. Also, there is something so captivating about watching tiny people marching through the frozen mountainous land.+ The soundtrack: Emotionally and eargasm material, the music contributes a great deal to the atmosphere of the game.+ The characters: Most of the characters in the game are fascinating with compelling background story. Too bad the story is short and some characters don’t stick around long enough for you to know them better.+ The lore and setting: The developers has established massive and in-depth lore which you can read about or discover as the game proceed. I find the Viking setting of the game quite unique and remarkable. + That ♥♥♥♥ing boat scene.The so-so+/- Gameplay: The Banner Saga uses a combat system resembles some classic SRPG games with a twist. You use a party of maximum 6 heroes to fight in a gridded, chess-like field. Each characters has 2 main stats: Strenght and Armor. Strength determine an unit’s health and attack, meanwhile armor determines your defense. The more strength an unit has, the harder he hits and vice versa. The more armor you has, the less damage you will take and you can ward off an attack completely if your armor is significantly higher than the attacking unit’s strength. Doing armor damage does not reduce health but it does reduce the enemies’ defenses, thus makes them more vulnerable. In addition of strength and armor, each heroes also has willpower. Willpower can be spent to make an unit move farther, deal more damage or using special ability. You and your opponent take turn to move and take action until there is one last person standing of either side. The less people you has in play, the more actions 1 character can take, so you can use 1 or 2 powerful characters over and over again before the enemy can react. Imho, the turn order is the biggest exploitable flaw in the combat system.The caravan section demands you to balance between your supply, renown and morale of your clan during your journey. Supply sustain your clanmen and army, the larger your caravan, the more supply is consumed each day. If your supply reaches 0, the number of people in your caravan and your morale will diminish harshly with each day passes. Renown is the only currency in the game, which can be used to upgrade your heroes, buy equipment or buy more supply. Morale determines how well your heroes perform in combat, high morale give you booste in willpower during combat and vice versa. Your morale will slowly recede as your caravan travel but it can be boosted by halt your march and rest (consumes however many days worth of supplies you spend resting). The resources in the game are extremely scarce and play brutally important role on how your game progresses.+/- Difficulty: The game is hard and unforgiving, even in the beginning. +/- Story and narrative progression: The campaign is line near, but as the story processes, you will be given various choices, some are petty and insignificant, some are morally difficult and make huge impacts on your journey later on. The game is short and seems a little bit rushed, but the replay value is huge with the variety outcomes of the array of decisions given throughout the game.+/- No permadeath: You may still lose your heroes outside of combats as a result of a wrong decision.The bad: - There are some minor bugs that may occur during combat, which can be irritating at times.The Banner Saga is one of the best strategy game I have played in recent years. It is an extraordinary visual-audio experience but it could use some improvement in the combat system.Strongly recommended and looking forward to the sequel "

The story has several ""main"" characters and grows on you as you play it. The combat (on normal) is hard enough to make it fun and challenging and to affect the decisions in the rest of the game.Love the art style, especially the landscapes, and the viking theme.

												I've just given this game a 2nd chance after failling running it on Linux a couple of weeks ago.I might not have played it much, but I don't feel like playing it more for the moment.The Banner Saga is certainly very beautiful, but I find the gameplay rather confusing: the number of characters is a bit overwhelming, and they all feel somewhat hollow; when you finally get to know the main characters and the caravan the focus changes to yet other characters in a different place with different needs; it's very unclear to me why characters live or (permanently?) die after a battle - is it random? there is no way to save your game to test different strategies or correct mistakes; battles lack strategy: there are very few options and you can't even choose which character to use. Characters all have the same few possible actions (except for 1 special ability if any); when upgrading a character some icons make sense (like strength, armour or willpower) but the others are unknown to me (chains??) and don't seem to be explained anywhere - kinda frustrating, given that ressources are limited and you can't go back since there is no save; the game seems very linear and yet seems to lack strong story elements: nothing more than collecting taxes and fighting random battles on the way for the moment.I consider The Banner Saga as an interactive story with turn-by-turn strategy elements - a genre I can enjoy, but IMHO it simply doesn't stand the comparison with other recent games (like Transistor or Shadowrun: Dragonfall) which have a solid gameplay, a more immersive storyline, strong characters, and great music & visuals as well - all this from the very beginning of the game.I must add that the Linux version of the game lags so much it's unplayable - yet the game runs fine on the same computer with Windows.I bought it on sale and yet have regrets. I don't think it's a bad game, but it's definitely not the game I was expecting.			"

												I can't come up with any other term that fits better than ""Gamer Blue Balls"".  The artwork was beautiful and unique, greatly reminding me of the best of 70's and 80's era line-art epics like Lord of The Rings or The Hobbit. They did an amazing job of creating a deep and interesting universe, from history to cultue and artwork. They have well-developed characters with mostly believeable behavior. The gameplay is challenging, especially in evoking the grim feeling of scarce resources and harsh choices.  You can build your characters up for combat, or you can try to keep your people alive, or you can do both poorly. There will never be enough currency (Renoun) to manage both. They managed to keep me interested in the civilians and the story enough to actually care about the choices I made, and agonize over the risk of starving them all to death in the cold. They built up an epic plot with several layers that were just coming to maturity when, out of nowhere, and with no warning at all, the credits start rolling. You finish a boss fight, that one of the characters even comes out and says won't actually kill the big bad guy, just put him down for a while. Enemy army - still rampaging through the world. Big world crisis - still utterly untouched and in full swing. Personal story - also still in the middle of everything. They created this grim, georgous, hugely challenging world that I absolutely loved, and just suddenly shoved a ""The End"" in your face at one random chapter about 1/3rd of the way in. If they had either finished the rest of the game, or made it clear from the beginning that this was only Part 1 of several, I would have been so happy with it. Instead, I'm left dissorientated, unfulfilled, and rather irritated. Maybe they were more upfront about it with their backers, but I missed this Kickstarter, and all I know of the game is what was listed in Steam. Sorry, but unless they patch this with the rest of the game that they left out, I can't recommend this to anyone. Such a shame to waste so very much potential.			"

All for a hard game where people die (x-com comes to mind) if you make mistakes but getting ""pulled aside for a little chat"" and then having 3 chars murdered is not my cup of tea.

												First off, I do want to say that in the begninning I was in love with this game. It struck me as a kind of oregon trail gone vikings. The combat is fun, requiring some strategy, and the story was interesting. The main issue that I had with the game is as a casual gamer I generally play on easy, and while a little challenge is fun constant challenge is not fun. Amusingly enough I found the combat to be jut about right to what I wanted, it was the (in my opinion) inability to ever have enough renown to level my guys up and feed my caravan, let alone buying anything. I restarted the game after chapter 5 because all of my people starved because I spent too much leveling up characters. On my second play through I spent almost all my renown on food, but ended up getting killed alot more in battle becase I was not leveled up. This to me, seems like it should be how the normal or hard setting works. When I play easy I want it to be just that, easy.			"

												While The Banner Saga has some interesting concepts such as the art and in-game fighting mechanics, it's real turn off is the three main deiceiving points that are apparent throughout the game.1. The game does not have any strategic elements aside the turn based battles - The battles are frankly very interesting and quite amusing, until you get used to them in like 15 battles. From then on you fight the same enemies in almost the same fashion over and over again. But The Banner Saga deceives you where it makes you think you have a choice in creating the outcome of the battle, such as charging in, or escaping. Truth be told, while the turn based fights are extremely difficult, the battlefield chocies has very little to do with the outcome of the overall game, meaning you can do mostly whatever you please to avoid battles to complete the game successfully.2. The Banner Saga deceives in that ""Player's choice drives your own narrative"", but realistically, whatever choice you make does VERY little to do with the outcome of the game. Sure, some unimportant characters might die off here and now, and you might lose some men and food etc, but it really has minimal impact on the actual gameplay and most importantly, it barely has any impact on the story. What this means for you is that whatever choice you make ultimately brings you back to whatever path (if any) the developers wanted you to follow, making the game extremely linear. Trust me, i've played the game three times just to check.3. Super short story - this is chapter 1 of the supposed trilogy, which I had no idea when I bought the game. But the troubling factor is that the game is full of filler elements: a vast array of unnecessary battles to make you feel like you've played a lot. By the third playthrough of this game, I decided to speed hack and cheat to make my characters god-like, and I managed to finish the game in two hours. That's how short the game really is. And no, there is nothing special about the story. the whole time you're trying to find out the reason behind your enemy's invasion and the game never succeeds in narrating why this happened, merely leaving you with... an unsuccessful cliffhanger meaning you aren't left curious of what will happen next because you don't really connect with any of the characters or the story.All in all, I wouldn't pay any more than $5 for this game.

												If you want a beautiful RPG experience that harkens to BioWare's early PC games, you won't be let down by this game.  Add one part Song of Fire and Ice (game of thrones), one part Vikings, and one part Ogre Battle and you have this game. About 75% of the game is spent in combat - turn-based strategy that is fairly interesting but don't expect anything as good as Final Fantasy tactics.  The other 25% is spent in the metagame of managing your troops via interactions, across the snowy north.  By that I mean making important D&D style decisions that have a very meaningful impact.Example: You have 700 troops and the enemy number over 1000 in the tree line.  You will soon be surrounded.  What do you do?1 Rush for the next town and try to lose them. (risk losing troops and supplies)2 Charge the enemy head on (engage in turn-based battle) to create a diversion and save some troops.3 Instruct your fire archer to set the forest ablaze to create a getaway. (dice roll, I permanently lost my only archer this way)4 Lead the enemy further into the forest and then light in on fire. 5 Order your troops to make a defensive formation.There are also animated interactions on the field and in town, wherein choices you make will have a direct impact on how much money, troop count, or loyalty you will lose/gain.  The game forces you to make tough decisions and there is -NO- returning to a save point, you must live with each crippling lost battle, or bad decision you make.  The art is fantastic, as is the storyline.  It's a beautiful RPG in every sense of the word.  At $25 it was really expensive but I wanted to support this dev.  It's easily worth $10 on a steam sale.			"

												Let me start by saying this: The Banner Saga is not a bad game, but merely a decent one and I do not think it's worth the full asking price.The Good:+The soundtrack by Austin Wintory is amazingly atmospheric.+The story, world and characters are quite good, especially since norse mythology is underused in general.+The combat draws from other games like Heroes of Might and Magic and Fire Emblem.+Great animations both during travel and while in combat.The Bad:-Sound effects repeat way too often and I'm pretty sure Varl, Humans and even Dredge have the same pained emotes.-The story is not finished, which means that you more or less have to buy the next game to get a proper ending.-A lot of characters repeat but with a few other details and just a swap of color.-The map is confusing to read and it can be almost impossible to decipher where you're going and how much you should provision.-Random events are scarce and too random, seriously just find a guide, especially for the ones where your characters die.-Renown doesn't make any sense as a concept in the game. Slaying enemies, making good choices and reaching milestones grants renown points. These points can then be used to level up characters when they have enough kills, buy items and buy provisions. But how exactly does your renown pay for food? And why do I lose renown when my heroes level up? Adding further to this is the fact that the game is one long escape from the apocalypse, but due to how renown is gained, you have to fight in as many battles as possible to level up the most and buy more provisions.-The combat UI is clunky.-Furthermore, combat feels off in many ways. See your HP is also your damage, I quite like this mechanic, however this leads to situations where it's actually better to let enemies live rather than killing them. The reason is because the initiative system always switches sides until only the last enemy remains.Bottom Line:The Banner Saga is a decent game that can be fun at times, but lots of small nagging design flaws will be trying your patience throughout, if you must play it, buy it during a sale.

												Play as a bunch of white nordic types fighting to stop a bunch of ""obsidian"" skinned refugees who are fleeing their homecountry... Hmm, pretty accurate simulation of the EU right now...9/10 - I expected more banner related gameplay.			"

												Won't say much about the story, as I think it's better if you just jump into the world. Something that needs to be said, anyway - this is only something like the first part of a series, and will leave you hungering for more. I guess you can enjoy it even paying full price, but keep in mind it's not the complete story and you'll have to wait for the next to get some answers.Highly recommended if you like vikings, turn-based strategic RPGs, or games where the plot and decisions you make play a big part.Pros+ The storyline. Every decision counts, and you may actually feel sorry for what you've done. Many characters can die if you make the wrong choices. That's cool, because then you want to replay the game and do everything better!+ Great characters and locations, with a deep world behind them+ The background, including all the misteries and the dead gods+ At least for me, combat system was awesome and fights could be challenging sometimes+ Beautiful musicCons- I found some characters to be way stronger and useful than others, the game didn't feel like well balanced- The story is not complete, and will leave you with unanswered questions until the next game shows up- Even with the decision making and random events, the game is very linear- It kinda sucks that keeping everyone fed and happy in the caravan doesn't seem to matter in the end, you can just keep your money for shiny amulets and let those peasants starve or leave			"

												The art is beautiful, the music is beautiful, the story is interesting, and it has good gameplay... But it is honestly very depressing to play. :'(I'd recommend playing this, and then watching a series of cat videos afterwards to forget how depressing this game is.			"
