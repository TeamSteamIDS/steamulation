												Borderlands 2 is a game for those that enjoy the feeling of finding awesome equipment hidden in a massive pile of other stuff.Sure, you don't NEED to go in-depth with this game.  On the first playthrough you can get by with just picking up gear as you travel along, choosing stuff that looks better than your current gear, and maybe occasionally buying something in the vendor that looks handy.  The deeper you go down the rabbit hole however, the more there is to discover.The story is decent for a First Person Shooter (albeit one with RPG elements), and dialogue is often amusing to a degree.  Handsome Jack, the main antagonist is a cartoon villain with M rated attitudes.  He believes, or at least pretends to believe that he is the good guy, and you are just a ""Filthy Bandit."".Graphically, the game has a lot more variations in design and color scheme than it's predecessor (which was brown, brown, and a bit of color here and there).  Cell shaded graphics with thick, graphic novel like outlines is the style of the game, and does a good job of separating it from the average FPS.Now, on to the gameplay itself!:Action is often fast paced and exciting.  So long as you don't allow yourself to get too far ahead of the enemy levels, you'll find battles where you have to fight hard to win.  The game does a decent job of easing you into the various elements, such as different gun types (Pistol, SMG, Assault/Combat Rifle, Shotgun, Revolver, Rocket Launcher, and Sniper Rifle), the importance of a good shield, grenade mods (alter the way your grenade behaves, including damage bonuses and special effects), Class Mods (Class-specific devices which can boost skills, and have other effects like increasing fire rate with specific weapon types), and lastly Relics (Device which generally boost damage or defence in some way).  Equipment rarity is also made fairly clear.  It goes White, Green, Blue, Purple, Magenta, Orange, Seraph, and Pearlescent.  The final two rarities (Pearlescent and Seraph) are special.  Seraphs require you to have at least one of the season pass DLC to obtain (and you need all 4 of the Season Pass DLC to obtain all the Seraph rarity items), and as to Pearlescent rarity weapons, you need to be in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (Playthrough 3) for them to have a chance of being spawned.  Don't assume that a blue is automatically better than a green rarity item, even at the same level.  Experiment!Playable Characters and Skills:There are 4 included playable characters, and two DLC characters.  Each class has it's ups and downs, and a special game changing skill unique to them.  For example, Salvador (Gunzerker) will dual-wield guns when his action skill is active, meaning TWICE THE FIREPOWER.  Axton (Commando) drops a turret, which damages enemies and draws aggression away from you.  Maya (Siren) locks an enemy's movements for a short time, allowing you to get in free hits.  Zer0 turns invisible for a few seconds and launches a decoy, and his first attack made whilst in this mode does increased damage.  The DLC characters are Gaige (Mechromancer) who launches a flying robot that attacks nearby enemies, and Kreig (Psycho); a schizophrenic musclebound maniac that will whale on everything within reach with increased offensive and defensive capabilities and can even throw his axe at more distant targets.Aside from the action skills unique to the character, there are various other skills that you can put points into, and have an effect on gameplay in some way.  For example, increasing fire rate or damage for a few seconds after a kill is made.  Each character has 3 skill trees, each ending with a final gamechanging skill modifier.  For example, Zer0's Bloodlust (Melee) tree ends with the Many Must Fall perk, which will instantly re-deploy the hologram if he kills the enemy with one melee strike.  As mentioned before, Class Mods unique to a character class will boost certain skills.  It's possible for them to go as high as +6, meaning some skills can be boosted to 11, as the normal limit on points you can put into most skills is 5, though some skills are only 1 (those usually affect the way you play).Plus, there is a gun that shoots swords....EXPLODING swords...In DLC4 (Tiny Tina's Assault on the Dragon Keep).  So yeah, there is that too.I hope you found my review useful, even if it might be a bit messy XD			"

Borderlands 2 - Excellent Story, Solid Gameplay, Great Characters and one of the very best Coop experiences around.  || 9.5 || Score Comment   Graphics 8 Borderlands 2 has a visual style all its own, it may not initially impress some used to a ""next generation, high definition, ultra realistic landscape"", but it is nevertheless very appealing and detailed. Some of the landscapes and views around Pandora (the world on which the story takes place) are beautiful and each area has its own look and atmosphere. Characters and enemies are detailed and extremely varied in appearance. You can customise your characters appearance with a large selection of outfits and heads which you can collect throughout the game.   Audio 10 No real killer soundtrack here (apart from the the introduction video), just really good atmospheric music throughout. Where this game really shines is the voice acting for characters, enemies, audio logs and even weapons (yes some of them can talk!). The dialogue is often very funny, helping to explain and drive the story, fill in background and really adds the the immersion.   Gameplay 9 A mix of FPS and RPG, Borderlands 2 is a lot of fun to play. So many missions to complete, so many enemies to kill, so much loot to grab. You are given massive area's to explore all over the world of pandora filled with creatures, quests, secrets and homages to lots of popular culture. Controls are responsive, intuitive and the game mechanics (even at higher difficulties) feel fair and well thought through. As you progress through the game you will earn xp and levels which allow you to customise your characters skills giving a large variety of gameplay styles.   Story 9 The story in Borderlands 2 is rich and engaging. The action is character driven, and while the main story is fairly linear, the open world nature of the game allows you to take a break from the main story arc and explorer the hundreds of characters and side missions that can be found all over Pandora. It also has one of the most badass, charasmatic and handsome villians of all time...    Replayability 9 So many reasons to replay this game. Firstly the story can be completed at least 3 times with the same character at increasing difficulty and xp levels (normal, true vault hunter and ultimate vault hunter) with progressively better rewards. There is so much detail in the story and so many optional missions that each play through feels different. Next you have at least 4 (more with DLC) characters each with their own skills, playstyle and story to explore. Finally you have tons of loot in the form of Guns, Shields, Grenades, Relics and Class Mods you can collect for your character. These increase in rarity from white (basic) to orange (legendary) generally the rarer the weapon the more damage it will do and many will have additional unique abilities (red text).    Multiplayer 10 For me, this game remains simply the best cooperative multiplayer experiences you can have. Your character's skills really augment and compliment each other when playing as a team. Enemy and mission difficulty automatically adjusts to the amount of players, requiring real teamwork and synergy to avoid dying at higher levels. The multiplayer allows you to connect (drop in and out midgame) to your steam friends games or to public games, connections for the most part feel quick and responsive even with 4 players and with only a small delay on audio communication.    Overall 9.5 I can't recommend this game enough, while a minority of missions feel like you are just a glorified delivery boy, most are creative, funny and packed full of classic moments and great characters. So much fun to pick up and play with friends. - I haven't really mentioned the DLC (of which there is a lot) in this review but the main ones (Mr Torgue's, Captain Scarlett and especially Tiny Tina's) are all well worth getting (these are included in the Game of the Year edition), great fun to play and add loads more content to the game. To progress to the highest level in the game (level 72 +overpower levels) you will also need the ultimate vault hunter pack 2 so I would recommend that if you reach the end and still want more.

												There is something to be said for a game that I just don't get sick of. I have owned this on console and played through TVHM at least 4 times with 4 different characters there. Played all the DLC except Tiny Tina on console, but when the GOTY edition became so cheap on PC I jumped at it and bought all the Headhunter DLCs, and the Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack as well. So I can now play through the game THREE times on a character. DarI'm so addicted to this game still, but the funny thing is that I don't even finish it, or even come close to it now. I'm in a mass addiction to boosting my Badass Ranks so I just keep trying to ""prestige"" it instead of moving on and going towards UVHM. xDI feel like I can pick this game up and play it at any time. Do a few things, and then quit playing. Unfortunately, for me anyways, I don't do that. I keep playing for hours, and I let all the other hundreds of games in my library continue to pile up. I play this game EXCLUSIVELY in SINGLE PLAYER. People will tell you that it is much more fun playing with friends, and truly it can be, but don't disregard this game as a single player game. It is insanely addictive, and it actually poses some slight challenges to you to play it solo. Beating Raid Bosses solo is actually a genuine accomplishment, if you can actually do it. They are meant to be beaten witha 4 player team, but you CAN beat many of them solo. The new Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (UVHM) makes it an even more insane challenge to play solo just for the regular game enemies. Needing to pump them full of slag just so you can actually get ready to start damaging them with any real power. Of course all this is basically a math problem of damage output vs. damage defense. Borderlands 2, simply put, is one of the best games ever made in my opinion. The sheer addictiveness and fun in playing it are jsut off the charts. I recommend this to anyone, even if you think you won't like it. I thought Borderlands 1 looked stupid for years until I bought it for $5 with everything and realized how amzing the concept is and how it was made for OCD gamers. Now they are both 2 of my most played games ever, and I don't see myself stopping BL2 anytime soon. After all I ahven't even used The Psycho yet!Buy the GOTY Edition. It is the best deal by far and has most of the relevant content you will want. Forget about the Season Pass and regular game. GOTY has all that stuff and more. Then buy the Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack to get extra level sand a 3rd round. The headhunter DLCs are worth it too for the cheap prices. Only thing not to buy are the stupid skin packs. Unless you like that sort of thing. Wait for it to go 75% off and you can get GOTY, UVH Pack, and allt he Headhunter DLCs for less than $20. BTW...these DLCs are legit and worth buying. This isn't some garbage map pack DLC, or jsut skins. These are high quality and large DLCs on the scale of the FAllout DLCs, and add even more than that in some of tehm. GOTY edition has almost too much content. >_>			"

												Borderlands 2 has a lot of what made the original great. Its a shooter with role playing elements. Players loot enemies to collect gear that best compliments their play style.If you aren't familiar with BL, the best way to explain this is to take the addicting looting system of Diablo and combine it with the basic elements of an FPS, throwing in some RPG via an inventory and skill tree. That's essentially the mechanics of the game, and it all slams together so well here. You have four basic classes to choose to play from, and each class has three paths to focus on in a skill tree -- this means there's plenty of variation to play. In addition to these basic mechanics, the game is open-world, though it may feel semi-linear as you can only explore on an area-by-area basis (think the opposite of an Elder Scrolls game, where you can walk around the entire map without hitting a loading screen until accessing a dungeon). I have to say, with combining so many of our favorite gaming formulas, this game has so many highlights. Sometimes I felt like I was playing something akin to Skyrim. Other times, the ambiance of a specific area or the design of a specific feature reminded me of BioShock. And sometimes certain things brought me back to my Fallout 3 days. However, I never forgot I was playing a completely new adventure that easily whisked me away for hours in the unique and captivating world of Pandora. Lastly, I can't forget the guns. No joke, there are millions of guns you can find. It is so satisfying to find a ridiculous weapon and destroy enemies for the next three hours with it, only to find another weapon that is even better.One thing many BL veterans mentioned is the lack of a good narrative beyond funny one-liners in the original game. I never played Borderlands 1, but I can tell you that in BL 2 the characters are memorable, the writing is well-thought out and downright hilarious, and the story moves at a great pace with scenes of great emotion and other scenes of great sarcasm. This is all coming from someone who is used to epic stories from Final Fantasy or Mass Effect. Also, be sure to keep your ears peeled while you fight the various enemies. They say and do some hilarious things themselves. But seriously, the writing is just super clever.In conclusion, this is one heck of a game. I feel that it combines the best of so many game genres into a single FPS while adding in a memorable story that motivates you to find out what happens next. Of course, you'll be laughing your face off the entire way.			"

												Definitely one of the best ""new"" games I have played. This game is fun to play solo or over the net with friends. The characters are witty, yeah even Claptrap :) Graphics are beautiful... Even after playing this game over 3000 hours; the game gives wow-moments to me. And every time there's something new.... and the vast choice of weapons, shields and other gadgets. So I full-heartedly recommend Borderlands 2. And yes, I will play co-op with you :)			"

												I had played 1200 hours before I even tried any of the DLC. Now, if that doesn't speak to the incredible level of fun and depth that this game brings, well, I just don't know that anything can. Sometimes I wonder how much better my life would be if I had spent those 1400 hours doing something constructive like studying my trade, helping the poor, or working on my home. But not often. Second best game ever made. Absolutely terrific. Life ruiner. Go for it.			"

												It's been a few years, so there's not much I can say that was missed/overlooked by other reviews, but I still get someone every once in a while asking ""how is the game now,"" now that the community has dwindled in activity. This is the best way I can describe it:Playing Borderlands 2 is just like going to a Standup Comedy Club.You can go alone, have a couple drinks, you'll enjoy yourself. Some of the jokes will be pretty old, but you'll still enjoy the way they are told by the new comedians. At the end of the show you'll go home and think ""that was great, I'm glad I did that.""On the other hand. If you go with some of your goofy friends you'll probably all be drunk as hell before the headliner even takes the stage. Absolutely everything will be funny as ♥♥♥♥ because that's just how it is when you're drunk with friends. At times you'll be having so much fun being stupid with each other that you might forget there's a guy on-stage trying to keep your attention. After the show you'll drag yourselves home, wondering where the hell that donkey came from, and swear you'll never do it again... until next weekend when you do it again.Special Note: Please see the first 2 comments below explaining high hours.

												Borderlands 2 is an action role playing first person shooter, developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2k Games in September 2012. It is the second game in the Borderlands series and the sequel to the popular 2009 hit Borderlands 1. As with the first game, you are able to complete a campaign with the main story quest and optional side missions as one of the four Vault hunters.  All of the key gameplay features are all present, such as online co-op, randomly generated loot and character building elements such as talent trees are all found in Borderlands 2. There has been a game of the year edition released last year which includes all the DLC apart from one. The gameplay at it's core is the same as Borderlands 1. The focus on randomly generated loot plays a huge part. Each of the characters you have the option to play as have their own specialty, and will bring a feel of originality to each playthrough on either of them.  We also see a new elemental effect in BL2, Slag, this is a substance that increases the damage a target takes if they are covered in it. You will also find Eridium bars as you play the game, these can be used to purchase storage upgrades and increase the amount of ammo you can carry. We also see an element of customizing how your character looks as well, you can unlock different skins, head designs, colour schemes and vehicle paint jobs.  Another major addition to BL2 is the ""Badd@ss rank"" system; points are awarded for completing certain in-game challenges, that in turn award tokens that will allow you to increase your base stats. These stat increases also take effect on all of your other single player characters too.  Also similar to the the original, we also see the return of a New Game Plus mode, in the form of ""True Vault Hunter Mode"", which increases the difficulty, and gives you a higher chance at even better loot drops. You are also able to level up to 50 in this mode too. The graphics in Borderlands 2 are virtually the same as the original, but with just a more enhanced look to them. We see the vibrant colour schemes in each zone come to life. Along with better quality textures too.  The style of graphics in Borderlands has always been a huge drawing point for me as there are hardly any other games which pull this style off as well as this. Your first playthrough Borderlands 2 will have a number of difficult encounters, but these can easily be overpowered by returning to the same bad guy, mission or zone after leveling up one or two more times, or getting a bigger better gun. If you stay on top of all of the side missions as you progress through the story mission, you will stay at the right level so that you won't just hit a brick wall of impossible monsters/enemies. To make matters easier when it comes to deciding how tough a mission will be, each one also has a recommended level - so you can easily see how hard a single mission will be without actually having to test the waters first. A full playthrough on single player of Borderlands 2 took me just under thirty hours. That is a pretty decent amount of content on offer, with the side missions and a decent amount of loot farming involved too. I have put almost 140 hours into Borderlands 2, as I have played various different characters through the story a number of times. This is a game where you can easily spend 300 hours and still be having the same amount of fun. I had zero amount of technical issues throughout BL2; the game is perfectly optimized, will run at 60 fps, and the cloud save feature makes it even better technically. Borderlands 2 is easily in my top 5 favorite games of all time. Just like the original, Borderlands 2 is a perfect game with no flaws in it at all. I cannot recommend this game enough. Most people will already have it since it goes on sale so much, but PLEASE play it. You will NOT be disappointed.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended 5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Borderlands 2 is a overall amazing game, different from many other shooters.It's colorful, looks amazing, and has one of the best shooter multiplayer experiences of all.All the content without DLC alone can be 60+ hours. The DLC adds even more to that. So farI have 250+ hours on the game and I'm not even done with all the modes.My only problem is that it kinda forces you to play with other players, playing multiplayer gives better loot,and makes the game much easier to play. Playing alone will get you killed alot unless your ready to grind a bit for the best weapons. But if your buying this game you'll probably play online anyway, since there's usually always at least one player around where you are in a public game.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Borderlands 2 Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: FPS; RPG; Cooperative; Lighthearted; Action  My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 30-100 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Multiplayer gamers  REVIEWBorderlands 2 is the sequel to the original installment of the franchise. Like the first one, it is a chef-d'oeuvre of gaming. It boasts a masterful blend of FPS and RPG elements with an elaborate loot system to make for truly delectable gameplay. Complementing the gameplay is the unique and self-identifying art style and graphics, the blithe and cartoonish atmosphere, and the lighthearted narrative and zany NPC characters. All of these factors working in concert generate one hell of a gaming experience that should be able to bring pleasure to nearly any gamer out there.Borderlands 2 plays very much like the first game, except there is just a little bit more of everything. Also, there are numerous small tweaks that go a long way to improve the tiny nuisances of the first installment. It is a direct sequel, but the lighthearted nature of the narrative allows for players to safely not worry about having played the first in order to understand the plot.At the core of Borderlands 2, we find the same exemplary elements found in the first installment of the franchise. The gameplay is designed to offer both the face-paced action of an FPS with the character progression elements and gameworld massiveness of an RPG. There is an XP system that awards level-ups and ability-boosts. There are scores of quests to complete; some ancillary and others pivotal to the core narrative. There is a crazy world to explore, filled with various interesting NPCs. Enemy spawns and combat occur in real-time, right in the midst of everything else that is going on in the gameworld. There is never a dull moment or a lack of something to be working towards.Borderlands 2 also has an elaborate and semi-random loot drop system. In the style made popular by games like Diablo, loot spills out of chests, crates, and enemies to pile up on the floor for you to peruse. Much of it will be junk, but you must always keep an eye out for the rare high quality drops. This is the same style used in the first Borderlands, except it has been amplified to offer a much wider variety of goodies. Due to the nature of the stat-progression of the weapons and the sheer variety, you will find yourself experimenting with many more and various weapons than you would in a standard FPS.With Borderlands 2 comes the return of the self-identifying art style that was made iconic in the first game; except the graphics are more crisp and detailed in this installment. The graphics fit the theme of the game with perfection, as they expertly relay the feeling of zany, cartoonish raucousness that the game is striving to evoke. This atmosphere sets the tone for the burlesquing narrative which never wastes an opportunity to poke fun at the other, more serious games it relates to.  Also returning in Borderlands 2 is the option for a cooperative multiplayer approach to playing the campaign. The multiplayer also borrows from the style made popular by games like Diablo. You are able to play with other people by either allowing them to join your session or by joining theirs. You bring your own characters and earn your own XP and loot, but the game will be progressed up to the point that the host has reached. Playing with friends, or even with random people, can make the experience exponentially more hilarious and fun.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												After more than 300h playing this is my short review.Pros- Story rich, the devepment of the story game is brilliant even with the side quests, you will hate and love Handsome Jack.- Jack, he is one of the best main antagonist in gaming history.- Amazing NPC characters like Tina, Claptrap, Mr.Torgue, Roland, etc.- Great playable classes all different to each other and all of them intereting to play in different way.- Loot, it's hard to get some legendaries but it's always fun to open a chest and get something amazing.- Weapons, super fun to learn what this new gun with red text does (one of them shoots explosive swords!)- Eastern eggs, there's one quest that you have to bring a ring from Claptrap Place to one mountain in Eredium Blight and throw it to the lava then 3 birds comes with loot chests lol.- Best community ever, always willing to help and play with you.Cons- Claptrap needs a wife			"

												There were a lot of things that made Borderlands such a great game when it came out three years ago: the hardscrabble planet, the oddball characters, the hostile creatures, the diverse missions, the abundant loot, the powerful skill trees, and the novelty of all these things combined in a cooperative first-person shooter. In Borderlands 2, the novelty is gone, but all of the other elements are back and better than ever. This sequel doubles down on the successes of the original and shores up its shortcomings, improving the familiar formula and delivering dozens and dozens of hours of immensely entertaining gameplay.THE GOOD:- A ton of great mission writing and dialogue- Enticing loot and experience rewards- Intriguing skill trees- Rich, inviting gameworldTHE BAD:- Spoken messages sometimes interrupt each other- One character ability is not substantially different from the core gunplay8.7/10 for me!

												This is a kinda game that you pick up, play until your balls are busted, drop it for a while and then pick it up again later.It's really fun, with a lot of guns (It is a lot of them. I thought I knew it but I've been told that in vanilla, BL2 had est. 1 mil guns). With a very well made combat and RPG system, this kinda game is something that everyone will gain a laugh out of, especially with friends. However that does not excuse it of the flaws it has. As you start the game, a Russian-ish man by the name of Marcus Kincaid tells you the introduction of the story, saying what happened in the ending of B1 (The original Vault Hunters finding and opening the vault only to find ""tentacles and disappointment"" which is weird since I find tentacles alone disappointing.) However, Hyperion has decided to step into power, by putting a H-formed Space Station over the sun/moon/whatever that thing is, making many of the areas overshadowed, and it also gives the game a ""Big Brother"" feeling with Hyperion watching Pandora.You are one out of 4 (6 with DLC. It's explained that Krieg got involved by riding on the side of the train in the end of ""A Meat Bicycle Made For Two"" but not how Gaige got in the train) Vault Hunters on a train, to find the new vault that Hyperion has discovered. Then they attempt to kill you, but Axton (as the Commando), Maya (as the Siren), Salvador (as the Gunzerker) and Zer0 (as a number Assassin) manages to together, survive and get into the last train cart, only to find a doll of Handsome Jack the antagonist, wired with loadsa bombs, welcoming them to Pandora before their supposed demise.This is where the game begins, with one (or depending on the friends you start with) Vault Hunter waking up in a snowstorm only to have a Steward Bot by the name of CL4-TP (Nicknamed ""Claptrap"" by his deceased non-existent friends) dig their grave. He finds you waking up, and enlists you as his ""Minion"" right from the get-go, and instructs you to get to Sanctuary with him.It may be a cheesy setup, but it's hella less cheesy than what B1 had.The gameplay is pretty much ""Grab the best that you can deal with until you find better guns to make bullets go out of them and into the enemies' heads and/or bodies."" Where you pretty much side quest until you've got guns good enough to face an army without having a Hulk with you (Unless you're playing Psycho where you are the Hulk.) Gearbox are pretty much ""Quantity over Quality"" when it comes to guns. Happiness is a warm gun when it comes to this game. The RPG system isn't like them Call of Duty games (This is a line you expected didn't you) where you can trade items, bid for them or duel for them with other players. One thing that I HATE though is that you only get 45 skill points instead of 50 when max level (Without DLC).The classes available are different from one another, and none of them are your average ""rooty-tooty-point-'n'-shooty-man"" due to their different trees and action skills. The Commando is the guy who likes Tower Defense games and has a turret with him to shoot and distract different enemies. When upgraded, it can cast a shield for your allies, be thrown on ceilings and walls, carry more guns and even rockets, plus having two of them! The Siren is a very much support class, her Phaselock lifts an enemy into the air and surrounds it in a ball of energy, which when upgraded can draw enemies towards it, deal elemental damage to everyone around, make your guns fire faster, and you can even make so that an enemy killed in Phaselock can heal you and your allies. She's also got a skill which lets you heal your allies by shooting them.The Gunslinger is all about compensating for his (presumably small) dong. He can wield two guns instead of one, and when upgraded can make so that you can distract enemies towards you, being able to gunzerk while downed, have a chance of not spending ammo when firing a gun, and... Just in general shoot two guns.The Assassin can turn invisible, and can regenerate health while cloaked, be able to perform backstabs, mark targets which makes them take more damage, throw Kunais with random elemental effects,  or you can make bandits be like ""He's like the wind..."" by getting increased gun and melee damage when moving (per level). There's also a skill called ""B0re"" which makes so that your shots have a chance of penetrating enemies and deal more damage every time it goes through someone... Gross.There are 5 elements in the game, Fire (great against those without a shield), Shock (Great against shields), Corrosive (Incredibly effective towards robots), Explosion (Which is pretty much self-explanotary) and Slag (By ""slagging"" an enemy, they take more damage when attacked by non-slag weapons.) Guns can either have one of these elements, or just have regular bullets which are all-rounders really. There are Pistols, SMGs, Assault Rifles, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles, Rocket Launchers and grenades. There's also E-Tech weapons. How do they work? Well, to quote Dr. Zed, ""It turns bullets into... Stuff that ain't bullets!"" They're different from bullet/rocket launchers. Normally they have better stats than normal guns but are harder to use. To quote Dr. Zed again, ""E-Tech is friggin' dope.""However the game expects you to do all the side quests, and such can get ahead of you quite a lot of times for people who just wanna beat the story real quick. It also has lots of difficulty spikes throughout the campaign, especially in the New Game Plus (named True Vault Hunter Mode).Despite all of this, it's a really good game, awesome with friends too. I'd say that you all should go and get it when it goes on a sale.			"

												My favourite thing about this game is it’s captivating story. With a lot of humour, this game pulls off an action shooter with RPG aspects and a storyline you should follow. There are lots of sidequests that will take hours to complete, but the benefits of completing this game are well worth the time. With millions of different guns, a lot of different character skins and a unique experience with all the various classes, this game has hours of fun built straight in.The game will be fun no matter which class you play, but that’s not entirely due to the class. I found that most of the classes really lack something to keep you interested in, and throughout the whole game it feels like more attention was given to certain classes over others. Story-wise, the siren is pretty much the only class that gets any attention and backstory, as an individual with a history and as a class with abilities. All of the classes have a slight amount of backstory that becomes obvious throughout the game, but Siren has significantly more, and even then it’s very little.Beyond that, the entertainment value of playing as certain classes over others was very noticeable to me. I played as all the classes, including the 2 DLC classes, and some of the abilities and skill trees and other class-specific aspects were lacking for a bunch of the classes. Some things that were common for all of the classes were that there are certain skill trees that seem obviously better than other ones and significantly simpler to think about, making them seem more attractive, and all of the classes lack enough in-game backstory to really get a feel for them. With all these classes, it comes down to a matter of opinion, what sort of playstyle you like and other such things, but I’ve found that there are some that are distinctly more enjoyable than others.I think if there were more random Echo Recorders placed around the maps with a bunch of stories about the characters, with more information on them the game could be a lot more interesting. Throughout my playing of the game, I found a couple about Maya (the siren), one about Zer0 (the assassin/ghost) and nothing about any other character. That’s always been something that annoyed me. The stories of the characters may exist somewhere, but if they do, they are probably too hard to find.In terms of story, I loved this game. There was a hint of humour in just about every interaction you had with the other characters, and the story overall was very captivating and kept me playing. I think the end-game was a bit lacking and didn’t completely match up with the story, but it was still interesting and I don’t regret playing this game through at all. The side quests in this game were very extensive, and easily one of my favourite aspects of the game. Some sidequests are very tedious and boring, but others are absolutely a blast, like those given to you by Tiny Tina (pun intended ;) ).The replayability of this game isn’t infinite, it does get boring to play through the same parts over and over again in this game, but that doesn’t mean you can’t play it more than once at all. Replaying the game in True Vault Hunter Mode, a difficulty increase that allows you to replay the game using your already powerful character, can still be quite fun. The difficulty of the game overall becomes harder while maintaining the same story with no new additions aside from more powerful guns.The playstyle in this game is very different from that of most other shooters. In Borderlands, you don’t really need to conserve any ammo and you can run around, jump and do a bunch of other crazy things while still attacking enemies. This makes the game more casual and relaxed, which I found to be pretty enjoyable. You very rarely run out of ammo, with all the excessive boxes with tons of different types of ammunition and the cheap price at which you can buy ammo in shops. That brings me to my next point, which is the excess of money in this game. There is very rarely an opportunity where spending money makes much sense or is beneficial, with ammo being really cheap and not really affecting your money and most of the items in shops being pretty bad compared to the ones you can get outside from drops. I know a lot of people enjoy using the slot machines at Moxxi’s bar, but I never found it that entertaining when it for the most part doesn’t get me anything decent. Pretty much the only point of collecting money is to get the badass ranks.The whole badass system is something I really like in Borderlands. Being able to slightly upgrade your character in about every way imaginable pretty awesome. Slowly, you’ll amass badass ranks by completing these missions, the more difficult missions resulting in more badass ranks, and for every 25 badass ranks you’ll get 1 badass token which can be used to upgrade one of the 5 stats presented. I really like the additional content that this adds to the game.Personally, I far prefer playing this game with other people. I don’t like playing very many games alone, and even if I’m playing a singleplayer game, I like to be talking to other people at the same time. I find it a lot more enjoyable, and the same thing applies to this game. I’ve never played this game without other people simply because every moment allows for a lot more laughing and interaction when you’re doing it with other people. If I had played through this game alone, I might have noticed some interesting bits of humour, but I never would have started laughing hysterically at some glitchy motion or funny joke. The enjoyment is multiplied by a lot when playing this game with other people.Something I noticed is that everyone plays this game differently. Personally, I like to play it patiently, doing all the sidequests, and being sure I’m making the right decisions with my skill points and gun choices. When I play Borderlands, I also like to play for as long of a period as possible. Of course I know nothing is that big of a deal, but I like being patient with this game and spending time on everything because I like feeling that I’m making the right decisions. Some of the people I have played with like to speed through the game and skip any extra content and make the easiest decisions possible. I think it’s important to play with people that have at least a similar mindset to you so that you aren’t being forced to play in a way that you aren’t entirely comfortable with.Warning: Slight spoilers in following paragraph. Reader discretion is advised.The final boss of the game really irked me. There was a whole obsession with how it was summoned using a siren and the key, both of which are very eridium oriented. The final boss used a lot of fiery attacks and swam in the pools of lava that surrounded the boss fight. I think it would have made a lot more sense if they were pools of molten eridium or something, with the boss spewing out eridium, or at least something purple, rather than fire. This game also has some really amazing individual lines. They are scared all throughout the game, but easily my favourite is the line that Scooter says when you meet him in Sanctuary. I’ve probably ruined the rewatching of that line several times when replaying the game with friends, through my inability to repeat the line properly and because I keep on trying.Overall, this game can easily be worth $20 depending on how much you play it and how much you enjoy it. I’d recommend getting it on sale simply because I’ve seen it go on sale reasonably often, for at least 66% off, but the game is also getting older and the Pre-Sequel (another game in this series, taking place between the first and second games) did come out recently. Quite simply, I love the amount of humour in this game, it’s a fun game to sink plenty of time into, and probably one of my top 10 all time games because of how much of a blast I had with it.			"

												Borderlands is an FPS+RPG game that includes tons of shooting and looting fun.Probably one of my favorite games of all time, I've had so much fun both in singleplayer and with other friends. The game has lots and lots of dlcs for you to enjoy, not to mention all the different guns this game has. It has such a massive variation  , almost every gun spawn with random parts from each manufacturer which makes it even more interesting. The art style is cartoon-ish which i think is absolutely great makes it really cool to play. The game has alot of replay value since they give you already 4 characters with their own uniqe skills to play around with plus the two dlc characters. The game is fairly long and there is still alot of stuff to do if you actualy complete it. The world is completely open and there is alot of exploring to do in the game. I've spent up to many hours getting just one gun that i wanted, but when you finally get the gun you have been farming or hunting for you really feel that you have achieved something. I made alot of friends in the past playing this game, either i joined random games or i found someone through the community, we had tons of fun together and we always kept on playing it every day. The coop has space for up to 4 players which i think is just fine considering the balancing of enemies (The more players you harder the game becomes, the better loot you will get.) That's really all i have to say about this wonderful game, I give it 10/10 probably the best game I've ever played, recommended to the highest.			"

TL:DR? See CONCLUSIONINTRODUCTION:Borderlands 2 is the sequel to the popular first-person co-op action adventure game Borderlands. Developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K games, it uses the formula which made the first game good and expanded it in astronomical proportions. The game promises larger maps, expanded co-op play, new classes and most importantly, procedurally generated items resulting in an almost infinite weapon & item variation.PLOT (No Spoilers):The story picks up after the events of the first game. Hyperion Corporation headed by Handsome Jack has arrived on Pandora, stolen the Vault Key and is driving the inhabitants to near extinction. The Vault Hunters from the first game (Roland, Lilith, Mordecai, & Brick) has gathered what was left of the Crimson Lance and reorganized them into the Crimson Raiders to stop Handsome Jack. The player takes control of a new set of Vault Hunters in their quest to help the Crimson Raiders stop Hyperion from opening a second Vault and unleashing a sleeping monster within.PROS:+ Cell-shaded textures that works well with the art style of the game+ Great voice acting and characters, most notably, Handsome Jack+  Expanded world which is almost 3 times larger than the first game+ New classes with new skills that are fun to play+ Entering and inviting for Co-op play is simple and easy+ Improved story from the first game with well paced missions+ Re-playability. The fun does not end after the final boss! There are new unlockable modes and expanded  adventure with...+ Quality Story DLC that adds several hours of game time per DLC campaign+ A lot of guns. “87 Bazillion Guns” as claimed by Gearbox+ Improved enemy AI that goes well with...+ Enemy Variety. Fight of bandits, robots, worms, armoured spiders, flying monsters and a whole lot more, each requiring the player to adapt by changing play-styles.+ Substantial amount of unlockable Character customization+ Good use of Physx for the benefit of PC gamersCONS:- Texture pop-in. Mostly noticeable when entering the game or entering a new area- Loot sharing needs to be improved since ninja looting is a concern for most players- In-game voices and messages, even story related ones, can overlap each other. New messages will cancel out any playing messages which is very annoying if your trying to immerse yourself in the story.- No ECHO (in-game voice message) replay like the first game. Once a voice-over message given by an NPC is overlapped, there is no way to listen to it again, aside from starting a new game plus.- Some DLC maps have glitchesCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and with a good blend of first-person shooting action, coupled with the progression and quest system of an RPG and all the fun and excitement of co-op play.WORTH IT?:I RECOMMEND this game to anyone looking for a fun coop experience with their buddies or story oriented gamers who likes an immersive experience. Although the game is well worth it's full price, I would still recommend this to be bought on SALE because of how often this title get discounted and by the sheer amount of DLCs available.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												Overall a great and funny RPG shooter game with frantic gameplay, unforgettable characters and tons of content. The art style is very unique and simple, and still looks great especially when you consider the age of this game. The loot system is exceptional, in my opinion, and I've spent hours grinding bosses or continuously clearing out areas to obtain rare items. Each weapon feels different and special because of randomly generated parts/unique characteristics. Playing with friends makes this game extremely fun to play, and if you don't have friends for whatever reason, then you can find an open session online and play with others. Definetely recommended!Personal Rating: 9.5/10			"

												Don't read this...Buy the game.A solid 10/10 game.The Good, the Bad, and the MordecaiThe Good:-Amazing story. The main story is truly funny and enjoyable.-Replay value: Having different characters with different play styles, Borderlands 2 stands out as one of the best games. -Achievements: You can get all the achievements with some work. None of them are bugged. You can get 100% of the  achievements.-Raid Boss fights: challenging and hard. See my guides on how to beat the Raid bosses under steam community guides. Many people consider Voracidious on op8 solo as hard as any Dark Souls boss-You will find yourself laughing over and over again. Handsome Jack ""Hey buddy it's me Roland lets go out for milkshakes"". Claptrap ""Your ability to walk short distances will be Handsome Jack's downfall.""  Herbert ""this concludes the sound of scarlett sleeping tape 96.""-Co-op: You can play with your friends which makes the good very fun. The people in the community overall are very nice. I would like to thank the community.-Character diversity: You will like this game regardless of your playstyle. Zero is Gearbox's Assasin Creed-Easter eggs: The game has tons and tons of easter eggs. For example, the vault dweller skin is a reference to Fall out.-NPC's: Very funny. Tiny Tina is one of the best NPC's in this game. Marcus very greedy (He reminds of Mr. Krabs from Spongebob). As for Moxxi,.....""You know what to do sugar""The Bad: I wish these things Gearbox would improve- Vermivorous: he spawns so rarely. While good in theory, Vermivorous hardly spawns even with 4 players-While Gearbox improved the legendary drop rates, it is nowhere near as good as Borderlands 1. I hope Borderlands 3 has better drop rates.The Mordecai: This was the joke part.Thank you for reading my comment			"

												Having watched the first moon landing live on television should let you know approxamately how long I have been on this planet.  Having spent several years and accumulating just under 1,500 hours of play in BL2 I would have to say that I never actually thought (once I got the hang of it) that I was playing a game.  But rather, living an experience that a lot of people will never understand as they have never played this game or any others.  Some how at some time a while back I became a part of the game and actually had the thought that I was actually in the game running and shooting for my very own life.  Several times during game play I had to pause to catch my breathe and shake off the tention and stress of a certain campain.  Other than sex, nothing has quite captivated me as this game has.  Thanks for the journey.			"

												Bout time I reviewed this game. This review is coming from over 2000 hours of game time (Steam and xbox combined) so i know the ins and outs of nearly every part of the game.To start with, its a great solid game in which will provide plenty of entertainment for you and friends, solo or in a full team of 4. Yes the game is a blast solo, though alot is said about its co-op experience however that doesn't mean it isn't fun for single players, but obviously you can get more (or less in terms of loot) from playing with friends. This game is addicting, you just want more and better loot and to level up, kill the raid to get loot to kill the raid again, run arenas, play slots, chest farm, boss farm, toilet farm... well those aren't that lucrative. The fast paced gameplay and tense combat is great fun and when you get through without dying or going down you get a real sense of achievment, or relief if you did happen to do down or die. A first playthrough is always a blast and that alone is worth its cost, then if you REALLY enjoyed yourself you get to do it at a higher level, with more challenge, but more reward. This game for me is about gameplay, not the story telling, yeah there is a stronger story than BL1 and more narrated side missions it still isn't up there with the likes of halo, GoW or other top, story focused games. So don't go in expecting to have a brilliant campaign story, go in expecting to have fun, and to have a good laugh.There are plenty styles of play that Borderlands supports. Like being the center of attention, taking fire, tank it all and kicking out lots of dps at close range? Gunzerker. Like sitting back and sniping? Zer0, who isn't affraid to go ninja and stab enemies in the back. There is the siren, a support character for that team player. Then there's Axton, well, axton is a tricky one, tough to play at the top levels however early game, he shines with his huge tank, area of effect (the nuclear kind) and crowd control. then there are two bonus to provide lots more hours of fun after you get bored of the other four.Yeah the game has its downs, its buggy, the scaling of certain skills, mechanics such as damage over time and certain types weapons just lose out to level. At top end level the game almost becomes unfair to the player forcing them to use only the best gear in the game, specific builds and so on, but then again, it is the top level. Its easy to break certain parts of missions forcing you to reload your game which can be very fustrating, also the AI has some weird quirks but overall isn't too game breaking.Overall this is a game I would recommend even now just before the pre sequel as this is a game that will never grow old, will allways be fun to pick up and play, yes it has some flaws but to a flawless game is nearly impossible and well this is a game that triggered the looter shooter genre and so it must be good!

												Now I think after my 2500+hours on console and my 300 here, it's about time I said some words on this spectactular game.PROS:-Addictive-Massive amounts of replay value-Billions of guns-Fast fun FPS gameplay with an RPG twist-Loot that rivals Diablo 3-Hordes of bosses-Interesting story-Great voice acting-Fantastic villian-Interesting characters-Cel-shaded graphics that still look great 4 years later-4-player Co op-Level from 1-72 plus up to 8 OP levels-Great classes-A popular playerbase-GUNS!!!-Tons of sidequests-A bunch of hidden easter eggs-AND MUCH, MUCH MORE! CONS:-Gets a bit boring after 3000+ hours-Some classes aren't balanced for OP8 and are unusable-OP8 as a whole is pretty unbalanced-No buy all ammo button-Seraph weapons suck-Pearlecent weapons suck       I can say for a fact that Borderlands 2 is worth spending your hard earned money on. *Sorry if my format is a little stupid, first legit review kek*(edit) Wanted to add in that after the game gets boring, you can do some challenge runs. Some range from pretty easy to nearly impossible. Just google Bl2 Challenge runs and you should be able to find the more popular ones, Oor y'know, come up with your own challenges. This for sure adds a decent amount of hours to your gameplay.			"

												Borderlands 2 is an awesome game. It has an interesting story, great characters (especially the main villain Handsome Jack and your companion CL4P-TP aka Claptrap the mini robot) and some of the best gameplay I've ever experienced.In a nutshell, you are a vault hunter and you are enlisted by a hyperactive CL4P-TP robot who calls himself Claptrap and refers to you as his minion. He wants you to help him bring down the villain Handsome Jack who is apparently responsible for shutting down the CL4P-TP production line.You can play it single player, but at the same time open your game for up to three others so it becomes a co-op game, and it is at co-op that the game absolutely excels. The creatures on Pandora (where the game takes place) become stronger or weaker depending on how many players there are in a game.As you progress through the story, you level up. Every mission you play, whether main or side mission has a certain preset level that would be nice for you to have making it clear in advance which missions are easier and harder. Expect more higher level missions as you progress. I think this system works very well indeed for this game. I had a ton of fun playing it, the dialogue is fantastic, the voice acting excellent, the diversity of characters and creatures is astoundingly large.If you like FPS, humor, great story, great characters and excellently finetuned gameplay, this game is for you. If you liked Borderlands, you're gonna love Borderlands 2.10/10 will tip Mad Moxxi again			"

Borderlands 2 Review - Rating: 9.1/10General ImpressionBorderlands 2 is a fantastic game, with many great features, and many hours of gameplay. The graphics and the textures are cartoonish, yet the developers managed to well-design them to look pretty great. The atmosphere is fantastic, there are a ton of maps, all of them are very large, and most of them will offer you a good time of combating enemies and exploring the areas. From the coldest mountains, to the hottest deserts, this game has it all. The audio is nice, the sounds of the guns are much diversified, the cars’ sounds are realistic, and overall they are great. Even the voice acting is pretty good. The music is nice, there are many soundtracks, and all of them will keep you stunned. The gameplay is nice, there are many types of missions, and they differ a lot, which is a good thing. You can kill a lot of diversified enemies, you can explore areas, you can ride your car and do stunts, you can buy from machine vendors whatever you want, and many others. More guns are in this game, different types of cars, more missions, etc. Borderlands 2  brought a lot of improvements on the gameplay part. The story is interesting, you can play with up to 4 different characters (different from the first Borderlands). The DLCs would add even more characters. I won’t spoil what’s happening in it, but 1 thing is sure: if you are going to play with all of them, you would basically spend a 250 hours (if you add the DLC characters too, then maybe even 350-400 hours). I haven’t tried out the DLCs, but from what I saw on YouTube, they are pretty great. I recommend that you buy the GOTY edition of the game. This game also has a CO-OP option, where you can play with up to 3 friends (4 in the game). The user-interface is pretty nice, with additional designs and well-synthetized information. The controls are well-chosen. The engines are alright, I haven’t found any haven’t met any bugs, crashes, screen freezes or frame drops. The mechanics are sophisticated and improved from the first Borderlands. Overall, Borderlands 2 is a fantastic game, with many great features, and many hours of gameplay.Positive PointsNice graphics and texturesHuge atmosphere, many mapsNice audio and nice musicAwesome, fun and challenging gameplayMany main and side quests availableGood humorMany guns, types of enemies, types of environments, types of missions, etc.A very well-designed user-interfaceWell-chosen controlsStable enginesSophisticated mechanicsMany Steam achievementsThe “Ultimate Vault Hunter – Level 1/2” upgrade will ensure you even more replay abilityNeutral PointsThe inventory space should be largerNegative PointsThe DLCs are very expensiveSome missions are not very interestingIf you level up too fast, the game becomes pretty easy "

												Borderlands 2 has to be one of the most unique games I've played yet. It was the first shooter game I enjoyed playing. The graphics are so interesting, and the storyline kept me wanting to see what happens next. I love the ability to have friends join your game to help you, it makes the game more enjoyable, and it does come in handy. The game has many aspects that make it replayable. I think you should give this game a try.			"

Absolutely lovable and replayable game With ~150h on PS3, ~500h on PS4 and now over 350h on PC I think i can say that I played this game quite a while. Yet, the more I play BL2 the more I notice that, if you dissect Borderlands 2 and look at this game piece by piece, it's really not that great, mediocre at best.- The graphics are mediocre which is cleverly covered up by the comic like art style and its   black lining. - The individual places are sometimes ""ok"" or just nearly unnecessary as you just have to pass through and never come back. To be honest, I found myself saying ""I actually dont like this part of the game that much"" far too often- Compared to Borderlands, Borderlands 2's variety of weapons is... lacking. Restrictions of gun combinations appearing ingame give you a lot less options (not that there aren't a lot). - Also, it was very much possible to find Purple Weapons in BL that were far better than Legendary Weapons, as they were often just a gimmick. Now, almost every guns best variant is Legendary, which takes away from the regular weapon drops.- Lacking animationsBut as I said, I played a lot of BL2  - and there is a reason for that. You are not supposed to look at BL2 as it's components, but as a whole. Borderlands 2 is one of the most fun experiences I had when playing Video Games so far. + Very big variety of weapons and a sh*t ton of loot in general+ Humorous Jokes throughout the game that still make me chuckle after playing it the 10th time mixed with lovable characters+ Wonderful Muliplayer with friends+ Raid Bosses that are challenging but fun (well mostly) to do+ Good amount of DLC content+ Great Story and SoundtrackAnd for the final positive point, the option to play the game as you want to play it. I think what brings me back so often, is the possibility to create my own Builds, mess around with my loadouts and just do what I want. Sure there are restrictions or ""best"" loadouts you find online but for me, a big part of Borderlands 2 is experimenting, finding new stuff progressing skillwise.All in all, Borderlands 2 is a great game and one of my favourites for sure! Should YOU buy it? Yeah sure, go for it! This game has A LOT to offer and if you are a fan of RPGs, Shooters, Comedy or Raids its worth checking out. Despite some of its flaws I mentioned before, I totally love this game to this day and will probably still play it multiple times in the future. The GOTY-Edition costs about 16 bucks if I'm correct when on sale, and the rest of the DLCs about 10 bucks when on sale, so why not, you probably wont regret it! :D  9/10 "

												The Borderlands series has a brilliant formula of wacky humor, countless guns, and RPG mechanics. Borderlands 2 has crushed its prequel with modified gameplay, gorgeous graphics, hectic music and an interesting story. While the sequel improved in every department, its story took me by surprise. The strong, unique, and diverse personalities you’ll meet through the well-paced story improves the entire experience. Most importantly, this gives life and excitement to the planet of Pandora, which was just a boring hunk of rock in the original game. The “Bazzilion” guns that Gearbox claimed Borderlands 2 will have was no joke, and it’s more than just a few minor tweaks in damage and accuracy. The guns will sometimes have a huge bayonet, a wacky reload animation, a crazy looking scope, and may not even have any recoil. When the critics can only complain about an imperfect user-interface, we can conclude that the gameplay is as addicting as we all hoped it would be. For fans of the original Borderlands, this is a no-brainer, but for those who are skeptical about the unique gaming experience that Borderlands 2 has to offer, it’s time to come to your senses and get in on the fun that you’ve been missing out on.The Good+Lots of great loot+Humorous writing+Awesome world+An actual story this time+Single-player is finally enjoyable+Co-op is still kingThe Bad-Underdeveloped visual customization-A serious lack of being able to approach enemy strongholds stealthily			"

												I found my first ever review to be a travesty to an epic game, so here is my redux :)A combination of first person shooter and role playing game, Borderlands 2 is an addictive mix of genres that will suck away thousands of hours of your time. The cell shading art style is different - but beautiful - and can be removed with a minor tweak in the config files if you want to take it off for a small increase in performance. Removing the cell shading does not detract from the beauty of the game, just changing it slightly.The storyline, voice work, and pace of the game are all fantastic. And I loved the humour and subtle (and some not so subtle) jokes throughout. Not much else can be said about it without giving too much away.I would highly recommend purchasing the Game Of The Year edition and playing through the game as each of the characters to explore the differing fight mechanics that come with them. Go in guns blazing as a Gunzerker, or sneak in as an Assassin; the choice is yours. There are a few more characters and others ways to deal with enemies, and those methods will keep you busy for a long time in this game as you explore the world anew each time.Although many of the side quests are not mandatory, they are recommended to be completed to gain experience to be able to progress through the story missions without having to empty hundreds of rounds of ammo into enemies. If you try to run through the story as fast as possible, you will find yourself coming across enemies many levels above your own, and you will die, a lot.If you like first person shooters, you'll like this game. If you like 4 player co-op with friends, you'll like this game. And if you want a game that provides a lot of content that is good value for money, you'll like this game (GOTY Edition, anyway).			"

												""Do not take life too seriously. You will never get out of it alive.""A unique FPS experience and a worthy successor of Borderlands. Compared with its predecessor everything has become a little bit crazier and better.My rating system consists of six categories in descending order of importance:- Atmosphere- Characters- Details- Tactical demand- Story- Combat & ControlsBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading:- S-Rank: excellent- A-Rank: very good- B-Rank: solid- C-Rank: satisfactory- D-Rank: inferiorIn case of an S-Rank rating, a game reference will be included in brackets as a token of my respect.Atmosphere: S-Rank(You make me so proud, minion. The way you're carrying on my fight against Handsome Jack. It brings a tear to my eye. A figurative one, of course. The saline content of actual tears would rust my eye quicker than you could say 'tetanus shot’.)Characters: S-Rank(When Claptrap speaks, I feel my brain cells committing suicide one by one.)Details: S-Rank(Did I mention I don’t have a medical license?)Tactical demand: S-Rank(If it took more than one shot, you weren't using a Jakobs!)Story: S-Rank(Hey kiddo.

You're still alive. So, if you could just do me a favor and off yourself that'd be great. Thanks, Pumpkin.)Combat & Controls: S-Rank(CATCH A RIIIIIDE!)To conquer all achievements of Borderlands 2, you will most likely spend more than 120 hours. You have to play the single-player campaign several times, due to challenges like ‘So Much Blood’ and ‘Unseen Predator’. ‘Challenge Accepted’ is a typical grind achievement.‘Friendship Rules’ is the only multiplayer achievement and quite simple to obtain.‘Thresher Thrashed’ will take the most time, because it requires a character around level 52 or higher. The achievements of the four DLCs are straight forward and easy enough to get with a high level character.Achievement difficulty: 7 of 10Common:- Singleplayer [+2]- Multiplayer [+1]Special:- Challenge Accepted [+1]- Thresher Thrashed [+1]- DLCs [+2]Estimated time for 100 % completion: +120 hoursChronology:Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel (PC)First-person shooter game(Science-Fiction) – 2014Borderlands 2 (PC)First-person shooter game(Science-Fiction) – 2012Borderlands (PC)First-person shooter game(Science-Fiction) – 2009			"

Tons of varied environments ranging from icy mountains to futuristic cities and volcanic canyons and guns that are not just simple reskins of each other but also feel different for the most part with diverse and ""funky"" modifiers; they scream while firing, they may explode on reload, etc. The PC version is also really well done this time arround with lots of options including FoV tweaking and UI placement/ resizement. Matchmaking is handled throught Steam so dropping in and out of a game is a breeze.Story and characters are also emphasized in comparison to the 1st one, with a likeable yet truly evil main bad guy, a completely insane little girl and characters from the 1st title making a triumphant return, with the game taking more time to showcase each one's personality a little bit better. This doesn't mean however that BL2 has become a story or character driven game.It's still the same gun-toting, over the top violent loot fest as it was before, with quests just being an excuse for you to go buck wild on your enemies. There are also raid bosses and tweaks since the game's release have made soloing them more difficult than before, just as it should be.

												-Borderlands 2-Very good game, nice story, interesting charachers. Has a lot of replay value. It has a lot of different locations to visit, many quests to do. While playing the game you are constantly improving your character, I have all 6 playable characters on max. level (I did it for me, I was good at it) The memories with this game and playing with friends are one of the best moments. Even when you finish the main game, there are a lot of DLC's, each different and special in their own way.Definitely recommended! DLC1 - Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty -It was very well done, but my favorite part was the treasure room glitch :DDLC2 - Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage -This is the best one they made for Borderlands 2DLC3 - Sir Hammerlock’s Big Game Hunt -Had potential, but it turned out to be somewhat boring.DLC4 - Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep -It's overrated, but still fun.UVHM - Level Upgrade from 50 to 61This made a lot of loot obsolete, but still playable.Digistruct Peak Challenge - Level Upgrade from 61 to 72 (and OP1-8)This made pretty much everyone use the same builds and the same loot.Headhunter Packs - Should've been a 5th DLC instead of 5 small packs.

												Absolutely amazing game. If you played Borderlands then you know that this game took everything that made it great and improved upon it. The story, the humor and the fire fights will keep you engaged for hours. Seriously few games on the Market can achieve what Borderlands 2 achieved. The humor and story are extremely engaging and its nearly impossible to walk away without the memorable character sticking in your mind for years to come. The game shines in Character Development, Storyline, Graphics, Humor and action. If you like RPG & First Person Shooters than this game should either already be in your game library or first on your wish list. If you haven't played it yet but are interested, stop reading this review and go get 3 friends together and start playing it immediately! There isn't enough good I can say about this game. The development studio hit a home run with it. There are so many characters from this game that I remember and throughly enjoyed listening to, intereacting with. Infact I have gone back and replayed this game just to see the interactions over. That is rare in today's games and many of them fall short or completely fail to engage the player and keep them wanting to play more. Borderlands 2 does just that, it engages you to continue the story and come back and play more. There are millions of different guns in the game, many legendary weapons and other gear that will keep you hunting for better loot. While some games use the better loot to keep you coming back, Borderlands 2 doesn't need it. You will continue playing because the storyline & humor is so engaging that the better loot is an after thought. No gimmicks, and no tricks to keep you playing. There are not walls where you hit and have to farm for hours to find the loot to continue. This isn't your traditional game with loot....cough cough Diablo 3 for example where you might get stuck and need to grind for hundreds of hours just to continue playing. Instead the game is well balanced so you can continue along the story & adventure while finding better loot during a traditional exploration endeavor. There are legendary creatures you can fight over and over again to get some of the best loot to drop quicker, but this isn't neccessary or required to complete the game. Infact the way Boerderlands 2 designed the system most players will find it very fun to do these types of fights with friends. If nothing else you will fall in love with ClapTrap. The skillpoint system is simple to use and you can switch out skill points to try different skill combinations by visiting a customization shop. There are skins to change your appearance and upgrades for backpacks and storage. This game has alot going for it and they did it right. There is no forced play style and you won't get stuck playing a character a specific way because you spent points in skills that you later decided you didn't like. Reset and try another skill until you find something you like. Seriously....buy the game, buy the game for 3 friends and play and have some of the best fun youv'e had in years. Oh and Allow me to introduce myself -- I am a CL4P-TP steward robot, but my friends call me Claptrap! Or they would, if any of them were still alive. Or had existed in the first place!			"

												Borderlands 2 is a very exciting action-shooter rpg game, hours of fun to play with friends, it has a decent story yet unique to follow, also dozen of quests scattered around at every location, and of course the most anticipated thing from the game are the Humors/Jokes from the characters, I couldn't help myself not to laugh when the characters are joking with each others.The thing that makes this game addictive is of course finding an exceptional weapons, collecting an achievements and whatnot, the enemies are tougher and even smarter as you progress and unlock the vault hunter mode, rest assured, with good weapons and grenade mods, they won't stand a chance. so make sure you stocked with weapons and grenade mods that suit you best.Not to mention the community of this game is still very much alive up to now thanks to 2K, like giving away Shift-codes to be redeemed for golden keys or skins, hence why you will feel this game has been taken care good enough, and thus I very recommended Borderlands 2, dont forget to grab its season pass as well, lotsa amazing dlc missions waiting ahead of you, oh and one more thing, grab the dlc characters such as Mechromancer and Psycho, they are totally well worth the money.

A review on Borderlands 2 Although i have hardly anytime played on this on pc, i have 1200+ hours on console, so i can give a fair review for this game.  Borderlands 2 is one of my favorite games of all time and my favorite co-op shooter. However i will give the fairest review to this game, so ill exclude my bias opinions.  Artstyle/graphics If you have seen gameplay/pictures of the borderland games, you will notice the unique artstyle to the game. This is cel shaded-style. This gives the game a more unique feel and it also suits the gamestyle, as its a not so serious game.  GAMEPLAY  The gameplay is excellent.I don't want to get into detail with the story, just to evade accidental spoilers, but you don't have to play the other borderlands to understand the story, the story is explained throughout the game, the story is  intriguing and very FUN! The rng system allows for TONS of weapons to be looted by you. According to Gearbox Software, there are over 17,750,000 different variations of weapons in Borderlands 2. Borderlands 2 uses a procedural process to generate its various guns in certain classes, such as handguns, shotguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, and more, but with many variations of firing speed, reload speed, damage type and more. This means every gun is unique. However as you level up you will see that less guns become as valuable to use as they are outdamaged by many weapons. *cough* unkempt Harold *cough* This is because the game gets alot harder once you've beaten it. There is a mode called true vault hunter mode which includes the same story but with higher level and stronger enemies, but this allows you to progress your character more, allowing you to level up more and find better weapons. To level past 50 you will have to purchase some dlc, however it is not needed to enjoy the game. PROS   The characters are hilarious and well developed. (E.G. CL4P-TP and handsome jack)  The huge variety of weapons.  The classes and abilities are very unique.  The replayability.  CO-OP!  The story.  Endless farming and grinding for exp and weapons.  The Easter eggs in this game are too funny!  CONS  Once you fully max your character (level 72 op8) there isn't many guns that will benefit you, as the dominant guns are literally the combo, grog and Harold, or bee shield and sand hawk, however there is many characters to replay as and different builds to make certain weapons highly suitable to your build.  TL;DR This game is fantastic! The loot, the story, the characters, the Easter eggs, the co-op, the gameplay everything about it makes it an amazing game. If you haven't already got this game, it is defiantly worth it's money! "

												Pros:-Doesn't get old.-Tons of possiblities for character builds.-Weapons out the ♥♥♥.-With the DLC,there is a lot of content. The game is huge.-If you play with friends, you're going to have a good time.Cons:-Dev's executed poorly on many things. The game runs well enough, but is nowhere near optimized.-Physx looks amazing, but forget about it. I bet a gtx 1080 would still drop below 60fps in many scenes. It's implemented well, but again, optimized poorly.-I've seen some people claim this isn't an issue, but it damn well is: The mouse sensitivity slider only moves in increments of 5. Yea, you read that correctly. If you're like me, and you have a measured senstivity that you use for hipfire in every shooter - good luck. On their slider, 10 is the lowest value. So you can't even go to 0, but you also can't go to 6, or 11, or 19... But if you're cool with going 10,15,20,25, etc. THEN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!I changed my mouse DPI three times to try and land on my desired senstivity (6 inches travel for a 360 in game) and just can not achieve it because their slider is junk. It's also not modifiable in the .ini, surprisingly.So that's it, and there isn't much else to say. If you can't dial in your sensitivity, it plays fine on a controller - and it's a game that you can always come back to and find new things, whether it's a funny line of dialogue you missed, or a shield/class mod combo that makes you respec your skill tree - you're always going to have a good time with this game. (Did I ever mention the gunplay feels good? Because the gunplay feels really good.)			"

												Borderlands 2 takes what the first game offered, and adds more, larger areas to explore, more characters, a fantastic story, new enemies, new ways to play, a great soundtrack and stylized graphics that are just as unique as before, but now look even better. And like the first game, it is playable as a four-player co-operative game with easy drop-in / drop-out. If you're an fps fan you owe it to yourself to get this game. I realize that sounds a bit fanboyish, but really, the core gameplay of Borderlands 2 is THAT good (even if the game can get a little grind-y at times).Installed size on my hard-drive (GOTY edition): 10.4 GB.The number of areas to explore is huge. I don't have the exact data, but it feels several times larger than the first game. There is a lot of snow at the start, but there are rocky deserts, alpine meadows, and a slag-riddled environmental monstrosity awaiting at the end. Quick-travel points abound (usually at the entrances to areas), so it's easy to go from one place to another. In-game save points are unfortunately like the first game; even if you passed a quick-save point, then quit the game thinking you'll resume where you left off, well, you won't. When you resume, you'll be back at the start of the level. Levels are well designed, too – twisting and turning at times, while others are wide open. The characters that we played in the first game (Roland, Lilith, Mordecai and Brick) are NPCs here, with the story centered around them. Angel, Claptrap, Moxxi, Scooter, Dr. Zed and Marcus return as well. So right away, stepping out into Borderlands 2 has a familiar vibe. Except now the enemy is the boss of Hyperion Corp, Handsome Jack. Colorful and distinct, there are enough personalities here to never lose interest – even when doing several of the fetch-quest filler missions (yes, they're back, but given the looting-and-leveling nature of the Borderlands games, probably unavoidable). While the story is great, I can't talk too much about it here without spoiling it. The early stages play out as a defy-the-odds hero tale as the player character defies Handsome Jack and escapes to the town of Sanctuary. Angel is still guiding you on your HUD, but your character catches her in a bit of deception. The second act reveals who (and where) she is – and sets the stage for the third act, which culminates in the showdown with Handsome Jack. I was genuinely curious about how this was going to resolve, and kept playing all the way through. This isn't even touching the side missions and quests for secondary characters. Side quests are a mixed bag. I was more than happy to free some animals for Mordecai; collecting body parts for Dr. Zed while a timer counted down was just annoying, and the rewards were barely worth it in either case (usually XP and a weapon which was far below my current level). The only reason to do a number of the side missions is because of the possibility of rare loot and character backstory. The rest are grindy level-fodder, needed for leveling up, but nothing else.I solo'd most of Borderlands 2 – yeah, crazy – and the game worked well as a solo experience. The bosses were never too hard; just long. One boss took me 45 minutes of running, hiding, sniping, and running again (I was playing the commando class). Clearly the bosses were not designed for soloing. The loot drops were also disappointing. The guns for sale at the kiosks were always – and I mean always – worse than what I was carrying. It's better to loot new weapons than buy them. Which means that other than ammo, there's nothing to spend money on (except respawning). The best weapons are acquired by using a “golden key” on the special loot-drop chest in Sanctuary, so sometimes it's just easier to spend a golden key than spending hours poring over loot (some side-missions for Moxxi do provide decent weapons).If there is a drawback to Borderlands 2, it’s the amount of DLC. There is a lot. Tiny Tina’s Assault on Dragon Keep was one of the best pieces of DLC I’ve ever encountered, having a fun story that was uniquely told. The Captain Scarlett DLC, the Creature Slaughterdome DLC and Torgue’s Campaign of Carnage DLC provide solid additional content. But additional player classes as DLC? (The Psycho and Mechromancer DLCs) Raising the character level cap via DLC? (Ultimate Vault Hunter Upgrade packs) There are a number of DLC packs that focus on skins and such, but this level of “parting out” the game verges on the ridiculous. If the game were not complete without the DLC, it’d be time for a rant. However, without the DLC, Borderlands 2 still feels like a complete experience. Thus I lament the DLC situation, but deduct no points for it.In an age when it’s cool to have “the latest” at expense of forgetting the hit games of yesteryear, Borderlands 2 inspires the sort of interest that kept me coming back again and again. A great achievement in fps video games, and a game that belongs in the library of every fan of the genre.			"

												As a newcomer to the Borderlands series I can safely say BL2 is a great game with no previous experience needed. I simply suggest you read a 2-minute plot summary of the first game and you're good to go! As always, I'll try to make a brief list on my pro's and cons to this game. If you have any questions or want me to clarify you can always leave a comment.GOODS+Don't need previous experience to play the sequel.+Guns, guns, guns. Lots of variety to keep the carnage fresh+Cool enemies to shoot your cool guns at.+Feels fast paced for an RPG-type game. Discourages farming with a solid experience system.+Story is very engaging. It falls apart a bit by the end, but aside from that it's really solid storytelling.+Characters and humour are a big part of this game's iconic personality.+I definitely recommend playing it with 2 friends. It's ok on your own, but works better in a small group, though 4 people can get a bit hard to co-ordinate. Great co-up game.+Connecting and joining with friends is really easy to do and mostly ran smoothly.+It has some replay value with the Newgame+ options, different characters and the chance for new legendary items.+Lots of fun challenges, secrets and easter eggs to find for a completionist like me!+The stat numbers of all your guns and items are a bit overwhelming at first, but the interface is pleasant enough that you can get used to it quickly.+Handsome JackNOT-SO-GOODS-If you don't like the humour or tone of this game, BL2 will probably annoy you quickly as it's an ever-present factor throughout the entire thing.-As an RPG it's leveling-up system is kinda lacking. Aside from small bonuses and one single ability there is no difference between your character and any-one elses. They did this so that any character could use any weapon/tactic with no real restrictions, which is good, but has it's downsides. Would've been fun to have at least 1 ability for every tree, or something along those lines.-Lack of voice commands and 'gesture' animations means you'll NEED a microphone to efficiently work together. Their exclusion is weird since even the most basic of co-up games tend to have at least a few voice commands like ""Help"", ""Thanks"" and ""Move up"" to prevent the need for one.-The 'random' nature of the game in terms of drops and rewards might not be your thing. It does help forcing some surprise and variation in playstyle sometimes, which is good. But not vfor every one.-DLC's are overpriced especially for such an old game. No reason to paywall extra content for what could be future fans.-Some weird structure choices. One example: So the main quest requires you to build a car. You go to a whole new area with new places and characters to get this car. You finally get this car, you drive it up to the story mission and... after honking your horn you immediatly get out. With the next vehicle-section being literally hours away. My partners in crime were NOT amused.And that's it for now. All in all Bordelands 2 is a definite recommendation for FPS-lovers even in 2017. If exploring a big, new planet filled to the brim with violence sounds like it might be your thing, be sure to give this a try! Might edit it later if I come up with some more points. Have any questions? Be sure to ask!Have a nice day.			"

												9! 24! 58! 100! 500! 1000! Critical! Is there a better visual barometer for satisfaction in videogames than damage numbers popping out of an enemy’s bullet-riddled head? The original Borderlands revelled in this instant gratification, complementing this core conceit with a ‘bazillion’ guns, tight shooting, addictive loot and a droll sense of humour. There’s little wonder why it was such a surprise hit back in 2009, and just as unsurprising that we’re back on the bombastic world of Pandora for Borderlands 2; a sequel that once again basks in the glow of numbers and bullets, hidden treasures and boner jokes.Set five years after the events of the first game, Borderlands 2 features an entirely new cast of playable vault hunters. After the original group opened the fabled vault and dealt with what was hidden therein, an arrogant prick by the name of Handsome Jack took credit for their actions, declared himself the dictator of Pandora, and is now attempting to plunder the planet of its most valuable resources, hoping to awaken some sort of ancient alien power. You’ll team up with a resistance movement led by the original cast of vault hunters, intent on stopping him and looting the entire planet along the way.Those same original vault hunters also now have dialogue, fleshing them out as actual characters after their previous stint as mostly silent protagonists. Borderlands 2 presumes you have some sort of reverence for the original cast despite their previous silence, but their inclusion and subsequent portrayals pay off in some interesting ways, both in regards to the narrative and the game’s humour. Most of the dialogue is fairly sharp across the board and its multitude of zany characters, new and old. The first game’s wacky sense of humour remains, with continuous pop culture references and a ludicrous amount of hidden Easter eggs, and this carries into some of the quest design and its inherent physical comedy.The humour’s in-your-face nature can be a little much at times, especially when jokes miss or drag on for far too long, but the near constant stream of dialogue keeps Pandora feeling alive, especially in the once-lonely single player. It can be immature at times, relying on cheap gags to generate a chuckle, but there’s also a lot of humorous dialogue that will consistently muster more than a laugh or two, and the majority of its voice acting sells each character with aplomb, delivering some fantastic performances.The most substantial improvements come in the gameplay and how you’re able to spec your character. In the first game you could pick the Soldier class, for instance, and by the end of the game you were essentially invincible if you spec’d in the right directions. Your deployable turret could not only lay waste to everything in sight but could also regenerate health and ammunition, leaving you free to stand still and eradicate an entire group of enemies with relative ease. Borderlands 2 has been reworked and is much more balanced, giving each character class a specific playstyle that comes with their action skill and making sure to never overpower them to tedium. There are three skill paths to choose from, each one focusing on specific areas, whether it’s improving your action skill, allowing you to do higher damage with certain weapon types, increasing your maximum health and so on. The Assassin, for example, is very similar to the Hunter class from the first game, focusing on sniper rifles and improving their effectiveness. But each class plays much differently in Borderlands 2, so the Assassin’s action skill is comparable to the Siren’s previous phasewalk ability, allowing him to turn invisible for a brief amount of time where he can utilise his melee attacks; something the Berserker class focused on in the first game. The gun manufacturers now produce particular kinds of weapons with their own distinct visual characteristics. One such manufacturer is Jakobs, who build Wild West style guns so you’ll find lots of revolvers and rifles that can fire as fast as you can pull the trigger but reload very slowly. Maliwan, on the other hand, builds weapons that deal out elemental damage, so they’re your go to guys if you want to set someone on fire.Whichever concoction of assorted weaponry you choose, Borderlands 2’s gunplay is tight and intuitive. Whether it’s popping the heads off bandits, melting a robot down with corrosive ammunition or hitting a Skag with the butt of your rifle, the combat remains entertaining long past your first playthrough and into new game+. This is thanks in no small part to improvements made to enemy AI. In Borderlands 2, enemies now move with more purpose and dexterity, keeping you on your toes and forcing you to adjust your aim as they dodge and roll, duck and weave. It’s not a massive enhancement in artificial intelligence, but it’s an improvement that gives the combat a more frenetic pace. Suicidal psychos will often charge you, explosives at the ready, while various projectiles are thrown in your direction. You’re constantly dashing from place to place and there’s a fantastic freedom of movement. There’s a phenomenal agglomeration of enemies, each befitting of some sublime character design and enjoyable AI. You’ll face off against cloaked monsters, robots that can transform into makeshift tanks and a gargantuan bandit that bursts into a fit of rage, killing friend and foe alike. Each enemy requires a different tactic to beat, whether it’s utilising your action skill, equipping a weapon with a particular type of elemental damage or inciting enemy v enemy combat.The game looks sublime on PC as well, particularly if you can run it on close to the highest settings. The cel-shaded art style never fails to shine and there’s some outstanding lighting effects that complement the level design. This is still the same Pandora as the first game but it’s been injected with a burst of colour and environmental variety. The desert wasteland still remains but now there are plains of green grass, snow swept icy caverns and a deep underground mine coated in luminous green acid. The colour pops with the art style like a comic book; Pandora’s exalted sense of place and character still remains.Borderlands 2 successfully maintains every aspect that made the first game such a surprise hit and improves upon them in all the ways that matter. The majority of these improvements may only be incremental which gives the impression Gearbox took the safe route, avoiding major iteration, but the formula still works. Whether that formula still appeals to you is the real question. If you’ve already spent countless hours with the first game is more Borderlands something you want? If it is then Borderlands 2 is a better game than its predecessor in every way. Just only by a smidgen.			"

												I went into the Borderlands series with this game and not knowing anything about it really.  I decided to start my experience and somewhere between that moment and the multitute of hours played non stop that preceeded, I had discovered something special indeed. Everything about it sucked me in; the creative art direction, the addicting grind in search of rare loot, and the insane characters that are voiced acted to perfection. The soundtrack plays a major role in this game's success, perfectly lending itself to the atmopshere, as well as some remarkable minimalistic songs used in towns (almost reminiscent of idling in Tristram in Diablo).  It also has something else up its sleeve, something that only comes about every decade or so; the feeling that a definitive classic has been forged, in a modern generation flooded with regurgitated cliches.  Borderlands 2 clevarly adapts gameplay mechanics from tried and true classics such as Diablo and Diablo 2, yet, has been able to produce something entirely unique, a game of the highesty quality and replayablity.Borderlands 2. Time will remember you.			"

												LAST EDITED: 11/24/16Borderlands 2 is a really incredible game that made the Borderlands franchise one of my favorite franchises to play. Now with that being said, there's a few flaws with the game but I'll discuss it in the pros and cons. While Borderlands is not as successful as other FPS games such as Battlefield and others, Borderlands still holds its own with its developer and easter eggs of other games such as Doom, Minecraft, and others. Anyways enjoy the pros and cons :)Pros:-The selection of weaponry for this game-More campaign DLCs compared to BL1 and BTPS-The skill selections of each vault hunter-The action skills are perfectly designed around that specific character-Amazing weapons especially in Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty DLC (Sandhawk, Pimpernel, Rapier, etc.)-The general boss and mini boss selection-Dragon Keep DLC (my personal favorite)-Some Pearlescent and Seraph weapons are excellent/phenomenal (Bekah, Butcher, Tattler, Interfacer, etc.) -The Pearlescent Jakobs Bekah (my all time favorite weapon in Borderlands 2)-The variety of phenomenal legendaries (Norfleet, Unkempt Harold, Fastball, etc.)-Salvador + 5 points of Money Shot + Chaotic Evil Monk class mod (Dragon Keep exclusive) = AN INSTRUMENT OF DEATH!-Moxxi weapons due to the healing per damage dealt percentage and some heal passively (Grog Nozzle, Heartbreaker, Hail, Slow Hand, Kitten, etc.)- Zer0's B0re skill + 1 Basic Repeater + Hyperius = Amazing Results :D-Some E-tech weapons are excellent (Florentine, Yellow Jacket, Plasma Casters of all manufacturers except Bandit, Slow Hand, Swordsplosion, Norfleet, Omen, Longbow sniper rifles, PBFG rocket launcher, Topneaa)-Despite the self slag on the Chulainn, it's a good weapon to use if you're using a Bee shield since its sister weapon, the Florentine doesn't benefit as much from the Bee shield-The Double Penetrating *GIGGITY* Unkempt Harold is absolutely broken-The Morningstar ;) (That should be a hint to this point but the veterans know about this one!)Cons:-Axton can be fixed but he's designed fine as the concept behind him was made-Many of the pearlescents and seraphs are currently awful/mediocre (Patriot, Bearcat, -The pain of Vermivorous, Hyperius, Master Gee, Voracidious, and Dexiduous-Some guns can be fixed but in general all guns are fine-E-techs lack the critical hit modifiers to match unique weapons and are inferior to weapons of purple or purple gemstone (Dragon Keep exclusive) rarity-E-tech guns cannot crit at all and have high ammo consumption-Torgue barreled assault rifles cannot crit at all-Digistruct Peak's insane pain (I earned OP8 months after I got the DLC)-The DREADED Landscaper shotgun (when fired the bullets move away from the crosshairs)-Many weapons have slow projectile speed and/or lackluster accuracy especially the Seraph weapons in Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty DLC-The Chulainn SMG's self slag (not bad against melee but very bad against bullets)-Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode balance is not balanced but is fixed in Borderlands: The Pre Sequel-Gearbox broke the Evil Smasher by patching its special effect as a unique weaponPersonally, the argument of both pros and cons can be debated among the player base but I'll leave it up to you if you think it's worth the money to buy this game and the campaign DLCs. In my opinion, I think I can recommend this game to anyone who seems to like video games. Hope this review helped. Thanks for reading :) ~Ky			"

												Borderlands 2 is a visual treat and the ""shoot and loot"" concept makes the game highly addictive. At times, the utterly hectic action can be fantastic fun and, without reservation, it's a game you should buy. But there are problems! There isn't a difficulty setting and people find the game too easy or too hard. The entire game is carefully balanced, and that balance is easily upset, leading to unrewarding play. Also, despite being coop, it's almost impossible to play with friends, because the levelling system makes a huge difference even if you are only a few levels different to each other. The DLC is highly variable. It wasn’t developed by Gearbox, and it show’s. The maps are generally very well designed, but the gameplay and rewards are lacking. In particular, Hamerlock’s is one you just want to get through as quickly as possible. The UVHM is essential though, and probably justifies the price of the Season Pass all by itself.  The bosses do start to get ridiculously tough in the DLC’s, pretty much demanding four players. It’s an incredibly detailed and fun game to play. Yes it has plenty of faults, but it still remains one of the best games ever produced. Now that it's starting to drop in price, you have no excuse not to buy it. "

												Well i have few hours on this game and i can say its a masterpiece.This game has crap tone of loots like: different guns,crap load of customizations,upgrade your ammo capacity, money bank, eridium and i can go on and on....The story in Borderlands 2 is marvelous.The action of character is amazing,main story is fairly linear,also you are in planet called Pandora which is the story of all of the games takes place. It is a barren, desolate world filled with dangerous creatures.Gameplay is a mix of FPS and RPG.There are so many missions to complete include side mission and dlc missions.You are given with massive are to explore all over to Pandora.As you progress through the game you will earn xp and levels which allow you to customise your characters skills giving a large variety of gameplay styles.The level cap is 50 but with dlcs it has cap to 72 but thats not over yet once you reach 72lvl you will gain access for overpowerd weapons and harder enemies and of course better weapons.So many reasons to replay this game. Firstly the story can be completed at least 3 times with the same character at increasing difficulty and xp levels like: normal, true vault hunter and ultimate vault hunter. Wich gives you progressively better rewards Cant wait for borderlands 3.P.S: This is better than payday 2			"

												Borderlands 2 is an incredible, breathtaking game with impressive visuals and sound design. The game have a great variety of enemies, the storyline is engaging and the combat is amazing, especially when you're playing co-op.If you like piles of guns, lots to do and shoot, and a robust leveling system with a natural coop multi-player aspect and aren't put off by the cel shading, it's a no-brainer.

 All of my reviews are based around my personnal opinion, they're not swayed by a majority of people liking or disliking it.   Better than  Destiny [www.destinythegame.com] Worse than  Borderlands 1  NOTE: All of my reviews are laid out in a particular format that fits the game. TL:DR Borderlands 2 was quite an experience. It has everything. Guns, enemies, story, badassness, psychos, annoying robots. Borderlands is one of those games that you don't play for just a couple of hours. If you have friends you can play this game with, the game has become twice as more fun. With beautiful locations, an amazing story and hilarious characters this is an absolute must recommend! Buy it already! About Borderlands 2 is a first-person shooter RPG where you choose one of four characters, (six if you have the dlcs) and start through an epic journey. The game is set on a planet called Pandora, which is inhabited by bandits. You may notice in the trailer, there are a lot of guns. All unique in their own way. You can have a gun that shoots fire, you can have a gun that electrifies people e.t.c. Borderlands 2 is one of those story rich games that is even better with other people. A successor to the original, with added detail, more characters, and whole new locations ranging from freezing ice plains, to deserts, and even to countrysides, Borderlands, even with death everywhere, has a beauty to it. Gameplay It's a first-person shooter, gameplay is going to be the main part in it. This game is filled with action almost all the time. There are dozens of types of enemies which can harm you in different ways. The game may make you rely on different types of weapons. For example, an armoured enemy will take more damage from a corrosive weapon, an enemy with a shield will take more damage from an electric weapon, or an enemy with no defense would take even more damage from an incendiary weapon. This can be awkward if you don't have those weapons. As I mentioned before, this game is amazing if you have friends playing it with you. The more people in a game with you, the harder the enemies, but also the better the loot. Go through an epic journey exploring the wilds, completing side quests and complain about who gets what weapon. Then there's the dlcs.... Story Note that I'm not going to spoil the story at all in this. Only the basis of it.One of the best stories I've ever seen in a video game. It has exciting, dramatic parts, to emotional and sad parts. Borderlands 2 always keeps you on your toes. The story is set on a planet called Pandora, which has an uninvited guest, a company called Hyperion. The leader, Handsome Jack, wants to mine a mysterious alien element called eridium, to open a ruin on Pandora called, The Vault. You, and/or your friends are tasked with saving the planet, and defeating Handsome Jack. As well as a main story, there are also side quests, which contain their own stories within them. There are hundreds of side quests in the game for you to explore, and if need be, build XP on to level up.  Design & Graphics Borderlands 2, as you can see by the screenshots, is a very cartoonish game, but not in the way you might imagine it. Although cartoonish, It's actually beautiful. Some environments leave you stunned. Graphics can be adjusted in the settings to make the game look even more pretty. If you don't have a perfect PC, this game can lag quite a lot, and the FPS can go down really low. Again, for the design, It's sublime. Almost everything is detailed. Open wildernesses are detailed quite well. The only negative thing I'll mention is mushy backdrops in some places. UI [User Interface] The Ui is rather basic to be quite honest. You have a basic hud in-game which shows your health, your shield, your ammo, your ability and a minimap. When you press the tab button, you open up a new menu which manages your inventory, your skill tree, your quests, your map and your challenges. You shouldn't have any problem navigating where to go. The game gives you basic tutorials on where everything is anyway. The main menu is also rather basic. Settings are easy to navigate. Had no problems here, neither should anyone else. Pros - An amazing story- Hilarious characters- Beautiful environments- Great soundtrack- Worth plenty of hours of playtime- Entertaining co-op- Great replay value- So many guns!!!!- Epic DLCs Cons - Inventory space can be a pain.- Sometimes relying on co-op too much.- Sometimes bland backdrops.- Some PCs may struggle when it comes to FPS. Final Recommendation Borderlands 2 is an almost perfect game, which is worth hundreds of hours of playtime. Whether it be alone or with friends, this game is addicting as hell. I'm still not bored of it and I doubt I will be for a long time. Finishing the game may seem like you've done a lot, but then you hae the dlcs to finish, which will give you even more guns, and even more fun!!! A must play for anyone, even if it's not on sale! Final Verdict - 10/10.

*English*RPG and FPS fell in love and had a child – its name is Borderlands 2The game has extremely charming characters (even the villains), a hilarious acid type of humor and an almost infinite variety of weapons and items.Borderlans 2 is infinitely better than the first title of the series. The characters and map progression is very fluid, unlike the 1st game where I often found myself “stuck”, forced to grind on(in) a map where I had already completed all quests, just to be able to survive on the following quests / maps.Besides the singleplayer mode, there is also a coop one with up to 4 players. It’s hard to find random people to play online, but it’s guaranteed fun if you have a group of friends to play with.*Português*RPG e FPS se apaixonaram e tiveram um filho - seu nome é Borderlands 2.Tem personagens extremamente carismáticos (até mesmo os vilões), um humor ácido hilário e uma variedade quase infinita de armas e itens.Borderlands 2 é infinitamente melhor que o primeiro jogo da série. O progresso do personagem e a mudança de mapas são bastante fluídos, ao contrário do 1º jogo, em que várias vezes me encontrei ""travada"", obrigada a ""grindar / upar"" em um mapa no qual já tinha feito todas as missões, apenas para conseguir sobreviver à missão / mapa seguinte.Além do modo singleplayer, possui também um modo coop de até 4 jogadores. É difícil achar pessoas aleatórias para jogar online, mas é garantia de diversão caso você possa jogar com um grupo de amigos.			"

												Overall a great and funny RPG shooter game with frantic gameplay, unforgettable characters and tons of content. The art style is very unique and simple, and still looks great especially when you consider the age of this game. The loot system is exceptional, in my opinion, and I've spent hours grinding bosses or continuously clearing out areas to obtain rare items. Each weapon feels different and special because of randomly generated parts/unique characteristics. Playing with friends makes this game extremely fun to play, and if you don't have friends for whatever reason, then you can find an open session online and play with others.

Play the game with one life, or play with no action skill, the rules are yours to make! Sure theres a few glitches (Vermivorous despawn)but its so unbelievably packed with content, that that won't really matter. Farming raid  bosses or just getting those OP levels is so gratifying!

												One word...""Amazing""I love this game. This is my most played game (unless you count hours I spent on Super Smash Bros on the Wii, and the F2P games of League of Legends and TF2)The game itself is great. Improved upon the original. With new characters and new abilities. I am glad I bought this game pre-release, and all the dlc content (not the skins).People may complain that they do not get everything with the GOTY edition. But here's the thing everything thats not in the GOTY is just skins. The headhunters are just a skin pack basically. You get 1 new one with each character instead of buying 1 per character at a set amount. Yea maybe there is a mission, but the mission has nothing to do with the main game and is just so you can earn that character skin.The main DLC itself. I would rate Tiny Tina's DLC as one of the best side stories I have ever played - you have knights, monsters, warlocks, dragons, magic missiles, SWORDSPLOSIONS!!!. It also delves into the mind of a child dealing with grief.The other DLC, Pirates and Torque are also very good. Mister Torque is one of my favorite new characters (after Tiny Tina of course). EXPLOSIONS!!!All in all, I recommend this game hands down one of my all time favorite games. Hopefully, you will find it enjoyable as well.			"

												loot and shoot.Buy advice: [Borderlands 2 GOTY edition + Ultimate Vault Hunter Upgrade Pack 2] buy these two during a steam sale is the best advice I can give for anyone. It'll run you right now about $15-$18 and you'll have all the DLC's worth having without rebuying or spending a bunch of money. It gets asked constantly in the forums. Classic FPS that can have a high entertaintement/hour value with replayable storylines, scaleable enemies, with better and better loot as you go. There are three main types of BL2 players I've seen. You have the diehard, the casual, and the barely interested. The diehards love doing the playthroughs, they love farming bosses and loot, they love the skills; they are great players and they have above 1k hours in the game, they can talk shop about this game all day but they're a dying breed because the game does have a half life for how interesting it is; the diehards will buy the game when it comes out, they don't need a steam sale, they'll buy all the DLCs and they bought TPS (the pre-sequel) for $60 the day it came out and already have 50 hours on it. The barely interested will wait for the steam sale, they'll wait for a few friends and they'll play up to level 30, maybe 60, they'll buy only the GOTY version, and theyll have 40 hours and be done with it. The hard part is figuring out if you're a casual player since you've never played the game.The best way for a casual player to play is to select the most interesting character to you (first time favorites: commando, siren, assassin) and you play them through until you finish all the storylines, challenges, achievements, sidemission and do level 1 to 72 to op8, that will take about 200-300 hours. Then you normally don't want to do another complete playtrhough of a couple hundred hours so you get powerleveled through to op8 on the other characters and you can go through the storylines easier, you can play with the skills and see how the skills work and even more fun see how the skills work with all the loot, most likely duped loot. Most of your playtime then will be helping others get there missions done, doing raid bosses, a little farming and the game will reach its half life, that will take another few hundred hours and you'll be finished with the game.

												I can very easily say that this is the finest game that I have ever played.  Borderlands 2 is an improvement (for the better) in nearly every aspect of the original game.  Borderlands 2 comes with a much better story, much more varied environments and enemies, better user interface and more variety in the way the gear behaves.The cooperative system is also very much improved in Borderlands 2.  The game moved away from using Gamespy for an online lobby and now uses full Steam integration with drop-in and out cooperative play.The game features 4 new classes (Soldier, Siren, Gunzerker and Assassin) with 2 others available for purchase via DLC (Mechromancer and Psycho).  Each class features all-new skill trees that have been mostly well designed and appear to work well for both solo and team play.Most of the original cast of NPC characters have returned along with a few new ones.  The story is very well written this time with an extremely interesting villain in Handsom Jack.  The story for Borderlands 2 does attempt to be a continuation of the original game and miraculously improves the previously lackluster story to a point where it now actually makes some sense.  The game also includes a TON of sidequests and activities so you can expect to have about 30 hours of gameplay with the main questline and roughly 50+ hours if you include most of the side activities.  There are 4 large campaign DLC and a variety of smaller DLC packs which will add significantly to an already huge amount of content.The only few negative things that I have found in the game include:1)  Less storage space than you had in the original game.2)  Inability to replay echo logs like you could in the original.3)  There is much more dialog (good) but too easy to interrupt (bad) with no way to replay as mentioned in my second point above.Overall I feel that Borderlands 2 is a huge improvement over the original in most aspects and the many improvements definitely outweigh the few negatives.  I have newer games in my library but this one always keeps drawing me back.			"

												9.5/10 - Amazing CoOp FPS; Improves On OriginalI loved the first installment of Borderlands, but this second offering improves on that template in almost every way! You have brilliant, unique graphics, plenty of FPS action and elements of RPG and tons of Loot!The best thing about this game is the CoOp online. I haven't even played much solo on the PC and probably won't since this element is so fun! You can play with 3 other friends through the entire lengthy campaign; that's good because I definately need the help. Although the game is 4 years old I never have to wait more than a minute to find a team to play with!Worth the $20; a high replay value especially with Coop Features.

												This is a game that completely shocked me. I knew nothing about Borderlands during it's release. Being honest, I thought, ""oh great, another shooter... I bet it's some cliche post apocalyptic first preson shooter where the player is the game's only last hope. Just another Call of Duty. GUNS?! Ughh. Boringgggggg!""HOWEVER, I ended up recieving it as a gift thanks to a good friend, and I was completely wrong.Borderlands 2 is meant to be played CO-OP with friends. Everything is well done. The game provides a large variety of guns with different abilities and elements.  You have to plan and think which gun is good for what situation and some are just straight out flashy and worth keeping just for personal preference. There is also a detailed skill tree system that allows the player to create the most BADASS character where the player can focus on what they want the most on. Best of all, there no pressure because everything is straight out obvious and there no PVP, so you never feel overwhelmed by tryign to make a perfect character to compete with others. I choose the cheap way and just max out my Turrent on the Commendo class. While the good character creation and a variety of guns are great, the gameplay can vary. At times, it can get really intense, ostentatious, BADASS! Hordes of enemies left to right, explosions everywhere, your PC probably screaming and explosing inside by the amount of particles  and graphical effects happenning in your screen. But, if you aren't a fan of shooters, you may at times find it repetitive as there are certain moments that feel the same. Some can argue it's just player heads to objective and kill a horde of enemies every time. I can't blame you if you feel like that, but...Borderlands 2 is the epitone for story games that prove that a fantastic story makes a game better even if it feels like a fetch and grind MMO style game. It took a game that barely had a story and  used all the characters and story plot to create this  shockly interesting story. It's like if you took coal and turn it into gold, but this is gold writing!  In addition, Handsome Jack, a new character, is pretty much the main star of the game as he guides the player throughout the game and introduces the history of Paradora. The humor in some way is very immature, childish, and goofy that you'd think it would have been written by a 12 year old. However, in my opinion everything is soo balance and even immature cussing jokes are actually funny and never feel overuesd. Being a child I am, I always get a laugh when I hear the word ""Badass"". (However, I know some people would disagree, so read about it with caution when buying). Reguardless, it's soo well done that you end up wanting to know more about the game, so you end up doing every single side quest just to know what exactly happen. Almost no quest feels like a chore because the story is what motivates you to keep playing. During your progression, he does so many bad thing in such a sarcastic and sinster way that you can't wait to have the opporunity to punch him right in his freaken handsome face. but at the same time, you begin to hate him in a way that you're actually interested in knowing more about him if that makes sense. Who exactly is he, how did he take over Hyperion corporation, why does he hate you and the vault hunters so much, why is he so freaken handsome?!?!!Buy the GOTY during a sale! Some of the season pass and level packs expansion are essential for the true experience! Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep expansion DLC is the minimum you need if you are just interested in the story because it is the conclusion of the story of Borderlands 2. This is no Mass Effect 3, I promise you that! The ending on Borderlands 2 is satisfying, but Tiny Tina concludes the game in a surpising way. Not to mention, who doesn't love dungeons and dragons? Overall, I absolutely recommend this game to anyone as long as you have friends to play with. It can be played alone. If you do, I recommend Commando or Mechromancer class because they have the ability to spawn a turrent or mech-robot that aids the player in tough situations.			"

Product received for free
												Man, Your just gonna have to get this Role-Playing-Shooter, Let Me Explain Why...GRAPHICS You probably have seen the trailer above, and it shows that Borderlands 2 and the entire Franchise have a unique art style...Cel-Shaded, and I find the graphics excellent and very well detailed... If the graphics do not suit your tastes, then well there is a fair amount of graphical mods on Nexus. The also runs a smooth 60 FPS and a few hiccups down to a 30-45 fps mark.GAMEPLAY Very excellent gunplay and roleplaying mechanics, the enemies aren't too bullet spongy, and they drop randomly generated guns, shields, and grenade mods. and the game has a TON of enemies, bosses, and minibosses. There is also a gear rarity system, Here it is with crappy to F-ing awesome, White for crap, Green for common, Blue for unique ( usually has red text when you hover over its stats), Purple for rare, Orange for legendary ( also usually has red text ). If your getting all the dlc...Seraph and Pearlecent are also extra ranks for guns, shields and grenade mods. AND THERE IS ALSO A ♥♥♥♥ TON OF GUNZ.87 BAZILLION to be exact.SOUNDGood music, decent gun sounds, I dont really have much to say about sound, but it has a decent soundtrack, you wont be dissapointed.STORY The game takes place in a kind-of SCI-FI setting with comedy and humor of all kinds. the story is this... I dont know if this if a spoiler or not but here it is... At the ending of the first Borderlands, they referenced Hyperion, 5 years later, someone named Handsome Jack wants to take control of pandora with a vault, but not any vault, a living dragon cute and cuddly thing called the warrior and you gotta stop it to prevent wide extinction of life all across the planet. not gonna tell you more cuz thats spoilers.FINAL VERDICT 10/10You will not regret buying this game...Buy it now...

												My experience with Borderlands 2 started off very negative. I thought it was a slow paced and quite boring game. This all changed as I pushed myself to continue playing. The quests are entertaining and suprisingly replayable, the variety of characters beckoned me to try out their very different play styles and powers, and the feeling of getting a better item than your current one never gets old. The DLC is worth the money and gives you new environments that are different to the vanilla games offerings. It is also a very good game with friends, especially with 4 different classes. Overall, I am very much enjoying my time with this game, and as long as you can get past the first levels with your first character, you will have a blast. 9/10, must buy.			"

												Its hard to said bad things about Borderlands 2 since it almost flawless. This is the perfect game for you and your friends to play with.Let me run down a few pros and cons for you to decided if it worth your money or not.PROS:+ Great Story with a lot of Humors and style in it.+ Great Co-op mode to keep you playing with friends.+ FPS game with RPG element in it.+ Each main NPC has there own styles of talking.+ Guns with additional elements and rarity to keep you spending in game money for that Jackpot.+ Lots of DLC to keep you busy.+ Unique visuals with cel-shaded style.CONS:- Some class seem to be OP (Gunzerker)- Legendary Weapon are hard to find even rare.- No Multiplayer pvp which is find for me but some ppl might don't- Over world have no boundaries so I fall into ocean and wasted my time to get back.- Invisible walls in some areas(usually when you climbing)Overall: 8.5/10 - Fantastic Fps story telling game.

												You will go deep into this game without writing a review in some cases... like mine.Doom revolutionized gaming in their primitive form into FPS back in 1993.Then Half Life continued with the beginning of 3D Graphics .Here we have the next Mile Stone, which evolved FPS games with Co-op, RPG, Open World with endless fun and humor. It is without hesitation the next standard for better games.No need for detailed review, as other 50,000+ did.--------حتدخل جو خيالي مع ذي اللعبة وتنسى تقيمها، الكل لازم يجربها، ما فيه العاب مماثلة لتجربة بوردرلاند.حتى انك حتستغرب ليش لعبة مثل هذه موب مشهورة عندنادووم بدأت ثورة في عالم الألعاب في مجال العاب التصويب في عام 1993.ثم واصلت هاف لايف مع بداية الرسومات ثلاثية الابعاد.هنا لدينا حجر الاساس لنوع افضل في عالم العاب التصويب الذي يجمع بين عناصر الاربي جي والعالم لمفتوح والطور التعاوني الكامل.... موب حق ديستني الخايس، ما يمديك تبادل بين اخوياك او تتحداهم ....في عالم كبير من المتعة والفكاهةومن دون تردد أنا أعلن أنها ستكون ان شاء الله المعيار الاساس لالعاب افضل. ...  ديستني ما تعلموا منها للاسف ...اذا ناوي تشتري اللعبة وحبيت جوها خذ نسخة السنة Borderlands 2 Game of the Yearلانها شاملة لاهم الاضافات وبسعر زهيد مقارنة بالجودة العالية Season Pass لا تاخذ الـشيك على اضافاته وبتشوف ان نسخة السنة اوفر وافضل واكثر منه			"

												I love this game. It's probably one of the best first person shooter games that I've ever played. It's just plain fun the controls feel nice and if you don't like them you can change them. The graphics are different but they actually work really well for this game. The whole MMO thing is pretty neat making each character feel really different even though they all have access to the same artillery. The game of the year version is pretty worth it adding 4 different dlc areas that each are pretty long. Game of the year also gives you 2 extra characters so that's pretty good. If you are an achievement hunter there's a lot of those that mostly aren't too luck based to get (finding donkey mong ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhh). The multiplayer is good if you know the person and can communicate with them. I find single player better for me at least because I like to move at my own pace. There's also a lot of comedic moments that made me laugh the first time. So in all it's pretty good and you should buy it if this is what you're looking for. Also there are 69 achievements so haha.

												One of the best games ever made!!!If you haven't played borderlands before then you NEED to play it, The replayibality in this game is incredible.. You level from 1-72 with the dlc, without i think the max level is 50. You get XP from killing enemies and completing quests, whatever level you are the enemies will be similar so its never easy!! there are so many guns and items it would be impossible to count!!! seriously there's no other game with more guns than borderlands 2, After you complete the game on normal you unlock true vault hunter mode which is harder, new enemies and new weapons and better loot, after you complete that you unlock ultimate vault hunter mode which is the same again, new weapons, enemies and better loot you also can get pearlescent weapons then too which you cant in the others, there's sooooo many sidequests it would take you so so long to complete all of them, the characters in this game are amazing and hilarious, also the characters you get to play as (choose from 4 or 6 if you have the dlc) are all unique, they have different skills and powers so you could find yourself completing the game countless times over different characters and builds, there's also character custamization with new skins and heads and there's tons of them and they're so cool!! you can loot these or unlock by doing challenges, this is my favourite game by far i've currently completed the story twice and i'm now playing on ultimate vault hunter mode, 48 hours in and the game has only just started.. i rushed the second playthrough and are saving the sidequests and all the dlc for this last one, there's just so much to do and it never gets boring ever! everything you want in a game is right hereCharacter CustomizationLoot (Endless amounts)Leveling up XPOpen WorldMASSIVE GAME I will be putting atleast 300 hours into this game, All DLC IncludedCO-OPJust buy it, dude.

												Are you REALLY asking for a review? Sure, why not. God these pretzels suck...- It's freaking Borderlands: that means GUNS, CHICKS, NONSENSE, LOOT AND EXPLOSIONS.- Forget high graphics game, this is like Metal Slug in a comic (the draw lines).- Loot, ""lewt"" or whatever you call it, the game includes THOUSANDS of different objects between weapons, shiedls and cosmetics. - The open world is insane.- NPCs are insane.- Possibly developers too are insane.- Spent a couple of hours without stopping and just wanted to cause havoc in real life.The only bad note are the DLCs.Cosmetics are NOT included in the Season Pass, so don't buy it if you want just the cosmetics or the Mechro/Psycho.11/10 would blow dozens of enemies up with a cluster grenade forever.

												After playing Borderlands 2 for more than 200 hours, I can confidently say that it is absolutely fantastic from start to finish. I rarely play a game for this long, but this one kept me wanting more. The difficulty spikes up near the end, though, so some people might not enjoy this about it.

												Borderlands 2 is one of these games that makes itself special in a whole genre. A bright star that gives you so many for the money you finally paid for. Pros:Mysterium of travelling your way that has to be done without vehicle by bunny-hopping whole time. ^^'Opposite of Dark Souls series (watching steps): Dark Souls II: Analyse exactly each enemy. 4 pers. coop BL2:  One person will try explain tactic.  Three others already in there -> Aaaaattaack!! - One time with pro's.... ATTAAAACK... xDYou can stealth, lift-up, peng-peng, get the h... out of them Nuke your gun. Circus of Flying Axes.Team > Single-player.Phantastic helpful community.Share vs. Duel.Farming/Looting.Fun never stops by optimization of the gear.Amazing crazy dialogues by Tiny Tina and Mr. Torgue (Wishing him as sales rep for vacuums or a wrestling promoter.).A story line that you will never regret having played it with all its side-missions.Most stylish and entertaining main-villain, you could wish for. (Personal advice: English voice setting is the best.)So many ways for your personalized build of your six different game characters. Badass tokens.Each story dlc is unique in its way and makes your heart smile.Plenty bosses that keep you focused.Bazillions of guns.Legendary equipment.Con: SPOILER! After playing UVHM => Normal + TVHM feel too easy ->Enemies cannot regenerate health!Résumé: Take it.... take it.... take it.... xD Have a lot of fun and keep a sharp lookout for your next enemy; it could be dropped a legendary item. *.* ^^			"

												Borderlands 2 is a, well let's self proclaim it, a ""loot-em-up"" first person shooter, created by Gearbox Software and published by 2K Games. The game is still set in Pandora, looking for a Vault after the Borderlands event. But they are different Vault Hunters this time, Maya, Axton, Zer0 and Salvador. Their role and abilities are different, so you pick each one based on what you like. You can now customised your appearance like your head and the costume. I am not going to talk through the details about their each character's abilities, so let's talk about the story, characters, graphics and the features they added. The atmosphere has been improved from its predecessors, including different locations with variety of biomes (snow, desert, etc.), compared to previous instalment where every locations are just only desert terrain. The graphics are amazingly beautiful and colourful with cel-shading, running with Unreal Engine 3. The story is hilariously well done, especially the characters are the funniest like Tiny Tina, Handsome Jack and CL4PTR4P. You'll love them straight away, even I am now a fan of Tiny Tina because of her sense of humor. They also provided some side-quests as you progress the story. The NPCs from previous instalment are back as well, with personality finally. Combat system is still the same formula from the previous game but even better. New feature added, Badass Rank which benefits your stats, depending on how you chose the stats, you can enable it or disable it. To earn it, you need to complete the challenge to earn Badass points. They added a currency feature, like Eridium to increase your inventory, storage capacity and ammo capacity. The enemy A.I. is just tough and punishing but sometimes, A.I. can be dumb or glitchy at times. You can play with your friends up to 4 players on server, but the biggest downside is the looting system because you cannot share the loot, instead they added a trade feature, so if one of your players cannot use it due to its class requirements, benefits of the item and level requirements. On technical flaws, I found some of the most annoying encounters, like walking over the small step of terrain with invisible wall, I mean it's 21st century ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it. Almost linear design choices with free roam is fine but adding invisible walls on small rocks you can step over or just nearly everything is unacceptable. There are out of bounds on every map but turrets will kill you instantly when passing beyond the area.+ Pros+ Atmosphere with variety of biomes+ LOOT, LOOT, LOOT MORE (I'm crazy about the dropped legendary loots from the fallen bosses)+ Hilarious story+ Replayability available (True Vault Hunter Mode / New Game Plus)+ Well executed character development and introducing characters throughout the story+ Combat System tweak and new features- Cons- Questionable invisible walls on terrains (small stairs, rocks)- Not shared loot system during Co-Op sessionIn this honest review, I highly recommend this game. It's an improved version of Borderlands. For your curiosity, play this game with friends than playing individually. Trust me, it's boring for some people who play this game alone. But for me, I love playing this game alone because of the grind. The story, atmosphere, well character development NPCs, looting system are the biggest improvement from the predecessor but those invisible walls on some terrain and not shared loot system are the weakest link. You will enjoy this game for every second if you play with friends.			"

												Borderlands 2 is a fantastic game if you like what it does, and a boring, tedious waste of time if you don't. It's one of those games that I can understand both why people love and why people hate.In a nutshell, it's a loot centered shooter with some modest RPG elements mixed into the pot. Without going on for hours about the game itself, I personally enjoy it. It has a good, if often crude, sense of humor, a moderate variety of enemy types, and an extremely impressive array of weaponry. As far as first person shooters go, this game is clearly designed to be played with friends, and can be challenging when you do. Overall, I'd say it's definitely worth buying if you enjoy silly, over-the-top action, and just basic brainless stupid fun.			"

												I've been waiting for a game like Borderland to come out for a very long time.Lucky me, I got Borderland 2 instead of a similar game. I've been longing for a sequel ever since I played the original game back in 2009.Every sequel should be improved upon its prequel. Borderland 2 does what Borderland didn't do back at that time, and it does it better.Everything in the game is just an improved version of the original Borderland. I was so skeptical at first. I was so excited about the game when it first came out. I wanted to try it on my new custom-built PC. The results for me were just amazing and satisfyingBorderlands 2 story didn't make sense and had no actual plot, but if you played the original game and knew what the hell was going on. The four previous characters awakened a big-a$$ monster ""final boss of Borderland 1"" and caused a disruption. A material called an Iridium scatters all over Pandora and becomes the currency for black-market and the new big thing for research. They finally ditched outdated GameSpy for online co-op games and integrated Steam, which is more than warm welcome. Despite the changes, some players still have issues with online gaming, mostly caused by their router configuration.Overall: Borderlands 2 is one of the best games of this year. If you've played the original then you'll instantaneously be familiar with everything and u will like this sequel better. Although I miss my Lilith/old characters but I forgot to say that I'm still playing borderlands 1 and it is still my favorite BL till this moment come join me BL1 honey.Now go buy/play Borderlands 2! You've wasted enough of your gaming time reading this review. Oh and... give a kiss to Moxxxi (p.s. don't forget to tip her.			"

												The most ""badass of badassiness"" game. It's the kind of game that grabs you right from the opening movie and keeps you glued until your eyes are bloodshot from playing 12 hours straight. Fight with more fantastic firearms of your dreams than you can handle. The story is well written, funny, twisted and disturbing, yet endearing. Co-op is perfect. Just land into any of your friends games and shoot the sh*t out of anything in your path. Great game.			"

												Wow... I think I'm in love with the Borderlands universe. There's just something really special about this game: the way the characters grow on you, the explosive atmosphere, the compelling story, the weird but incredible way they weave heavy moments and introspection in a game filled to the brim with humor, gore and internet memes. I feel like this game is the best it can get, or at least until Gearbox or some other developer comes up with something even better. With such a diverse cast of characters, I find it hard to imagine NOT being able to relate to at least one of them despite how extreme their personalities can be. It's not all haphazard extremeness either and each is endearing in their own way. The game is very inclusive of queer characters and neurodivergent characters. They follow stereotypes, they break stereotypes, and their differences are natural and introduced as such. Handsome Jack is on par with Pagan Min as my favorite antagonist. Every character feels alive and has defining dialogue and the areas you can explore are often beautiful. Pandora is a harsh yet vibrant world that you will blast through over and over until you finally come out on top. The FPS genre generally isn't very memorable but here's a game that smashes the rules and brings out its own style. Gunplay is the heart of Borderlands and there is a huge number of quests you can complete to gain better guns, loot and experience. I found levelling and looting enjoyable and the skill trees are decent but slightly underwhelming as a lot of them become useless if you grind to endgame difficulty modes. It goes without saying... there's a lot of grinding in this game and a couple ""fetch"" sidequests. Especially early on when you're stuck with some really low level equipment. But once you get past that initial slow start, the game really picks up and you'll find yourself shooting electricity out of shotguns and facing more challenging opponents with better rewards. I think the only gripe I might have with the gameplay is that some bosses felt poorly designed-- sort of same-y with almost all of them having unavoidable area-of-effect attacks. Until recently the drop rates for legendaries was notoriously difficult but has been fixed. Minor bugs exist but with the rest of the game being completely incredible I found them more funny than annoying.There are four playable characters (plus two more in GOTY edition) that each have their own perks and quotes. No matter who you choose you'll have a good time while they rattle off at enemies or make it to second wind just in time. There's Axton, Pandora's most handsome (next to Jack!) but smart-mouthed bisexual man, who makes a great tank and support. Maya, an ace siren, is my personal favorite with her phaselock ability and makes for a nicely balanced offense and support unit as well. Her background ties her in somewhat with the going-ons of the game and playing her can involve you more in the story. Zer0, my other favorite, is your key ""outsider"" nameless, mysterious type. He recites haiku and displays emotes on his face.... which is honestly more adorable than it should be. You just can't quite put your finger on him but that's probably part of his charm. It should be noted that although he's an assassin class, there's no stealth (this is not a subtle game!) but over time he can become a very specialized, powerful character. Sal is the only one I haven't tried out yet but from what I've heard his skill tree makes him one of the most OP tanks in the game. Sadly there isn't a lot of backstory on the protagonists but there's plenty on all the other NPCs you'll be dealing with.UPDATE: I've finished playing all the characters to OP8 and Sal is the pure definition of this game. EXPLOSIOOOONS! Gaige and Krieg, the other two characters included in GOTY/season pass as dlc, are fun, fast-paced power tanks. Highly recommended.This is an attractive game full of creativity and it's clear upon playing that the people who made this game really put in a lot of effort and attention (and also memes) into it. Aside from the characters, small details like occasional ECHO logs and the differences in gun part brands add depth. The landscapes and cartoony art are great and perfectly suit the game's action-savvy theme which creates a unique combination of lightheartedness and gore. I loved the day-night transitions and many areas make for some beautiful, detailed scenery that are nice to look at while you're in or out of a fight. The world is literally blowing up with fun! And despite some really tough mobs you'll crawl through, you might find yourself coming back for more because there's nothing quite like it. For a game that makes a million jokes, I copped lots of feels and it somehow really touched me.If you have the time and energy to spare, I strongly recommend the GOTY edition. Tiny Tina and Captain Scarlett's DLC that are included with it are some of the biggest, best DLC I've seen to date. There are many ways to play the game and trying out new characters or difficulty modes lends itself to some high replayability. On days you just want to sit back, kick some butt and feel like a badass, this is the perfect solution for everyone and anyone. Now excuse me while I write a love letter to gearbox.			"

												Borderlands 2, is, in my opinion, GOTY 2012.Like looting? Check.Don't like looting and just want to proceed with the quest? Check, but do some sidequests to make sure you level up pretty evenly.Do you like an interesting story?   I can't say it's very complex, but it makes you feel with the characters (both lmao and ""muh feels"")Do you like interesting characters?   It's Borderlands, were you expecting something NOT interesting about them?Do you like content?   Even without GOTY, this game has at least 40~ hours before you beat the main campaign; nevermind the pretty cool sidequests you get.   With GOTY, you can expect well over 120-150 hours before you beat everything (again, with proper side-quest balancing)Personally, I rate this a 9.5/10, since the only drawback I saw was that sidequests WERE a requirement, or else you'll get creamed in the main campaign.    They're not boring though (maybe in contrast to the main campaign), so that's always a plus.			"

												If I were to describe video games in an extremely complicated metaphor that tied in mammals, reptiles, ethnic food, and figures from mythology, Borderlands 2 would be something like a Platypus-Snake-JapaneseSesameChicken-Surma.Platypus: Why a platypus? Because Platypuses/Platypeese/Platypii are unique. They're a weird hybrid thing that is actually pretty cool. Borderlands is practically a second cousin of the platypus, with all that uniquity. The best way I can think to explain it would be to draw up the image of an MMO. MMOs let you run around, level up, dump skill points everywhere, find loot to kill things to find more loot of varying rarity, and some of them let you enter instanced dungeon areas to kill monsters with your friends (Where applicable). Borderlands is pretty similar to that, but it's a first person shooter. You pick a class, get killed first thing off, and then start your adventure as the semi-official minion of the incessantly talking Wheatley/Gir mashup named Claptrap(More like shut-your-trap, amirite?). Your adventure will have you killing enemies for random loot, levelling up to get different perks that let you build your own style of character, and taking side quests from NPCs. the whole game is like one of those aforementioned instanced dungeons, where you can drag up to three friends (Or, should you lack those, random people online that probably hate you just because they are the internet) and go monster slaying. I've heard that if your friend takes your loot, you can stop being friends and then challenge him to a now-unfriendly duel to kill him and take what's rightfully yours. I wouldn't know, because I don't really..... have... friends. And I hate the internet people. In summary: Borderlands 2 is an FPSMMO but not MMO because instead of being massive multiplayer it's like 4 multiplayer, but still retains all the typical trimmigns of one of the nicer MMOs. It's like halo with quests. After your head finishes exploding at how fun that sounds, carry on reading.Snake: Snakes look pretty cool, and they make neat sounds.You know what else looks cool?I do! I have awesome curly hobbit hair like Frodo. But I'm not the only cool-looking thing around. Cel-shaded graphics are pretty neat as well. Borderlands 2 has a really cool art style that makes it super obvious you're playing Borderlands and not something else. For the easily confused, it may be nice to be able to tell what game you're playing at a glance. Sound-wise, it's wunderbar (German for wonderful. Also useful: ""Der Mann isst das Kind"" means ""I like children"", which is good to know because people trust you more if you like children). Everyone's voiced, and they voiced real nice. Guns sound like guns. Bad guys sound like bad guys and say things like ""I will kill you"" before making guns noises come out of their guns. Japanese Sesame Chicken: HOLY CHILDREN OF GOD SESAME CHICKEN IS GOOD. I order it every time I go to a Japanese restaurant, much in the same way I ordered Borderlands 2. fun is good, and Borderlands 2 is fun. Everyone is funny, and you can't spell funny without fun. You can't spell gun without un, and you can't spell fun without un. You also can't spell undertaker without un, but that's not applicable here. Dialogue is full of funny things, a couple of which made me pause the game so I could laugh for a while (Claptrap talking about his own voice is my favorite line so far). Surma: Surma is the Finnish god of violent death, if wikipedia tells the truth. Science has been performed to prove that wikipedia is true. So scientifically speaking, (Is that what scientology is?) Surma is real, and Surma is in this game a lot because you will death-initely be violently death-ing a whole death-ing lot of things with all your fancy guns you pick up (Which feel great by the way. Some shooters feel horrible, and other just ""feel right"" or something). Lots of fun stat comparing to be had, so you can put that statistics* class to use for once. It seems like Surma might be the only god in here though, besides maybe the god of fun if that's a thing (Sheogorath?). All your quests will boil down to ""walk here"" followed by ""shoot the bad things"" (Don't worry, they are bad things like enemies, so it's fine to shoot them. Claptrap addresses this as well, if you are suffering any moral twinges about this.) and then ""pick up the things"" and then finally ""take the thing to the guy"" to get a profitable return. So not much variety. the story behind each will be different, ranging from r/interesting to ""You srsly ask me do this.""The complete Platypus-Snake-JapaneseSesameChicken-Surma package:I like this game. I only have a couple hours as of this review, but it seems like I'll be grabbing plenty more, even though none of me jolly mates have it. I'll get them eventually. It may eventually wear itself out, but if that unholy grindfest Warframe held my attention for an extreme 172 hours, I don't think I'll get sick of Borderlands 2 anytime soon. ESPECIALLY if my imaginary friends get imaginary computers and play with me.Overall score: Great out of ten. I told steam to give it the blue thumb and not the red one. Hail Surma. *After talking to a dormmate, I have come to realize that statistics is not about how to compare weapon stats in video games. I will try to petition and have that made a thing though.

												A lot of different guns with different effects,like slaging for extra dmg, fire dmg, corrosion dmg, electricity dmg, explosion dmg and normal dmg.There are many shields with enhanced capacity or booster shields dropping shield energy items to refresh shield energy before depleted, shields with bonus dmg to melee dmg or 1 unique shield for bonus ranged dmg at full shield capacity.Spiked shields which do dmg to melee attackers and 1 unique shield to ranged attackers(homing spikes shot at).Character class items to improve skills in your skilltree and so on.a lot of different legendary items and also special items which can be purchased in special currencies, like seraph crytals gain at bosses slain on hardest difficulty(also overpowered lvl) and torque tokens collectin at torques campaign or gaining by doing a quest Bar brawl witch can be repeated infinite.If you die you turn in a fight for your life modus,where you after killing an enemy in a short time span, get back into action, otherwise you die and will be respawned at the last waypoint/travelstation, loosing an ammount of money.Travelling by car is good but using travelstations to get fast to other locations is fast and awesome. 6 classes 4regular and 2 dlc chars, 3skilltrees. 4 players coop, you can also duell each other, different looks for your characters, outfits and heads and vehicles skins, Boss enemies for 1 Insane skilled char or for 2-4 Players.Vehicles 2 different cars, in the normal game, at Hammerlocks Hunting Dlc 1 Hovercraft and 1 Boat at Scarlets Pirate Dlc. Doing quests and other tasks gives you Badass rank for some Bonuspoints, increasing gun dmg, gun accuracy or maximum Health, maximum Shields, faster reload and so on. Lvl cap is 72, if you have that Digistruck Peak Dlc, otherwise 50. Great game, but storing Stuff is a problem, shared stash a bit small 4 items, but good that there is one. The regular safe could be pimped by spending eridium bars, also the Ammunition/Grenade capacity you can handle.Funny dialogs and other stuff included. This game is made in a comic look and i like it ;) Hm, forgot to say there are golden keys available in this game to open a loot chest in sanctuary, which contains loot of your actual level. I started with 8 keys and you can find around the whole internet options to increase the number of keys to get some maybe good loot.Another Benefit from Digistruct Peak dlc is, after solving the histoty of simulated violence, you unlock overpowered lvl 1. On this difficult the complete game get a bit harder higher leveled enemies, but also better loot overpowered 1 items.After each overpowered lvl solved overpowered difficult can be raised at the main menu. The maximum overpowered lvl is 8. I played the whole game without any mods and so is the review about the game.If you want to help a friend getting overpowered lvl´s unlocked, your friend has to host the game.			"

												I think this is probably one of the greatest ARPGs ever made. Technically an FPS-ARPG hybrid, this game combines a first person shooter interface with an ARPG style incremental loot hunt. This is also combined with a hilarious story, a vast array of ingenuous environments and Handsome Jack, the lead villain who is arguably one of the best video game antagonists every created.Game play revolves around killing bandits (and other monsters) indigenous to the fictitious planet Pandora. Pandora is a grim, frontier world, existing in a universe with a weak (or nonexistent central government) which has been a target for various attempts at corporate takeover. Most recently, it has been revealed as a place where ancient, alien treasure troves known as “Vaults” can be found. There are a host of well voiced, hilarious NPCs and supporting characters, an amusing story and plenty to shoot. Players can choose between four basic characters, with an additional two characters available as downloadable content. Each player character comes with its own special ability, allowing for a surprising variety of gameplay. This is an incredibly well done game that can provide hundreds, even thousands of hours of entertainment. Highly recommended for ARPG fans.			"

												«У них же были дети, родители, семьи… Как ты мог? Шучу. Убей их всех!»Да и могла ли атмосфера поменяться? События второй части разворачиваются на той же планете Пандоре всего через несколько лет после известного провала четверки охотников за Хранилищем. По пустынным равнинам все так же бегают скаги, в небе парят свободные ракки, а бандиты разбивают свои лагеря. Однако кое-что изменилось. Вскрытие героями Хранилища спровоцировало выход эридиума — сверхценного ресурса, на добычу которого направлена деятельность корпорации «Гиперион». Красавчик Джек, возглавивший «Гиперион», объявил политику очищения планеты от бандитской заразы колонистов, которые для совместного противостояния корпорации сплотились в местечке под названием Убежище. Таким образом, сюжетным фоном выступает классическая борьба могущественных, многочисленных, но «злых» эксплуататоров и слабых, но нравственно более одаренных повстанцев. В сюжетной завязке Borderlands 2 не блещет оригинальностью, повторяя каноническую схему многих антиутопических произведений. Тем не менее по ходу игры сюжет увлекает, нас ждут приятные и не очень неожиданности, которые проливают свет на события первой части.Система развития персонажа в Borderlands 2 не сильно отличается от оригинала. Уничтожая различную живность, а также выполняя задания, игрок получает опыт. Каждый новый уровень автоматически увеличивает максимальное здоровье и урон, а также дает одно очко умения, которое можно вложить в развитие того или иного навыка. У каждого из персонажей есть три специализации, представляющие собой набор тех или иных умений. Например, у убийцы Зеро это снайперское мастерство, хитрость, резня.Чтобы улучшить следующую ступень специализации, нужно вложить 5 очков в предыдущую. А таких ступеней у каждого персонажа шесть. Таким образом, чтобы дойти до вершины специализации, нужно иметь как минимум тридцатый уровень. А это значит, что можно стать или выдающимся снайпером, или крутым рубакой в ближнем бою, или всем понемногу.Что же касается боевой составляющей, то и с этой стороны игра похорошела.Плюсы: потрясающий стиль; фирменный юмор; колоритные герои; многообразие оружия.Минусы: система развития персонажа могла быть интересней.

												I haven't tried any of the dlcs so I won't be telling anything about them in this review!!You are a Vault hunter, and you seek for quests and victory! This is an open world/freeroam FPS game, that everyone got to have in their library!The storyline is very rich and interesting. Personally for me it wasn't easy to understand it. Its kinda complicated, but the game is fun. Even though it supports controllers I recommend using a mouse and keyboard. The controlls are simple how they should be in every game. Theres alot of quests and side quests. Guns are also very much in this videogame. I can't even count them all. What I love about this game is that it has its own unique style, kind of cartoon, messy. Its fun that you can play online with your friends or random people. In a lobby you can invite 3 more people. 4 people in one lobby is max.Borderlands 2 is better than any game from borderlands franchise. It has been proven by gamers that played borderlands series.PROS:+Unique+Fun+Exciting+Addcting+Good graphics+Doesn't lag at all (Check my PC stats in my profile)+Costs low price if you buy it from ♥♥♥+Has CO-OP+Trading cards :3+Controller support+Rich storylineCONS:-Hard to understand story (For me)-No local co-op (Maybe possible with mods)EDIT: Forgot to add to CONS that a huge minus is for -Driving controls			"

												If Call of duty was a movie and Grand theft auto was a Gang fight, Borderlands was a circus.That's right, colorful and noisy circus.It's not trying to stir emotions, it's trying to entertain us.On borderlands 2 the circus is returning, bigger and funnier.But it's still the circus we know from 2009.Since the Vault opened at the end of the first game, it was discovered the miraculous element Haridium.Pandora has not become a better place to live.The new energy source attracted to the Planet the largest birds of prey in the galaxy, such as Hyperion technology corporation and its owners, known as Handsome Jack.Jack took over the planet with the help of armies of robots and his troops is threatening to destroy all opposition.He searches for Pandora's Box, another legendary Vault that supposed to give him absolute power over the entire planet and kills every vault Hunter that comes and may precede the Treasury.For those who not familiar with the series, Borderlands combines first-person action gameplay with a formula of a mass extermination, collecting loot and character development of role playing-action.I like to call it Shoot and Loot.The maps that make up the game's open world isn't random, but it will send you to kill thousands upon thousands of enemies, returning to life in most areas after a short time.Like I said, Borderlands 2 is a circus.Don't search for exciting moments & epic scenes.Come to the carnival (And don't forget to bring friends with you [Seriously, it's very boring to play alone]).

												I can already see myself getting attacked by lovers of this game for not recommending it. This is a game I actually hate, and I will explain why even though most of my arguments will be deemed invalid. I've spent a long time playing this game with a variety of friends I have, beat it once and played a lot of the True Vault Hunter and helped friends in different campaigns. As I write this review I'm level 40, I think the most fun I had out of this was surviving rounds with buddies in Fink's Slaughterhouse and riding some vehicles, other than that, the game has been extremely tedious and repetitive.Yes, I understand this is a RPG, and doing repetitive tasks is expected of one in the genre. However, my point stands because I believe there is a lot more to expect and to do on a big, open world like this. A lot of the dialogue, which are mostly done by characters that speak to each other through quirky one-liners, made me cringe due to how corny and/or annoying they were (Claptrap and Ellie being the biggest examples). It lacks polish too, as seen in the game's intro when played with multiple players, Claptrap addresses them as a single vault hunter, rather than multiple. It's something that shocked me a little, for a game that has its own proper and working co-op support, considering even Doom 3 on the original Xbox had dialogue acknowledging multiple players. But I digress, I was able to get a laugh out of very few lines, but I just couldn't find the majority of the ones my friends laughed at funny at all. On top of that the game throws a massive meme spam at you.Minor spoilers start here.One of the things that disappointed me the most about the game's ending, is how predictable it was. The final boss has a weak point that you just have to shoot a bunch of times for it to die/be damaged effectively, I've lost count of how many times this formula has been reused. There's next to no strategy in any of those, and zero entertainment. You just shoot them until they die, wasting a load of ammo, whilst going down a lot through the fight, sometimes even dying just to respawn in order to repeat the exact same process. Instead of going with a different and daring move that could've paid off and become very memorable, they went with the safest and dullest way.Minor spoilers end here.The A.I. in Borderlands 2 is the definition of dumb. They literally just charge at you and never bother to take cover or communicate any strategies, repeating the same tactic every single time. This made the game's combat beyond uninteresting and underachieving. It feels like their script is to really just lock on a target and shoot them regardless of anything that's happening. They don't try to defend themselves. They don't try to attack smartly. They just shoot or run at your direction to hit you (depending on the enemy), and that's it.I'm tired of characters that are nothing but quest distributors. While the quests have improved, they still use the same post-MMORPG find-and-fetch, or kill X number of a certain kind of affair code. It remains flat and boring to drive to a waypoint looking around for an item you’re supposed to retrieve while having a bunch of dreadful enemies to fight. Now about grinding, it's something that I will never understand how it can fun for people. You do the same monotonous crappy tasks for a tiring long amount of time to gain things that are hardly any better than what you had before. It's rarely ever worth the reward. There is literally no goal in MMORPGs other than the experience itself. You could argue that it feels rewarding achieving your goal after a long time spent working to get it, the counter-argument is that 95% of those rewards are worthless, and only take true effect and make a significant difference after a sluggish amount of deeds are done completing said tedious tasks.Furthermore, what really are the RPG elements in the game? Pondering over whether to sell a gun that does a certain amount of damage and has a percentage of this effect, or the other gun which deals more damage but doesn't have that effect but another is not role-playing. Neither is shopping for new class abilities with your new XP purchased skill point. Those things are micromanagement, not role-playing. In my eyes a game is a RPG when I feel that I am embodying a character. When you create a personality for the character and stick with it, making decisions based upon his/her beliefs, background, and such. Never once has this happened in Borderlands 2, so why is this considered an RPG? Simply having ""RPG elements"" like level progression, skill points to spend, getting better gear and the like really just doesn't to me make it an RPG game. I think the whole idea of 'role-playing' in a game context has become too blurry, and people are now misusing the term.Shops are stocked with the same kind of junk, and come with an occasional daily deal to tempt to you sell off your entire backpack. Clicking on Pandora’s countless lockers and storage boxes is borderline ennui. I don’t consider wandering around and picking up a valueless amount of money and a pack of ammo over and over again to be gameplay, and it’s doubtlessly not good gameplay. I nearly blench when I see a bunch of green lights from a distance, because I know that when I go there I'll get the same crap I always get and move on.It's the development road and sense of progression in the game that remains completely messed up. It’s too long, drawn out, and rewards perseverance and grinding rather than good playing and skill-building. Taking 5 levels to even unlock your character’s core class ability is also bothersome. It feels like you are constantly chasing a game-changing function that never materializes, and that is pretty much it. You’re non-stop attempting to advance or find a new and worthy gun, although when you do it’s just an unsatisfying incremental change. This game is empty, and to me, people are gleefully ignoring this as they run around opening boxes in the middle of shooting.At least, in cooperative, while talking to your friends about random subjects it's much easier to disregard the factors that make this game boredom, as it feels like it becomes a secondary. You tend to focus more on these during single-player. Obviously, there are things to praise about this game, such as the great art design. The voice acting is done with emotion and energy, which is something I adore. In the middle of unfunny nonsense there are some amusing things you can get a laugh out of, and clever references are also present. If you want to have a good time playing a mindless shooter that you can spend a lot of hours on and contains a lot of guns and quests with your friends, this indeed gets the job done. Looking at it as a game overall however, it is not good. I hope Gearbox improves Borderlands 3 upon this, since this one didn't from its predecessor. 4.1/10.0 "

												This game got his Epic moments, but also sad moments.If you want to have action just let people flying play Maya the Sirene, If you want to spam bullets for days play Salvadaor the Gunzerker, if you want to controll the battlefield then play Axton the Comando or if you want to Headshot or slice up your enemy's play Zer0 the Assassin.If your going to buy this game then be prepared for the pur epicnes, a RPG Action shooter ever had.Get some guns, Kill some creatures and beat the Hyperion Corporation.Jack won't kill himself so what are you waiting for.

												Loot, Guns, Treasure and EXPLOSIONS!!! Thats right ladies and gentlement this game packs all of the punch! with the ability to have up to 4 people playing at 1 time, more then 1,000 different types of guns to use, extremely well done DLC content that is actually worth the buy and adds onto the game experience and keeps is fresh as the day you just bought it! I have over 1,000 hours in this game for a good reason it was just that much fun for the longest time! 2K did an amazing job brinigng this game to life and giving it all they had to make it not only enjoyable for them, but for the customers who bought it. The game will never bore you and its worth atleast 4-5 different play throughs especially if you have friends! So I recommend you sit back, grab the nearest BIGGEST gun you can find, grab your bestest of best friends and hunt loot! See you on Pandora vault hunters! Nya~			"

												I have never played the original Borderlands. I decided to play Borderlands 2 to see what this franchise is like. I first noticed the cel-shaded graphics and a diverse number of characters to choose from. After I chose my protagonist (Gunzerker) I had to get used to the skill trees, the wacky characters, the large number of side missions in addition to the main story missions. One of the wackiest characters is Claptrap, a robot with something to say all the time and is quite delusional.The story is set in Pandora, a planet filled with vicious creatures of all kinds. The planet is control by Handsome Jack, the main antagonist of the game. As you progress through the game you will regularly hear Handsome Jack’s speak sarcastically about your goal to bring him down. There are many Echo recorders that will help flesh out the story and who Handsome Jack really is.The script and voice acting in Borderlands 2 is nothing short of superb. The voice actors and script writers should be highly commended for making the characters such as Scooter, Moxxi, Claptrap and others very entertaining. The only problem I found with the voices was that some conversations can be interrupted by other conversations before you can hear them completely. However, it’s not such a bad thing for the game overall.There is plenty to explore and if you’re into exploring as much as possible, Borderlands 2 will entertain you for 100+ hours. Each sector of the map has its own environmental feel and its own creatures. The DLCs add even more content for you to explore, but you are best advised to advance your character to at least level 20 because the enemies are much tougher than those enemies in the main story. The DLCs are divided into chapters and side missions while the battles with tougher creatures will reward you with lots of experience points. The side missions in the main game are definitely worth pursuing, as they include puzzle elements and some very simple goals such as simply shooting someone in the face in the side mission titled “Shoot This Guy in the Face.” Other side missions require you to find certain items to receive a unique weapon such as the side mission titled “The Lost Treasure”, a mission that requires you to find different parts of a treasure map. The parts can be anywhere in a region, but the payoff is huge in the form of a very powerful pistol.Part of what makes Borderlands 2 great in gameplay is the diverse availability of weapons, shields, grenade mods, class mods, and relics. Class mods and relics have ways of enhancing your character’s combat abilities. The inventory feels a little clunky, but once you get used to it you can navigate it pretty quickly. The inventory is important for using in the various vending machines for buying ammo, selling ammo and streamlining.Respawning is an integral part of this game, as enemies will respawn when you return to the same sector. It may feel tedious after a while, but it can be rewarding because these are opportunities to gain more experience as you try to reach the level of 50. To max out your character you will have to complete the normal mode in order to open up the True Vault Hunter Mode. It is important to know the strengths and weaknesses of enemies so that you know which weapons and ammo work best against them. For example, the loaders (mechanical bots) are vulnerable to corrosive ammo. Therefore, it is best to use a corrosive weapon to kill them faster. The crystallisks are hulking creatures with shins that are made of brittle crystals. Shooting their brittle shins is the only way to bring them down.This game encourages cooperative play, so it can be fun playing with friends. However, it is better to play with friends who are at a level close to yours, although the game automatically balances the difficulty according to the levels of the players. It is a great feeling trying to heal fellow players in dire times. The unusual feature of death is interesting because there is a chance to achieve a second wind if you get a kill while you’re dying and the red meter is going down to zero.I found the save system awkward since it saves everything that happens. If you leave the game while in the middle of a mission, you will have to pick up where you left off and the enemies you killed will respawn. In essence, the save system consists simply of save and quit.Borderlands 2 is one of the most entertaining role-playing games with so much to explore. The gameworld is thriving with loot and opportunities to reap the rewards of doing favors for other townsfolks. I highly recommend this game to anyone as it will take many, many hours of your time and those hours will feel worth it.			"

												Personally i'm not a big fan in FPS games, or even hate.But Borderlands 2 just hook me into the world, and I'm in love with this game.Combining with some RPG elements, it makes the whole game is addictive as hell.You can play as a psycho, or a ninja, or deploying a turret or a robot and do all the dirty works for you, etc.Pros:>Awesome storyline, enjoying every single story and cutscene of it>A s*** tons of humors>Wide weapons pool, providing you multiples weapons to use in combat>The artstyle and graphic is just too amazing, and is compatible with the game>Multiplayers/Co-op system, you can play with your friends or random players online>Characters, skins, monsters and enemies are badass>With DLCs it makes the game more interesting>You can often get free golden chest keys from official twitter pageCons:>Poor matchmaking system I haven't play any of the borderlands series but this one is really worth playing, as well as Borderlands and Borderlands: TPS, since the borderlands series don't disappoint us everytime :3Highly recommended9.8/10 "

												This is how to make a sequel ! Boost the sh*t to the (MAD) MAX !Could it be any better ?GIMME BORDERLANDS 3 !Exemplary co-op fun combat frenzy. (not much better co-ops)6 different characters, different situations. Tasty! Skillfest. Lets rock! Lootfest. Juicy! Boomfest! GRRRRnades! Bosses. Badasses. Challenging difficulty. Awesome and various weapons. Elemental or special/hilarious effects.Amusing and some delicious abilities, and then comes more of delicious throughout the skill tree. Hack n slash. Catchy character-gameplay building (you can respec).The Siren is just awesome, enjoyin her all the time! The Assassin is very tricky with various gameplay, he rocks. The Gunzerker has kinda mechwarrior/godlike feeling, lovely. All those three, perfect gameplay, hack n slash. Get the loadout editor software for exploring all the stunning arsenal!Comparing to the original, the more variety of enemies was needed and now its on. Also now fluent - action friendly walkthrough... enemy respawns now are slow; more resources, no major shopping dilemmas... Campaign DLCs also rock and have power to impress you and outshine the basic game.Large world overall. Lots of things to do. Secrets. High replayability. Humourous. Stylish. (over 12 million copies sold)			"

												Overall, the art, narration and characters are really memorable. Considering I'm not much of an FPS fan (I haven't played BL1, note that), the number of hours I've put into this game is actually something I didn't plan out or expect.First to run through was pretty fun, and somewhere halfway around the second one (if not for the DLCs), the game start to drag a little bit on solo. I particularly liked how skills can be conveniently reset anytime along side with the large variety of weapons (gun porn~!). Trying out different builds made the game really interesting to play. I also like how some quests have quirky and funny storylines.If you're playing with friends, it's a great game to play! At this point in time, I don't think I'll be picking up BL2 again if I weren't playing with someone else. At higher levels, raid bosses get to be more frustrating than challenging, and the cycle of running through the same thing - griding and trying to score good loot just wears me out. I picked this game up on sale and bought it with friends, so the experience of laughing at Claptrap cursing stairs was really awesome. I would definitely say it's at least worth the money and worth playing.			"

DID YOU KNOW THAT OVER 97% OF ALL LIVING CREATURES ON PANDORA AREN'T EXPLODING RIGHT NOW?! This is one of the best COOP games I've ever played, heck even playing it Solo is fun enough (though, it can be tedious during some main quests). Released in 2012 and yet I'm still playing it in 2016: still have a lot to explore, achieve (you thought that getting all Steam achievements can be your end game, huh? How about in-game achievements, too?), level up (still having 1-2 characters to level up to max level and then getting all characters on the top of Overpowered level) and, of course, I still need to get MORE SHINY GUNS.Pros:+ Catching story line, and then -- BAM -- you get the DLCs for more! + more Side-quests!+ NPCs, their intros and VAs (seriously, just listen to Mr. Torgue). There's even the weapon manufactures commercials (check it out on YT)!+ Jokes, references, memes, Easter Eggs! Lots of them!+ Characters and their backstory.+ COOP, up to 4 players.+ Replayability: you have Normal + TVHM + UVHM modes to do and then, once you got Lv.72, you unlock OP1-8 levels +  Badass Tokens + [for hardcore perfectionists] you have in-game achievements in additional to Steam ones!+ Loot: a single item can get different levels, rarity, stats, weapon parts (that actually affect the weapon's stats!), mechanics etc.+ Explosions -- these are beautiful.+ Guns. Glorius guns. (while it's not the bazillion we've been teased about, there's still lots of them)+ OST -- varying from ambient to boss themes -- it's still eargasmic. Too bad that some of awesome tracks aren't listed in OST.+ Enemies. Ohhh I'm sure your most hated ones will be Juggernauts, Fire Threshers and Rabid Skags/Stalkers. Prepare to die & rage.+ Interesting mechanics: grenades that fire bullets?! A shotgun that fires swords that explode?! A shield that turns you into One-Punch Man?! GO GET IT. + with DLCs and updates you get more stuff, Pearlescent and Seraph with their own features.Cons (sadly, there are):- You can't start on higher difficulty if you already unlocked it. For every character you got you have to unlock and play through every Difficulty mode (Normal -> TVHM -> UVHM). Can be tedious and burning out if you don't speedrun through or not using save edit.- The game is about getting a better gear with each level you get. The grind. While I find it pretty OK-ish, some players may not like it.- The game isn't perfectly optimized, so you can experience FPS drops even on high-end PCs, but it's still worth it.- Easy to mod stats. You can encounter players with modded weapons or stats -- they can not only kill things by just looking at them but also drop some of their shinies ruining the fun for you (if you pick up the drops, it's all up to you).- Can be rough for Solo players (everytime you die the boss/enemies get their HP restored back to 100%)			"

												Absolutely fantastic and thoroughly enjoyable!++ Wonderful character designs++ Great dialogue supported by excellent voice acting++ Unique skill trees even for what is essentially a shooter++ Numerous weapon and accessory varieties++ DLCs add a huge amount of content and replayability++ Extremely enjoyable single and co-op play++ Pop culture references galore (add nothing to a story but are always a nice touch)-- Repetitive mob and boss types-- Difficulty scales up in sheer brute force rather than combat intelligence or tactics-- Redundant kill, find, fetch, and delivery quests-- ClaptrapNot a lot of cons for me in this game. I'm just kidding about Claptrap. He is as funny as he is annoying (most of the time).I had the retail release of BL2 (and none of the mission packs and Vault Hunter upgrades at that time) way before I even became a Steam member. It's still as much fun now as it was back then. The DLCs add fresh content plus a good dose of hilarity, especially the Mechromancer and Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep!In terms of play and narrative, this is a very simple game at its core, but it's incredibly fun because it does it what it does with great polish, and the presentation is top-notch.

												Hi this is a lot of fun specially when you play with friends in Co-op Mode. You can level up in that game get better weopons upgrades. The story telling for missions is very funny. Mostly the scenes with the robot speaking^^. You have diffrent classes to chose every single one with a unique skill they can activate and you also receive skill ppints for upgrading your character. Very important is to find much Loot and good weopns even more good protection in form of shields and enough Health casue the enemies get very strong when continue further in the game. For all who love shooters with RPG elements i can recommend this game. The missions you can chose which you want to go first for but you can have multiple activated at same time and decide which one you will go for. Aslo its not a good idea to alone for a large number of enemies so grab your friends and you have fun.greetz Akaya			"

												Borderlands 2 deserves all the praise of the first in the series, but not much else.  More than a new title, it feels like a reskinning of the original.  For the most part, it excels in all the same ways the first does, but minor flaws place it a couple places behind its predecessor.  The biggest complaint, and it's a minor one, is that the menus are harder to navigate/stats of weapons are harder to discern.  Campaign/story-wise the game continues the series acceptably but it feels somewhat repetitious.			"

												Haven't played such a dank game in a looong time! The characters and the dialogue are meant to play a parody account of what is in fact a serious setting. From badass bosses to sloppy douches, from swamps to metal wrecked graveyard, you just can't get enough.The graphics are a wonderful artwork rather than a mediocre realism. The control binds are comfortable. The game is super friendly on medium end systems. You can't seem to farm enough for a huge mount of weapons, mods, items, skills and that makes you wanna farm more! Although sometimes it feels cluttered and you really can't be patient enough to absorb all that info.Coop is the best!! Get a friend or friends and start embarking on a rampage.Rated 9/10			"

												What can I say other than RPG + Guns + More Guns + Even More Guns and throw in a bunch of DLCs = a very fun game that you will enjoy playing. Campaign is very good you get involved with the chracters and what happens to them also it has Handsome Jack one of the best villians I have ever had in a game he is such a ♥♥♥ you love to hate him. The DLCs add extra content where the main story ends with new areas and loot + more dialogue from the characters you begin to love like Torgue, Tina, Hammerlock, etc. Also did I mention there are 3 times you can replay the game as the same character but each time the enemies become harder and start to regen hp + higher chance of loot and all around a fun time if you and a couple of friends want to blow crap up. Out of 10 I would rate this game 9.5 and I recommend anyone that loves RPG elements and the quirky nature of the first Borderlands but done better to pick this up even if you are not familiar with the first I highly recommend all around good game.

												Borderlands 2 is not as good as the first game. Oh, sure, it's got a better (more emotional!) story, more diverse maps, more vehicles, a cool head and skin system, more gun types and effects, and is just all around a bigger, more varied experience, but it's not... well, okay. The first game wasn't a great shooter. Borderlands 2 isn't either. It mostly relies on simply pointing and clicking. The stats all ultimately determine how quickly an enemy's health bar diminishes in size. It's not as if we're playing Half-Life or Halo or FEAR or Bulletstorm or something, because we're not. We're playing a game that's about loot.Too bad the loot drop ratios are so bad. I don't know why they're worse than they were in the original game, but I do know that in my hundred-some hours of play, I only managed to pick up four or five orange items. That seems wrong. Borderlands 2 is the first game that made me seriously consider using CheatEngine. Me, I don't like cheats unless they're humorous, but Borderlands 2's drop ratios are so frustrating, requiring needless, endless grinding from players, that I found myself kinda going ""yeah... let's make things more like they were in the first game.""The story is great. I've mentioned that. I should mention it again. It's great. Best of all is Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep, which is apparently the only DLC developed entirely in-house at Gearbox (the others were apparently outsourced, which might suggest why they're all kind of terrible in terms of level design, pacing, and the like and only worth playing for the humor--Hammerlock's Hunt is easily the worst one), which actually kinda makes me feel emotions and stuff that I don't normally like feeling in video games.Borderlands 2 isn't a great loot game. It isn't a great shooter. It's a good-looking game, a glorious co-op experience, and is really funny to boot. Mister Torgue is a stand-out character; easily one of my favorites of all time. The new weapons and effects--if you're lucky enough to pick them up, are pretty cool. The game expands a lot of the elements of the first game, or tosses in a bunch of new things to make it more diverse. It's a fun game that's worth playing, but not because of its core gameplay mechanics, which are a bit of a letdown, or most of the DLC, which... honestly kinda sucks due to boring level design.			"

The AI actually have brains and know how to take cover. This game presents a challenge in every aspect that you can enjoy. The gameplay and controls are completely unflawed and the story is nice too. But there is one problem...CLAP TRAP IS ANNOYING AS HELL!!! This game is really a must buy. If you are looking to buy any dlc, get the Season pack, Ultimate vault hunter upgrade 2 (the first upgrade is included in the season pass), The Psycho pack, and the mechromancer pack.			"

												Borderlands 2 is a rpg, Fps. This game is worth the money but not only is it an fps but quite wacky and bizzare making it one of the most unique and different game of all time. Borderlands 2 contains quite a few dlc that last very long. It also have 3 headhunter dlc which are short and only give out alot of skins and heads for your character.Borderlands 2 has a wide variety of bosses and mini-bosses such as knuckledragger,boom-bewm and captain flynt. Borderlands 2 a great solo game but when friends come on its raid boss time! Raid bosses are tough bosses and usually need a few peopel to defeat. An example is terramorphous, He is a big powerful monster who can wipe you off the map. Some raid bosses are Hyperius, Master Gee, Voracidous and dexidous.Borderlands 2 has a million different types of weapons, Many are found randomly but some 'Unique' weapons which are usually marked with red text saying something about the weapon. Every boss in borderlands 2 drops a unique which you will need to farm for. Farming is when you fight the boss over and over again for his rarest loot. Some bosses only have a 1 in 200 chance of dropping their unique. Raid bosses drop and legendaries. Borderlands 2 is a great game and easily a 9.5 out of 10			"

												This is a very good co-op game (so was the first one). It kind of mixes a shooter with a RPG game, and it does it incredibly well. You can explore, you can use vehicles, you can loot and surely you will laugh more than once. The only thing I don't really like is that this is the first case of a GOTY edition which doesn't include all the DLCs (and it has a lot of them). So, I recommend either not buying this game until a final version with every DLC is released, or buying the GOTY edition and hope they will someday release a single final upgrade with the latter DLCs and the ones excluded from that GOTY ed.

Public Review on behalf of the Opium Pulses Steam groupFew words about the gamePersonally it's my most favourite universe in whole... universe, yeah that makes sense. What can I say about the game, you're playing as a Vault Hunter, running around Pandora, which is planet where basically every living creature wants you dead. Great combination of first person shooter with roleplaying game. It can't get repetetive with over a gazillion of weapons and shields you can find.Advantages - Great story, dialogues, epic backstory of every single character - Awesome sense of humor fullfils whole story perfectly - Graphics are original and stylish, unique map design can be seen everywhere - Long, differential gameplay full of boss battles and hundreads of enemy types - 4 players coop, one of the best designed of all games - Perfectly selected soundtrack and ideally voiced characters - Moxxi ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)Disadvantages - Easy to exploit many aspects of game - From time to time there are problems with loading textures / shadows / long distances even with good setup - Disappointing in-game radio, i was hoping for more awesome songs to listen - There is kind of ""need"" to do side quests as You will have troubles to beat monsters / bosses due to level differences if You will go on fully by story missionsIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!

												(Just humour me for a moment and pretend like you've somehow never heard of this game before) Hey, JacquesLeSauve, what's this Borderlands 2 game I keep hearing about?! Well, mister and/or miss random person gamer, since you ask!... Borderlands 2 is a first-person, co-op, loot-hunting shooter with RPG elements, and, it might surprise you to know, the sequel to Borderlands 1! (and technically the Pre-squeal, but that's kind of a grey area) Play through a lengthy campaign as one of four characters, each with their own unique abilities and upgradable skill trees to compliment those abilities. Complete quests, fight badasses, earn money, level up and explore the strange and wonderful world of Pandora, all the while searching for that hot new gun that's gonna seriously f*ck sh*t up and ruin everyone else's day. Sweet. The perfect antidote to an endless array of grey and brown shooters, this vibrant, cel-shaded style game refuses to take any part of itself seriously, save for the gameplay. Brimming with personality, it never misses a chance to hit the player with an off-colour joke or make fun of either itself or gaming in general, with a large portion of that magic being owed to the brilliant writing. The vast majority of characters fit into their roles perfectly and are expertly voiced as well, which is a huge breath of fresh air given how lacklustre the writing and acting can be in so many other games that have yet to learn how to feel natural or not completely chew up the scenery. OK, maybe the main villain is guilty of that heavy-handedness as he's so manifestly evil he goes beyond caricature or archetype and smacks of the creators trying way too hard to rile the player up and make them hate him. But even then he rarely outstays his welcome for too long. Gunplay is pretty much rock solid as everything feels like it behaves exactly the way it's supposed to, whether it's firing something big and heavy and primitive that makes a big boom, or something more elegant and finely balanced for those scalpel-like precision kills. Even reloading a weapon can feel immensely satisfying, between the reload animation itself or the nice, big clunking sounds of a clip being jammed into place... a sentence I never thought I'd hear myself say. Now I feel weird, like a freaky gun fetishist. Eurgh. But yeah, for a game all about shooting, this nails it for sure... even though I'm the type of player that likes to bring a knife to a gun fight. But either way, whatever you're into, this game has you covered. Speaking of having you covered, I really have to mention the online community. I'm not much one for online play typically, be it co-operatively or competitively, so not being massively familiar with it, I was a little apprehensive going into this, especially hearing horror stories about a few other communities, so I was expecting the worst. But I was really pleasantly surprised at just how nice and friendly and (mostly) competent the majority of other players seem to be. Sure, you'll occasionally get the odd palindromic loot tool come along and grab all the best gear for themselves, ignore other players in need, then talk cr*p about everyone else when no-one comes to their rescue. But in my experience most players here are incredibly nice and considerate and generous (I especially love the ""loot fairies"", players that randomly dropped into my game, threw a load of gear at my feet, then disappeared, never to be seen again) and many will happily chat with you if that's what you're into. I've even added some good people to my friends list off the back of this game. So if anybody's worried about that aspect of the game, they really needn't. If I had to make one major complaint about this it would be the opening. The bleak tundra setting of the first few hours really isn't very inviting or stimulating to the player and feels more like it should have been a mid to late game location rather than your introduction to the world, even for seasoned veterans of the first game. And, unfortunately, this is probably pretty unavoidable, given the nature of games where you have to level up, but you won't get any interesting gear for a while, either, and everything might initially feel really mundane for some players. But if you can push through it, then once you acquire newer, more interesting abilities and perks and expand your arsenal to include more exotic and outrageous gear, than that's when the game really starts to shine. So, with tons of replay value, between the multiple characters, two new game + modes and tons of additional DLC to purchase, whether you play this alone or with others, this is a game that should keep you busy and happy for a long, long time. So good is it, in fact, that after over 300 hours of play I'm still not tired of it and can't wait to see what they'll do for the third outing. Come get you one!			"

												First of all, I strongly recommend getting the Game of the Year edition if you can, for only a few bucks more during a sale, you get so much more DLC. If you don't get the GOTY edition, at least get the Tiny Tina DLC.The game is very cartoony and injects a lot of humor (sometimes dark) into the gameplay and dialogs. This game is a bit different from other FPSs in the sense that there are a lot of upgrades and level ups, and once you finish the main game, you can enter True Vault Hunter Mode, a harder version of the game where enemies are leveled up, and then again as Ultimate Vault Hunter mode, where enemies are even more scaled up. My only gripe with this game is that only legendary class weapons (the highest tier) become relevant later in the game, and you will pretty much sell/ignore all other drops, and there is no real money sink for you to spemd all your excess cash. Farming the legendaries can be brutal sometimes, where you can fight the same boss 100 times and still not receive a legendary drop. Still, I would rate this game as one of the top 3 games I've ever played.			"

												LIGHT THE FUSE BIT*HES!!!One of the best mix of FPS and RPG. Tons of enemies, guns and quests. The game will make you laugh after 5 minutes of playing, it has a lot of jokes, funny characters and easter eggs.If you player 1st borderlands you'll recognise a lot of characters from prev game including playable characters. Game supports co-op up to 4 players, while playing with friends will make game even more fun, with more players enemies become tougher and you'll get better loot.Game suits everyone who loves shooters, games with rpg elements and enjoys humor. Not recomended for those wants something more classic and straightforwart and doesn't like to spend a lot of time on customization, skills and leveling up.			"

												Borderlands 2 is a blast in co-op, and an improvement over its predecessor in almost every way, but still retains that lonely, barren feeling when played solo.  Missions and environments are more varied and interesting; classes, skill trees and weapons are more fun; PC-specific improvements including adjustable FOV, better gamepad compatibility etc. Vanilla vs vanilla it decimates the original Borderlands. There isn't as much enemy variety as I would've liked and, while the environments are more varied, they're still mostly limited to inherently barren environments (ice, desert, wastelands).  I would've liked to see more lush environments but perhaps this is being/will be addressed in the DLC.  There are minor bugs like your loot falling through the earth along with real problems such as inventory space being extremely limited, considering it's a loot game.  In spite of this, the game is polished and solid all the way through.One of the top quality games of the year; got the nasty taste of Diablo 3 out of my mouth. Highly recommended if you plan on co-op.			"

												There's GAJI♥♥♥♥TONILLION GUNS IN THE GAME.And all of them are ♥♥♥♥♥♥.That being said, this game's p good alone, but better if you have friends that'll consistently want to play at the same time as you. The only problem is if you want to play more than your friends, because then you'll get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off that you can't level up your dude without your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ friends, and then you'll make a character for solo play and one for friends play. But then one of your friends wants to play but he's a different friend then the other friend your were originally playing with so you have to make a third character to play with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ friend. But then the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ friend realizes by level 25 he doesn't like playing Siren or something, so he wants to be the Gunzerker, but then you get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off because you're already the Gunzerker and you're going ""wtf dude"". And then some other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ friend wants to play with you guys, so he makes a character and you guys wait for him to level up and catch up in the story so he can enjoy it playing the first time legitimately, but then when he finally catches up he doesn't want to play as much as you guys.Basically, if you're playing with this game with friends, you have to be as patient as Saint Teresa or you're going to want to cap a ♥♥♥♥♥ 24/7.Also Jack's an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.But overall it's still p good. Kinda grindy though later on.			"

												So, a few years after the FIRST Borderlands came out, I developed a deep hatred for it. I though it looked stupid. I still haven't played the first one to this day (I missed the sale), but I grabbed this mainly because a friend said we could play together (we have not since).But hey, part of what makes me LOVE this game so much is because SO many people still actively play it. I swear, every time I've started playing, and sometime during the session, one of my friends asks if they can join my game and/or I can join theirs. Some people don't intend on making me feel like a noob—though they do and I'm okay with it/don't say anything—but it's so fun! The game has the most unique online systems I've ever seen IN a video game, and everyone just has a ton of fun~The game itself is very similar to Bioshock (thanks 2K) in the means of shooting, crazy-♥♥♥ weapons (MUCH more so here) and looting. A LOT of looting. You could spend hours in the game literally making little progress, but looting EVERY container you can find, and there are plenty of secrets to find, too! I'm sure those secrets go with a few achievments, but again, if you don't want to spend hours...they're just achievemnts, dude; I know it's hard to resist, but it really can get tiring looting everything.The game's got a LOT of humor, and a LOT of unique storyteling/characters that help with that. It's an experience EVERYONE deserves to enjoy. And I feel bad I looked at this franchise the wrong way at first.			"

												I think I prefer BL 1 more then this, only because I like the simple features and easy to manage inventory and whatnot. But BL2 has slot machines, so that feeds my addiction to gambling very nicely. Everyone laughs at me when I try to not visit Moxxie's for the slot machines, so I like to make up funny excuses to why im there or lingering nearby lol. All in all, it's an alright game and will continue to play it until all the quests are complete. :)			"

												First time i tried Borderlands my first thought was ""humm its cool i guess, lot's of shooting and stuff"" 1 week later i was so happy with the game i bought Borderlands 2 and let me say it's the best game out there in my opinion i just love to play this x.x i've complete the main history over 10x and i still have fun since you have a 6 characters (including Mechromancer and Psycho dlc's) i have over 200hours of gameplay so yeah xD Anyway if you want to have a great time, lay with your friends, do awesome missions, trying new weapons and build you own skill tree this is the best game for you :) the graphics are really cool and the gameplay it's easy, i'll be honest my only complain was the driving since you have to control the car with your mouse, but in 2 days i got so used to it i don't even notice now Pros: - Lots, lots and lots of gameplay time.- Awesome missions and side missions with explosions, headshots, jumps and a great sense of humor- Different characters each one with their combat skills.- A insane ammount of weapons and items.- Skins (which sucks to be bought separetlly from GOTY)- Raid bosses- It has Claptrap so yeah buy it! Cons: -Not everyone owns this game :(11/10 i really, i repeat i really recommend this game!			"

												Borderlands 2: Probably the best game I've ever gotten from a friend. (Thanks [A.C.E] ACEALEC︻デ═一 for getting me this game) It combines the good parts of shooters, with an impressive, dark story, and also some amazing characters. I usually keep this stuff towards the end, but I'm gonna be honest with you: This is probably one of the finest games of last generation. To the review!GraphicsThe visuals were annoying at first and still are, but I began to grow into the comic styled visuals and then thought it looked great. However, some enemies had poor textures along with lots of the environment. The characters look great, the buildings look awesome, but the environments, many of the enemies (Not all, though. Some look great) have odd textures or look poorly done. When it comes to comic graphics, it's either a hit or a miss. I say Borderlands 2 was successful, but I can't say that it was out of the park good. Overall though, I like it.GameplayThe gameplay, which is tied for first as Borderlands 2's (BL2 for short) strong point, takes the ""good parts of shooters"" and along with countless loot, class combinations, several RPG elements, etc, and makes some strong gameplay. The gunplay is heated along with the special ability each class has, the fights are even more intense. All of the characters are pretty balanced, heck, even Axton (The Commando) is pretty balanced for a guy who has a sentry who does the work. However, since I used to play quite a bit of Salvador (The Gunzerker) seems a bit weak, His ability is good, but it isn't as useful as the Siren's, the Assassin's, and the others. He could use a small buff. Ironic, too. He actually did lots of steroids. Must be karma or something. Don't do drugs, kids! Oh wait, I'm getting off topic. Excuse me for that. Anyway, the vehicles in BL2 are good enough, but maybe a few more different vehicles would've been better. Either way, going around and running over Psychos is good fun. The world is large and there's lots to explore, too. I love this game's gameplay. StoryThe story was done right and makes most shooters look bad. It isn't top notch like Spec Ops: The Line (Which was also released in 2012) or Mass Effect (When a game has a better story than Mass Effect, you KNOW it's good) but it's able to satisfy me. The writing has a dark tone to it, but at the same time, there is some funny moments that try to cheer you up in the hostile world of Pandora. I'm not going to spoil it, but if you've played Borderlands 1, there will be a moment towards the end of the game where your heart will just break. There are some strong plot twists that greatly affect the story greatly and make the huge 90 degree turns worth it. The humor is a bit rushed, but I still laughed out loud many times. Claptrap and Handsome Jack are the two guys who basically lead the whole story. Claptrap is always funny, and even Handsome Jack is humorous a lot. However, Handsome Jack starts to show that this ""loving to hate him"" thing is really starting to kick in at a certain point in the game. He goes flat-out revenge and really makes him a strong character and also one of the best villains I've ever encountered in a video game, rivaling GLaDOS and others. The four main characters (and DLC characters, making it six) are all good, but again, Salvador is a bit one dimensional. Either way, don't underrestimate this game's story.AudioThe audio is great, and the voice actors did an outstanding job. Handsome Jack is definitely the strong point and is able to prove that he is a terrifying (yet awesome) villain. The music is great and fits in with the atmosphere perfectly. Not much to say other than Handsome Jack played his role well.ReplayabilityThe replayability, if it isn't obvious enough, is tied with the gameplay for the #1 strong point of the game. I'll try not to make this part too long, so yeah. Here we go: There are TONS of DLCs to buy, you can try to beat the game with another class, try another playstyle, help a few friends, get some new customizable skins, get the legendary weapons, find all the easter eggs, and lots, lots, lots, lots more. Should I say anything else to back up the fact this game has some pretty strong replayability? No? Good.VerdictIn the end, Borderlands 2 proves that it is one of the best shooters of last generation and is one of my personal favorite shooters now. It does something few shooters actually do, which is have a strong story. The great gameplay, amazing replayability, detailed characters, and funny writing all make this game a true masterpiece any shooter fan should have in their library. So, newbie Vault Hunters. Are you ready to go shoot, loot, and loot some more?Graphics- 7/10Gameplay- 9.5/10Story- 9.5/10Audio- 8/10Replayability- 10/10.:8.8/10:.+Amazing story+Outstanding gameplay+Unforgettable villain+Detailed characters+High replayability+Easily one of the best co-op games out there-Textures poorly done on occasion-More vehicle choices-Some rushed humor moments			"

												Borderlands was great, Borderlands 2 is just amazing. There are so many easter eggs, secrets and shout outs to movies that I likely will never find them all.  I played as the Hunter on 1, Zero on 2 as, I guess I am a distant sort and would rather take em out from so far off that the one next to them wonders where that came from.  But really the game play is very good, has many things to make you laugh, and some sad. BUY IT NOW! LOLEdit:I have 2,760 hours in now.  Time to add some infoAt the time I did this I had only played Zer0, with practice he is a force to be reckoned with.Now, I gravitate to Gaige, the Mechromancer because, anarchy forever LOL  Early play her ""pet"" Deathtrap is killer and helps a lot, once I get the skill close enough and the skill Anarchy things get interestingMaya, awesome support but a power house in her own right, cloud kill, baaahahahahahaa, phase lock.Axton, well rounded out solder type, not my fave but he is balanced pretty well.Krieg (Psycho class), for up close melee, this is on the edge of your seat fast paced action.  Once you unlock Release the beast, if you can work with it you can be a runway train.Salvador, the Gunzerker.  If you manage to get the right guns, class mod and relic, he is pretty much a tank.  So much so that some find him boring, I think he is fun but not my fave (see Mechromance above).If you get the GOTY + Ultimate Vault Hunter Upgrade pack 2 and the five head hunter packs you have it all, and I can honestly say hundreds of hours game playEven my least favorite of the four main campaign DLC (NONE are in the main story, they have their own stories and maps) is good, my fave (Tiny Tina's Attack on Draggonkeep, an AD&D inspired story) is awesome.The game has it's issues, but the good out weighs it by a lot.PhysX is badly implemented and appears to work better on old NVIDIA cards (from 2011) than new ones.  PhysX if not on low causes loot to fall through the floor/ground in some places as well as poor frame rate.If you are not trying to use PhysX the game can run on fairly low end hardware.Borderlands, is was/is a good game, but this one (Borderlands 2) in spite of it's problems is just an amazing game.  If you like ARPGs and FPS then I think you should give this one a go.			"

												I love borderlands 2. Great and kind of unique style of gameplay alongside great humor and over-the-top-action. Very entertaining if you play it with your friends in coop mode (the whole story can be played solo or in a team). A personal advice: If you play the story in coop, do it with someone, who actually wants to finish the game, it is so frustrating to start a run, just to stop it right in the middle.			"

												One of the most entertaining games I've ever played with and the FIRST game which really made me laugh.It's one thing that the game is beautiful, the story is more than decent, it's not just funny but rather hilarious, the looting is unbelievably rewarding, what is more the DLCs which provide extra stories are well worth the money, but what I liked the most that it's full with smart references to movies and music and lots of other stuff which I probably missed or just didn't understand. I found these references  - from Led Zeppelin until Twin Peaks - in the names of the achievements, missions, but you will also recognise a few stuff when your crazy enemies are running towards you and shouting in your face, or you just pass by somebody in the middle of nowhere and of course, you can find these in the main story too.Borderlands 2 is a lot of fun, especially with friends.

												I highly enjoy playing this game. I love games that have a leveling system and love the tree sets they have. It is nice that you can practically build your player in any way you want. I like that it also has escalating difficulty depending on how many people you have in your party. It is one of the games that you are always excited to find a chest of loot, not just, ""oh hey, a chest"". All the weapons have such a wide variablity that you can always find the best weapons that suit you fo the time being. The only thing I have bad against this game, is the time it can take to level, sometimes I would play for a long time and not get a level (this is like after level 40) and it can just get tedious with the amount of time. I only play this with friends now because it is significantly more fun with more people. The story is also amazing too, and the comedy bits are just pure genius. 9/10			"

												Exciting main story, numerous (this is understated, seriously) side quests, multi-playthroughs, overpowered levels (provided you have both UVH upgrades) and a neverending thirst for legendary loot... Six Vault Hunters come to Pandora not only to battle Handsome Jack the villian but more importantly also to find the best trash among all other trash and to farm kill Raid bosses (and son of Raid bosses) so many times even their great-grandchildren die from aging.

												The game that keeps on giving. Borderlands 2 is a loud, colourful mess of shooting, looting, idiocy and even more idiocy, and is one of the finest multiplayer experiences I know. It's made even more addictive by the extensive RPG elements.If you have Nvidia PhysX available, you ought to enable it because Gearbox have really made use of it in Borderlands 2. Fight scenes become a cacophonous rainbow of silliness that leave you craving more every time.They really missed a trick when it comes to weapons though. There are countless weapons in the game but they can't really be customised with scopes, suppressors or elemental effects. If you find a weapon, you can either take it or leave it. Here's hoping Borderlands 3 will address that issue and allow players to piece together the perfect loadout for their play style.If you are looking for realism in your shooters, try elsewhere, but if all you want is NGHGHHYEAHHH then Borderlands 2 is for you.

												It seems crass to judge a game by quantity, but this is quantity of quality. So if the amount of money you spend on games is a practical concern, it's worth saying that this one is freakishly good value. Even if it's not a concern, it's worth saying that this one is freakishly good.There's really only one conclusion to be made with Borderlands 2. Despite its flaws it really is some of the best co-op gaming you're likely to see in recent years, if you like piles of guns, lots to do and shoot, and a robust leveling system with a natural coop multi-player aspect and aren't put off by the cel shading, it's a no-brainer. 8½/10			"

												Just pick a few friends and enjoy hours of content that in its majority is basically looting and shooting, but still quite fun and entertaining. I only manage to do one playthrough (3 if you count that I beat it with the same character in the three different difficulties to reach max lvl) and have experience almost the enterity (not all) of the game and its dlcs, took me +150hr. Many people like to make fun of the story because you can play this game without caring much for it but I find it quite entertaining and charismatic. One of the strongest features of this game its the strange sense of humour, sometimes ridiculous and extreme and other times completely dark but that I particularly enjoyed. It's characters are yet another important point. I'll remember Handsome Jack as one of the most emblematic villains in videogame history, a lunatic you get to love and hate at the same time.			"

I must say that i had real blast while playing it. Not even sure when my steam counter jumped to over 100 hours in less then 1 month :). I really love it, Pandora is amazing place to explore. everywhere you go there's something completely new to discover. Scenery really changes between zones, they put lots of work into them. I only wish zones would level with me, some quests were simply too easy as i came back to them after a while. other then that, perfect game			"

												I've been a long follower on the Borderlands series, and I am personaly proud of this game, overall. There is hundreds of hours of gameplay, not to mention there is 6 characters to play, and in Borderlands 1 there is only 4, not a big ""over the top"" peice in the game as a hole, but still, it's cool. Lastly, I absolutely love the ""playthrough"" system. It makes it where you can play the stories and DLC once again, making the game have more and more hours. Once again, all of the borderlands are amazing, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone thinking about getting it.			"

My biggest complaints about Borderlands 1 were the interface issues on PC, and nearly all of those are solved in BL2. The only minor issue I have with BL2 is the inventory management. Bulky, and clunky navigation, but that is only a very minor side note on an otherwise fantastic game! The coop play really makes this game shine! Single player is fun, but playing with friends is what this game was meant for. 10/10			"

												Borderlands 2 is a big game. The sprawling cooperative shooter has arrived, delivering long hours of shooting, looting, and butt jokes. Well, almost intact. Game design changes, like changing the enemy death animations, do a good job of cutting corners while preserving the core action. Technical shortcomings, however, leave little doubt that this is the lesser version of Gearbox's great sequel. Dialogue and sound effects frequently sound flat and occasionally disappear, while the frame rate often slows down in combat and makes the chaotic action feel unwieldy.Combat in Borderlands 2 is naturally a bit floaty and loose, largely due to way player movement and enemy behavior are paced. As a result, it can accommodate the small degree of control imprecision added by the touchscreens and be none the worse for it. Likewise, the smaller range of motion of the analog sticks may cause some making the PC/console transition to balk a bit, and indeed, aiming can initially feel ungainly if you're used to the game on other platforms. After you adjust the aim sensitivity and spend some time wandering the wastelands, however, the mercenary satisfactions of long-range headshots and up-close bullet barrages are well within reach.Pros:Its a good game +Long story +wide variety of guns +Large World +Cons:You have to be on the same level to play together (in some cases only) (Multiplayer)Character skills menu is broken (Skills menu)In skills menu Main Protagonist is invisible, sometimes loads after some mins (Skills menu)My ratings,8.5/10 :)			"

												What can i say about this game. I Can't stop playing it. I already had this game on PS3 with around 200 hours on there, and when it came on sale on steam i couldn't resist. An FPS/RPG/Co-op game, you can play with your friends, play single player, or play online, and i can guarantee you won't get bored. Thousands of weapons leaves choices open to how you want to play, and with 6 utterly different classes to choose from, there are a number of awesome, fun ways to play.I had bought Borderlands 1 a few months after it came out and played it for many hours, completeing the game on 2 characters, and i enjoyed it so much, when i saw that they were releasing Borderlands 2 i honestly thought that it couldn't get any better. Well they made it better all right. If you have have played number 1 or if you havn't then i still highly recommend this game.The storyline is brilliant, funny, and a lot of fun. Some of the characters are hilarious and brilliantly thought out, and the story will keep you laughing all the way. The graphics and excellent, with a mix of cartoony and realism all mixed in, much like Borderlands 1. The gameplay is also fantastic, with so many different ways to kill enemys and different playstyles. One of the best games i have ever played.10/10 from me, highly recommend!			"

												This game is truly incredible. Simply put: This is one of the most finely crafted pieces of media that I have ever played in my life. Get the game of the year edition for sure - it's easily worth it, even if you don't believe it now, you will and you will regret not getting it all at once. xD The only negative I have for the game is how its final of three leveling modes, Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, almost completely requires you to play with other people unless you have the most overpowered gear and the like... Despite this: The game is amazing. The price of around 30 bucks? for the game of the year edition is so worth it: and if you get it on sale for like 8 bucks like I did... There is literally no better usage of your money in terms of gaming. :)			"

												Borderlands 2 like its predecessor is a role playing shooter. You begin your adventure as the victim of train sabotage by Handsome Jack. And awaken from catastrophe relatively unscathed at the feet of Claptrap. Claptrap eventually leads you to resistance against Handsome Jack, led by the original four characters from Borderlands. The story has seen improvement over the original. The quality writing as a whole has drastically increased from first insulation, but it’s made not for story structure but in the dialog as well. From the dialog alone, I predict that Handsome Jack will start appearing top 10 favorite villain list over the internet sometimes soon. He has a great personality, his funny human and ultimately very very evil.The journey will rack you-in over 30 hours to complete the main quest line. That’s if you don’t do any side missions, go off exploring, team up with friends and their games. Borderlands 2 is a time enthralling but I mean the most enduring way possible. No matter if you catch the game on sale or if you pay full price, you will get your money’s worth. It’s jam packed with quality content from start to finish. If I use the term “finish” likely because once you complete the main quest, you can play thru the entirely game again against harder and more diverse enemies that drop more elaborate guns and gear pushing you seemingly temporary cap of level fifty. In that regard, Borderlands 2 is like an MMO but one you only experience with friends and strangers if you want to. Teaming up with your friends and strangers is as easy as flickering on light switch. Cooperative gameplay not only exponentially increases the fun factor with your friends, but it also causes the game to spawn tougher enemies and better loot. There are plenty of bad-♥♥♥ awards, permanent perks for performing various in-game task that can only be achieve with help from your friends.Graphically, Borderlands 2 has seen a significant facelift over the original but still uses the same art style. I ran on several different graphics but somehow hard time pushing few of the games more fantastic effects when there was tons of actions on the screen. But all in all, I am very pleased that way the game performed. I experienced very few crashes and my connectivity issues were hammered out by the third day of gameplay. The varied locations grade from deserts, to rocky mountain ranges, to green steps, to snowy wastelands, to urban environments and industrial complexes located in the world’s harshest terrain. You’ll be fighting classic enemies like skag, rakk and pyscho but there is also nice variety of new beast, malcontents and machines.Getting from point A to Z in Borderlands 2, can be done either by foot, car or fast travel stations. Considering the massive size of the entire world, you’ll be happy for any type of transportation after a particularly grew some firefight session. It is important to note that driving cars on PC, takes some getting used to. But most of all, I am slightly disappointed to see that enemies clearly have air superiority over you with transforming robots and buzzard drop ships. This isn’t necessarily negative mark against Borderlands 2 or a side note. I really really want to fly those buzzards around in the available areas within Pandora. Despite everything I love about Borderlands 2, it definitely has an ugly side to it. Unfortunately, it comes from the multiplayer. Joining cooperative games which I haul hardly recommend on doing. It can have some massively negative repercussions to your single player experience. You can miss entire chunks of the storyline and game important unlocks by hopping on with players who are only few levels ahead of you depending where you are in the game. Even though Borderlands 2 offers a system to counter this possibility, it’s not 100% effective. And sadly, there is no Replay Mission option available which could potentially resolve this issue entirely.I love Borderlands 2 and truly love it. Certainly, there are few dense in the hall but all in all its exemplary experience from start to finish whether you play along or with friends. I can easily say one of the best cooperative games I’ve played this generation and easily one of my favorite first person shooter as well.  "

												This game, despite not having better graphical quality than other RPG games, it is one of the best games I've played. The fact that the game's setting which takes place in the years 5252 does not convince me much about the technological advancement as compared to the present (other than the fact that you can download your own vehicle from any catch-a-ride machine), but Gearbox's most famed game is not just an awesome game, it's beyond that. There are 3 playthrough modes, 6 characters to play on, and thousands of different variants of weapons to choose from. And then there are unique weapons, which signifies that these weapons will act in a unique way upon being fired, rather than just having its bullets fired in a straight line. Normal Mode was relaxing and enjoyable, TVHM was more intense, and UVHM (including the Overpower levels) is tougher and is recommended for hardcore gamers. I could go on, but this is truly an awesome, must-play game. Hats off to the game developers.			"

												Important information for first time borderlands players--The GOTY edition comes with all 4 campaign DLC, 2 playable character DLC and ONE of the level cap upgrade DLC (UVHM pack 1 specifically). This means that all GOTY players will have a level cap of 61.-If you want full immersion, I recommend you purchase the GOTY and then UVHM Pack 2: DIgistruct peak separately. This increases your level cap to 72 and gives access to 8 OP levels which you could research about.-The 5 Headhunter packs do NOT offer new weapons, but each are worth a couple hours of content and are still fun to play around with for their price if you want the complete intended experience.-The game itself is amazing and is regarded as an essential title according to many gamers.

												Borderlands 2 is cross between an RPG regarding the story and a FPS for the action and levelling system.With randomly generated guns, shields, class & grenade mods, the variation of equipments is staggering, much like the enemies.From Psycho Midgets holding shotguns bigger than them (that have the most hilarious lines ever written), robots with everything from pistols to nukes, local wildlife that can lob cars at you or tunnel underground and appear with a fiery explosion and a swarm of tentacle like arms to various boss's & a hole host of creatures, humans & AI mechs, under, on or above the surface of Pandora. Which by the way is a beautifully place.The environment ranges from glaciers, valleys, deserts, roaming hills, caverns, towns & with the expansions even more including a vast landscape produced by a 13year old explosives genius mind, Tiny Tina. A character I hope you will come to love as most of us have.The main story is brilliant and take you all over Pandora. You can play solo or with up to 3 others, from 1 of 4-6 (DLC dependant) Vault hunters. All with unique abilities, and skill trees that can be changed throughout the game to suite your play style & equipment. The vast number of optional side missions can provide some very nice loot, insights into the life & history of Pandora or just a good laugh.The main DLC's (Psycho, Mechromancer, Ultimate Vault Hunter Upgrades 1 & 2, Mr. Torgue's, Sir Hammerlock's, Captain Scarlett & best of all Tiny Tina's) are all worth the coin, the head hunter packs are ok, and the skins are all superficial. But to be fair now the GOTY Edition is out id just get that, then you have the lot, it's so worth it. I'm on 1000+ hours and still coming back to it.Edit: Spelling10/10			"

												I've put a lot of time into this game, as well as Borderlands 1.  This is an insanely fun shooter that I just do not get bored with; even after all this time I can re-start with a half-completed character, or start anew, and find myself having a blast again.

												Great game that combines fun gameplay with fun characters. It is really enjoyable, however, at the top levels (first cap was 50, now it's 72 - you need UVH upgrades 1 and 2) it is hard to beat bosses alone, not sure if more people are needed but it seems impossible to go on alone. Either way, good game and always fun to play with some friends.			"

												Borderlands 2 puts you into the shoes of new sets of Vault Hunters who've come to Pandora because of Handsome Jack , the villian of this game. Right over from the beggining you get to Choose from A commando , siren, gunzerker or an Assassin , the characters from the First borderlands appear but they aren't playable.This game is literally HUGE and is worth 200+ hours of gameplay. The guns you get are totally random and effective against enemies.I give it 9/10 as there are small bugs in it.			"

												Shooting games aren't usually my cup of tea but then there's Borderlands. The first game was a game that I sunk a large number of hours into (steam lies) because of how much fun it offered, Borderlands 2 takes everything that the first game has to the next level and adds even more.The characters in the game have amusing dialogue that is rather funny and interesting, each has a different style and a unique personality, whether it's Cl4P-TP, Scooter, Handsome Jack or any of the many other character you'll encounter throughout the many adventures on Pandora.While missions are usually to kill other creatures there's still a large diversity and I never felt that I was doing the same thing except for maybe some of the missions in the Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt DLC.The game offers a number of DLCs and while that could be bad practice I have to give them credit for at least 2 of the main DLCs: Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty, and Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep for being excellent (I can even go as far as saying that Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is beyond excellent and because of it Borderlands 2 is now my favorite game). Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage DLC is good fun, and Sir Hammerlock’s Big Game Hunt has its strong points but has some bad ones as well.The game provides an interesting story line as opposed to its predecessor in addtion to connecting it to what little of story the first one did. There are moments of pure nostalgia for Borderlands fans, as well as plenty of easter eggs and references to all kind of different games, movies, and TV shows that kept me smiling throughout the game.The game has very high replayability value, aside from 6 unique classes each class can be played in many different styles thanks to the massive number of different weapons and skills combinations, and the addition of the badass rank and badass tokens with the large collection of challenges, it also helps that the scenery and lighting ingame are impressive and beautiful to look at. Exploring everything and taking my time to finish most challenges I already have over 100 hours on a single character and I'm not yet done with all the DLCs on the Normal Mode, I still have many more hours before I even start True Vault Hunter Mode and Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode on that character alone.

												This game is absolutely awesome.  Highly recommended 10/10.I originally had this on Xbox 360, but the Xbox was always being used by someone else.  I didn't get far in the game when I first got it, but I knew even then that I loved it and would eventually get back to it.  Having a chance at Second Wind when you lose all your health, keeps you on the edge of your seat - just one more kill quick, and then away you go again.Quirky, humorous, intense, and immensely fun!.......... and did I say ""Bazillions of Guns""I definitely say join Shift for the Golden Keys, and the GOTY edition certainly has it's advantages!The Co-op play is a great part of this game, giving up to 4 friends a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon together. Did I say that you get to shoot lots of stuff - trust me, they're all asking for it!Buy it now, play it, and you'll know what I mean and agree - top game!			"

												When I first saw Borderlands I thought: this is not my cup of tea. But guess what, when something goes on sale it gets more attractive so yeah, i bought it for a ridiculously low price and gave it a chance.The game is quite repetitive, the ""million weapons"" exist only in stats (really unsatisfying) but the game is still not boring for some reason. The ""story"" was something I did not care about (which is surprising because mostly the story is the reason why I pick up a game), many people say it's awesome but for only few character was interesting so this game was a ""shooter"" for me. The voice acting, sounds and music is great in this game alongside the world. Also, the UI is pretty great as well but most people don't give a thought on this one.Ohh, and this game does the ugliest thing in the FPS history: spawning enemies in the back. That was so so so o frustrating, I was like ""not again..."" for almost the whole game. After almost 70 hours I left the game with the feeling of incompletion (even though I finished every main and side mission) and frustration. I played through because I thought I'll feel that good feeling when you complete a game, but there was nothing, just emptiness.I have mixed feelings about recommending this game but it definately worth a try, it can be interesting for a while and it's pretty fun with friends.

												If you don't mind beating the main story and selected quest (with best rewards) over and over and over again (though each time with higher difficulty, with opportunity for rarer loot, more skill points or just starting a completely different character), grinding for best loot available, take on raid bosses or simply have a fully supported co-op (up to 4 players) experience, the game's definitely for you. It might become a bit challenging on UVHM difficulty (3rd playthrough) for some so just remember to spam special abilities often and slag enemies as frequent as possible. Optionally, take advantage of skill/gear guides or better yet - beat this mode cooperatively. Grab the GOTY edition on Steam sale (roughly €10) + UVH Upgrade 2 for the most badass experience ever!

 Borderlands 2  Borderlands 2 is the sequel of the same name but quite telling the different stories. In the game we can play as one of four main characters: Salvador (gunzerker), Maya (siren), Zero (assasin) and Axton (commando). Each of these characters has a different special skills, abilities and use different types of weapons. In the game, we will have to visit the various places of the mysterious planet Pandora. During the game we will fight a fight between different monsters, bandits or Hyperian forces but our biggest enemy is Handsome Jack. We also assign a fight with a bit more more powerful enemies and bosses are more precisely. In the game, we have a lot of weapons from pistols to rocket launchers. Our heroes can change the skin. Fields after whose will also move us are very large. The game has a very pretty graphic and very good sound. Creators also offer cooperative mode for a four people and a very nice DLC packages which adds many hours of fun. I highly recommend this game, gameplay is a very funny. My final rating is 9/10.  "

												Borderlands 2 attempts to step up from the first game, but in the end they don't deviate much from the original setup. There's guns, loot, ridiculous characters, and EXPLOSIONS.One thing I enjoyed, is that this game is just a heck of a lot more FUN. The voiceovers are great, some of the characters will bust your gut (Torque and Tiny Tina), and the ongoing lines from Jack always tow the line between seriously-going-to-kill-you and I-need-to-crack-a-joke territory.The controls and gameplay are solid once again, and I had a relatively bug free experience on the PC. If you are an achievement hound, get ready for a few achievements that will drive you batty. The Challenge Accepted achievement takes more time to complete than the main campaign does, but man does it feel good to land it.My biggest complaint with the Borderlands series continues to be with how stinkin' easy the game is. Yes, they added Ultimate Vault Hunter mode and made the baddies better (also the overleveling DLC), but I'm concerned with the original campaign. I want my first playthrough to be challenging. It took me all of a minute to defeat the final boss on my first playthrough, do you know how unsatisfying that is? Instead of building the game around a pre-set structure of levels for opponents, why not structure the first playthrough where all enemies level up with you? Nothing is worse than coasting through the final mission while shooting a gun that's ten levels above your worst enemy.Overall, it's a game that's very fun to play and has reasonable replay value, but you won't find many surprises here if you played the first.

Summary (TL;DR)This game is the peak of the series, bringing in new and refreshing characters while letting you work alongside the original four from Borderlands 1. With this installment of the game, Co-op is even more fun now with new vehicles, weapons, and enemies to hunt down, along with characters old and new being introduced and reintroduced to the story. The game also often questions your morality... but you will have to play to learn more about that.Pros Fun gameplay Original Graphics Great storyline Co-op doesn't feel like everything is too easy Claptrap is as annoying as ever Great character skill trees High replay valueCons Many ""filler"" missions Skill trees can't be fully completed, even WITH the DLC level cap raise. Missions can get annoying if you aren't at the right level for the area.Rating8/10			"

												4 Stars - A colourful shooter with strong co-op functionality.This was my first entrant to the Borderlands games and I was impressed. Although not the most precise shooter this game was a lot of fun. The core game plays through a loose storyline that can be solo or co-op. Weapons are regularly looted and can be quite diversive, enabling the player to find a combo that suits.The borderlands is humoursly filled with pyscho's (good and bad) as well as a plethora of dangerous natural inhabitants and the over-arching presence of Jack who plays the key villian role (well).Overall I found the co-op play through of this to be very satisfying and I recommend giving it a go.Pros -Co-OpArt design / Plot aspects / World atmosphereWeapon DesignCons - The loot generator will throw out some guns that are just crap and these should be avoidedGun specs can mislead the player as guns appear more about fit than numbers. Over analysing weapon choices may distract from game play			"

												Borderlands 2 is a very mixed bag. At times, it can be incredibly fun, as you unload shotgun pellets into Psycho Midget faces and throw buzz axes at a Goliath's head. At other times, it can be an incredibly tedious game as you backtrack from place to place and are forced to perform some infurating timed quests. The same can be said for its juvenile sense of humor. At times, it can be a very funny game, but at plentyof other times, you'll groan at how dumb a joke was or how awful a reference was. Let's get the biggest issue out of the way first. This game is terribly boring in the first couple of hours. You barely have any variety in combat, you have very few and very weak weapons, and you don't really have any interesting quests. It's a slog through the campaign until you get enough skill points in your character to make the game fun. For example, in my playthrough as Krieg the Psycho, it was a boring experience until I got enough points in cooldown reductino to let me spam my active ability freely. And on that note, we look at another big flaw of Borderlands 2: the skill tree. Every character gets only one active skill, such as being able to dual wield guns, turn invisible, or summon a giant mech of death. While this improves the variety of combat greatly at first, you don't get any of the more interesting or game changing abilities until your character is at a very high level (31 or more). Until then, you're stuck with (mostly) boring percentage stat boosts that barely affect your playstyle. To the game's credit, there are a hanful of interesting skills that do change how you play significantly, but there aren't enough of them. If there was more than one active skill, then the skill tree would be a little more tolerable, but as it stands, it's a grind to get the skills that you actually want. Next on the chopping block is the music and gun sounds. The guns, more often than not, sounds incredibly weak. You often feel like you're firing a peashooter, not a quad barreled shotgun. It's all incredibly underwhelming, to be honest. The music is fine, but it does a very poor job of pumping your adrenaline. That is, the music never helps you feel like the badass that the game wants you to be. My next major complaint is the loot system, in that it's not very good. There are some interesting weapons and drops, but more often than not, you'll get crappy guns that you'll just throw away because they're too weak or underleveled. This wouldn't be so bad if guns scaled to your current level, but since they don't, you'll be getting a lot of trash in proportion to useful equipment. Also, the performance of this game is not very consistent. At times, I can get 120 FPS no problem, but when I turn 180 degrees, it become a quarter of what it was a second ago. After trying numerous engien tweaks and reducing graphical fidelity, not much improves the performance of this game (I run a 780 Ti, so it's a very capable rig). It's not a dealbreaking, but it is very annoying.  Finally, the story is very threadbare, despite Gearbox's efforts to improve it this time around. The entire story can be summed up to: Handsome Jack is a ♥♥♥♥, go kill Jack. I mean, the story does its job in getting you from place to place and ferrying you to a wide variety of locales, but it really isn't anything memorable. So, now onto the good. The combat can be really fun late game when your character is properly specced out. Having a maxed out Mania tree in Krieg is a blast as you one shot enemies with your melee weapon or snipe them from afar with your thrown buzz axes. You'll eventually get some interesting guns that have some very powerful effects that mesh with your playstyle or change it up. Co-op is pretty seamlessand allows you to drop into and out of a friend's game quickly. Enemies will become tougher, and loot will become better, so it's definitely the way to play if you have a couple of good buddies. The voice acting, in general, is very well done. Solid deliveries by the cast all around, and there are some very well delivered lines (pretty much anything by Handsome Jack is well voiced, for example). There really aren't any characters that get get on your nerves, unless you find Ashley Burch's voice grating. Finally, the game can be incredibly funny in its own stupid way. If you embrace the cheese of the game and accept stupid jokes like ""bonerfarts"", then you're going to have a good time. However, it should be known that this game relies entirely on crass humor, so if you don't like that sort of thing, you will not enjoy the humor whatsoever. So, in conclusion, Borderlands 2 is a very slow burner because of its poor skill tree and loot system, but it picks up later on in the game as you get more interesting loot and skills. It's definitely great as a co-op game, but it's a fun experience too if you play solo.			"

												Hello Newest Vault Hunter!I am Phoenix and I'm here to review a great game called ""Borderlands 2"". Borderlands 2 is the sequel to the game Borderlands (No ♥♥♥♥ Phoenix). Borderlands 2 has a LOT of guns, shields, class mods, grenades, and relics. most guns are normal but the rest have cool abilities, Have u ever shot a gun that fires 3 small grenades at once? you have? Well then have you ever shot an assault rifle that has a Mini-gun Barrel? A ♥♥♥♥ING MINI-GUN BARREL. Have you ever had a shield that absorbed enemies bullets and allowed you to add it to your ammo count? No? Then BAM. Plus ACTION SKILLS, Action skills allows your character to  turn the tide of the battle. Have you ever thrown a turret out? yes? well have you ever gone into a murderous gunblazing rampage where you shoot 2 guns instead of one, Pick up someone from the battefield with some sort of magic, gone invisible with a decoy shot out, went out on a murdererous rampage and killed everyone with an axe that holds a buzz saw, and have you ever deployed a murder bot? No. But you can in borderlands! However be careful because almost everything alive wants to kill you, plants and animals. However you are the badass who is going to kill them all just for fun. Btw the is an evil corp. hunting for treasure the same one your after. The CEO wants to kill you Badly. Like I said your the badass who is going to kill him and take the loot. Good luck Vault Hunter.			"

												4 Stars - A colourful shooter with strong co-op functionality.This was my first entrant to the Borderlands games and I was impressed. Although not the most precise shooter this game was a lot of fun. The core game plays through a loose storyline that can be solo or co-op. Weapons are regularly looted and can be quite diversive, enabling the player to find a combo that suits.The borderlands is humoursly filled with pyscho's (good and bad) as well as a plethora of dangerous natural inhabitants and the over-arching presence of Jack who plays the key villian role (well).Overall I found the co-op play through of this to be very satisfying and I recommend giving it a go.Pros -Co-OpArt design / Plot aspects / World atmosphereWeapon DesignCons - The loot generator will throw out some guns that are just crap and these should be avoidedGun specs can mislead the player as guns appear more about fit than numbers. Over analysing weapon choices may distract from game play			"

Honestamente, no esperaba que me gustara y enganchara tanto, ya que la primer parte me pareció un bodrio totalmente repetitivo.Las clases son 5 si tenés el DLC, cada una con varios builds diferentes que, al menos en el caso de Zer0 que fue a quien elegí por ser ultra badass, te cambian totalmente el gameplay.El loot es altamente extenso, los entornos son muy variados, las quests no son siempre la misma ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pinchada en un palo, el argumento está muy bueno y el humor está siempre presente, cosa que me encanta.El juego sin DLC's es muy completo, los mismos AGREGAN cosas, no es algo capado del contenido original, así que si no te da el cuero para todo, comprate la versión pelada que vale cada centavo debido a su calidad y duración.

												I love Borderlands 2. It is one of the most addictive games I've played in a long time. It by itself is a good 100 hours of gameplay and with all the extra content and characters it adds a good couple hundred more hours right there. Not to mention the raid bosses and hunting for legendary weapons and farming. It is well worth your purchase!			"

												A combination of first person shooter and role playing game, Borderlands 2 is an addictive mix of genres that will suck away thousands of hours of your time. The cell shading art style is different - but beautiful - and can be removed with a minor tweak in the config files if you want to take it off for a small increase in performance. Removing the cell shading does not detract from the beauty of the game, just changing it slightly.The storyline, voice work, and pace of the game are all fantastic. And I loved the humour and subtle (and some not so subtle) jokes throughout. Not much else can be said about it without giving too much away.I would highly recommend purchasing the Game Of The Year edition and playing through the game as each of the characters to explore the differing fight mechanics that come with them. Go in guns blazing as a Gunzerker, or sneak in as an Assassin; the choice is yours. There are a few more characters and others ways to deal with enemies, and those methods will keep you busy for a long time in this game as you explore the world anew each time.Although many of the side quests are not mandatory, they are recommended to be completed to gain experience to be able to progress through the story missions without having to empty hundreds of rounds of ammo into enemies. If you try to run through the story as fast as possible, you will find yourself coming across enemies many levels above your own, and you will die, a lot.If you like first person shooters, you'll like this game. If you like 4 player co-op with friends, you'll like this game. And if you want a game that provides a lot of content that is good value for money, you'll like this game (GOTY Edition, anyway).			"

												You have to reeeeeeeeeeeeeally love Borderlands to get the most out of this one. Otherwise you just get sick of it relatively quickly like I did. Even still, you may think you love Borderlands a lot after playing the first one, and think you'll really love this one too, and then realize that maybe you don't like it as much as you thought.Objectively speaking, everything about BL2 is better than the first. It's incredibly polished, loaded with content, easier to play with friends (or strangers), highly replayable (that is, if you reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally love Borderlands). So much improvement, but just not as addicting. Exploring is pointless because there's nothing to find, and the only good weapons come from grinding bosses. I just couldn't get hooked like I did on the first one.Mostly fun while it lasted, but I'm so bored of it all, and it's feeling like a chore just forcing myself to finish the last (and apparently best) DLC. The humor is enjoyable too, I suppose, but it quickly becomes predictable.All in all, I'm in a strange place with this recommendation. If I could go back in time and tell myself not to get it and that I wouldn't enjoy it as much, past-me wouldn't believe future-me and would still buy this game and it's DLC anyway. I can't say I regret the 107 hours spent playing this game, but I can't say it was time well spent either.Curiosity satisfied, Borderlands hunger satiated, that's it for me. Thanks Gearbox and 2K, but I won't be getting BL3.			"

												When I got this game, I played about 10 minutes and got bored. A while later, I picked up the game again to give it a second try and played it all the way through, putting in about 45 hours as of this review.Honestly, this is an amazing game. It is very hilarious, with an amazing cast of people voicing the different characters throughout the game, and is LOADED with easter eggs. Even though this is a comedy-style game with somewhat of a dark humor aspect to it, the story still managed to bring a few tears to my eyes, being surprisingly emotional. Plus, there are sidequests galore that add lore to the game and give you some pretty sweet items.			"

												Kill, loot, buy stuff with loot, use stuff to kill more...loot again.That's basically Borderlands. I was honestly never a fan of the first one. I found it bland and repititive and preferred games like Diablo if I wanted a non-stop lootfest. Borderlands 2 changes much of the sense of tedium with a story with actual stakes as well as humerous writing.The game can get dull quite fast, however, without friends to play it with. This is definately a Co-Op game.			"

												You are not in Kansas anymore. You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen. Respect that fact every second of every day. If there is a Hell, you might wanna go there for some R & R after a tour on Pandora. Out there beyond that fence every living thing that crawls, flies, or squats in the mud wants to kill you and eat your eyes for jujubes. We have an indigenous population of humanoids called the Psycho's. They're fond of saws that are dipped in their enemies blood. Those blades will stop your heart in one minute - and have brains equal to a bowl of mush. They are very easy to kill. As a random vault hunter, it is my job to keep you revived. I will not succeed. Not with all of you. If you wish to survive, you need to cultivate a strong lack of moral sense.			"

												Borderlands 2. Wow. If this game knocked my socks off, it sure as heck will do that to you as well. As a fan from the Borderlands series, you might be expecting a fanboy review. But nope, it's actually that year. Buy it. Buyyyy it. Buyyyyyyyy it.PROS:+ Great Storyline, plot twists, etc. + You've heard this a billion times.....SO MANY WEAPONS AND POSSIBILITES (Shields too, if you're into that stuff)+ Intresting visuals that give it a comic feel.+ Exploration! You will be rewarded!+ Multiple ways to dress up your character! + Fun side quests and characters! You'll meet some crazy awesome people on Pandora.+ Guns! Did I mention that?+ ACTUALLY FUN DLC. (Just stay away from Hammerlock's Hunt. That sucks. Bad.)CONS:-Graphics and textures are just a little outdated-Patches now and then to get rid of exploits-Some not so fun, long, missions (The Bane)Overall, if you hadn't played the first game,  THAT'S OK  It features characters from the first game, but there is nothing to miss, as of the start of the game it gives you a quick gist of the first borderlands, and what happens now.9.5/10. Easy saying it when I've came back for the  *7th time and beat it.*Number subject to change. I always come back for this game.			"

												This is more of an addictive hobby than a game.  Take the old Doom games, update the graphics with a cartoony look and then throw in a great story and some RPG elements and you have Borderlands 2.  The loot in the game is maybe the most addictive feature, the items you acquire can be great but they loose their luster (and power) as you level up so you are constantly searching for better gear and items... this leads to playing the game in search of legendary items (loot midgets anyone?) at higher and higher levels.  Each character can play through the game three times (more really, since you can reset your progress in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, if you get that far) and with all the DLC available for this game, that means hundreds of hours of gameplay.  If you're an addict of the game like me, get all the DLC for it including the headhunter stuff because it all contributes to the greatness of Borderlands 2.  I've mainly played as Gaige but I've also tried out the Gunzerker too.  I've sunk over 200+ hours into the game as of the writing of this review and I'm still looking forward to playing as the Siren and the Psycho.  Be warned... if you get into the this game, I mean really get into it, you'll have a long stay on Pandora and the real world will become a serious nuisance because it will limit your ability to play Borderlands 2.

												The game is set 5 years after the original Borderlands, on the planet Pandora. Handsome Jack, the leader of the Hyperion Corporation (Borderlands 2's main antagonist), claimed responsibility for the opening of the vault and the killing of The Destroyer which the four original vault hunters; Roland (Soldier), Lilith (Siren), Brick (Berserker) and Mordecai (Hunter) {The original vault hunters are NPCs in Borderlands 2} had done under guidence from ""Guardian Angel"". Handsome Jack declared himself dictator of Pandora.You play as a new group of Vault Hunters; Axton (Commando), Maya (Siren), Zer0 (Assassin), Salvador (Gunzerker), Gaige (Mechromancer) and Krieg (Psycho) {Note - The Mechromancer and Psycho classes are DLC and have to be brought}. The new vault hunters are tasked with killing Jack and restoring order back to Pandora.The game itself is a First-Person Role Playing Shooter, It relies heavily on loot, the game is all about grinding to become a god, getting to the highest level and getting the best gear, Co-Op is a huge part in Borderlands and makes the game 20x more fun with otters. Borderlands 2 has good comedy in it too, just silly little things that make you laugh.Borderlands 2 is really good!, it is really fun with some friends and with all the DLC that is out, you will have hours and hours of fun.

												What a fantastic game!  While the experience is much better if you can round up a couple of friends, this game is still very much enjoyable as a single player experience.  I have easily logged over 100+ hours on this game on console, both as single player and as multiplayer.  Combining the fast paced action of a first person shooter with the addictive nature of leveling and loot finding from an rpg, Borderlands 2 is a new beast altogether.  Add in a competent story and this game will suck you in for dozens of hours.  Even if you're not a big shooter fan I would say give this a try, as it relies less on twitch gaming and more on planning and strategy.  With multiple classes that play differently, this is a game that you could easily play through more than once.  Solid controls and soundtrack only add to the experience.  Overall, this is one of the best gaming experiences you can have this generation.  I give this game a 9/10.			"

												This game is filled with awful dialouge made by a bisexual man who wears dresses.... this is the exact reason you should buy this game. It's honestly one of my all time favorite games, corny ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jokes, gameplay is creative, and well, it's a great time for you and friends to just ♥♥♥♥ around and have a good time. It can be competive at times though due to the whole shoot and loot aspect.  You have to be there before everyone else but you also have to work together to beat some bossesand enemies. I've beaten this game hell about 8 times? It's still one of my favorite games/ stories. The gameplay can be glitchy at times but it will work with you.  I recommend GOTY, the dlc is ♥♥♥♥ except the tiny tina assualt on dragon keep, but its worth the experience and new guns added in with the dlc.  It is a very rewarding game except with farming bosses or mini bosses for the legendary/pearlescent/unique weapons in the game. But other then that it doesn't get to repeatative but you NEED to take breaks because eventually drags along like a dog with no back legs. Definitly worth the 40 bucks, totally time consuming, ONLY PLAY WITH FRIENDS. 10/10 best review ever			"

												Fun with friends.  I am big into stories, and the story in this game is kinda just background.  Playing online, other players would often interrupt the story bits, so I would miss important plot points.  I will likely just play through this game once.  The community is great, most players are very helpful.  This is a great way to meet people online.  If you are in to twitch shooters and loot, then check this out.			"

												Borderlands is about having a ridiculous variety of guns, and killing many, many things with them.  Borderlands 2 is also about that, but also about killing all of those things in multiplayer.  With enemies forever scaling to be just above your level, Borderlands 2 is more difficult to play solo than the first game was.  It's still a lot of fun, but as someone who would usually not play multiplayer, Borderlands 2 is not as fun as the original.  It is certainly worth playing though, and at this stage you can get the GOTY edition pretty cheaply, so go kill things to death.			"

												Loot and Shoot has never been better. Honestly I have no idea why I didn't get into the Borderlands franchise sooner. This game took everything that was amazing with the first Borderlands and made it 100x MORE BADASS! The characters are well developed and the game just in general is one of the best experiences I've had with a shooter. The guns really are on a whole different level this time around especially with the new element introduced known as slag. I won't go too much into slag but let me just say its a great addition to anyone's arsenal. There's a trading system that is very useful to players and if you want to fight for your guns just start a trade and enter a duel for a winner takes all situation. The enemies are very diverse and some can even evolve mid combat such as the goliath and varkids, which offers plenty of challenge if you let them power up. The game also rewards returning players of the first borderlands as you can interact with the original vault hunters as well as a return of some familiar guns (hellfire, volcano, bone shredder, etc.). Stop reading this and go buy it! It's a game you will NOT regret playing			"

												Awesome game, but I would only recommend it if you have someone to play with, as I think that playing the game solo makes it a bit boring. If you like FPS games and shooting aliens right in the face, then you will get instantly addicted to this, but even if you don't like this kind of games that much, you will also like this one. It has an almost infinite repetitive value, as you can complete the game and the side quests all over again with another class.The story is amazing, and there are some funny moments and references at times.I would defenitely recomend this game. Get it in a good promotion!			"

												Let me set my small backstory of this game for you guys. Back in 2012 I had my 14th birthday and I'd asked my friends ""what should I buy for us to play together?"" This was back when I didn't have a PC and played on a Xbox 360, their answer? Borderlands. I bought this interesting little title for around £8 in a CEX. Let me just say, best £8 I'd ever spent, one of the few games I actually bought ALL the DLC for too (GOTY edition was impossible to find, believe me). So of course, I heard rumours of Borderlands 2 and got pretty hype. I saw the release date ""September 12th 2012"". Pre-Ordered the ♥♥♥♥ outta it. I got home from school that day more excited than a child recieving a lollipop and popped in the disc and played Borderlands 2 for the first time. I'd played atleast 200 hours, perhaps more on it, but never the DLC. So lets say I got 200 hours out of just the MAIN GAME.Later on in life I got a good PC, first thing on my buy list was Borderlands 2. This time, with all the DLC I could get. After completing this game for a 10th time in my life I feel like I should review it. So this is the meat of the review, the game itself. Whilst not going into spoilers I'll give a quick synopsis. You're a Vault Hunter, Handsome Jack wants this Vault, you want to stop him. A generic plot I suppose but very very well written. I've played through this so many times (I say completed 10, but I've had multiple characters I've just started and never finished with) and the dialouge still makes me giggle at times. I find it all just so silly and wacky that it gets to me every time. The main story itself is quite long, you'll need to do side quests to keep leveled alongside the main story, but don't worry, each sidequest is entertaining in itself, varying from robbing a bank, shooting a guy in the face (but not the arm, or body, or leg) to simply jumping off a cliff. The main story is also pretty great, you get emotionally invested in characters, you learn to hate the snark of Handsome Jack, you learn to love the Vault Hunters of the past game, you learn to despise Claptrap and his annoying voice lines.  jk claptrap i love you really The gameplay? Oh my it is so addicting. Looting new guns, out of what the game boasts to be a gazillion, each one with a different possible outcome. Maybe this one will have a scope, or a knife, or BOTH. Grenade Mods offer an interesting use too, altering what your grenades do. My favourite is a singularity grenade, pulls the enemies in and then blows up with them all together. The gunplay itself, while sometimes you feel like you're pretty much throwing a wet paper towel at a wall in the hopes of breaking it down, is also satisfying. Snipers are nice to aim, shotguns have a nice little kick and assault rifles kick ♥♥♥ (I recommend Jakobs). The best part? This game is Co-Op. 1-4 players and A LOT better when experienced in a group than solo, in my opinion. Each person taking a different character from the cast of 6 to vary up gameplay and make a very gorey battlefield.Level design is also great, my favourite map being Lynchwood. Every place has some form of parkour and a lovely look to it, from sweeping vistas in the Highlands, to the metropolis of Opportunity, to the... well... dust of ""The Dust"". Every place jumps out with life and is memorable in its own way. The game also looks A-MAZ-ING. Cel-Shaded art style is perhaps my favourite when it comes to games and this game just looks so nice with it. A cartoony feel to an over the top game, whilst still managing to maintain beauty of landscapes. The only thing I recommend is not using PhysX, it's known to tank FPS (my friend gets around 40 with it on high and he uses a GTX Titan, just set it to low). The characters you can play as are all pretty damn cool too, I'll just list them:MayaMy current character I'm playing with, was never a fan of the Siren til I played Maya, an absoloute pleasure to play as you control the battlefield, you take key targets out, you revive team mates with Res, you heal, you corrode, you do everything within your power to destroy and reign supreme over the hordes of bandits that Pandora has to throw at you. Also you can shoot your friends to heal them. She has two play styles, a ""medic"" of sorts, supporting the team, or a absoloute destructive force, murdering hordes of bandits with a quick tap of the ability key.GaigeMy favourite character to play as, she has a giant death robot. That in itself is amazing to me. She has 3 very different trees, the left tree, ""Best Friends Forever"" focuses on helping newer players out by giving abilities that help things like aim, with an ability that lets bullets riochet off of surfaces and find their way cozily inside that nearby enemies cranium. ""Little Big Trouble"" focuses on using elemental weapons, mainly shock, to your advantage. The final tree, ""Anarchy"" is an interesting one, it lets Gaige do more damage at the cost of accuracy, allowing for even the worst gun to become a power house. The best part about this tree is combining this tree with the bullet reflects from the BFF tree, Zer0An interesting fellow, not much is known about this illusive figure, other than he's a badass mofo. He's an assassin, who's specialties are in melee and backstabs, or if you decide to go for it, sniping and pistols. Zer0 has the potential to be one of the best pick of Vault Hunters in the game, able to do ridiculous damage to single targets in a single shot. His ability, Decepti0n, lets Zer0 go into stealth mode and send a decoy that enemies will attack. This is also pretty good for reviving people, but its main use is to pick off a high priority target before a fight starts, or to escape from a fight you can't win. I haven't played as much Zer0 as I have Gaige, but from what I have played I love the guy, and is always a pleasure to have one guy playing the haiku speaking assassin with ya. Also when he revives you he gets a ""<3"" on his face, what could be better?AxtonAxton was my original guy, after playing Roland in BL1 I felt like going for something similar, Axton was just that. His ability, a turret, can murder enemies pretty efficently. You can chose to level up your turrets or your own ability, the turrets were perhaps my favourite to level up though. You can get a variety of upgrades, a shield on your turret? Rockets? Two turrets? Sure thing, Axton got it all. My main fault with him however is that he's a pretty cover based character, prefering to let his turret to do the dirty work, but a nice character nevertheless.SalvadorSalvador is my least favourite character to play, which is pretty funny considering I like playing them all. His ability, whilst somewhat tame compared to the rest, can be a whole load of fun. Salvador can go ""Gunzerk"", wielding two weapons at once. Any two, you aren't limited? Two snipers? Go ahead. Two rockets? Sure thing. I can't remember much of my time as gunzerker, I just remember that he was a little guy with a pretty big appetite for destroying everything.  KriegOkay I'll be completly honest with you, I've not got the DLC for Krieg but I can tell you one thing. He solos raid bosses for a living. If you choose him, have fun with that.Closing Note for this reivew. It helps to play Borderlands 1 before this, it will give you a closer bond to some of the characters. But other than that, the main game is absoloutely amazing. I would recommend this game to anyone with an addiction to picking up things with stats and comparing it with other things with stats. Also to any shooter fan. And to anyone. Even your dog. Also before I close this off for good, two things. One, I ran out of space to do DLC reviews and two this may be slightly bias due to my franchise nerdboner, but it is still an amazing game despite that.10/10, would shoot in the face again.			"

												Borderlands 2 is a hectic and thoroughly enjoyable First person RPG shooter.  While replaying the main storyline campaign can get repetitive after a few times, the amount and variety of DLC content keeps the game feeling fresh.  The game comes stock with 4 distinct classes and has two additional ones available through paid DLC.  Each class plays differently and with the talent tree choices even playing the same class over can feel slightly different.  The length of the main story campaign feels decently long but can be rushed through relatively quickly.  That's why I highly suggest playing through all of the available side quests and EXPLORE.  That is one of the bigger selling points of this game for me.  While the story itself can feel linear and pushing you from zone to zone.  The amount of extra quests and areas to discover is great.  I highly recommend this game to fans of the borderlands franchise and newcomers alike.			"

												На планету Пандору прибыли 4 наёмника, чтобы отыскать некое ""Хранилище» - кладенец инопланетного оружия и эридианских технологий. Им противостоит корпорация ""Hyperion"" в лице Красавчика Джека, ставшего президентом этой корпорации и имеющий свои виды на Пандору. Вследствие чего, Джек присылает станцию доставки грузов корпорации в виде буквы ""Н"", на орбиту Пандоры, и начинает захват планеты. Данная игра представляет собой ""Diablo от 1 лица, исполненная в лице шутера"": прокачка персонажа, бесконечный опыт за убийство огромных толп врагов, большое количество квестов, к такому количеству приблизился разве что Skyrim. Процесс игры представляет собой формулу: убить и обобрать, а также споры по поводу снаряжения в кооперативе, ибо в игре случайно генерируется ВСЁ, включая награды за квесты. Графика в игре не однозначная, но красивая, присутствует технология nVidia PhysX, что делает бои, более красочными. Из минусов можно отметить унылый однообразный геймплей, присущий играм данного жанра. Оценка: Отлично 8/10 "

♥♥♥♥♥ out for Anthony Burch lmao+ Much more self-explanative story than Borderlands 1+ Callbacks and references to Borderlands 1 that aren't too tiring or fan-servicey+ EXTREMELY fleshed out skill trees+ Customization! + Wonderful Vault Hunters to followup the classic 4+ Amazing PC release, as opposed to Borderlands 1+ Great DLC+/- Manages to keep consistent with Borderlands 1's lore, but also flops at times+/- Loot system has improved areas, but is vastly inferior to Borderlands 1's. I will explain this later- Anthony Burch is a gooch with arms, legs and distinct facial features- Late game ( UVHM, OP )- Salvador is a bug altogether.Ferreal, that Borderlands 2 reveal trailer? The Nero one? Rock hard. Never been so excited for a game in my life, and whaddya know-- I had my reasons to be, and they were justified! BL2 was a wonderful follow up and perfected the loot n' shoot formula while constantly feeding me new mechanics and concepts. The way the characters mingle and talk to each other makes everything feel very alive. Pandora is as savage as ever, but still has that goofy sense of humor... Albeit, more in your face. The writing has very strong, and very weak points. The humor is still low brow, absolutely. But there's a lot less kick and punch in it. Like Gearbox is just sort of poking you with a stick constantly until there's a reaction. As of now, this game has six playable characters. Axton, Maya, Salvador, Zer0, Gaige and Krieg ( Axton isn't useless, you goons! You just didn't spec him correctly! ). Some perform well solo, some in groups. Some perform well mobbing, some melt raid bosses. One of them does all of that. Regardless, there is a nice bit of build variation in this game. Much more than Borderlands 1. Most characters were sort of stuck to whatever weapons their tree was designed for. The only thing you'll never need in your life is an Assault Rifle. ♥♥♥♥ sucks eggs.The story is nice, until you read into it-- The very exact opposite of Borderlands 1. Anthony Burch's writing is juvenile, and only shined when writing the silly yet enjoyable series HAWP ( Hey Ash What'cha Playin' ). The biggest merit it has is that Handsome Jack is a saving grace of a villain. I hate him, but damn do I love him. But ♥♥♥♥, do I hate him. The characters in general are pretty fun. Their lines are decent, yet it's more enjoyable to hear them talk about the world of Pandora and their relations with others than dumb jokes, if you ask me. "" C-Creech! You're saying so much good about this game! Get to the negatives already! "". Oh. Alright, you little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I'll get to the negatives. I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO BORED PLAYING A LATE GAME IN MY LIFE. UVHM has mild issues, such as constant slag reliance, enemy health regen and... That's like, it. The scaling is good. The game keeps up an intermediate difficulty. But the real ♥♥♥♥ starts when OP levels happen. Digistruct Peak is the videogame equivalent of LVL 80 Ultimate Badass Herpes. None of it is original. It's a mix and rehash of other levels with reused enemies and bosses that you go through so... What? You can level up without actually leveling up? No skill point, or increase in health? Sure, difficulty and ' overpowered gear '. But everything in this game two or three shots you unless you're running Evolution, Sham or Salvador in general. There is zero sense of accomplishment in this. It's a bitter relief that ends short because you still have to do it upwards of eight. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Times. The reliance of Red Text ( Legendaries / Unique Blues ) is boring, cookie cutter and toxic to the genuine fun factor this game brings. I've heard the argument that it's ' the thrill of the chase '. What chase? Resetting your game fifty times for an item that most people just cheat engined anyways? I was a firm believer that getting all my items legit would feel good and not as cheap as a save file. God was I wrong. After 20+ hours of farming Doc Mercy for a fire Dva Infinity with at least a Vladof or Jakobs grip on it, I was ready to just call it quits. Once you reach a certain point, non-red text weapons are useless. The point of the Borderlands series was the glow and smile you got when opening a chest. Late game, chests are useless. There's so many legendaries that the chance of getting something good or useful is nil. AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON PEARLESCENTS. Legit. Don't get me started. This review's gone on long enough. Not feeling it.As a Borderlands veteran, the endgame to this was so mind numbing and irritating that I just went back to Borderlands 1. Sure, less content. But, a more enjoyable, fulfilling experience. If you're new to Borderlands, consider picking up GOTY when it's on sale sometime. You won't regret it! This game is good, but has glaring flaws that has left me sort of iffy on playing it anymore after just 300 hours. That's a lot of time, mind you. And if you see no issues in the ones I pointed out, you could have double that.			"

												Начну издалека, но буду краток. Вы ведь знаете игру под названием Left 4 Dead? В свое время она наделала шороха и раздвинула рамки кооперативных шутеров. Лучше ее… только Left 4 Dead 2, объединившая в себе все лучшее, что было в первой части, умножив ее на еще одну группу из четверых героев, новое оружие, новые кампании, и переработанную динамику боя соединенную с более высокой интерактивностью окружающего мира. Такая же формулировка верна и в отношении Borderlands 2. Новые герои – старые мотивы. И это тот самый случай, когда новый друг совсем не хуже старых двух. Друзей становится больше. На четыре единицы. Четыре персонажа, проработанные так же тщательно, как и предыдущие герои. В случае если вы пожелаете приобрести DLC количество «охотников за ковчегом» увеличится до шести. Нет смысла расписывать все улучшения, которые появились в Borderlands 2 – пусть это будет сюрпризом для поклонников серии. Стоит отметить лишь, что бой стал еще более динамичным. Что ощущение оружия в руках не исчезло. Напротив. Положа руку на сердце, могу сказать, что такого количества оружия в играх я еще не видел. И речь не о том, как оно выглядит. Эффективного оружия. Интересного оружия. Оружия, которое хочется держать в руках, и из которого хочется палить. Даже в воздух. Даже просто в стену, лед или камень. Чтобы слышать как оно поет.Речь о функциональности этого оружия. О его манере боя. Об уникальности присущей каждой его единице. Кучность, отдача, время перезарядки, дальность, спец-возможности, дизайн - все это не просто данные. К оружию идет привыкание, как это когда-то происходило в игре Jagged Alliance. Только вот к оружию привыкаете вы, а не NPC. И потом ищете что-либо похожее именно на эту модель, именно с такими же характеристиками. Скажу более, частенько вы согласны воевать устаревшей моделью, которая наносит противнику меньше урона, затягивает продолжительность боя. Просто потому, что с этим стволом – вам комфортно. Колоритные персонажи, замечательные боссы, великолепные панорамы Пандоры. Пост-апокалиптика во всей своей красе. Тонны оружия, десятки и сотни тысяч выпущенных пуль, десятки и сотни мест, каждое из которых имеет свой дизайн и историю. Апгрейды, улучшения и мини-перки. Ну и куда без визитной карточки этой игры. Потешного робота, шутника, клоуна и феерического размаха трепла, о котором сэр Хаммерлок схватившись за голову как-то сказал «О боже… он опять говорит». Все это здесь. Всего стало больше. Всего стало дольше. Да и старые герои, как и в упомянутой L4D2, никуда не исчезли. Они рядом. И вы еще не раз их увидите. Хороший напиток не выдыхается. Он настаивается. Тоже произошло и с этой игрой. Боевая механика выросла настолько, что первая часть игры, после динамики боя второй части, ощущается несколько пресноватой. Наверное, неспроста Gearbox Software решили выпустить переиздание первой части, снабдив её всем тем чего они добились во второй. Не знаю как для вас, а для меня это - отличная новость. Я люблю Пандору. Люблю этот мир, и также люблю торчать в магазине, или в игровых автоматах этого мира, подбирая себе револьвер по вкусу.Как и в случае первой части, если вы все же начали зевать – попробуйте кооператив. Игры подобного плана в кооперативе начинают играть всеми цветами радуги. Одни забеги за «лучшим чемоданом» чего стоят. Не говоря уже о возрастающей сложности игры, и куда более богатом луте.P.S.Было бы очень некрасиво с моей стороны не отметить особо саундтрек к игре с участием Джаспера Кида. Кому-то это имя может быть незнакомо, но вряд ли кто-то незнаком с такими игровыми сериалами как Hitman и Assassin's Creed. Ну и, конечно же, с героями данного обзора Borderlands и Borderlands 2. Если за сто или двести часов вы ни разу не выключали музыку, должно быть это чего-то да стоит.			"

												I haven't had this much fun playing a game since I first started playing Far Cry 3! This game isn't for everyone, but it grows on you. Not very story-oriented, which is an element I focus on more, but it does have some great moments and lore. What it lacks in story, it makes up for with incredible gameplay! A must-have for any fan of first person shooters or role playing games. 9/10			"

												Borderlands 2 is one of those games where it has an equal mix of gore and humor(ok, maybe more humor) that blends together surprisingly well for anyone that has an enjoyment for dark humor or just confused to what comedy and tragedy is.  If you're looking for a game that's open-world with challenges and enemies scattered all around it's map, this is the game for you(as long as you can bear the long grinding sessions and completely s***ty guns you can randomly find, some being deemed ""legendary"").TL;DR: Open-world, funny in a dark way, beware of s***ty guns.(This game is best experienced if you have played the first game, so buy it, or don't, I don't know, I'm not your dad, I just like this game a lot so I'm just giving you this review...)

												To anyone considering buying this game, ask yourself two simple questions.Do I have friends that would play this with me? Do I like shooters and/or RPGs?If you answered yes to either of these questions, then you will enjoy this game. Playing with friends in this game is a great time, even if you dont want to get involved with the story, you will find that shooting your way around the world with up to three other friends is massivley enjoyable. However, boasting an incredibly solid campaign as this, delivering quirky characters and interesting dialogue, this games gives you pleanty of reason to actually get involved in the story. All in all, the campaign scores a 8.7/10 from me, as the multiple runthroughs that I went through did not have me pull my eyes out of my sockets from tedium. *cough* Borderlands 1 arid badlands*cough* The area that really makes this game shine is the DLCs. The dlcs from this game are, with the community in almost unanimous agreement, better than the actual campaign, which as I said before, is really great. Finish the game for the first time, then I wholeheartedly recommend you smack those dlcs. With actual raid bosses *cough* Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel and your single ""Raid"" boss which was just a rehash of the last boss(Which dont get me wrong, wasnt a bad boss, and the idea of doing on what is basically a higher risk for a higher reward  difficulty is nice, but thats what true and ultimate vault hunter mode are for, not the only raid boss slot in the game.)*cough* (Wow that was a really long cough...) left right and center (Which are basically titanic bosses that will test all of you and three friends abilites), these dlcs offer the game longevity to last you through your post game completion hours. If you are not planning on getting all of the dlc for monetary reasons or others, then I recomment that you buy the dlc's in this order as far as you want to go;Tiny Tina Assault on Dragon Keep. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME AND THEN SKIP THIS DLC. This, in my opinion, is the SINGLE BEST DLC I HAVE EVER PLAYED FOR ANY GAME EVER. This dlc is great. It retells the deals with Tiny Tinas grief and eventual acceptance of (spoilers I shall not say) and it does so in a fashion that runs you through a fantasy world filled with orcs and Dragons and sorcerers and loot, oh boy the loot... This DLC is the Borderlands 2 experience. Do not miss it. 10/10. Please find me a fault in this Dlc, for I can not find any off the top of my head.Torgues Campaign of Carnage.This add on campaign, the same as Tiny Tinas Campaign, adds on an additional plot that introduces you to one of the best Npcs in the history of gaming. You will never look at a torgue weapon the same again. 9.8/10.Captain Scarletts Pirate Booty.Yeh, I dont know, its alright, but it just doesnt quite have the same awesome feel to it as the other campaigns. I think I might be the desert backdrop and the lack of a really interesting and constantly recurring funny character, but it doesnt hold you as well as the previous two, despite still being enjoyable and quite lengthy. I would give it a 8.7/10Hammerlocks Hunt.Skip it. you are not missing out on anything. I know I sound very dismissove here, but the last boss is a ♥♥♥♥♥, as in the bullet reflecting, cowardly, annoying as hell ♥♥♥♥♥. Not to mention the raid boss, who is a collosal a-hole. Unavoidable novas and basically a giant Rabid Stalker, yeh...no, I think Ill pass, or maybe come back as a pimp when I level up my gunzerker... :resmile:Hammerlock does his best to be funny, and the pathetic attempt at being a main villain does come out more humourous than intimidating as intended, so if you enjoy Borderlands humour and want another chunk of gameplay you wont be dissapointed, but you also wont come out going, Wow, that was awesome!  7.2/10Finally, for all of you who made it to hear, well done, clearly you have a large attention span, you might actually get yourself a legit Norfleet one day. The character packs. Mechromancer and Psycho. This depends on what you intend to do with each of these chars. Up to level 72 WITHOUT OP levels, I would recommend the Psycho. He is probably the most satisfying of all the chars in game, you find yourself looking out for that satisfying crunch sound beneath your buzzaxe... However, if you intend on taking only one of these chars into OP 8, take the Mechromancer. This is because the Psycho is balanced through leveling, and as he stops leveling inside the OP levels, his melee damage starts to drop off, making him far less viable, especially compared to the Mechromancers anarchy stacks, making you an inaccurate but oneshotting machine, when I say one shttting, I mean one shotting minibosses one shotting. In summary, if you are looking at the game and thinking, ""Hey, this looks pretty alright..."" then do yourself a favor and buy it. And if you enjoy your first playthrough of the original campaign, do yourself a massive solid and get Tiny Tinas Dlc. You will not regret it. And if you are really loving the game, buy the Psycho, go Psycho and enjoy yourself while you do it. This is the best installment to the Borderlands franchise up until now, with the greatest campaign and longevity of them all. So do it.			"

Many times you can get the GOTY edition at 75% discount and thats a real bargain for all the gameplay and hours you get from this game. The world is detailed and nice, i really love the graphics in the game. It's a really amazing weapon system with all kind of random weapons like the first game. the amount of dlcs can feel abit overwhelming at times, but the game dont need all dlc to be enjoyable.			"

												I will start by saying; I have been playing Borderlands2 for maybe about a week now. I currently have a level 18 Commando. Never did I touch the original Borderlands, and I always wanted to get into it. The commercials on TV always patronized me, and then one day, bam! Someone gifted it to me on Steam. I couldn't believe my eyes.It is now maybe 3 years later, that I have gotten myself into Borderlands 2 (which, guess what - was gifted to me!) with two other friends. I am absolutely in love.If you have ever played an MMORPG - the concept is sort of the same. You have to complete quests, and you unlock experience, currencies (Cash, Eridium [usable on black market]), weapons, class mods and whatnot. Of course, there is also DLC you can purchase to further customize your character -- but you do not even have to. You can also unlock OTHER character customizations just by playing.Loads of fun. Quests can sometimes be confusing on figuring out exactly just where to go, and controlling your first vehicle before you get the Bandit by mouse is EXTREMELY awkward for me.. the wheels don't move by A and S, it moves by the mouse. I know there's a term for that.. but I don't know what it is, and it is 2am in the morning.Please - get this game. I promise you you will thank me later. And if it's gifted to you - thank that person. I have my own thanks to give. :)			"

												The hook of Borderlands 2,  is the loot. Guns, ammo, character skins, grenade mods, class mods -- there’s always something just a bit better, something you so desperately didn’t even know you needed until you found it in Borderlands 2. Just like other action RPGs, the hunt for loot becomes intoxicating because of the tiny rush you get each time a rare colored item spills out of a chest or recetly slain enemy. Guns are a bulk of the loot, and that’s great because you’re going to spend most of your time in Borderlands 2 staring down a gun sight.You simply have to decide the best -- or most entertaining -- way to kill everyone. Borderlands 2 is a much needed improvements to areas like narrative and class skill design to Borderlands. Overall this is an amazing shooter no one even remotely curious should overlook.			"

Grab your friends, give them shootalots and get into da choppa... or atleast bandit roadrunner.Having played Borderlands 1 over and over, then jumping onto Borderlands 2 expecting the same mayhem of flying bullets and screaming psychos, I definetely found what I looked for and expected from second installment. Game reintroduces our old Vault Hunters from previous game as NPCs with the feel of nostalgia, we get to play 4 new base heroes with simmiliar mechanics to old ones and introduces two more heroes with brand new mechanics which were made with support and feedback of fanbase since we all were trigger happy in Borderlands 1. We are carried through planet Pandora once again to show us what changed in meantime, then we get to know more and more of Handsome Jack, one of best developed villains of all times (next to Vaas from Far Cry 3). During game we get to shoot out all our happiness, frustration, we laugh a lot and sometimes feel sad, all because of very good made story, which rarely happens in shooter games nowadays.			"

Grab your friends, give them shootalots and get into da choppa... or atleast bandit roadrunner.Having played Borderlands 1 over and over, then jumping onto Borderlands 2 expecting the same mayhem of flying bullets and screaming psychos, I definetely found what I looked for and expected from second installment. Game reintroduces our old Vault Hunters from previous game as NPCs with the feel of nostalgia, we get to play 4 new base heroes with simmiliar mechanics to old ones and introduces two more heroes with brand new mechanics which were made with support and feedback of fanbase since we all were trigger happy in Borderlands 1. We are carried through planet Pandora once again to show us what changed in meantime, then we get to know more and more of Handsome Jack, one of best developed villains of all times (next to Vaas from Far Cry 3). During game we get to shoot out all our happiness, frustration, we laugh a lot and sometimes feel sad, all because of very good made story, which rarely happens in shooter games nowadays.			"

												Borderlands 2.. I've played this game on the ps3 and I have to say, I loved it. It's so funny how some characters react in situations and overall it has a lot of missions to complete. I bought it for pc now so I could play it with more friends and the coöp mode is also good. It may lag a bit, but with a stable computer you won't have any problems. The DLC's are okay.. Some of them are quite short but if you buy them in the sale you will really have something for your money.Overall a good game with some bugs and even bad things like too easy missions..Good to buy the game in the sale, not for 50 euros.7.5/10			"

												A great humorous game with amazingly funny characters, Including the 4 characters that you get to choose from! I have played the first game and Borderlands 2 has not disappointed me at all. Whether you're a casual gamer, protecting your kingdom online, or an heavy MMO gamer, this game Is for you. There are 4 characters to choose from and 2 extra characters to play as with DLC, Krieg the Psycho, and Gaige the Mechromancer. Everyone has their own powers, ranging from changing the flow of the battlefield, to berserking your way through midgets and psychos. Borderlands 2 features 4 player co-op with a driven storyline. It Is worth every penny.			"

												Borderlands 2 (BL2) is the only game I’ve ever preordered, and I definitely understand why people say Game of the Year editions punish loyal customers and early buyers. The game is amazing but if I want to get the DLC, I’ll have to spend more than the actual game costs! I guess I’ll have to wait until the GOTY edition is really cheap and upgrade my game.BL2 is a first person shooter where you play as one of 4 (6 if you have the DLC) Vault Hunters on the planet Pandora. The story takes place sometime after the events of Borderlands 1 (maybe a few years) and quite a few characters from the first game show up in BL2. The game is world is very large and exploring everything is an exhausting but worthwhile job. You can learn a lot about the game by listening to hidden audio recordings or talking with NPCs. There’s quite a lot of humor in the game so it’s never dull. The boss especially, Handsome Jack, has tons of insults and stories to throw your way.As for gameplay, BL2 has a level system so I guess you could call it an RPG. Each level you get a skill point to put into 1 of about 45 different skills depending on your character. You can re-spec your skills at any time so you really only need 1 of each class to experience all the play styles. There are a few vehicles that you can drive depending on what area you’re in (travel can take forever if you’re on foot). BL2 has built in multiplayer so your friends can drop in or out at any time. Just like in the first game, if you’re “killed” you have about 5 seconds to Fight For Your Life. Kill any enemy during these 5 seconds and you’re revived. If you fail Fight For Your Life, you respawn at the nearest New-U kiosk (you don’t save or load the game manually). If you have a friend in the game, he can revive you during Fight For Your Life and you won’t have to respawn. Like the Diablo games, when you beat the game on normal mode, you can choose to replay on an increased difficulty level where both you and the enemies are higher level. Better gear will drop and almost all the enemies will gain resistances to various weapon types. This “True Vault Hunter Mode” gets insanely hard by the end of the game and you pretty much have to have a friend or 2 backing you up. BL2 is one of the few games that I’ve played through completely on coop with a friend and it definitely improves the experience.Overall I would definitely recommend Borderlands 2 to anyone who enjoys First Person Shooters or Action RPGs (I’ve got over 200 hours in this game). The story and combat are amazingly well done as is the humor and variety. However, definitely look for a “complete edition” since the Game of the Year edition actually doesn’t include all the DLC. I think Greenmangaming had a complete edition a week or so ago which included not only the Season Pass, but also both new characters and the Ultimate Vault Hunter upgrades (increasing the level cap and introducing new weapon types).

												A great FPS with more loot than you can ever want. From the first game, the story, characters, and the levels are amazing. I have 100% completed the PS3 version, PS4 version, AND now this version! It is very hard to find bad things in this game, other than most of the DLC is boring or too short. Play with friends though! I've completed the PS3 and 4 versions solo, and the game is super boring if you do. I completed the PC version with my best friend, it was much easier to play through the game for the 50th time.

												Great game. However, it's pricy, so I'd buy it at the normal sale price of 9.99 USD. The DLCs are also a great part of the game. Borderlands 2 is also a Grindfest, so if you want to keep your sanity, you'll want to use a profile editor. The game is a great timesapper, and even better with four friends.Edit: Also, there's a shotgun that shoots swords that explode into more swords. 11/10.			"

												This game is fantastic, though not without flaws. While this game maintains diversity in levels, weapons, and enemies, it really loses steam with the amount of grinding included in the game. Indeed, grinding is not inherintly bad, but it does become quite tedious and boring as the game stretches on. Also, some of the writing in this game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible(cringy jokes, memes, and all round annoying cast members). However, the gameplay itself is fantastic, including so many skills and weapon types to the extent that finding a pretty gun with a new element consistantly never becomes stale. The art direction in this game is fantastic, as the cell shaded aesthetic really surprisingly clicks with the tone of the game. The vibrant colours and explosions succeed in creating eye candy for all to enjoy. In the end, I wholeheartedly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys first person shooters, ARPGs, or any sort of coop-centric games.			"

												I just bought this game because it was on a sale and because I heard it is a really good game. I didn't really know what I was getting into. After the first few hours I've started to enjoy this game more and more and without even noticing I was caught into the story. The graphics are awesome even if they seem cartoonish. Different classes from which you can choose the one that suits you the best. If you want the best loot possible you will have to grind a little. The game is very fun and the developers have the sense of humor. Overall it's a good game with a great story and a good co-op experience. Now I feel kinda ashamed because I didn't try it earlier.

Borderlands 2 is a seamless blend of everything I liked about Diablo, everything I liked about shooters before they mutated into platforming mad-libs of interactive fiction, and everything I like about RPGs.  Gearbox got just about everything right, and doubled down with the DLC - Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep is a treat for tabletop fans and a real kick in the feels.10/10, sets the standard for first person looters.

												While BioShock Infinite might be the best game I have ever played, Borderlands 2 is the absulutely best in terms of overall player experience. I have never ever had so much fun as when playing this game. Beautiful graphics, entertaining storyline, probably the best voice acting in all of video game industry, some of the greatest character designs ever made (Claptrap, Tiny Tina and especially Handsome Jack), immense amounts of loots (there are literally millions of guns you can choose from) and excellent replayability. The game has about 200 hours of gameplay if you wish to level a character entirely, which is a lot, but I guarantee you, they will be some of the best moments of your gaming life.A lot can be said about maturity of the content of the game as well. A lot of harsh language, sexual innuendos and things that would be disgusting in other games (cannibalism, torture and so on) is present, but the game is incredibly mature and deals with all of these themes in a very respectable way, which is further supplemented by the perfect graphics. Not only that, but the game also packs striking thoughts and supports LGBT rights, goes against domestic violence (I will never forget Mr. Torgue saying his best quote ever: ""YOU BETTER TREAT MOXXI NICE! NOTHING IS MORE BADASS THAN TREATING A WOMAN WITH RESPECT!""), regards personal insecurity and many many other important topics in our current society. It does all of this with grace. There is even an NPC created specifically for a now-deceased Borderlands fan - and that is just one of many examples of how great the developers are. Honestly, Gearbox Software staff are some of the best people I have ever had the pleasure to meet.The humour in the game is also something that cannot be possibly overglorified. Not only you will find references to just about every game and pop culture theme ever to be made here, but the dialogues are incredibly funny even when discussing important things. The way the game makes fun of itself is something that absolutely captured me. (""Torgue weapons ALWAYS fire EXPLOSIVE ROUNDS. They are also LOUD and require EXCESSIVE use of CAPITAL LETTERS"") The fourth wall is broken all the time, but it is done in a so incredibly funny way that it feels so, so right. (""Hey guys, remember the old Crawmerax the Invincible?"" ""Sure, we exploited his glitches for HOURS! Oh, Pearlescents!"")The DLCs are all worth is as well, as they add a lot to the story and offer a lot additional content. Tiny Tina's Assault on the Dragon Keep is probably the greatest DLC ever created for any game ever. The amount of references, fun and interesting enemies present here are incredible. If I had to choose a single game out of all of them and spend the rest of my life playing it, it would be Borderlands 2.Would I recommend this game? No. No, I do not recommend you to buy this game. I recommend you to head to the Store and buy the Borderlands GOTY Edition, Borderlands 2 GOTY Edition, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel and it's Season Pass and The Tales of Borderlands as well. Buy the entire franchise. Just. Do. It. Also, write a love letter to Gearbox Software and thank them for creating the best game franchise currently to exist.			"

												After having this game for a few years it's about time I write a review.Borderlands 2 is one of those games that seems to do everything right.Great story, amazing, diverse, interesting whacky characters and humour, so much to kill, quest and loot. Even the enemies are diverse and interesting. So many different kinds of enemies, from the large variety of bandits that say all manner of things when fighting you and the strange alien animal enemies such as skags, bullymongs and many others.No matter how many times I play this game I never get sick of it. Iam playing my third character and levelling her to max lvl and am still enjoying myself.The game also has RPG elements such as you have various skill trees to put points in as well as can customise the look of your character by skins and heads, though most of the more interesting ones you have to pay for.And you can try and do all the challenges if you do get bored which increases your badass rank, giving you tokens to put into increasing things like health, shield recharge rate etc. by a small .% of each token used, so it adds up and makes your character even stonger as you'll need it if you want to face terramorphous a very challenging lvl 52 super  boss.There is not really any major downsides I can think of with this game, had no bugs or problems, the controls are good.The only negatives I can think of is that I tend to out level quests, I end up lvl 19 and have a lvl 15 quest. And if you want the best loot you have to do a lot of boss farming.This game I'd class as almost perfect in my top 5 of all time favourite games. This is a must play game 9/10. "

												Funny and brilliant, Borderlands 2 is twice as good as the first, something which isn't always the case for sequels. But Gearbox Software manages to improve their IP in many ways, offering one of these titles you could not possibly forget to buy in 2012, and proposing new features that will allow players to blow off some steam for hours. It delivers on every promise of the original, being an instant classic that proudly stands alongside the PC's finest shooters.			"

												7/10 Content -No big highlight of the game story, most of the game in the coniferous forest region, individual tasks carried out at the snow-capped mountains. Alone attracts me is the chief villain large image of the character, personal feeling that he was the only bright spot in this game role. His tone, style behavior quite some gangster style. Other characterization is not perfect. Compared to the third generation all-round game content has been enhanced weapon types, vehicle type has increased; shops trading buttons are also more humane. Unfortunately, after all, and the third generation is not much difference.9/10 pictures -This is very good for the optimization, allowing low with the computer up and running. Compared to the third generation model to do a lot of fine, the picture brighter, animal fur simulation can also be turned.8/10 Music -The music is all that is full of strong religious song, it sounds very strange feeling. Protagonist in the above vehicles, some special scenes will have a corresponding soundtrack, the music box with a nice atmosphere, but nothing gives the image a deep song.9/10 Get started -Compared to the third generation of the simple to use this for a lot, backpack capacity, carrying bullets ceiling limit purse and so has been significantly improved, when the figure was not so easy downhill supposed blood. But the difficulty will be too late simple, especially the last few unlocked gun is very powerful, it is affecting game balance.7/10 playability -Repetitive single-player content, is still occupied point Chantha, massive collection of elements, several quests, play more will feel bored. But to do this for a very good cooperative mode, players can have the freedom to wander in the map, the third generation is no longer the kind of simple tasks can only enter cooperation. However, only a maximum number of two people cooperate, rather than four, and the extension can only do small tasks.Total - 40/50 good			"

													Well where to start.... GraphicsYes those visual friends of ours that tickle our eyes in jolly old delight.They are here in plenty tho a little dated the comic style in the way the game is presented is verynice. The lines colors and shades work well in this style and allow you ""oooh and ahhh"" at the screen as you fire away with one of your boom sticks.The next great thing in this game is loot and I mean LOOT every where. Its what its all about. after getting killed a few times and getting very frustrated with the game it pays of when you find some badd *** gun and take down the next few waves with an ear to ear grin plastered on your face.. AMAZING!Next is  co-opSeamless Co-Op. join a buddy's game and play on. Leaving body parts and gore in the tracks of your team. This is how co-op should be.Splitting money and a trade system between your groups allows no one to be left out of the loot bonanza! Next...mmmm what is next? Well the over all game play is fast paced and very addictive the game at times can seem a bit of a grind. Constant enemy waves put your poor trigger finger to the test and push the meaning of ammo conservation to the test. But then you find the loot bin and the grind had paid off, nicely too. The mission system shows how hard the next mission will be and if you need to roam around to level prior to your attempt is a great option.A level 4 taking on a level 6 mission will be very tough but levelling is easy in the beginning. After level five you get a skill point to spend in one of 3 trees to make your toon yours and yours alone. In my opinion this game sets a fast paced shooting callery of bandits, monsters, robots and other evil doing creatures. My advise is to lock load pre-pair your fingers and dive face first in the sea of bullets ahead and enjoy the visuals, game play and the company of a stark-raving mad friend to accompany you on this blissful murder feast.Enjoy!Graphics 8/10 Gameplay 8/10 Co-op 10/10 Controls 9/10 Content 9/10 Replay 7/10Overall 8.5 on the ~n00bz~ scale			"

												A frenetic and extremely funny cel-shaded FPS, mixed with some RPG elements and a fantastic random weapon system. Borderlands 2 is firstly a very well crafted shooter, with accurate mechanics and smooth, fast controls, which let you handle complex, long and exciting combats. Secondly, the environment and character design is wonderfully realized: the map is big and heterogeneous, while funny dialogues will make you laugh from the beginning to the end of the game. Main plot, secondary quests and amazing DLCs build a long-lasting game, never lowering the level of fun and challenge, especially in coop mode. Definitely one of the best FPS of the last years. 90/100I would also like to mention that italian dubbing is excellent, granting hilarious dialogues.			"

												This game is really good. It has a solid theme throughout with witty, refreshing characters and dialogue. If you enjoy RPG's and FPS I would highly reccommend this game to you. An absolute classic which will remain as one of my favourite games. It has its glitches though like gun merging and infinite ammo however this is only possible on singleplayer so it doesn't ruin the game too much. I feel this game gives a better experience if you play this in Multiplayer with friends however the loot isn't shared among everyone (only the xp and money) so the guns have to be literally nabbed by everyone. D: Either way, I enjoyed this game and I will still continue playing it! Great game, with great price! ;D			"

REVIEW: BORDERLANDS 2: GAME OF THE YEAR EDITIONNote: I played this game solo.I’m generally not a major fan of FPSes. I’m more of an RPG sort of guy. And yet, I found myself interested and intrigued by the Borderlands series. When the series went on sale not long ago, I canvassed some friends’ opinions, whether I should get the first game, or the second. I had, admittedly, enjoyed watching the Two Saiyans Play videos of the latter. Having been told to get the second game, that’s what I did, getting the Game of the Year edition. But was it worth it? **** the hell, yeah!Five years have passed since the opening of the original Vault. The Hyperion Corporation, led by the egotistical and petulant tyrant Handsome Jack, has begun to tighten its grip on Pandora, killing bandits and the normal populace alike, all in the name of ‘taming’ the border world. As rumours of a new Vault spread, Jack makes the call for new Vault Hunters, only to kill them. But that was a mistake. A new group of Vault Hunters will rise, team up with old ones, and embark on a quest to stop Handsome Jack. But they have a hard task ahead of them, as Jack has more than one trump card up his sleeve…I enjoy games with a good story, and one thing that Borderlands does very well is the story. It’s like the mutant offspring of Mad Max and Red Dwarf, with a touch of Blake’s 7 (or Firefly, if you need a more modern show) thrown into the mix. Funny, full of references, and yet serious and full of pathos when it needs to, it’ll certainly have some shocks for fans of the first game. It’s also populated with a cast with the good, the bad, and the fugly. The storylines of the DLC ones are fine enough, though the real star storyline of the DLC campaigns is that of Tiny Tina’s Assault on Dragon Keep. It’s also one of those rare sequels that you can enjoy fully without any knowledge of the previous game.The graphics of the Borderlands series are very distinctive, being pseudo-cel shaded. They’re also pretty damned good, giving the right style and vibe to this world. There’s also a variety of landscapes, from desert and arid lands, to tundra, to cities, and even verdant mountains. The Borderlands series shows that realistic graphics aren’t always the way to go, that stylised graphics can often be better than the more realistic stuff some games seems to want to tend towards.Sound-wise, the game is superlative. The music is spot-on, albeit not as spectacular at times as I want it to be. The voice-acting, however, is something else, with particular praise going to Dameon Clarke as Handsome Jack, Cherami Leigh as Gaige, Jason Douglas as Krieg, Brina Palencia as Moxxi, Chris Rager as Torgue, Colleen Clinkenbeard as Lilith, Scarlett, and Tannis, David Eddings as Claptrap, and Ashly Burch as Tiny Tina. They, along with so many others, make this game wonderful, giving life to characters that make us laugh, cringe, and cry.But a game would be nothing without gameplay, and as far as FPSes are concerned, Borderlands 2 ****ing rocks. While I am not enticed by the series’ claims of ‘87 bazillion guns’, procedurally generated (though the elemental properties are certainly enjoyable), the hybridisation of an FPS and an RPG is considerably more interesting. Each character is given a unique attack ability or Action Skill, as well as a variety of abilities you can invest points in, RPG style, to customise your character’s abilities. The game itself can get a bit grindy at times, but thankfully, it’s one of the games that will have you having fun while doing so most of the time. The four DLC campaigns also add some substantial playtime to the game, and the two DLC characters are bloody good. Not only that, but it’s a game that you may very want to play through again, right from the beginning, which is why the True Vault Hunter mode may appeal to those who do want to do so.If you had to get one FPS to play in your entire life, then I would have to recommend Borderlands 2, hands-down. Get the Game of the Year edition. You won’t regret it.RATING: *****EDIT: Nominated this for the ""Five More Minutes"" Award for the Steam Awards 2016.			"

Borderlands 2 is one of the best games I have played, especially in recent history. There is very little to dislike about it: it has a great soundtrack, the cel shading art style is still gorgeous, it has the best sense of humor of any game (besides The Stanley Parable), the balance is really tight, a variety of playable characters to match any playstyle. and all of the loot and skill trees an RPG fan will love. Throw in co-op with friends, and I can't think of a better recipe for a good time. It's really a modern take on the Diablo series.One of the biggest complaints people had about the original Borderlands was that the story was nothing to write home about, and the end was a big disappointment. Gearbox very clearly went to great lengths to rectify this in Borderlands 2; they had a clear antagonist right from the beginning, and they did everything they could to make us hate his guts. I think they may have focused a little too much on this however, because there wasn't a whole lot else going on. The end boss was also really easy; it had a lot of health, but it dealt so little damage, I don't think my shields ever got depleted.Thankfully those are really the only complaints that I have about the game. Everything else was a big improvement over the original: more enemy variety, more interesting characters (the characters you played as in the original take center stage and get a lot more development than I was expecting). Even if I hadn't had my best friend to play with, I would have had a great time with Borderlands 2. I'd say that a reasonable price to pay is $40, but it's been around for so long you will most certainly pay less than that. We will soon be diving into the DLCs, so you'll be hearing about those soon enough.			"

												Borderlands remains to this day my favorite game due to its uniqueness of combining rpg and fps elements with a great story and voice acting that were fun and entertained me for basically months of gameplay time, some of which isn't on Steam before I decided to buy the GOTY just so I could get all the achievements for this game. So don't get me wrong for the review below, but:I never hated jumping mechanics and invisible walls more than in this game, ever! Or map designs that make you cover a distance by going on an arch or a zig-zag to reach your objective just to add more gameplay time, and this happens especially in the dlcs. The first two aspects persist from the first game, but the third.. oh man. Also on that note I hated the most all the quests in Tundra Express given by Tiny Tina, because the entrance to her cave is located in exactly the opposite direction of all the objectives except one. I can't even remember how many times I've cursed the developers for making me run around a god damn rock to turn in something, just to get another in almost the same spot. Also the story is kinda forced and lacks character which made me quit the game two or three times before level 25 because I didn't connect with what was going on in it, and this is the first game I've pre-ordered! I still prefer the first Borderlands for that where you actually care about your hero and what's going on, you wanna get involved in changing the situation.Other than that it's still a great game built in the same manner with a lot of content that can keep you playing many hours alone or with friends and they did improve on the later part, connectivity becoming easily accesible which is great because that's why we're all using this Steam platform after all. So I can see why it lacks in some content, just to make up in other related to the multiplayer category, like the badass ranks and bonuses and all the playthroughs (hell in the first game max health and shields were in the two to four thousand limit), so the players have something to return to that doesn't feel absolete after just a few hours. I hope to see a Borderlands MMO one day, which seems they're getting closer and closer to and might be the perfect game yet as the developers usually listen to what the community asks for and they constantly improve the new releases on that matter.

												This game is really fun. With exciting AND addictive game-play that stays fresh even past the 10th play-through I am never bored with this game. The story is actually great and the superb voice acting makes it hard to not like the characters from the bandits to handsome Jack himself, on that the characters are well made and written and each is unique from the main cast (Zero, Maya, Axton and Salvador) to all the bosses, even to npc's such a Moxxi and Crazy Earl, each has a nice backstory from obtainable audio logs and also them talking to you through missions and just seeing them in generalThe humor plays a big part as well and is one of the main attractions of the Borderlands franchise but another is the graphics, the graphics look great overall and the PhysX makes it even better, the iconic graphics though not like Battlefield or Metro in quality are still amazing if you have a close look at the world in Borderlands 2, a change from Borderlands 1's post-apocalyptic landscape.The DLC are a must have, maybe not the skin packs so much but they are nice non-the-less, the real gems are the actual main DLC's, some are serious and to the campaign and some are crazy, each DLC is made around a character like Mr Torgue, the owner of the explosive guns but my favorite was the second to final boss, Professor Nakayama, (SPOILERS) He looks like he will mutate or something from the eridium markings but me and my friends were too busy laughing when he fell down the stairs and on each step he hit, his lifebar went down a chunk, easily one of the funniest moments in Borderlands (In my opinion)I had this on console and clocked litterally 1000's of hours on it, soon to be building a beast of a computer and will be returning to the Borderlands to have some fun and shoot some bandits in closing this game truly deserved Game of the Year and remains my favorite game of all time, it truely deserves this place and if anyone doesnt have this game you are missing out, it isnt everyones 'cup of tea' but for less that £5/$10 it is well worth it even if you arent a big fan and only play it once.NOTE: THIS IS QUITE BIASED AS I AM A HUGE FAN OF THE SERIES AND HAVE GOT A LOT MORE HOURS ON CONSOLEGraphics - 8/10Humour - 9/10Plot - 7/10Lifetime - 9/10Gameplay - 10/10			"

												Let me introduce you to probably the greatest game you will play, and you don't know it yet. Don't be fooled with the gameplay videos on youtube and the trailer ones which does not at all reflect the actual gameplay, because it's the atmosphere with YOU inside the game that makes the game truly amazing. The story is incredibly great that you'd love playing the game over and over again with different characters. I have only bought the game just today and I am completely amazed with how you play the game - the story has a repetitive gameplay (I haven't even progessed much but I already want to replay.) with different characters, with your friends and all, and along with that you will want your dear Clap-trap to shut up as he talks non-sense.Oh also, there are vehicles that reminds me of Far Cry and it's really hilarious to try to ride the car as your friend tries to shoot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monsters. I ended up crashing the car into mountain which ended up getting stuck. (DAMNIT MONSTERS.) Maybe you'll have a better luck. It is worth noting that the class skills are easy to use and learn, and I usually find games like this incredibly confusing (Skyrim, for example). It's a nice starter game for people who want to get used to class-type games.All in all, I must admit that this game is truly one of the best games I've ever played, and was definitely worth buying the whole game and it's DLC's while it's on sale. You should definitely not miss the chance to try this game.			"

Borderlands 2 Reviewto be honesty Borderlands 2 is definitely one of the greatest open world sandbox games I have ever played :) this game is just freaking awesome, it has everything that makes a great game! a good story, great gameplay, interesting characters, RPG elements, a unique and diverse open world and a lot of loot whoring for some badass guns ;) and that's not even scratching the surface of everything you can do in this game. there's so much to do in this game that sometimes it can all feel a little overwhelming but in a good way. you never feel bored because there is always something for you to do. Pandora is a huge open world to explore and it has some of the most diverse creatures and enemies I have ever seen in a game. the guns are all randomly generated and they all have there own name, stats, levels and abilities making each and every gun you find unique and different from one another, so you will never get the same gun twice and you will be more proud when you find that one badass gun you really wanted. this game also has an amazing 4 player co-op that you can do all the main missions and side quest together and trade your guns and loot with each other. this game is just infinitely times better when you're playing it with one or more of your friends. onces you get into it you just want to play this game again and again. my recommendation... just buy this game xD you won't regret it ;)Final Score: (10/10) Absolutely Incredible ;)			"

												Gameplay: The shooting mechanics are very competent, although there is not as much differentiation between weapons as there was in the original Borderlands, the weapon variety is still much more impressive than most other games on the market (as of this review). The gunplay is designed to be fast paced, with each character having an equally high jump height and no fall damage. Unfortunately many of the available skills add little to the gameplay, only making minor changes to stats such as damage and reload speed (although there are a few instances in which a particular skill can radically change the way you play). Overall the shooting is fun, but can get repetitive over time. This is remedied by playing with friends, which spices up the general gameplay; but unfortunately repitition and lack of incentivising loot made the game a chore to play for me towards the end.Story: The plot is sullied by an annoying dichotomy between the game's attempts at creating forced emotion and a cheap laugh, moments of particular emotional weight are negated entirely when a sudden line or action from a character attempts to provide comic relief or simply emphasise the game's ludicrous nature; because of this it is hard to take the plot seriously and moments that would otherwise be genuinely funny are simply annoying or distracting. The game has moments which did make me laugh, but often resorts to borderline juvenile jokes, which compared to the few witty lines feel out of place and hamper the overall comedic experience. Graphics: The cell-shaded art style is certainly unique and works in tandem with the semi-realistic world of Pandora to create an environment that is both grounded in reality but also clearly fictional. This is to the game's benefit, immersing the player into the intruiging world without the need for particularly detailed models or textures (not to say that these are lacking, many of the weapons and locations are imbued with a unique style of their own, but as years go by the art style will not age as badly as those games which attempt to portray a pseudo-realistic world, but are limited by current technology).Sound: The soundtrack consists primarily of electronic music, which works in synonym with the fast-paced gameplay. The voice acting is well done as well, with many characters having well voiced dialogues. Sound design throughout the game is well done.Re-playability: There are four different classes, each with a unique special ability (being able to dual-weild weapons, deploy a turret, etc.), but the skills available to each of these classes are not particularly unique, so replaying the game is not especially worthwhile. There are a large amount of challenges, but many can be simply accomplished through normal gameplay, or are very grindy.tl;dr: Great game, but can get repetitive. More fun with friends.			"

												One of the best cooperative games I've ever played. Not only is the single player campaign good, but you just cannot play this game without friends it makes it ten times funner. The maps are pretty decent sized and the weapon choices are just ridiculous.Pros:-Decent map sizes-Great storyline-Literally the best cooperative game you can play with friends-Challenges throughout maps makes for hours upon hours of gameplay-Weapon selection is HUGE-Ranking system is rewarding and fun-Dialogue within game is fun and wonky-Replayability value is HIGHCons:-Some maps can get old/boring-Some missions seem extremely long and dull-Certain missions are pretty pointless-Not really a fun game without playing with friends/cooperativelyOverall a solid 8/10 game.

												Borderlands 2 is spot-on in every way. From the hilarious characters with brilliantly written dialogue to the enticing loot to the zany, phrenetic combat, every aspect of the game is perfectly executed. Gearbox took a risk in casting four (six) new vault hunters to replace those from the original Borderlands, but the new characters fill in their positions excellently. In addition, Lilith, Mordecai, Brick and Roland all play major parts in the game as NPCs, and their presence is welcome. Claptrap returns as well, as humorously moronic as before. The four new vault hunters, Axton (Commando), Zer0 (Assassin), Salvador (Gunzerker), and Maya (Siren), are racing against Handsome Jack, president of the Hyperion Corporation, to reach and open a new vault. In addition to the main four vault hunters, there are two DLC characters, Gaige the Mechromancer and KRIEG the Psycho, who are definitely worth purchasing if you are into the game. They are included in the Game of the Year Edition. The story is entertaining throughout, with plenty of fun side missions to complete if and when you finish the main game. There are also three DLC bonus campaigns which are all extremely fun. In conclusion, Borderlands 2 is a rare 10/10 in my book. It's one of those games that is just plain old fun, without sacrificing a clever, well thought-out story and excellent character design.			"

												This game is brilliant. There's no other way of putting it. This game is fun in single player, and super-fun in co-op.Gameplay:- There is nothing more satisfying in perhaps any other game than seeing a stream of CRITICAL damage indicators streaming off a psycopath/midget/fat person/robot's head.- The variety in guns, grenade mods and shields is unprecedented. In co-op, you'll constantly be comparing your gear to that of your friends, trying out their weapons, trading weapons. All of the gun types are fun to use - especially revolvers. I swear they're magical or something...- The game is a well-made hybrid of FPS and RPG. You can give your character (one of 4 classes in the base game, with 2 more in the GOTY edition) abilities and level them up, enabling you to use better weapons, grenade mods and shield. Story:- Ridiculous humour that works - that about sums it up. You'll encounter crazy situations and missions, but you'll just accept it.- There's an awful lot of it. The main story missions don't often feel recycled, presenting you with different challenges every time. There's plenty of voice acting in both the main campaign and side quests, whcih is impressive considering the volume of these.- There are a fair few unexpected plot twists, but it usually doesn't feel dragged out.- Handsome Jack is both formidable and funny. He's a truly worthy nemesis.- Claptrap makes you want to kill him within 20 seconds of meeting him. I've yet to hear a voice on par with how annoying Claptrap's is.Graphics and Sound:- If you crank the settings up, this game looks pretty nice. The cartoony style means it also runs well on lower-end PCs without looking muddy.- If you have an NVIDIA card, you're in for a treat. There are cloth and liquid PhysX, and you can cut the cloth with bullets. Debris flies off the environment and bounces off things. It makes hectic situations look awesome.- Gun sounds and voice acting are great, everything else is generally OK, not too special.- I've had a couple of unexpected slowdowns and 2-second freezes. This shouldn't happen on my PC really, but I suspect it's PhysX related. I keep PhysX on Medium or High, though, because it's great.Multiplayer:- The game has 2-4 player co-op multiplayer. All missions work in both single-player and co-op, with enemy volume and health scaling to keep difficulty constant.- You can start duels for loot with your fellow players, in the event of disagreement.- Pretty seamless. Invite players to your game from the main menu, and they drop into your world with all your mission progression.- I'd advise that everyone has a different class, otherwise you'll all die at the same time and respawn back at a checkpoint, which gets annoying.- For best experience, everyone in your co-op session should be within about a 10-level range of each other, or the underlevelled character will need reviving constantly.Summary:This game should be compulsory. My life is complete, now that I can shoot midgets with shotguns and find cool loot in portaloos. My advice: buy GOTY - you'll want all the Borderlands you can get.			"

												I started up Borderlands 2 thinking this game would be an average shooter with a crappy story. I had played only a small portion of the original Borderlands. A warning before you buy, the introduction to this game can be boring, but once you start leveling up, spending skill points and gaining unique loot, the game truely starts. As I followed my new 'friend' Claptrap, throughout the world of Pandora I started to realize what a marvel this game truely was. I met new characters. laughed my ♥♥♥ off and starting gaining allies. Handsome Jack, the antagonist, seemed to make me laugh more than anyone else. I thought this game was only goofy and comedic, especially when I met Tiny Tina. As I got to know characters I started to get atttached, although that was a mistake. Epic battles and heart wrenching experiences ensued. This game is definetly an emotional rollercoaster. Besides the story missions there is tons of side missions, but unlike most side missions in other games. Instead of an average side mission, like 'Collect 25 Flowers' or 'Kill 25 Enemies' each side mission contains its own story. Whether it be competely humorous or extremely depressing and sad, every side mission was unique in its own way. Another fantastic thing this game is the amount of loot and different weapons. According to Gearbox software (the game developer) there are over 17 million different guns in this game. If you finish all of the side missions and story missions, the game is constantly being given new DLCs (Downloadable Content) containing tons of missions and hilarious campaigns. If you are looking for tons of fun either by yourself or with friends, Borderlands 2 is for you.			"

												Fun. Want to play a co-op game with friends? This is the game. I really don't recommend playing alone, as you can still have fun, but it's double the experience. Also, ememy's are harder the more players, so it's not a game you are just going to dominate with friends. The game overall is amazing and I think you guys should give it a shot. It's not an easy game either. Don't do side missions, and you will be punished. It's not you have to do side missions all the time, but if you just play the main story, you will be lagging one level or 2 behind.			"

												Fun. Want to play a co-op game with friends? This is the game. I really don't recommend playing alone, as you can still have fun, but it's double the experience. Also, ememy's are harder the more players, so it's not a game you are just going to dominate with friends. The game overall is amazing and I think you guys should give it a shot. It's not an easy game either. Don't do side missions, and you will be punished. It's not you have to do side missions all the time, but if you just play the main story, you will be lagging one level or 2 behind.			"

												Borderlands 2 is and always will be one of my favourite games.It's such a large and expansive game with so many characters to meet and side missions to complete, it's hard to leave this game at the end of the day. Upon completing the storyline in solo, I recommended BL2 to one of my friends, made a new character and pretty much played the whole game again without being at all bored. I can't actually think of a downside to this series other than the fact that they haven't released BL3 yet.			"

												This is hands down one of the best games I've ever played. It is challenging, fun, the loot system is great and the story telling is amazing. And the games is just absurd sometimes, the chaos that is going on on the screen and the funny moments throughout the game. There are also many side quests, which are all great and each has a twist to it. You can spend many hours grinding for the loot you like and exploring every part of this vast world. The co-op is also fun and brings more challenge to the game, as when you have more people the enemies become stronger. Definitely 10/10.			"

												One of the best cooperative games I've ever played. Not only is the single player campaign good, but you just cannot play this game without friends it makes it ten times funner. The maps are pretty decent sized and the weapon choices are just ridiculous.Pros:-Decent map sizes-Great storyline-Literally the best cooperative game you can play with friends-Challenges throughout maps makes for hours upon hours of gameplay-Weapon selection is HUGE-Ranking system is rewarding and fun-Dialogue within game is fun and wonky-Replayability value is HIGHCons:-Some maps can get old/boring-Some missions seem extremely long and dull-Certain missions are pretty pointless-Not really a fun game without playing with friends/cooperativelyOverall a solid 8/10 game.

												Borderlands 2 is spot-on in every way. From the hilarious characters with brilliantly written dialogue to the enticing loot to the zany, phrenetic combat, every aspect of the game is perfectly executed. Gearbox took a risk in casting four (six) new vault hunters to replace those from the original Borderlands, but the new characters fill in their positions excellently. In addition, Lilith, Mordecai, Brick and Roland all play major parts in the game as NPCs, and their presence is welcome. Claptrap returns as well, as humorously moronic as before. The four new vault hunters, Axton (Commando), Zer0 (Assassin), Salvador (Gunzerker), and Maya (Siren), are racing against Handsome Jack, president of the Hyperion Corporation, to reach and open a new vault. In addition to the main four vault hunters, there are two DLC characters, Gaige the Mechromancer and KRIEG the Psycho, who are definitely worth purchasing if you are into the game. They are included in the Game of the Year Edition. The story is entertaining throughout, with plenty of fun side missions to complete if and when you finish the main game. There are also three DLC bonus campaigns which are all extremely fun. In conclusion, Borderlands 2 is a rare 10/10 in my book. It's one of those games that is just plain old fun, without sacrificing a clever, well thought-out story and excellent character design.			"

												Borderlands 2. Those who like it love it, those who hate it always will. Nonetheless, I'm one of those who loves it. I myself have played well over 300 hours of this game across different platforms, and have at least 9 separate characters. The game-play is fluid, easy to jump into, and immensely fun. The amount of enemies spanning from humans, to robots, to crazy ♥♥♥ creatures is immense, and the amount only increases with the second and third play-throughs. And obviously, Borderlands 2's procedural weapon system, with the 12 bazillion guns, is a lot of fun. You never know what you're gonna get. And the DLC's amazingly add even more of these great things into the game, along with more of the hilarious humor that you quickly come to love. Overall, this game is easily in my top three of all time favourites, and might just be up there as #1. I'd recommend it to anybody who likes grinding for levels and loot, and somebody who has a sense of humor.			"

												I have unregretfully poured just a little over 400hrs into this game. It's been nothing short of amazing and definitely ranks amongst the Top 5 this generation. The gameplay, story, drop system and dialogue are MASSIVE (and I'm not exaggerating) improvements over the first game. The main quest doesn't feel as tedious, bland and empty as BL1, in which some will give you the chance to earn slight bonuses, consisting of stronger weapons, shields or even character skins. One of the major overhauls I love the most is the Badass Rank. Completing levels of challenges will increase your BA Rank and give you a token whi you can apply to stat increase for better accuracy, longer duration of DoT effects (shock, fire, corrosive) or overall damage. And your BA Rank is applied to all characters that you create (my BA Rank is around 31,000 or so) so you can start off a new character and be extremely overpowered but in the long run it will pay off as True Vault Hunter Mode will greatly amp up the difficulty. More so with Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (not recommended until Lv61 because of level scaling). You can also earn skins from these challenges as well.Of the core classes available you have Axton the commando, whose Sabre Turret shreds up everything when deployed. Going down specific trees allows the turret to fire rockets, set of a radial nuke or even grant the ability to deploy 2 at once. Maya is a Siren, much like Lilith but instead of Phase Shifting for an advantage, she can use Phase Lock. Phase Lock surrounds the target in a orb when invested into skills like Elated, Sweet Release, Helios and Chain Reaction, you'll set the enemy on fire, drain health (and restore it to your friends) and transfer that orb to the next target. Gaige the Mechomancer (who was available as a preorder bonus before the game launched) has Deathtrap. Deathtrap is basically your scout who'll rip apart anything in sight and his abilities are further amplified when going down the Best Friends Forever tree. I've invested a few points into BFF myself but I'm more partial to Little Big Trouble. LBT primarily focuses on Shock damage, in which some weapons (and shields) can make Gaige literally invincible. There's much more I can say here but I'll wrap this up with: If you see it on sale, better yet the GOTY Edition which includes all of the DLC (not the paid skins) you are definitely getting a huge bang for your buck. 10/10.

Borderlands 2 is one of the best games I have played, especially in recent history. There is very little to dislike about it: it has a great soundtrack, the cel shading art style is still gorgeous, it has the best sense of humor of any game (besides The Stanley Parable), the balance is really tight, a variety of playable characters to match any playstyle. and all of the loot and skill trees an RPG fan will love. Throw in co-op with friends, and I can't think of a better recipe for a good time. It's really a modern take on the Diablo series.One of the biggest complaints people had about the original Borderlands was that the story was nothing to write home about, and the end was a big disappointment. Gearbox very clearly went to great lengths to rectify this in Borderlands 2; they had a clear antagonist right from the beginning, and they did everything they could to make us hate his guts. I think they may have focused a little too much on this however, because there wasn't a whole lot else going on. The end boss was also really easy; it had a lot of health, but it dealt so little damage, I don't think my shields ever got depleted.Thankfully those are really the only complaints that I have about the game. Everything else was a big improvement over the original: more enemy variety, more interesting characters (the characters you played as in the original take center stage and get a lot more development than I was expecting). Even if I hadn't had my best friend to play with, I would have had a great time with Borderlands 2. I'd say that a reasonable price to pay is $40, but it's been around for so long you will most certainly pay less than that. We will soon be diving into the DLCs, so you'll be hearing about those soon enough.			"

												Trust me when I say that trying to rate a favourite game and remain open for the contras of the game is really hard.Short review: Loot’n’Shoot, Shoot’n’Loot.Long review:I bought this game for one reason only – my friends bought it and I would have been bored to play anything else on my own. Prior to playing it, I didn’t like the typical cartoonish style and wasn’t really excited about the option to remove the thick border lines either.So I bought it, installed it and started playing with my friends – I still wasn’t very excited about the game – but maybe because the first few missions aren’t very captivating. But a bit further in the playthrough and a few level-ups later…. BOOM! I fell in love! I obsessed with the characters, storyline and loved the dialogues. All I wanted to do in my spare time was playing BL2! At a certain amount of characters and playthroughs, I stopped playing. And when I decided to play a bit again, I remembered the love…DLCs:I have all the playable DLCs and enjoyed them all. If you liked it and don’t have a budget to buy all the DLCs, then I believe you should definitely get ‘Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep’ and ‘Borderlands 2: Mr. Torgue’s Campaign of Carnage’.The mini DLCs are really really short (Headhunter 1: Bloody Harvest; Headhunter 2: Wattle Gobbler; Headhunter 3: Mercenary Day; Headhunter 4: Wedding Day Massacre; Headhunter 5: Son of Crawmerax;). On the other hand you get to do fun stuff like *SPOILERS!*  drinking whiskey, making babies cry, kill happy loving couples, kill drunk enemies and chase loot leprechauns…Contras:The only thing I can point out here is what happened to me when me and my friends. What happened to me is that me and my friends started new characters to play together, but of them didn’t play as much as the others. This lead to a huge difference in levels and the low level character being useless and unable to enjoy the game. Of course, there are ways to work around this and this is isn’t a flaw in the game itself. Nevertheless, I do believe this still should be said, as BL2 is not like Dead Island, where all characters can be different levels and can still play together (due to level compensation).Deathtrap is quite buggy when you’re in the menu:

Pros:I like the graphics, even though I can’t play on the maxed out settings or with PhysX on high quality. Having the graphics settings on max looks awesome though (as per my knowledge there are a few bugs showing on the highest settings).Finding and joining someone else’s game is easy and straight forward and the community is awesome – if you ask, you’ll be helped by complete strangers. As I prefer coop games, this made my gaming experience really enjoyable. It should be noted that, as BL2 is a coop game, there shouldn’t be any reason for players not to be nice, but still… Nice people become more an exception in real life and on the internet, so I have to point this out.What I love is the dialogues, the NPCs response when you engage in talking with them (check screens in the bottom, but beware –  SPOILERS!), the characters’ story and custom dialogues depending on the character you play (in the mini DLC’s).For me, the biggest ‘pro’ for BL2 is the fact that it made me laugh so hard, so many times. If anything can make you laugh and cry at the same time, then it’s worth spending the time. Of course, humour varies, so it can’t be a guaranteed fun time for everyone.Will you like the game or not? I don’t know… It really depends on what you expect and like, so make your choice.Screenshots = Spoilers!NPC dialogue lines:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=234047759http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=234047391http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=165472838http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=234047552Typical BL2 humour:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=155631698http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=180275753http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=231877045http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=205405674 "

												Let me lay it down for you guys, Borderlands 2 is one of my new favorite games in my library. Borderlands 2 is a hybrid FPS RPG 4 player Co-Op game. Now, when I say RPG, I don't mean something like Final Fantasy, Skyrim, or Dragon Age. Those games need you to be fully invested in the RPG elements of the game, and while I do like that sometimes, other times it gets boring for me. Borderlands 2's system feels very unobtrusive and can produce some good results even if you are randomly picking things in the skill tree. But if you do put some thought into your character's skills and how you play the game, you could be rewarded with a character that is perfect just for you. A good thing to mention is that there is only 4 (now 6 with DLC) classes to choose. While that doesn't seem like many to some people, each charcter is unique in skillset and apperance. I must say, even though it didn't feel like then, the first 1 to 2 hours are slow. You don't even unlock skills untill lvl 5. That goes away once you hit the ""hub"" city of Sanctuary. This is where the story picks up and the one of my favorite parts of the game shines, the side quests. These missions never take themselves too seriously and sometimes are quite inventive, more than the standard fetch quests other games make you do. And everyonce in a while you start a quest that turns into a large chain of quests, building this little mini story (A good example of this is Ellie's Clan War quest). The main story is okay, much better than the orignial's, but it isn't close to the amount of depth some other shooters have. However the writing is great and is very funny. All of the NPCs have their own personality and some you can really begin to love after a while. Except Claptrap. I can love him in short bursts.For the FPS element, it comes down to the guns. Remember when I said the RPG system was unobtrusive? I kinda lied, as I have spent lots of time just sitting and comparing the stats of guns, shields, class mods, relics, and grenades to each other. Guns can be pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, snipers, SMGs, and rocket launchers. All equipment has a manufacturer which decides for guns what it's strenght has. So Jacobs guns are usually high damage, low capcity, semi-auto guns, but the fire as fast as you can pull the trigger. Hyperion guns actually get more accurate the more shots the fire. And there are more brands with more effects. Then there is elemental types that do more damage to certain types of enemies, like fire doing more damge to biological enemies, corriosive doing more to armored enemies, ect. So when ever you pick up a gun you have a lot of things to consider.Speaking of guns and loot there is a serious issue when it come to Co-Op. When an enemy drops a gun, it only drops one. Not a problem in single player. But with 4 people that causes issues, especially on bosses who drop really valuable loot. For me that is my only serious issue with the game, and I play by myself mostly anyway.I've had lot's of fun playing this game, and if you don't own it, I suggest you do. I also suggest you get the Game of the Year edition which is a great value. And remember in the words of Markus the gunsalesman, ""No Refunds!""			"

												I have been an avid fan of the Borderlands series since I first played the original installment back in 2008. Below is my personal impression of its pros and cons:Pros: + Engaging, immersive gameplay. + Fun and worthwhile cooperative multiplayer experience. + Graphics and art-style is timeless, aging through the generations remarkably well. + Creative characters, both playable and NPC. + Great level design and set-dressing. There are lots of little details to find and explore. + Detailed universe, with a captivating storyline that further motivates you to keep playing. + Great gameplay balance with the leveling system, making progress feel rewarding. + Varied characters with a range of possible play-styles. + Excellent compatibility in terms of your computer's performance. Even low-end computers with generic graphic cards can comfortably play (with reasonable quality adjustments). + LOADS of extremely entertaining and creative DLC to play after you've finished the main story. DLC campaigns are also fairly priced. + Tiny Tina. + Meat Bicycles.Cons: - No evident compensation for high latency in network play. - No in-game method to view your ping. I often try judging my latency by how long it takes a bullet to leave my gun after firing. - There's an anticlimax once a character has reached the highest possible experience level. Each subsequent kill and other progress after that, comes accross as less rewarding. - A character becomes progressively more difficult to fully level up. Less experienced FPS players will likely find the tougher play-through modes more frustrating than fun. Playing with friends, especially in True Vault Hunter Mode or Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode is definitely recommended. - Relatively predictable storyline for the main campaign, but still worthwhile.Ultimately, I fully recommend this game, as well as the other titles in the series, despite their shortcomings. It's an experience I always look forward to, whether I get to play with friends, or when I just wing it solo. There's a unique joy in finding that occasional super-rare item, or popping the head off a cheeky psycho that wants to be buried upside-down!			"

												This game is really good. It has a solid theme throughout with witty, refreshing characters and dialogue. If you enjoy RPG's and FPS I would highly reccommend this game to you. An absolute classic which will remain as one of my favourite games. It has its glitches though like gun merging and infinite ammo however this is only possible on singleplayer so it doesn't ruin the game too much. I feel this game gives a better experience if you play this in Multiplayer with friends however the loot isn't shared among everyone (only the xp and money) so the guns have to be literally nabbed by everyone. D: Either way, I enjoyed this game and I will still continue playing it! Great game, with great price! ;D			"

												Let me introduce you to probably the greatest game you will play, and you don't know it yet. Don't be fooled with the gameplay videos on youtube and the trailer ones which does not at all reflect the actual gameplay, because it's the atmosphere with YOU inside the game that makes the game truly amazing. The story is incredibly great that you'd love playing the game over and over again with different characters. I have only bought the game just today and I am completely amazed with how you play the game - the story has a repetitive gameplay (I haven't even progessed much but I already want to replay.) with different characters, with your friends and all, and along with that you will want your dear Clap-trap to shut up as he talks non-sense.Oh also, there are vehicles that reminds me of Far Cry and it's really hilarious to try to ride the car as your friend tries to shoot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monsters. I ended up crashing the car into mountain which ended up getting stuck. (DAMNIT MONSTERS.) Maybe you'll have a better luck. It is worth noting that the class skills are easy to use and learn, and I usually find games like this incredibly confusing (Skyrim, for example). It's a nice starter game for people who want to get used to class-type games.All in all, I must admit that this game is truly one of the best games I've ever played, and was definitely worth buying the whole game and it's DLC's while it's on sale. You should definitely not miss the chance to try this game.			"

REVIEW: BORDERLANDS 2: GAME OF THE YEAR EDITIONNote: I played this game solo.I’m generally not a major fan of FPSes. I’m more of an RPG sort of guy. And yet, I found myself interested and intrigued by the Borderlands series. When the series went on sale not long ago, I canvassed some friends’ opinions, whether I should get the first game, or the second. I had, admittedly, enjoyed watching the Two Saiyans Play videos of the latter. Having been told to get the second game, that’s what I did, getting the Game of the Year edition. But was it worth it? **** the hell, yeah!Five years have passed since the opening of the original Vault. The Hyperion Corporation, led by the egotistical and petulant tyrant Handsome Jack, has begun to tighten its grip on Pandora, killing bandits and the normal populace alike, all in the name of ‘taming’ the border world. As rumours of a new Vault spread, Jack makes the call for new Vault Hunters, only to kill them. But that was a mistake. A new group of Vault Hunters will rise, team up with old ones, and embark on a quest to stop Handsome Jack. But they have a hard task ahead of them, as Jack has more than one trump card up his sleeve…I enjoy games with a good story, and one thing that Borderlands does very well is the story. It’s like the mutant offspring of Mad Max and Red Dwarf, with a touch of Blake’s 7 (or Firefly, if you need a more modern show) thrown into the mix. Funny, full of references, and yet serious and full of pathos when it needs to, it’ll certainly have some shocks for fans of the first game. It’s also populated with a cast with the good, the bad, and the fugly. The storylines of the DLC ones are fine enough, though the real star storyline of the DLC campaigns is that of Tiny Tina’s Assault on Dragon Keep. It’s also one of those rare sequels that you can enjoy fully without any knowledge of the previous game.The graphics of the Borderlands series are very distinctive, being pseudo-cel shaded. They’re also pretty damned good, giving the right style and vibe to this world. There’s also a variety of landscapes, from desert and arid lands, to tundra, to cities, and even verdant mountains. The Borderlands series shows that realistic graphics aren’t always the way to go, that stylised graphics can often be better than the more realistic stuff some games seems to want to tend towards.Sound-wise, the game is superlative. The music is spot-on, albeit not as spectacular at times as I want it to be. The voice-acting, however, is something else, with particular praise going to Dameon Clarke as Handsome Jack, Cherami Leigh as Gaige, Jason Douglas as Krieg, Brina Palencia as Moxxi, Chris Rager as Torgue, Colleen Clinkenbeard as Lilith, Scarlett, and Tannis, David Eddings as Claptrap, and Ashly Burch as Tiny Tina. They, along with so many others, make this game wonderful, giving life to characters that make us laugh, cringe, and cry.But a game would be nothing without gameplay, and as far as FPSes are concerned, Borderlands 2 ****ing rocks. While I am not enticed by the series’ claims of ‘87 bazillion guns’, procedurally generated (though the elemental properties are certainly enjoyable), the hybridisation of an FPS and an RPG is considerably more interesting. Each character is given a unique attack ability or Action Skill, as well as a variety of abilities you can invest points in, RPG style, to customise your character’s abilities. The game itself can get a bit grindy at times, but thankfully, it’s one of the games that will have you having fun while doing so most of the time. The four DLC campaigns also add some substantial playtime to the game, and the two DLC characters are bloody good. Not only that, but it’s a game that you may very want to play through again, right from the beginning, which is why the True Vault Hunter mode may appeal to those who do want to do so.If you had to get one FPS to play in your entire life, then I would have to recommend Borderlands 2, hands-down. Get the Game of the Year edition. You won’t regret it.RATING: *****EDIT: Nominated this for the ""Five More Minutes"" Award for the Steam Awards 2016.			"

												Borderlands 2, a game without borders. Wait, did that make sense?Now that we got that paradox out of the way, Borderlands 2. It's, ♥♥♥♥ing, great!Borderlands 2, a game with endless possibilities. At least, when it comes to guns. This game never gets old. You get new weapons all the time, upgrade your character at least 10 times every time you play.I seriously played this game hundreds of times. I made tons of characters, just to narrow down to play with a specific type of gun, and it's still awesome to do. The replayability of this game is awesome. Even though the quests are the same, your playstyle is never the same because of all the random weapons you find. I haven't even gotten to play all the DLC yet, that's how much fun I have just playing the regular game. I haven't even beaten true vault hunter mode yet o.oAll in all, great game.

There are a number of big differences between BL1 and BL2 but if you can see get past those this is a game you would not regret buying.Some fantastic scripting with voice talents.. a return of a a number of the Orginal cast for cameo spots.. and a truely epic saga.. Some very serious questions of your own beliefs in reguards to Bandits and Handsome Jack. My vote .. go buy it you won't reget it.			"

												Incredible game. This game has taken Claptrap as my favorite NPC of all time, Handsome Jack as best villain, and the best combat system ever. The story is great. Even though I haven't played the first game, it was very easy to follow along. I'm not going to spoil anything, but the story is short and sweet. It's the perfect length. When you are just about to get tired of doing missions over and over again, it ends. There are mountains of side missions to keep you going and the multiple different playthroughs also keep the game alive. Literally millions of guns and endless hours of fun.			"

												This game is a wonderful example of how to make games replayable! This game is a perfect balance between lots of great loot & A first person shooter game. The jokes are funny, the loot is cool, and It leaves me wanting more! Gearbox has made a beloved FPS franchise that I hope will continue. Gearbox deserves the 20$ asking price for this gem of a game. However, there is one problem i have with it. For Some Legendarys, the drop rates are insanly low, to the point where you spend hours trying to get them off the specific boss they drop from, to the point where you have to ""Dupe"" (duplicate) other people's weapons just to enjoy the game. Other than that, i think this game deserves to be loved and remebered as a true milestone in gaming!                                                                                  9/10			"

												This game is really fun. With exciting AND addictive game-play that stays fresh even past the 10th play-through I am never bored with this game. The story is actually great and the superb voice acting makes it hard to not like the characters from the bandits to handsome Jack himself, on that the characters are well made and written and each is unique from the main cast (Zero, Maya, Axton and Salvador) to all the bosses, even to npc's such a Moxxi and Crazy Earl, each has a nice backstory from obtainable audio logs and also them talking to you through missions and just seeing them in generalThe humor plays a big part as well and is one of the main attractions of the Borderlands franchise but another is the graphics, the graphics look great overall and the PhysX makes it even better, the iconic graphics though not like Battlefield or Metro in quality are still amazing if you have a close look at the world in Borderlands 2, a change from Borderlands 1's post-apocalyptic landscape.The DLC are a must have, maybe not the skin packs so much but they are nice non-the-less, the real gems are the actual main DLC's, some are serious and to the campaign and some are crazy, each DLC is made around a character like Mr Torgue, the owner of the explosive guns but my favorite was the second to final boss, Professor Nakayama, (SPOILERS) He looks like he will mutate or something from the eridium markings but me and my friends were too busy laughing when he fell down the stairs and on each step he hit, his lifebar went down a chunk, easily one of the funniest moments in Borderlands (In my opinion)I had this on console and clocked litterally 1000's of hours on it, soon to be building a beast of a computer and will be returning to the Borderlands to have some fun and shoot some bandits in closing this game truly deserved Game of the Year and remains my favorite game of all time, it truely deserves this place and if anyone doesnt have this game you are missing out, it isnt everyones 'cup of tea' but for less that £5/$10 it is well worth it even if you arent a big fan and only play it once.NOTE: THIS IS QUITE BIASED AS I AM A HUGE FAN OF THE SERIES AND HAVE GOT A LOT MORE HOURS ON CONSOLEGraphics - 8/10Humour - 9/10Plot - 7/10Lifetime - 9/10Gameplay - 10/10			"

												Very surprised. Stylish. Amusing all round. Great Story character introductions and character to the game. Quite immersive. Great in co-op. FOV still seems a little distracting but nothing like the first game. Driving is still the strangest method I have ever seen used, not suited to a mouse and keyboard,I keep thinking how it would be well suited to a persistant mmo style of gameplay.Saying all that would probably not fancy it solo.

												Borderlands 2 is and always will be one of my favourite games.It's such a large and expansive game with so many characters to meet and side missions to complete, it's hard to leave this game at the end of the day. Upon completing the storyline in solo, I recommended BL2 to one of my friends, made a new character and pretty much played the whole game again without being at all bored. I can't actually think of a downside to this series other than the fact that they haven't released BL3 yet.			"

												I have unregretfully poured just a little over 400hrs into this game. It's been nothing short of amazing and definitely ranks amongst the Top 5 this generation. The gameplay, story, drop system and dialogue are MASSIVE (and I'm not exaggerating) improvements over the first game. The main quest doesn't feel as tedious, bland and empty as BL1, in which some will give you the chance to earn slight bonuses, consisting of stronger weapons, shields or even character skins. One of the major overhauls I love the most is the Badass Rank. Completing levels of challenges will increase your BA Rank and give you a token whi you can apply to stat increase for better accuracy, longer duration of DoT effects (shock, fire, corrosive) or overall damage. And your BA Rank is applied to all characters that you create (my BA Rank is around 31,000 or so) so you can start off a new character and be extremely overpowered but in the long run it will pay off as True Vault Hunter Mode will greatly amp up the difficulty. More so with Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (not recommended until Lv61 because of level scaling). You can also earn skins from these challenges as well.Of the core classes available you have Axton the commando, whose Sabre Turret shreds up everything when deployed. Going down specific trees allows the turret to fire rockets, set of a radial nuke or even grant the ability to deploy 2 at once. Maya is a Siren, much like Lilith but instead of Phase Shifting for an advantage, she can use Phase Lock. Phase Lock surrounds the target in a orb when invested into skills like Elated, Sweet Release, Helios and Chain Reaction, you'll set the enemy on fire, drain health (and restore it to your friends) and transfer that orb to the next target. Gaige the Mechomancer (who was available as a preorder bonus before the game launched) has Deathtrap. Deathtrap is basically your scout who'll rip apart anything in sight and his abilities are further amplified when going down the Best Friends Forever tree. I've invested a few points into BFF myself but I'm more partial to Little Big Trouble. LBT primarily focuses on Shock damage, in which some weapons (and shields) can make Gaige literally invincible. There's much more I can say here but I'll wrap this up with: If you see it on sale, better yet the GOTY Edition which includes all of the DLC (not the paid skins) you are definitely getting a huge bang for your buck. 10/10.

												Gameplay: The shooting mechanics are very competent, although there is not as much differentiation between weapons as there was in the original Borderlands, the weapon variety is still much more impressive than most other games on the market (as of this review). The gunplay is designed to be fast paced, with each character having an equally high jump height and no fall damage. Unfortunately many of the available skills add little to the gameplay, only making minor changes to stats such as damage and reload speed (although there are a few instances in which a particular skill can radically change the way you play). Overall the shooting is fun, but can get repetitive over time. This is remedied by playing with friends, which spices up the general gameplay; but unfortunately repitition and lack of incentivising loot made the game a chore to play for me towards the end.Story: The plot is sullied by an annoying dichotomy between the game's attempts at creating forced emotion and a cheap laugh, moments of particular emotional weight are negated entirely when a sudden line or action from a character attempts to provide comic relief or simply emphasise the game's ludicrous nature; because of this it is hard to take the plot seriously and moments that would otherwise be genuinely funny are simply annoying or distracting. The game has moments which did make me laugh, but often resorts to borderline juvenile jokes, which compared to the few witty lines feel out of place and hamper the overall comedic experience. Graphics: The cell-shaded art style is certainly unique and works in tandem with the semi-realistic world of Pandora to create an environment that is both grounded in reality but also clearly fictional. This is to the game's benefit, immersing the player into the intruiging world without the need for particularly detailed models or textures (not to say that these are lacking, many of the weapons and locations are imbued with a unique style of their own, but as years go by the art style will not age as badly as those games which attempt to portray a pseudo-realistic world, but are limited by current technology).Sound: The soundtrack consists primarily of electronic music, which works in synonym with the fast-paced gameplay. The voice acting is well done as well, with many characters having well voiced dialogues. Sound design throughout the game is well done.Re-playability: There are four different classes, each with a unique special ability (being able to dual-weild weapons, deploy a turret, etc.), but the skills available to each of these classes are not particularly unique, so replaying the game is not especially worthwhile. There are a large amount of challenges, but many can be simply accomplished through normal gameplay, or are very grindy.tl;dr: Great game, but can get repetitive. More fun with friends.			"

												One of the best cooperative games I've ever played. Not only is the single player campaign good, but you just cannot play this game without friends it makes it ten times funner. The maps are pretty decent sized and the weapon choices are just ridiculous.Pros:-Decent map sizes-Great storyline-Literally the best cooperative game you can play with friends-Challenges throughout maps makes for hours upon hours of gameplay-Weapon selection is HUGE-Ranking system is rewarding and fun-Dialogue within game is fun and wonky-Replayability value is HIGHCons:-Some maps can get old/boring-Some missions seem extremely long and dull-Certain missions are pretty pointless-Not really a fun game without playing with friends/cooperativelyOverall a solid 8/10 game.

												Borderlands 2 is spot-on in every way. From the hilarious characters with brilliantly written dialogue to the enticing loot to the zany, phrenetic combat, every aspect of the game is perfectly executed. Gearbox took a risk in casting four (six) new vault hunters to replace those from the original Borderlands, but the new characters fill in their positions excellently. In addition, Lilith, Mordecai, Brick and Roland all play major parts in the game as NPCs, and their presence is welcome. Claptrap returns as well, as humorously moronic as before. The four new vault hunters, Axton (Commando), Zer0 (Assassin), Salvador (Gunzerker), and Maya (Siren), are racing against Handsome Jack, president of the Hyperion Corporation, to reach and open a new vault. In addition to the main four vault hunters, there are two DLC characters, Gaige the Mechromancer and KRIEG the Psycho, who are definitely worth purchasing if you are into the game. They are included in the Game of the Year Edition. The story is entertaining throughout, with plenty of fun side missions to complete if and when you finish the main game. There are also three DLC bonus campaigns which are all extremely fun. In conclusion, Borderlands 2 is a rare 10/10 in my book. It's one of those games that is just plain old fun, without sacrificing a clever, well thought-out story and excellent character design.			"

												Incredible game. This game has taken Claptrap as my favorite NPC of all time, Handsome Jack as best villain, and the best combat system ever. The story is great. Even though I haven't played the first game, it was very easy to follow along. I'm not going to spoil anything, but the story is short and sweet. It's the perfect length. When you are just about to get tired of doing missions over and over again, it ends. There are mountains of side missions to keep you going and the multiple different playthroughs also keep the game alive. Literally millions of guns and endless hours of fun.			"

You can choose between 4 (6) classes,You can hold up to 4 weapons, which can be (depending on the class) be reinforced with skills. For every level up, you'll get skill points to build up the 3 skill trees. Me and my friends played this game in coop, and it made lots of fun. If you're looking for a nice coop game to pick up or just searching a nice shooter, you should get it! 9/10			"

												Saying I love this game is an understatement. I could play this game and never tire of it, and it's that kind of endless re-playability that makes Borderlands 2 one of the best buying decisions you'll ever make. A word of warning though: make sure you have at least one friend to play it with. Multiplayer is what truly makes this game worth playing every single day. Sure, playing the campaigns solo is fun and satisfying on its own, but with a friend (or friends) the game takes on a whole new dimension of enjoyment. I love every bit of dialogue in this game, the writing is spot-on hilarious, and even emotionally touching at times. And the weapons....oh, the weapons~    Searching for rare, legendary or otherwise badass weaponry is a reason to play in and of itself. It seems the possibilites in this world are truly endless. It's an action FPS on the outside, sure, but I love just how much of an adventure RPG-element there is at the heart of the game in terms of style and character skill development. You care about the characters plights, as well as the story itself. Borderlands 2 really has its own personality, and you can immerse yourself completely in this crazy world. Another thing to mention is the DLC. There are plenty of extra missions to choose from, and it only adds to the replay value. In fact, you're much better off just buying the Game of the Year edition since it includes a lot of them.  Since I mentioned RPG's earlier, I will specifically suggest Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep as my favorite of all the DLC missions. If you enjoy Magic the Gathering, Final Fantasy, Dungeons and Dragons or anything like it---you will experience a nerdgasm with this one.			"

												Borderlands remains to this day my favorite game due to its uniqueness of combining rpg and fps elements with a great story and voice acting that were fun and entertained me for basically months of gameplay time, some of which isn't on Steam before I decided to buy the GOTY just so I could get all the achievements for this game. So don't get me wrong for the review below, but:I never hated jumping mechanics and invisible walls more than in this game, ever! Or map designs that make you cover a distance by going on an arch or a zig-zag to reach your objective just to add more gameplay time, and this happens especially in the dlcs. The first two aspects persist from the first game, but the third.. oh man. Also on that note I hated the most all the quests in Tundra Express given by Tiny Tina, because the entrance to her cave is located in exactly the opposite direction of all the objectives except one. I can't even remember how many times I've cursed the developers for making me run around a god damn rock to turn in something, just to get another in almost the same spot. Also the story is kinda forced and lacks character which made me quit the game two or three times before level 25 because I didn't connect with what was going on in it, and this is the first game I've pre-ordered! I still prefer the first Borderlands for that where you actually care about your hero and what's going on, you wanna get involved in changing the situation.Other than that it's still a great game built in the same manner with a lot of content that can keep you playing many hours alone or with friends and they did improve on the later part, connectivity becoming easily accesible which is great because that's why we're all using this Steam platform after all. So I can see why it lacks in some content, just to make up in other related to the multiplayer category, like the badass ranks and bonuses and all the playthroughs (hell in the first game max health and shields were in the two to four thousand limit), so the players have something to return to that doesn't feel absolete after just a few hours. I hope to see a Borderlands MMO one day, which seems they're getting closer and closer to and might be the perfect game yet as the developers usually listen to what the community asks for and they constantly improve the new releases on that matter.

												Flat out one of the greatest shooters of all time, but I think everyone knows that already? But in case you didn't... now you do. Endless content, HOURS of gameplay, and replayability. 3 different skill trees for every class to make rerolling characters fun. Can pick it up and set it back down at anytime. Can find GOTY edition cheap. There are only a few DLC's you don't get with GOTY. Google is your friend, I'm not here to hold your hand haha. It's a must have for any gamer.			"

												This is hands down one of the best games I've ever played. It is challenging, fun, the loot system is great and the story telling is amazing. And the games is just absurd sometimes, the chaos that is going on on the screen and the funny moments throughout the game. There are also many side quests, which are all great and each has a twist to it. You can spend many hours grinding for the loot you like and exploring every part of this vast world. The co-op is also fun and brings more challenge to the game, as when you have more people the enemies become stronger. Definitely 10/10.			"

												EDIT: Nominated this game for ""5 more minutes!"" Steam Award. Bordrlands 2 is filled with content even if you only have the base game. However the DLCs give you the fullest and most enjoyable experience, 100+ hours guarranteed!Best FPS ever! Are you tired of Call of Duty and Battlefield? Do you want something new, and something more various? Do you want loot? More loot? EVEN MORE LOOT? If the answers are yes, then Borderlands 2 is your game! You go on quests, and receive items, and do Badass Challenges, and you never stop getting loot! I have over 100 hours in this game, and I still couldn't complete all DLC-s. AND there are 3 modes to play: Normal, True Vault Hunter AND ULTIMATE VAULT HUNTER! So if you are looking for a game, which you can play for years, Borderlands 2 is your game!			"

												Borderlands 2 is one of the best games I've ever played. It has so much content in it. I just started a challenge for myself and maybe you should start it for yourself, to get the most out of Borderlands 2. (BTW I have all the DLC's)My challenge is to get with every character (Axton, Zero, Maya, Salvador, Gaige and Krieg) to an 100% save. 100% means for me, 100% complete Normal mode, 100% complete TVHM (True Vault Hunter Mode) 100% and 100% complete UVHM (Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode). This will include the DLC Main Quests and the Side Quests. In UVHM I will also reach OP8 (Overpowered Level 8)This is my way to get the most out of Borderlands 2. If you not already have this game, buy it now or on sale, cause its worth it :D-XtremeKingZ			"

												Borderlands 2 is (obviously) a sequel to Borderlands, set on the world of Pandora, where you, a vaulthunter, have to take it up against Hyperion and their leader which is also your nemesis: Handsome Jack.PROS:+ Enormous amount of gameplay (can vary between 50-200+ hours with different characters and DLC)+ Multiple characters to play with, each with their own special ability and skill tree+ Giant library of highly creative weapons+ Has multiple stories and sidestories+ Upgradable by various DLC's+ Many places to go and many enemies to fight+ Looting is incredibly fun+ Many funny dialogues, jokes and charactersCONS:- A lot of ingame items require additional payment- The weapons often feel a little unsatisfying in terms of physics and sound- You die a lot, and if you die in certain areas, you have fight through the entire area again, including walking all the wayBoth the type of gamers looking for action as well as gamers looking for a game rich in story: get Borderlands 2.My rating: 8.5/10			"

												This game is near flawless. With exciting AND addictive game-play that stays fresh even past the 2nd play-through I am never bored with this Game. Especially considering how easy it really is to play with Friends. I do wish it was more possible for people of different Level ranges to play together but we cant have it all.In stark contrast to the first Borderlands, the story is actually compelling and the superb voice acting makes it hard not to be drawn in. The Humor plays a big part as well and never feels out of place in the abstract Borderlands Universe.The Graphics look great on both high and mid range Systems, offering highly stylized Graphics that still have a touch of Realism. In closing I must commend Gearbox Software for their love-letter to the PC community. This Game truly deserved Game of the Year. “You're gonna be my new meat bicycle!” 100/100			"

												If you enjoyed the first Borderlands then this will fill like the mega deluxe sequel to it. Gearbox doesn't change up the formula much. It's just more of the good stuff. More highly detailed levels. More classes to play. More guns and interesting gun stats (like throwing your guns like grenades when you reload!). More Story. Way more jokes from the crude, to the ludicrous, dark, and ironic.I have three criticisms but they are small. First the level designs are very highly detailed with scale. Some areas have seven floors and often times you can see multiple floors at the same time. It can be hard to process every thing that is happening at once. Second the NPCs talk over each other. If you want to hear what they say just stop moving. If you trigger another conversation it will just completely cut off the other one with no hope of retrieving it. Some of the areas are really long and you can easily be killing guys for up to an hour before another plot exposition. Maybe I'm just ADD but you can easily forget what was going on.Over all Borderlands 2 is very very good with over 30 hours of content. I finished this game and felt like I could easily find another 15 hours and that's before all the extra DLC. The co-op in this game is no joke either. The enemies scale accordingly so it's not a cake walk and working together is a must in this shooter.  Easily worth it at full price. Pretty much a must buy at $15.			"

												After more than 200 hours of gameplay (which were totally worth it) on all three game mods through numerous side missions and DLCs, I have few things to say about this game. Like, it's awesome!It was a great idea to combine a FPS with an RPG in case of Borderlands, it's even more so with Borderlands 2. Compared to its predecessor, Borderlands 2 has a lot of improvements: better graphics, better characters, more convenient interface, easier loot picking (money and ammo is picked automatically, by walking over them), more DLCs, more humor, more various enemies, more maps, more action, better skill trees.I think what makes Borderlands 2 such a great game and a must-have, is its unique setting of Pandora with its outlaws, monsters and dark politically incorrect humour.However, there are some things that are annoying and/or disappointing.1. Loot system: 98% of weapons and equipment are crap. All great or just decent weapons are rare. The unique reward weapons often are worse than the regular weapons that you have already equiped. Also, in Borderlands 2 there are only 5 million weapon combinations, whereas in Borderlands there are 17 million combinations. With that said, a lot of time is spent on comparing and sorting weapons, which at some point becomes frustrating. I wish there were some kind of automatic recommendations that could help save time. Well, there is a colour system – orange weapons and purple weapons should theroretically be the best, but that's not always the case. I think a filter system would be handy, when a player can set preferences for potential loot.2. Side missions: some of the side missions are really stupid, like ''go there and pick X number of things'' or ''walk a skag (sort of a dog-like monster) for 5 mins not killing it''. Such missions are typical in RPG games, but in my opinion this should have been one RPG aspect Gearbox should have skipped. Also, a major part of side missions has a very weak storyline or no storyline at all.3. Maps: some might disagree, but I personally hate these serpentine-like maps with endless turns and hidden passages. Also, it's hard to locate a target in a monochromatic, schematic representation of a multi-level area in a mini-map. You have to guess on which level the target actually is, e.g., in a cave or on a cliff, on the ground floor or rooftop. I'd prefer if the distance would be indicated as in Assassin's Creed.4. Fast travel stations: you travel distance and between maps either by vehicles or using fast travel stations. As a result, lots of time is spent by either running or driving and fighting the enemies you had already killed before. I'd rather prefer an outpost system as in FarCry 3.5. Vehicles: often it's much easier to be a pedestrian. Besides, the vehicle guns are weak and impractical.6. Unbalanced leveling and enemies. Apart from Ultimate Vault Hunter mode, in which you face enemies who are two levels higher than you and quite hard to kill, in Normal Mode and True Vault Hunter mode, you mostly face weak enemies and around level 30 further leveling becomes annoyingly slow, since the experience gained is ridiculously small but the necesssary amount of experience points gets higher and higher with each level. Also, I don't think that there should be a level cap (which is 72 with the second upgrade pack), because some of the bosses in the Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode are of level 80 - that means that you can't possibly kill them.7. This game is pushing Co-Op, because some of the missions are so hard, it's almost impossible to beat the game in single-player - you just get tired of dying and wasting expensive ammo on hordes of enemies.8. Finally, I don't think that it's fair that all the DLCs are not included in the Season Pass or GOTY edition. With the exhausting level-ups and search for legendary weapons, it's just plain exploitation of players. It's a sort of corporate behaviour you would expect from EA and Ubisoft.Although there are points when Borderlands feels just like a pointless loot grab and desperate skill tree development, it is one of my top favourite games. I hope the Borderlands Presequel would be even better.9/10.P.S. I recommend to read this more detailed review by Michale Barnes: http://www.nohighscores.com/2012/09/26/why-i-think-borderlands-2-sucks-but-i-like-it/. It gives an honest representation of what the gameplay actually is like.			"

												В игре открытый мир, состоящий из трех десятков отделенных друг от друга локаций. Каждый кусочек Пандоры обставлен по-своему: помимо ландшафтного эксклюзива на диких территориях встречаются градообразующие предприятия, пещеры монстров, лагеря бандитов, небольшие деревушки, пустыни, трубопроводы, индустриальный завод, лаборатория с удивительными растениями и животными, высоченные ледники. Дизайн каждого объекта, каждого населенного пункта – изумителен; уникальный, рисованный графический стиль; тщательная проработка каждой детали. В игре многообразие оружия. Игра автоматически генерирует характеристики находимых или «выпадающих» из монстров экземпляров, создавая огромнейший арсенал: начиная от обычных пистолетов и заканчивая снайперками с разрывными патронами и кислотными гранатометами. В игре много юмора и побочных и сюжетных миссий. Музыкальное сопровождение восхитительно: мелодия чутко реагирует на появление больших скоплений агрессивных врагов и очень хорошо сочетается с общим стилем локаций. Есть сетевая игра на четверых игроков. Моя оценка 10/10.			"

												Following on from the first Borderlands game, Borderlands 2 improves upon the formula in a number of ways. In addition to the story being far more grandiose this time around, there are some key improvements to the general gameplay:  Infinitely more dialogue between characters this time around, adds life to the world.  Far more map variety. Original game was based almost exclusively in dusty outdoor maps. This time around, you visit lush Oasis environments, eridium riddled locales, etc etc.  Character differentiation. Mister Torgue and Tiny Tina are utterly hilarious and brilliant.  Gun engineering. The guns this time around really feel different between manufacturers. In the original game, the only real difference between weapons was whether it was elemental or not.If you enjoyed the first game, then you will have a blast with this.Highly recommended.Played on Windows 10 Pro x64 without any problems.

												This game has so much to offer and is visually spectacular in a speed induced sort of way.  It's cartoonish, gory, funny, ridiculous...the list goes on.  Playing with friends is lots of fun.  Gearbox improved everything that was lacking or wrong with Borderlands in Borderlands 2.  Get it if you love combat, fps, action, adventure, and really cool characters.  My favorite character so far is Jack himself, the Nemesis of the game who taunts you unrelentlessly throughout the game.			"

												A fun adventure to play, an even funnier one with teammates!The self-definition of the first Borderlands game was ""FPS and RPG had a baby"", and what a baby! And what little brother!Despite the revamp of hud, weapons trades and skill trees, this second game keeps its cartoon graphics, open-like world and fast paced shootings, and introduces many old and new hilarious characters, as well as a detailed and entertaining story.This game will surely please any FPS player each his own way, thanks to the 6 playable characters and their action skills, its four difficulties, and extra campaigns.An important, extra note about difficulties and level cap. Normal and True Vault Hunter Mode difficulties include a NPC level cap (of 30 and 50 respectively), meaning that enemies will stop leveling as you are past this level, even if you keep earning experience. This is important after completing TVHM, since the Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode brings quite a difficulty gap compared to the previous one, and not everybody will enjoy it. If you are in this case like i am, you shall disable the UVHM update in order to prevent your character from leveling past level 50, and keep enjoying TVHM.			"

												Hellooo Vault Hunter! Welcome! Welcome to Pandora! To your right you will see a couple of Hyperion robots peacefully grazing in the meadows with some Bullymongs roasting Bandits in the background, to your left you'll see a magical UNICORN PRINCESS. Now you are welcome to stay as long as you want but beware for the Handsome one is up and about! Happy Shooting!You play as a Vault Hunter choosing between the classes and skills of Assassin (Deception), Siren (Phaselock), Gunzerker (Gunzerk), Commando (Summon a turret) and Psycho (Rampage).Borderlands 2 allows players to complete a campaign consisting of central quests and optional side-missions as one of five treasure seekers. Online collaborative campaign gameplay, randomly generated loot, such as weapons and shields will be the weapons that you obtain as you defeat enemies and monsters in the world. The world of Pandora is rich, colorful and beautiful. Once the game begins you will be engulfed in the story which has amazing narrative. BTW this game is basically GUN PRON so get ready to have multiple extatic episodes as you finally get the weapon you crave. The weapons are the heart of this game and each company that makes the guns give them different properties which can make you fall in love with them or simply turn away from them. The customization in guns as well as skins give your character a change.The levels go to 72 and then you can go to OP LEVELS! (Which go to OP 8)This has been one of the funnest shoot-em-ups I've ever played! With the witty dialog, amazing characters and great storyline I was laughing over and over. I would recomend buying the Game of the Year edition to get the DLC but if youre not keen on buying dlc then at least get the Tiny Tinas Attack on Dragon Keep. The best DLC I've played as of now not one DLC has come close to the beauty of this DLC.This game is amazing and funny. 10/10 MUST BUYHAPPY HUNTING VAULT HUNTER!			"

												Addiction to the max...Let me get the easy and mandatory stuff of the way:The Graphics:Okay so this is the same engine as 3 years ago. However, there are improvements, at least on the PC version. The physx is now able to display some cool visual effects. The improvements include+hundreds of sparkles from explosion guns;+ fire looks like fire now;+the corrosion goo now oozes out on the ground and cascades down the slopes;+ the battlegrounds are now littered with pieces of rocks and gravel (that do not disappear by the way);the electric guns now display more sparkling effects;+there is now some sun glare+there is now aurora borealis+there are some nice snow and desert effects+the anti-aliasing has been greatly improved+the day to night shift has also been improvedThe Cons:-the water looks pretty much the same though-we still get Directx9-Visually, everything about the game has been improved except that you still cast no shadow and you still can't see your legs-The Resolution problem. okay so I thought I was playing with my native 1920x1080 resolution until I figured out (at level 10) that you needed to change the resolution one more time IN-GAME. Apparently, changing resolution in the game menu does squat. So I've been playing the crappy console 1080x720 whitewash resolution for about two hours before I figured out what was wrong. DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE.-SLOW texture loading, just like in the first game. Whenever you enter a new are or go into a shop it will take a couple of seconds for textures to load. Thanks consoles!Okay as for the gameplay:It remains largely unchanged however there are improvements. The sprint effects are now more realistic. One of the things I liked is that it is MUCH MUCH harder to earn money now. I reached level 18 and rarely had more than $ 1500 bucks in my pocket. This is a breath of fresh air considering that you could easily rack up $ 200,000 by the time you hit level 15. ( I am not even mentioning the exploit of cloning artifacts and rejoining friend's game to essentially have infinite money). Also, I should mention that they now got rid of all those unnecessary zeroes, as in, there really is no reason to sell a gun for $ 254,620 when they could downplay the entire currency by a factor of 1000. Ergo, you would have to buy the gun for $ 254 instead.The skill tree is somewhat the same from the first games with some similar perks.They now added Eridium as currency, which is rare. Except you can only use it to upgrade your ammo/grenade/backpack capacity.They haven't changed the driving. It is still a keyboard+mouse driving which still sucks.They also now added caravans which can get attacked and then get looted for rare weapons.The elemental effects largely remain the same. Fire is good against flesh and corrosion is now really effective against armor (robots don't have shield or health anymore, only armor). Also, robots are easily taken out when their limbs are blown off.It seems like the auto-assist weaker than in the first game but it can still be felt.The enemies are even more hilarious now. The voice acting is great (same goes for THE friendly NPCs), especially when you hear the midget armored goliaths talk. It's obvious they try to overcompensate for their vertical challenge by being extra badass. The enemies still do the barrel rolls, they still take cover and can spend up to 5 seconds and they can also jump from platform to platform. There are also the buzzers (make-shift propelled helicopters much like in the mad max movies) which are pretty fun to shoot down. It's even more fun when they sing the Ride of the Valkyries composition (from Apocalypse now), it's pretty amusing. Some midgets ride on each others' heads too.I'm not too sure about the insects though. They are gross and disgusting to fight.In general, it is still way more fun to fight humans or rather, the humanoids, rather than the robots and the beasties.The weapons:I'm not sure if it's me but it looks like they put more effort into adding more flare to almost every other gun. The seemingly random-generated stats are still there but at least gun skins look more flamboyant and peculiar. They also varied the standard appearance types somewhat. So, not every rifle gun is necessarily elongated for instance.The story:It's a continuation of the first story (perhaps a couple of years after opening of the vault) wherein The Handsome Jack, who is in charge of the Hyperion Corporation is attempting to open an even bigger vault and obtain control of the prehistoric monster to rule Pandora. The story has some twists, surprisingly and it's always welcome to see the good old friendly NPC's again.In the end, perhaps this could quality as Borderlands 2 since it's a continuation of story and all, I just didn't really feel like it was a new installment all that much, a lot of things feel same, although it's a definite improvement over the old one. There is more narrative, more quests, new enemies, new artifacts, mods, etc. etc. But there is not necessarily more depth, perhaps it is so because of the type of game itself. However, there are plenty of comical and satirical moments that catch you off-guard. The game is also littered with easter eggs. "

												I at first didn't want this game, but at the steam 2013 summer sale I decided that it would be a nice pickup to play with friends. Boy was I right, all my friends and I loved playing this game with eachother. Although I do wish it was more than 4 players max cap so that I didn't have to be left out of the game, this somewhat upset me. But, one idea to do is to split up your friends current session and start one with others. Overall I recommend Borderlands 2 to anyone looking for a great way to get mad at friends and quit a skype call! -Nick Lafayette			"

												Here are some of the shortest reviews I could possibly give. Hopefully this will give you an idea of this game:*I was killed and died. 10/10 (Enemys are quite challenging if you complete missions according to your level.)*I was killed and didn't die. 10/10 (Second Rewind is a great feature that lets you kill an enemy when you're downed and then automatically revives you. Why? I don't know. Maybe it's the Adrenalin that keeps those bullets in your head from killing you.)*I found a unique weapon in a trash can. 10/10 (WEAPONS. EVERYWHERE. This game is gun porn.)*My PC is ♥♥♥♥ and I can run this game on highest settings. (It's really not demanding albeit it looks pretty decent, who doesn't like Borderlands' style? 1v1 me ♥♥♥.)*Makes the wait until Fallout 4 bearable. 11/10 (Bethesda pls hurry)All in all I would r8 this game 0/10 do not recommend.I'm kidding.Really, I hope you understand that.Buy the damn game and get the Season Pass, too, because Borderlands 2 without a Season pass is, really, just Borderlands 1.

												Love it, A game i've been playing since day one with my Lil brother (a game which me and him have at least 5000hrs), across many platform. I just recently got it for the pc to play with a friend, that has never played the second installment. I'd like to say its one of a kind, for what it is, and I am thankful for this game for bringing me and my Lil brother so much joy, and headachs since the first one. The dlc's ( especially Tiny TIna's Assualt On Dragon Keep) are actually fantastic. Other then Captain Scarlett being a late down and Carnage ( which Is okay because of Mister Torgue) where lack luster.. Or to me atleast. The loot system is pretty nice for what it is, I do enjoy getting that suprise when I find an Violet or even legendary item drop. Other then some spawn rate for certain items, It's okay. It's what i like about the game, can't say how much time i spent trying to find the right Weapon in the right stats.. The days and nights that would go by.  However it's a must have for Everyone that has few friend to mess around with and just have fun. Goofy, bloody, aggressive fun.			"

												One of my favourite games of all time, with over 300 hours of gameplay on the ol' PS3...and still, Borderlands 2 is a hell lot of fun to replay on PC.The combination of RPG elements, like endless amount of loot to collect (over 870 'Gajillion' guns according to the developers), various optimization options, skill trees, 6 playable characters that really differ from each other in playstyle and strengths, with the best of first-person-shooting is just so well done, it is just hard to describe it.When this game is on sale, you can get the GOTY-Edition for just like 10 bucks AND YOU GET SO MUCH IN RETURN.This is one of those games that really get stuck in your brain, the amazing feeling of walking through the desert, supported by fitting guitar riffs, holding your beloved, rare and green-yellow-glowing shotgun in your bloody hands, beheading half-naked psychos charging at you with hilarious phrases like 'Suck my ♥♥♥♥, Mommy!'.You gotta love it.Graphics: 4/5    For a cell-shading game it looks beautiful.Music: 5/5         Every setting comes with a fitting calm and battle theme that gets stuck so easily.Gameplay: 5/5So grab one to three friends and get sucked into this jewel.Wub wub.

												I have played this game for over 1200 hours. As such, I have explored all 6 classes, almost all of the skill sets, tried most of the weapons, etc. How they can make a game fun for as long as I have enjoyed this is beyond me. I played and really liked the first Borderlands, but this one is better yet and I have the pre-sequel already pre-ordered. While it is not a true sandbox as we have come to know, it gives enough general freedom to explore. It awards those who like to be thorough with up to 69 achievements and a lot of challenges which gives you B@d@$$ points you can spend within the game to make all your characters stronger. My negatives are relatively minor. The game limits players from leveling above 72, but then introduces over-powered enemies through Raid On Digistruct Peak that then goes up to overpowered 8 (OP8). I understand the logic to this as they don't want everyone to have every skillset. However, there is no way that I know of to look at a level 72 player to know if they are playing as 72 or OP8. There is a big difference in the strength of the items and if an OP8 person joins your standard level 72 game they one-shot-kill everything. Overall, great game. I love the cooperative aspect. Without it, I wouldn't probably have ever played online. I hope as hardware gets stronger, they can make the graphics better and/or add more players to the mix. I don't think it probably is possible, but being able to game with someone on a console, PC, and MAC would be awesome. Thanks for all the enjoyment Gearbox!			"

												Borderlands 2, great first person shooter in an open world journey. I hardly played the first installment, but with hardly any knowledge of the story, Borderlands 2 does a great job getting you caught up. You also interact with the first game's characters. You start off with four completely different characters to choose from, each exhibiting their own specialties. I went with Axton for the overall easy feel of a balanced character.You're put into a world full of chaos and violence, annoyed by an obvious attention seeking toaster who craves your friendship and help. With any typical MMO you must supply yourself with loot found, bought or traded from fellow players. The game's main antagonist, wonderfully named Handsome Jack, keeps in contact with you throughout your entire journey, spewing threats and relatively creative insults. The game does offer multitude of side quests to keep you entertained, and easter eggs that are uniquely fun to find.Pros:- The story. It is action packed and immensely pleasing- The characters. Each character brings their own satisfying opinions.- Free roaming. Progress when you want to.- Repeatable bosses. Some days I enjoy fighting an old boss without having to start over.- Looooot. It is everywhere.- Character customization. - Plenty of fun DLC worth the money.- Easily a 200+ hour game.- Co-op is fun and rewarding.Cons:- Claptrap. Many like him, I can't stand him.- Most side quests are just pickup or kill certain amounts.- Builds can become too cookie cutter to obtain max efficiency of your character.- Some special abilities more overpowered than others. (more nit picking here)The game is worth its current price, but the game of the year edition should be considered for purchase. You will get two new characters and most or all the current DLCs. There is still an active online community willing to play and help, at least the players I've come across have been really fun and easy to get along with.			"

												Who wouldn't buy this?? I've beat both Borderlands on xbox, a year later I decided to play on pc. I absolutely believe this is worth the money, and it's much cheaper on pc than consle. The co-op is also an amazing feature. You can do your friend's story or they can do yours, either way - it's an amazing game. Buy it now!Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 10/10Story: 9/10Laughs N' Giggles: 8/10			"

												Great. Caught my attention since the first released images and videos and i still play it since release day.  It caught my attention so badly, made me play with all the classes until the end. The cel shading effect, which is one of the identities of the game alongside the characteristic humor, blends in with the world amazingly. Think of Diablo's looting system, now add FPS and humor to it, you have Borderlands 2. I highly enjoyed the first game, and LOVED the second one. Also, on a side note, this is an Easter-egg filled with a game in it. I warn you beforehand, SO MANY REFERENCES.10/10.			"

												""เป็นเกมส์ที่เกรียนที่สุดในสามโลก!!""Borderlands 2เป็นเกมส์ที่ผสมระหว่างMMO+RPG+FPS หรือรวมกันก็MMORPGFPS - -! คงจะนึกภาพออกนะ...ต้องบอกก่อนว่าผมไม่เคยจับภาค1มาเล่นนะ โดดมาภาค2เลย เปิดมาก็โดนตั้งแต่ฉากเปิดเรื่องแล้ว(ไปหาดูเอาเองนะ คนที่คิดใส่เพลงนี้ตอนเริ่มนี่แจ่มมาก)สิ่งที่ดีงามที่สุดในเกมส์นี้คือปืน ปืน ปืนและก็ปืน(ปืนดีไซน์แจ่มมากอวกาศสุดๆแถมออฟชั่นปืนยังเจ๋งฝุดๆอีก)อีกอย่างก็มุขตลกในเกมส์ ความฮามันสุดจริงๆ คือในเนื้อเรื่องมันเศร้านะ แต่พอเจอมุขตลกกับปืนในเกมส์คุณจะลืมไปหมด 555+ ความฟินมันบอกไม่หมดจริงๆ เอาเป็นว่า...""เล่นผ่อนคลายก็ดี เล่นจริงจังก็ได้ เล่นกับเพื่อนก็ฟิน จัดไปปปป""Story  10/10Guns  11/10Music 12/10Joke   2,000,000/10 "

												First time I've heard of Borderlands 2 I was like ""Meh, another blurry movie, Borderlands 1 FTW"". But then I've got a ""pirated"" edition of the game. It was SO AWESOME and without any doubts I did remove it and got BL2 + Season Pass + Preorder DLC + Mechromancer pack.What's so awesome about it? Let me explain.First: ""traditional Borderlands"" humor. Violence, black humor etc. It's not annoying or way too brutal. Just fit the game setting.Second: awesome characters, story line, dialogues. Even though Handsome Jack is a villain of the game - he's awesome as well. I were waiting for all the ECHO transmissions, never skept any cutscenes and did all the side quests. A lot of entertainment here.Third: of course, it's graphics. You can say ""booo, battlefield 4 has better graph"" - you're kinda right, yeah. But nobody cares about ""realistic"" graphics here. It's like you're playing comics.Fourth: nice characters. I can't say they have an awesome storyline (but i did like Maya's story at least) but gameplay aspect is just headsmashing. A lot of variants how to play each character, way better than Borderlands 1.Fifth: DLCs. Yeah, eve though you can say ""RIPOFF!!! TOO MUCH DLCS!!! THEY'RE NOT WORTH ANY CENT!!!"". Actually they ARE worthy. Not kidding. 4 DLC's included in a Season Pass providing SO MUCH CONTENT. And all the content is not like ""Meh, they'll buy it anyway"". No. They're detailed. They're providing experience that can be compared to the base game(and imo Tiny Tina's DLC is even GREATER than the base game).Sixth and the last: co-op play. ""Adventure time. c'mon grab your friends, this time we'll play the Borderlands"". Nothing to say. It's SO GREAT for co-oping. It's awesome when you can count on friends standing behind you, ready to help, revive or even heal you.In total I'll say this game is definetily worth EVERY cent you pay for it. If you like GOOD action games - you should get it. My overall score is TEN out of TEN.			"
