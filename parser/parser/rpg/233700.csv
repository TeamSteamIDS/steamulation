												OK, let's get this out of the way right now.You will die.Lots.You will be poisoned, diseased, irradiated, blown up, and electrocuted. You will be hungry and starved, your equipment will break, your armor will fail, and your ammunition will run dry. You will be stunned, confused, blinded, and terrorized. You will be shot by crazed security robots, shredded by mutated terrors, and gnawed on by countless foes, and occasionally disintegrated....so, you've got that going for you.Overview (what is it?): Sword of the Stars: The Pit is a turn-based top-down roguelike, where you play a character exploring a hostile and ancient alien complex trying to find the cure for a plague that is running rampant through the worlds. Gameplay:Well, for those unfamiliar with roguelikes - this game is not meant to be beaten in a few hours then discarded. As my introduction stated, this is a challenging game, with permanent death (the game mechanics prevent you from saving, except to exit the game) and you can only have one active game per character class at once, so you'll frequently watch as a character you've invested hours of gameplay into is wiped out or overwhelmed. Because the game is randomly generated each time, sometimes bad luck will end a good run with not much you can do about it. Your character has several limiting factors to keep in mind - ammunition is limited, and can only be replenished by finding more (which, depending on the weapon, may not be that common). Food is a concern as well, as there is a hunger mechanism that makes starving a real possibility if you can't find or make enough food to stay alive. Disease is a concern - not just from infected creatures, but perhaps by being forced to eat things you shouldn't...  And, of course, there's just running out of hit points and dying at the hands of the denizens of the complex!Gameplay itself is turn based, with you and monsters alternating turns (though, if no monsters are visible or present, your turns run seamlessly together making it easy to move around). each turn you have a limited number of movement points to move around the grid squares and explore the complex, looking for abandoned equipment you can scavenge or repair, old lockers that might contain food or items you could use - and, of course, creatures that may still be lurking! Somewhere on each level is a hatch leading to the next level below, with monsters getting tougher as you descend. The interface is a nice balance of being easy to get used to, though does take a quick reference of the manual to learn some of the finer points. generally, you move with the awsd keys, and use the space bar to interact with objects you face. 'Interact' is case sensitive; for a locker or a freezer, it'll be 'open', a locked vault will be 'unlock', a broken piece of equipment will be 'repair', etc. Combat is similarly simple - equip the weapon you'd like (or select from available hotkeys), and click on the target. (And, yes, there is a good tutorial available to teach you all this stuff!)Overall, though the game itself is simple, I found (and still find!) it interesting because some of the choices the gameplay provides. I'm hungry - do I dare risk eating my tainted meat, or press a little further in hopes of finding something more suitable? The room ahead is heavily guarded - is it worth the ammunition I'll use (and wounds I'll take!) to clear it in hopes of finding equipment I can use, or should I bypass it? My inventory is full - do I drop some of the parts I'm carrying in hopes of building something useful down the line, or sacrifice some of my limited food, ammo, or extra weapons?Crafting:Since I mentioned it above, a note on crafting. As you explore, you will find recipes and blueprints (or, sometimes, discover them yourself) that allow you to combine items you find to create new items. Some of these are intuitive (cook raw meat to make cooked meat. Combine certain meat with bread to make a sandwich, etc.) but the crafting system is very involved, to the point of being able to craft for yourself armor, weapons, and equipment that will drastically improve your chances for survival. How involved? Well, I'm several HUNDRED hours into the gameplay, and still am constantly finding new clues and recipes...   it's certainly a rich and rewarding ara to explore -though sometimes frustrating, as the random nature of the game means you may have a great blueprint, but be short of a needed item to build what you want, and unable to find said item (or, worse sometimes, have all the items you need, but lack a workstation to assemble it!) The limited inventory space means you can't simply carry everything - you have to decide what is important to you, which again leads to some interesting choices sometimes. Anyway, know that crafting is very important in this game, and there's much to discover here! (Also, note that I play The Pit with several DLC installed; this does add some to the crafting, but to be fair, I don't think I'm close to finding all the recipes from the original game yet!)Characters:Your first choice when you begin a game is which character you'd like to play. The original game provides three options - a marine, who is very capable in combat but lacking in the finesse and scientific skills; an engineer who has lots of technical know-how but limited combat effectiveness; or a scout - a sort of jack-of-all-trades character, a mix of some finesse and technical skills combined with some light combat skills as well.Available DLC (downloadable content) allows you to broaden this class list: Mind Games adds psionic powers to the game and allows you to play as a human Scion or an alien Tarka Ranger, and the Gold expansion adds four more (three immediately and one unlockable) characters. I won't go into too much character detail here - the info is out there if you choose, but suffice it to say that each character has strengths and weaknesses, different starting equipment and skills, as well as a personal backstory for why the character is descending into The Pit. And the choices you make are very relevant, too - for example, the marine excels at combat, so you'd think he'd be easy to play, as monsters don't really scare him. However, his lack of foraging skills mean he's more likely to go hungry from not finding food, and he may run out of ammo faster from not being able to find more - plus his limited science skills mean he's less able to craft new equipment for himself. Overall, most of the classes are well balanced - there's one I find to be a touch overpowered, and a couple I don't play because they don't fit my playstyle (one in particular seems a little weak) but with this much to choose from it seems to me that the average player is going to find at least a couple they really enjoy. Character Advancement:Your character has four attributes (might, finesse, brains, and power) that you can increase as you advance, as well as various skills. Skills include weapons skills (pistol, rifle, blade, to name a few) and equally important non-combat skills (foraging, lockpicking, psionic skills, decipher, electronics, etc). The basic game has something like 20 skill areas available to your character, and the mindgame expansion adds five more (five different psionic skills) for a total of 25. Each time you gain a level, you're given a number of skill points (dependant on character class) to assign. Again, it comes down to choice - you can't be good at everything, so what's important to you? Skills will level with use to a certain point - but to be really good takes some added skill points. Your character also has various other values (hit points, armor, etc) that are fairly self-evident, but I do want to make note of the hunger mechanism. Each character has a 'food' bar, similar to a life/hit points bar- eat some food, this goes up to a certain maximum.			"

												If you play this game, you likely enjoy Roguelikes. You'll have suffered at the hands of Risk of Rain, but eventually felt the sweet taste of coming out on top. You'll have been bruised and battered by ToME, but in the end, you showed that game who was boss. Probably you've gritted your teeth in the final boss battle of FTL at least a dozen times, swearing at it, but coming back for more, and eventually succeeded.So when you play Sword of the Stars: The Pit, it's going to kick your ♥♥♥, and your first reaction will be: ""Well, it's like those other games, I just have to learn how to play it."" It'll happen again and again, defeat after defeat, spurning your best attempts to master the game, and slowly, but surely, you'll start to wonder: ""Am I just bad at this game? Is it just THAT tough? That complex? Something beyond my skills?""And the answer is: No, it's not. It's just a ♥♥♥♥ game. Unfortunately, SotS: The Pit, suffers from having too many resources to manage(durability, Psi, food, health AND ammo), and aside from Psi, which can eventually alleviate two of them(health and food), there's no way to trade between your resources, and getting the right things to recover said resources is entirely random. You'll also have no idea which of the dozen or so crafting-and-foraging skills will be relevant on a given run, as the containers provided are entirely random, not to mention that you may simply get none of the necessary crafting stations even if you have all the ingredients, and since there's also about a dozen different kinds of ammo, and some armor and food don't work for all the characters... I think you get the idea. It requires such absurd luck to actually get what you need, and at basically no point is your own skill involved. You rarely get the choice of whether to engage or not, either, since anything you spot will likely move to engage you, sneaking isn't a skill and almost any hostile can outrun you.The game also suffers from the fact that some of the playable classes have non-functional features, like the Lich. It's roughly a 50-50 chance whether his minions will ignore enemies or just wander in circles while said enemies liberate your femur for a chewtoy.Really, there's so much random chance involved that you may as well not even play the game, just roll a die to determine whether you succeed or not, keep doing it until you get a success, and then go play a more fun game.

												An utterly compelling turn-based gem. I've never been one for Roguelikes, albeit content with minimalist graphics, ASCII lies beyond my tolerance, so I'm fairly new to the genre. Also, being a compulsive cleptomaniac in RPGs, permadeath and losing all my gleefully scavenged goodies has never been a positive factor. However, this has gripped me. Starting out is a little grindy, as you must unlock vital crafting recipes (i'd recommend the wiki) to really stand a chance at not starving to death early on. However, due to heavy randomisation, progress can hinge on redundant plans and experience is required to know how you can adapt. The more you play, the more you learn and damn, is there much to learn as you desperately try to manage your equipment and potentially useful crafting items to survive another floor. Utterly brutal, but brilliant.  Highly recommended, though not a short affair like FTL (even pre-DLC) and thus quite the voracious time-vampire, should you befall to it's charms.			"

												Hands down my favorite rogue-like on steam. ( I  <3 U 2 FTL )I've put in over 125 hours of starvation, ammo depletion, broken equipment and death and death and death. I love it and I still have yet to get close to beating this game.  Not only did the game start with a crazy amount of resources, recipes, weapons, monsters and skills, but they kept adding to it! New characters, psi abilities more recipes and monsters. What do I do will all this random junk in my backpack, everything can be used to craft something new. And on top of that it has a great Sci-Fi dungeon crawl feel. Starving, saving your laser ammo until your skills are up and worrying if your combat knife is going to break on the next attack. The greatest game I've never beat!			"

												This is TorNis, from Twitch. I was first on livestream to beat on Insane difficulty this game (Vanilla SoTS), then the same happened with all expansions. I played this Roguelike too much. Perhaps too much. But it's worth every hour of my strugle versus the game. I cannot describe the feelings of joy once you beat the Pit for the first time.Short info about the game: - If you are old veteran of Roguelikes, such as ADOM, DC: SS, Nethack, Tome - you will love this one- SotS: The Pit is a turn-based progressive grid-tile roguelike with advanced gameplay- You will die a lot, learn from your deaths, collect recipies from your previous attempts. Knowledge = Power- Know your enemy, your items, your skills, your enviroment, manage it and make the game's RNG bend to you, not you bend to RNG			"

												One of my favourite games of all time and a close call for GOTY for me.This snuck up on me earlier in the year and after I gave the demo a go I was instantly hooked and bought the full game, and subsequent expansions over the course of the year.With endless replayability, the game is an excellent Rogue-like where your chosen character must traverse through an ever-descending series of floors. The monsters (of which there are so, so many different and unique types) get harder the deeper you go, the loot gets progressively better although is still wonderfully randomised -- sometimes you are cursing your lack of equipment, other times you get lucky. Food is scarce, so you must scavenge to stay alive. You can craft items and food from recipes which you can discover through experimentation or by hacking computer terminals and gradually uncovering pieces of text leading you to the full recipe. This element adds to the replayability as you'll likely learn something new from each run.The game is brutally hard as you crank up the difficult level, but for those looking for an easier time the Easy setting is much more forgiving.So yeah, if you like Rogue-likes and want an extremely polished turn-based game with wonderful graphical style, sound and huge replayability, I can't recommend this enough :)			"

												There's no shortage of good. well-developed and deep roguelikes with reasonably modern interfaces these days, so any new contender will have to bring something new and interesting to the table. Sword of the Stars: The Pit succeeds in doing this with a strong survival horror element-not jump scares, but ""real"" survival horror: resource scarcity, agonizing inventory decisions, and steadily increasing toughness of the enemies tforcing player adaption to the changing situation.There is classic roguelike RNG going on everywhere, so if you are turned off by random things happening this isn't the game for you. Completing a full successful run of The Pit is a pretty length endeavor as well, so if you are looking for a game that offers you a quick play, this isn't it either. If what you want is a scarcity-driven roguelike with a great interface and a well done setting and theme, The Pit will not disappoint. I also highly recommend this game to experienced players who feel that today's games are easy to the point of boredom. The Pit is hard, and in a good way-at first it seems that you lose to randomness, but usually it's due to playing sloppy or greedy and this game punishes mistakes in a way that most games don't. You'll find all the challenge you can chew with The Pit, and then some.  "

												This game is pure death and hatred, with no way to survive for long. It's out to kill you no matter what you try to do.But that is the fun of it!It's all based on randomity; the damage you deal or take, the outcome of an attack, the percentage to succeed in an action, and so on.The upsides definitely are the interesting soundtrack, the enormous amount of content (DLCs included here, but even without) and how different each run turns out.This game also seriously scared me at times! The sounds, the things enemies do, the fact you keep finding new things - all this easily manages to get one scared of the game.Sadly, because of the evil nature of the game, you often go to ragequit and never come back for a while. A ton of things you have to know about beforehand, else you'll just die instantly:The recyclers, for example, pull you into them, holding you there and deal enormous damage.Or the Von Neumann Probes, which have a chance to insta-kill you or delete a random item from your inventory.I'd say go for it if you like turn-based rogue-likes, and even though I'm not a big fan of the genre otherwise, it turned out to be a ton of fun in the end!

												I would encourage more kids to play as it is an entertaining critical thinking/time & resource management challenge… vs learning how to call strangers piles of sticks online in COD-ish games. Pros:+ 30-40 Floors of randomized obstacles turn base RPG (depending on DLC purchased)+ Every DLC adds not just a character but improves upon existing game mechanic – so not money grabs but adds value to WHOLE game – worth getting even if you don’t want new chars IMHO. + Dungeons of Dredmor like turn based combat, so great for alt-tab, pick me up anytime game+ Need to manage, inventory/resources in Deus EX 1 like inventory grid.+ Different enemies/traps that require different tactics, weapons and approaches.+ Tons of loot and craft able weapons, armors, gadgets – ***Google sword of the stars the pit Wiki for an idea. but it contains spoilers**+ Tons of different skills to focus on, so different characters have different playstyles (Not exactly like SPECIAL/perk system from fallout series but uniquely good) + 3-8ish different classes with different skills/equipment load out+Decent voice/music/sound acting (I actually really love the soundtrack though!) Cons:-Dated graphics (but pro if you’re into that like I am)-Difficult learning curve, can understand why some players get turned off by this (pro if you like a challenge that requires adapting) -Player won’t have idea of what items/tactics necessary for successful runs (but seems to be part of the game design of learning via failures etc.)-Will have to play multiple times to unlock certain recipes to craft important (but not game required) items. Can cheat with wiki but normal way to unlock is to just play a lot as recpies are unlocked via skill checks at consoles-Lack of a storyline – it’s there but in the form of lore/messages obtained from consoles (which also is the only way to learn recipes (sans wiki) -1 Save per class picked, max 5 slots.. but only as game progress save (sorry no save scumming!)

												(In the interests of full disclosure, this review is based on the Gold Edition - which should be considered the best option available).A metacritic of 68? Who reviewed this game? Ben Kuchera? Did it not have enough empty houses for him to rummage through with stories of teenage girl angst to get voyeuristic over?It's nethack, but not your father or your mother's nethack. This is tried and tested ""Get in from the frozen exterior of a planet into a secret underground base that extends downwards further than any greedy dwarf dared dig."" model, but brought up to date with a solid lick of paint, high resolution graphics, and a clear and consistent approach to enemies, objects and overall design.The story, what there is, is much the norm for such roguelikes, it's merely the pretext for getting you to the front of the dungeon, the reality is that this is a true roguelike, you go as far as you can, aiming to reach the bottom of the pit, or die messily along the way. You only have one life, no do-overs. Unlike a lot of ""modern"" nethacks, this one goes back to roll style checks for skill tests, and gives an extensive list of possible talents to sculpt and model your character. The Gold edition additionally features several extra classes, giving you a respectable pool of choices, both human and nonhuman in nature (playing as an alien ranger is -awesome- ).It's base levels all the way down, they're all evil, they all want to kill you.Scattered throughout each randomly generated floor is a variety of traps, both tile and door based, locked chests and rooms, and various devices that may help or hinder your ability to progress. Ranging from defunct cookers that need repairing to prepare a simple blandwich (Don't ask what's in one, really, you don't want to know..), to advanced and somewhat dotty security computers that may just as readily electrocute you as deactivate the several heavily armed and armoured droids patrolling the area.The game operates functionally as a turn based game, with each discrete action you take allowing the AI the opportunity to respond (hint - if the game pauses briefly between moves, there's something nearby, and it's almost certainly unfriendly). You take an action, the AI takes an action, repeat until either you or whatever the AI sent your way has collapsed in a pool of it's own fluids. Make sure you know what you're killing, and you're killing it with the right gun.When dealing with multiple foes, target selection becomes important, you can if you feel confident let the computer handle targetting and it does a sensible enough job, but on occasion you'll want to step in yourself to ensure that the scariest thing dies first. Combat employs a wide variety of melee and projectile weapons, and in keeping with the future sci-fi aesthetic, these can be pretty fantastical, including laser, plasma and other interesting effects.With the addition of extra characters, Mind Games and all the extra ways to die, The Pit has become highly complex, very well supported, and a deep and involving creature, there's now many ways to die, many ways to survive, and many accomodations for various playstyles. This is -not- however, baby's first nethack. You will want to start with say, Dungeons of Dredmor, because this one will kill you in good order if you're not at least familiar with the concept of being pragmatic and cautious and making efficient use of your time. Hunger can ruin your life far easier than you might expect.In such games, death can come in many ways, here is no exception. Simply being impaled is for novices, try being irradiated, choked by a mimic pretending to be a med station, diseased by an out of control experiment, or being melted in acid. It is important to note that in these games - Death is an opportunity to learn, not a signal of failure. Go in expecting to die a lot, and the ultimate victory will be that much sweeter.Closing thoughtsThis game is not for the faint of heart, but it is well worth the effort, and for an intermediate roguelike player, someone who's cut their teeth on more forgiving entries to the genre (Dungeons of Dredmor is a great place to start), this is the logical progression. Welcome to The Pit. Enjoy your stay.Verdict : Highly recommended, and to the so called ""professional reviewers"" who say otherwise, hang your heads in shame you overpriced wastes of space. You no longer deserve the sites you work for. "

												There's simply too much tedious crap that's required for optimal gameplay. You want to lockpick all the doors for xp/skillups, drop all the items before walking through any trapped door until you've identified the item destroying trap, spam psi/melee skills on empty air for skillups.. stuff that adds no fun gameplay, requires no decisions, yet is mandatory.Also, there is way too much rng. It is perfectly possible to lose a run because you don't get another type of weapon and run out of ammo, no matter how much you melee/knife stuff. Or  you can faceroll a run with good drops. And you don't know which it'll be until you've spent a few hours on a run.Though, the game does include a built-in way to cheat rng. By depositing xp/items from other previous characters to new ones. Which kind of breaks the whole point of roguelike, you can just grind your way through the game if you're inclined to.To be fair, it's sort of fun. But there's way too much ♥♥♥♥ design to truly recommend this game, when you could play Crawl instead.			"

												This is one of the most challenging Rogue-likes (or lites) out there. Similar to Dungeons of Dredmor, but way more punishing. There's something quite addictive in the gameplay though, especially if you work to decipher all of the crafting recipies instead of looking them up. Overall, it's a fun game that presents a lot of random elements that can sometimes stack against you and seem very unfair. Despite that, it's still fun to go on a run every once in a while, and the devs were very good about supporting the game with free content for over a year after the game was released. You probably got this game in a bundle, so try it out "

												I've sunk a shocking number of hours into this Pit and I am in the paradoxical situation of not recommending this game.  It has many good points.  But it is a sadistic game designed to trap a certain type of gamer who confuses difficulty as gameplay.  And I fell for this trap hard.  I have completed this game on the normal difficulty.  I have also died trying more times than I can estimate.  Was the journey worth it?  No.  I offer a metaphor for what it's like to win this game.  It's like a casino with thirty floors.  You start with a hundred bucks.  And you've got to play at every table at least once.  But you lose a dollar every five minutes, because the game has a brutal food clock.  Yeah, Good Luck.

												I seem to be on a glut of roguelike and roguelike inspired games lately.  Sword of the Stars: The Pit is an exceedingly competent entry into the genre that is well executed.  The graphics are a bit strange but familiar to those that have been with the series, and in the scope of it's own series are done fairly well if not extraordinarialy.  (The character animations definetely look to have been done on OpenCanvas or something similar and stand out against the rest of the game, though).The roguelike elements are definetely the strength of the game.  Combat is intuitive, fair, and reasonably balanced.  The creature AI can be relied upon to act in a consistent manner which is fairly important for combat in roguelikes, and the different weapons actually add a variety of game mechanics rather than just being incrementally increased versions of the same guns, which is a pitfall of many roguelikes.  The random nature of the game can make things in some runs much more difficult, but I never felt the randomness broke a game in the way it can in many roguelikes.  If you got a bad roll on a level you can still have an entirely legitimate change of making it through the level if you play skillfully, such as utilising beserk mechanics to cause enemies to fight each other, luring enemies into environmental hazards, through grenades around corners, or placing traps.  Which also leads into another of the games strengths - there are a lot of mechanics such as those I just mentioned and they're fairly intuitive for the most part.  If you have any experience with roguelikes you likely don't need the tutorial or the manual, although both of those are actually quite well done.  The one mechanic I do have a gripe with is the idea of the crafting recipes.  It's supposed to be able to find recipes through some of the data panels but I have never done so.  Most of them can't be found this way and it turns the game either into experimentation with blind luck, or consulting a wiki.  There's some people that like their games like that however, and it's a subjective preference of mine that I don't.  The voice acted parts - albeit fairly rare - are actually pretty well done, as well.  The whole game just seems to be a game where a significant amount of time and effort has been taken on polishing the game, something sorely lacking from many releases big and small these days.The biggest criticism I have about the game is that is very ""safe"".  It takes no risks and as such is very generic in the truest sense of the word.  However it's a well-executed implementation of the genre with an interesting background story and theme that offers a huge amount of replayability and a variety of different levels of challenge for someone to find their individual level of comfort.  Definetely a game to pick up if you enjoy the roguelike genre.			"

												♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the Pit is brutal. Everything in the Pit wants you dead, from rats to robots to scared & confused aliens to flying fungi with guns, but even the doors, containers, and medical supplies often seek to do you harm. The one moment you let down your guard, you'll be in serious trouble or dead before you fully realize what happened.The Pit is difficult, challenging, and you gotta be in it for the long haul to truly progress.What else makes this game fascinating?Randomness: Everything is randomly generated. You will never have the same experience twice. Level maps, the enemies you face, the items you loot, the amount of skill points you receive when leveling up, the effect of potions, the effect that doors have when you walk through them, weapon & armor mods, every detail is procedurally generated. Size of content: There’s an amazing amount of creatures, items to find, items to use, items to craft, and messages you must decipher slowly over time left behind by the previous rulers of the Pit. The 11 available classes/characters each provide their own unique experience in gameplay mechanics and strategy. I have played for over 200 hours, have completed only 26% of its achievements, and think I've experienced only about 25% of the game's content (based on guides on its items, creatures, and crafting recipes).Combining the sheer size of content with the crazy randomness of it all, results in infinite possibilities for dangerous fun. Oh yeah, and there’s permadeath, with no manual saving points. The Pit reinforces the terror of your inevitable death with every movement. Every step you take, every room you walk into, every container you attempt to open, anything can take you down at any moment. The Pit has a steep learning curve. If you enjoy difficult but not impossible games, deep turn-based strategy, and sci-fi RPGs, you won’t regret playing this game.			"

What for?This is the most difficult and rewarding game I have ever played.  In order to beat the game of normal difficulty, you must be conscious of all the complexity this game has to offer, and master the art of building small advantages and minimizing your mistakes.  You will die, you will learn, you will not sleep, but you will achieve something great.  Luck helps too.  Also, this game is fun to play.			"

												Now that I've broken 100 hours on this game, I feel it is a bit disingenuous to never have written a review of it. I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with this game. The first thing to know is that this is probably the only modern roguelike on Steam. Sure, there's CoQ, ADOM, TOME, NetHack, etc. But those are ASCII roguelikes with tile interfaces. This has true ground-up, fully constructed graphics, sound, and music while maintaining the challenge and replayability of the others listed.Here's the love part of the relationship. This game is infinitely replayable. The different classes handle differently (ahem, other roguelikes that have nominally different classes that basically handle the same). This creates massive variety in playstyle. There is an epically huge amount of items and enemy types. Choices matter. Strategy matters. This is a roguelike with the greatness of a modern UI. The hate part of the relationship. The recipe system was a hugely original and clever way to put persistence in the game without altering the gameplay or permadeath components. Unfortunately, it is a bit too steep. After 100 hours, I'm not even close to having completed the recipes. This drives me away in frustration every now and again. Once this part is completed, I'll probably enjoy the game more.The other thing is that it takes a very, very long time to complete a successful run. This means you'll find yourself blaming RNG and the cruelty of the difficulty a bit much. Sometimes this drives me away. To be fair, this is an illusion. Anyone who claims the game is too RNG dependent doesn't know what they are talking about, and you can safely ignore their review. Go watch people who are excellent at the game. If you play in the Easy - Hard difficulty settings, and you consistently die, then it is your own fault. Post a video of your run, and people will point out the hundreds of tiny mistakes you make each floor that caused you to die in the long run.Anyway, this game is excellent, and the flaws do not hinder it enough to ever truly pull me away. If you're a roguelike fan and you haven't played this yet, you're missing out big time.			"

												This is not a game for those who like to get every achievement. After 300+ hours of play, I have a achievement only 0.12% of players have: a win on normal difficulty. THERE ARE THREE LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY ABOVE NORMAL. That said, once you abandon any expectation of completing the game, there's a lot of fun to be had. Randomly generated levels and permadeath mean each attempt is unique, but there's enough saved progress in building up your list of craftable items and unlocking lore that encourages you to try again one more time. I'd recommend buying one or more of the DLC packs to go with the game - each adds new items, enemies, weapons and playable races. The Mind Games DLC also adds a whole new system to the game - psionics, so that's a good place to start.			"

Crafting, exploring, fighting etc. and all these with endlessly fun randomized parameters. I love this game!			"

												Sword of the Stars!  There are some things in gaming that will just never, ever get old, going deeper and deeper into a dungeon while looting everything there possibly is to loot being one of them.  You can't miss with this basic premise, but you can certainly sweeten the pot.  Making the loot drool worthy is a complicated exercise in tug-of-war: too strong, and you'll never find improvments, not enough and you have your players getting bored.  SotS deftly walks this tightrope with a deep crafting system and the depth of the game itself.Let me explain what I mean by that a little more:  The game is pretty difficult (if you're playing correctly :^)) but there are A LOT of cool things to find that can be a big help.  Whether it's a electronic chip that boosts your computer skill to max level, or a sick, sick piece of armor, every cool find is made cooler by the hope of getting deeper into your run they represent.You start the game having to choose a difficulty (at least hard for the most fun) and a class.  The differences in the classes are refreshingly pronounced and greatly influence how the game plays out.  The Commando has a big advantage with starting equipment and stats, but doesn't grow as fast as the Scout (whom will get one or two shotted on the first few floors of the Pit).Combat is fluid and lovely. The game is actually turn based so standing still gives you time to size up situations and make a decision.  Everything takes place on a grid.  The game has a magic ability to shoot at the square you want even when you misclick.  Seriously, it's uncanny.  As with most roguelikes, your goal is to get as far as you can.  I think you can actually beat this game but it's harder than a mother ♥♥♥♥er.  Replay value is built in with the roguelike genre, but The Pit particularly so since the game changes even more than normal from run to run and class to class.8.4/10			"

I found one con, if you don't like luck chances that bad luck could ruin the task you're doing, not the run, but the task, then still buy the game. It takes like 50 minutes to get adjusted to it. It's not a huge nerdy thing that takes hours to master for a freakin' role playing game roguelike hybrid.I do indeed recommend this game to anyone who wants a new game of the roguelike genre, it can be extremely challenging, or extremely easy, depending on difficulty.Please buy it, it's very atmospheric and will give you some memories playing it. I sure got some. :D			"

												After racking up quite a few hours already, I feel compelled to leave a recommendation for this marvelous gem of a game. Now for the record SOTS: The Pit was my true first rogue-type game experience, its brutal and more often than not unfair, but despite that it still manages to keep me coming back for more with it's absolutely stellar, seamless turn-based RPG gameplay. However what truly got me hooked on it was when I discovered that you can play as a tentacled telepathic extraterrestrial dolphin, with tentacles for legs and arms and.... tentacles for a mustache! thats the extent of awesome this game is. PS: being turn-based it plays great side by side with watching/listening to vids, you can easily resize the window to fit the other half of the monitor if you dont have a 2nd one.			"

												This game is excellent for so many reasons. It's a Rogue-like, and, if you know what that means, you're probably a fan of the type. If not, do a little research because the sub-genre isn't for everyone.Firstly, the game is very broad for how simple it is. There are a ton of interactable objects within the Pit to interact with, all relying on your particular class' skills and some RNG to determine the effect when using them. (Typically, pass/fail, but sometimes the reward or punishment can be greater than standard.) Tons of weapons, armors, utility items and the like to aid in your overall objective which is to reach the bottom of the Pit!There's a crafting system in place, but you'll have to find the right Interactable objects and the recipes (sometimes, you can guess or cheat if you want) to craft the items. However, your recipes and 'deciphering' progress are saved across playthroughs, so you'll be able to access previously acquired recipes or progress to acquiring them regardless of your deaths. (And you will die, often).The graphics are semi-retro but colorful and pleasing, and despite their somewhat lighthearted appearance, the game has this eerie feel to it that is enhanced by the imagery.The audio is fine, nothing spectacular, but it isn't bad or unfitting. The soundtrack can become a little redundant once you've put a lot of time into the game, but the track changes ~5 floors. And honestly, I feel its atmospheric quality makes it acceptable 'background' music, in that it doesn't grate on your nerves.The interface and controls are excellent. Straight-forward and for the most part, comprehensive. You can play the game completely without a mouse but I don't really see any advantage to it.The gameplay itself is very different. You have 'moves' available displayed above your health/stats bars that dictates how many squares you can move before two things happen. 1) The 'time' increases by 1 point each time you exhaust your moves. 2) All the enemies on your particular floor will take their turn, whether or not it interferes with you. So it is at your behest to do more research on this style of turn-based play, I remember it being a little disorienting at first. As time progresses lots of passive systems take effect, like your 'food' levels, health regen (you and enemies) buffs/debuffs etc. On the higher difficulties, time can become VERY crucial, making each step its own calculated decision. Some actions use 1 or more time units regardless of your Move allowance. Things like reloading or interacting with the world. There's a pretty sharp learning curve at the very beginning but it all makes sense very quickly and there are a ton of beginner guides that are far more comprehensive than this little review.ALSO! Learn to make use of Ctrl+W/A/S/D this allows you to turn without using a move-unit, which is critical for observing your surroundings before potentially allowing the enemy a turn.I only just came back to this game after almost 2 years because someone commented on a forum post from way back. It reminded me how much I love this game and the punishment it can deliver. It's a great game by a great Indie company and it comes with a ton of DLC that add lots of little pieces and additional classes. My suggestion is to get it all at once, as some of the DLC adds quality-of-life and UI improvements that I wouldn't want to deal with anymore. Get it all!TL:DR Get this game, it's affordable, fun and has a highly addictive replay value!			"

												For fiction in general, not just videogames, there are works which attribute their  success to being innovative and others that rely on typical genre conventions but are constructed well enough that generic elements fail to make them weaker as stories/movies/games/whatever. Between these two loosely defined and ocassionally overlapping categories, Sword of the Stars: The Pit is the latter. If you have experience with roguelikes, especially older ones, you have seen the elements that make it up before: heavily randomized level layouts, a prominent hunger mechanic to penalize idleness, and turn-based movement and combat. If all you care about is new game mechanics, this roguelike may not be for you.Yet what Sword of the Stars: The Pit lacks in innovation it more than makes up for in polish, setting, and play style diversity. Each of the classes, with or without the additional ones from DLC, feels sufficiently different that relying on the same strategies in a universal manner is going to get you killed. With a host of stats and systems for gunplay, psychic powers and melee combat there is a class or two for everyone. Chances are you will still die, of course. As rogue-likes go, this one is relatively forgiving, but the key word is relatively. You will still ♥♥♥♥ up and get murdered or starve, possibly several times in a row if you are unlucky or careless. If all you care about is getting to the end of a game, this probably isn't for you. If you can accept and embrace failure, however, Sword of the Stars has plenty of fun to be had on the way to the reaper.			"

												The utmost problem with this game is that it's similar to fellow rogue-like Dungeons of Dredmor, but inferior in every conceivable way. As I was playing, I eventually had a fatal thought. Why am I playing this instead of DoD, Dungeonmans, ADoM, or another vastly more enjoyable roguelike?I had no answer whatsoever and so I stopped - in the middle of a pretty good run that may well have led to victory - and uninstalled it. I feel better already.The trickiness is that the game appears well-crafted and designed, and nicely executes on that addictive formula of needing just one more key ingredient or item to make a solid run. So you keep going, searching every crate and biopod for your holy grail. And when you don't find it and instead die, you think JEEZ I was SO close. And that thought, that sense of ALMOST is so overwhelming that you forget to ask yourself: was I even having fun?Well no, and here's why:-Every run begins with a boring grind. That's how it's designed. You have to be moderately idiotic or unlucky to fail within the first 10 or so levels, yet if you want to succeed in the later 20, you have to play those first ten conservatively and thoroughly. This means using your fists and knives to conserve ammo and durability - which means taking longer to kill every monster. You have to lockpick every door and station in order to raise your skills and get exp. This takes hours and it's not fun because...-Tactics and variety are both nil. Except for rare situations, combat tactics do not extend beyond conservation of durability and ammo. Most of the classes play remarkably similarly. The biggest difference is starting gear. But they otherwise have the same skills and stats, just different starting numbers... which primarily affect RNG success or failure. Weapons all function more or less the same. Not that it would matter anyway because the only choice you have is to use what the game gives you, and that's just how it's gonna be.-Inventory and itemization sucks. First off, as I said, nothing you get offers drastic new tactical opportunities. It's mostly just numbers. This bread can be combined with this meat to raise this hunger bar by this amount. This repair kit raises this durability number. This necklace gives 5 to your stats so you have a 1% greater chance at the RNG game. Nothing that will totally change how you play the game. Second off, crafting blows. Finding recipes is laughably grindy (and on some characters impossible), so basically everyone resorts to the wiki. But even using the wiki, I never once crafted anything cool. Not armor, not a weapon, not a robot friend to follow me around. At best, I put a scope on a rifle which -- yep you guessed it! -- gave me a slightly higher chance of winning the RNG game.-All of this combines to make death entirely unenjoyable and onerous. Which yeah kind of a weird statement. But not really. That's supposed to be a roguelike's modus operandi. Yeah, sure, your char permadies BUT here's some metagame progression to lessen the sting. OR hey that just means you get to try out a new character with totally different tactics! There is NONE of that here. You die - and it's 50/50 whether it was your fault - and that's that. And then you pick a character who essentially plays the same as the one who just died.Basically, if this were the ONLY roguelike available, I'd probably recommend it. Roguelikes are sweet. But there is NO particular reason to play THIS one. If you're tempted to buy it, don't. Get Dungeons of Dredmor or another roguelike instead. Or if you already own one, go load it up. You'll have more fun, I guarantee it.			"

												I wanted to love this game. I really did. I've put in my time (nearly 40 hours, according to Steam), but I just cannot find myself recommending this game. I love the setting (sci-fi roguelikes are notably scarce), and they've got interesting character choices, especially with the DLC installed, pulling from the SotS galaxy and lore.However, in the end, the game's just too hard. And not hard in a satisfying way. Hard in a grindingly slow, agonizingly limping way that eventually will find your character naked with all his weapons broken or out of ammo, bleeding fists beating hopelessly against the uncaring steel chassis of a battle drone that's blowing holes in you. It's been the sad fate of literally every character I've tried, even on easy difficulty.What it boils down to is that the game, in its debatable wisdom, decided that everything should have durability. Then the game decided that whenever you fix something, its maximum durability would be decreased. So far, so good - I suppose I could see the logic in wanting to force characters to have to keep upgrading their equipment. Except that's not what happens. What happens is that, due to a lack of getting the right crafting materials (or, very rarely, getting the stuff you need, but never finding a crafting station), or getting the wrong drops (nope, that's HEAVY armor, you can only wear LIGHT armor... or worse, you're a space dolphin - you can't wear 99% of armor, period), or not getting any drops at all; everything breaks.Even the most promising characters can be lost because you weren't able to find any ammunition that fits in any of your guns for 3 or 4 floors running. Or because you ran into one-too-many acid beasts, and now all your equipment is broken.There's something fundamentally wrong with a game where one of the basic tips for new players is to take off all your weapons and armor and punch the beginning monsters to death, because otherwise your ♥♥♥♥ will break before you can find enough equipment to have any chance of winning at all.

												A science fiction roguelike. It truly is Dungeons of Dredmoor with a future theme in almost every way. It has lots of classes. gear, systems, enemies, levels, and just all around great gameplay. It is turn based, you go forward in the levels with the gear you start with and what you find, with turn based combat, lots of chance systems with lockpicking, hacking, and the like. If you enjoy Dungeos of Dredmoor I gurantee that you will absolutely love this.Final Verdict: Must-buy for fans of the genre, and strong reccomendation for the curious.			"

												Giving this a thumbs down not because of the content, but because of the confusing state of Linux support. Some of the DLC works. Some of it doesn't. Fullscreen isn't available. The Linux version of the game is behind the Windows version, and despite a pinned post from the developer saying an update is coming out ""soon"", it's about 20 months old with no update on its progress.If you're playing on Windows, read the other reviews to see if this is a good deal or not. If you're playing on Linux, you might want to try another roguelike like Tales of Maj'Eyal (ToME), which is not only an excellent game, but has had consistently solid Linux support throughout its entire history.

												Easily the most fun and feature-rich roguelike I've ever played. Rather than the usual medieval magic Tolkien -esque setting, this one's closer to something like Alien or System Shock. The designs are interesting, the amount of items and their functions are pretty staggering, all are explained really well, and there's far less of a logical learning curve to this one, without impacting replay value. With all the DLC now out, there's a dozen characters, all with a unique feel to them. The setting is grim, with a pretty absurd amount of lore behind it. The gameplay flows well, allowing for varied movement and both timed and instant actions. There's a bigger emphasis on facilities than in other games of the genre, with a run possibly going many different ways depending on what kinds of crafting stations You find, or by a room getting destroyed on the crossfire, leaving You with lots of bones and binding, bit no free lockpicks. Bottom line, it's he most immersive and fun roguelike I've had he pleasure of spending ungodly amounts of time with.			"

												The Pit has got to be one of the pinnacles of modern rogue-like. It's frustratingly difficult. Sometimes too frustrating, and sometimes too easy. Which is to say two things:1. The RNG in this game can be decidedly cruel or benevolent. Getting that one weapon from that one locker on floor 3 could mean the difference between dying on the next floor or 10 floors later. And then, sadly, sometimes you'll get that weapon and it'll be meant for another race. Or you'll get a power suit and you're not a marine (who plays marine anyway?). Considering the wide variety of items, and how exclusive many of them are, it stands to reason that they implemented my second point...2. ... that being the ""blue rooms"" on every 5th floor. Now, here's where you can basically cheese the game to make it easy, depending on how much time and effort you feel like spending. Every 5th floor there is a room somewhere that contains two storage units that can be accessed by any character on that same difficulty: one for experience, and one for items. A character who REACHES this floor may ONLY deposit into both of these, but they can deposit *anything*. Including all of your experience gained from level 1, if you chose to not level up your character at all, allowing you to donate a gigantic amount of experience (since it multiples your donation by 5). As well, you can donate any items, including any of your starting gear, which can allow for some nasty combinations. A NEW character that STARTS on the floor you donated to can access and withdraw from these, but not deposit.This wouldn't be an issue to me if the system were implemented in an easier way. This is really my only gripe. A more thought-out way of giving your new character an edge based on how well you did/lucky you were on your last runs would've been appreciated--I choose to simply ignore the blue rooms.Okay, one more gripe: crafting. You'll find all sorts of stuff and have a hard time crafting. Your inventory will fill quickly and you'll not want to get rid of all the puzzle pieces you have for stuff. It's frustrating. That's it, though. This game frustrates the ♥♥♥♥ out of me and I love it for it. Great survival gameplay, starvation is a very real threat (especially if you're Striker), as is running out of ammunition or having weapons break, things exploding, acid eating at your armor, traps destroying your favorite gadgets, poisons from annoying, screeching spiders with crazy movespeed that can kill you in a few turns, bullets that'll mow through the uncautious... fun for the whole family, really.

												The Pit is a roguelike RPG set in the Sword of the Stars universe, where you venture into a subterranean alien facility in search of a cure that is unknown to human science.  The story is rudimentary and will neither surprise nor impress you from beginning to end, which is standard for the genre.The game, with its DLC, currently features a single, procedurally generated 40-floor dungeon along with achievements, crafting, eight playable characters and four difficulty levels. Progress may be saved and resumed until death, which is permanent.Combat is turn-based and primarily involves guns and grenades but, since ammo is a finite resource, your fist and bladed weapons are there to back you up.  The bulk of enemies are either robots or run-of-the-mill insectoid and little green alien types.  In addition, you’ll have to deal with the threat of traps, status effects, starvation and equipment degradation. Crafting is necessary for survival and allows you to create food, medicine, tools and equipment out of components scavenged from enemies and containers.  Recipes can be found by decrypting messages on computer terminals and every action in the game requires you to pass a skill check with a chance to fail.  Electronics, computers, lockpicking, mechanical and medicine are a few examples of non-weapon skills.The Pit is a traditional roguelike, where magic and generic fantasy have been replaced with uninspired technology and sci-fi.  Even so, the sci-fi setting is a breath of fresh air.  Despite feeling a bit slow at times, the game does a good job of forcing you to make the most of your supplies and surroundings.  Updates from the developer have been regular so I have to recommend it to fans of the genre, especially since professionally developed releases are few and far between.			"

												Lost countless hours due to the feeling of one more try, one more move, one more go, one more level e.c.t Not had that in a game since Civilisation. So many build options for your character and the unlock system for R&D is great. You unlock projects from hacking computers which lets you build new items. These items can be built by new characters opening up further options on later playthroughs and you will need later play playthroughs. Expect to die and start from level 1 a lot.Update: 2016, still stands the test of time.			"

Important Note: Reviews are based on Gold Edition(comes with Mind Games + Gold Edition dlc)##Short Review:## I love this game almost as much as I love dungeons of dredmor but in sci-fi way.If you like rogue-likes + sci-fi get the game.Lots of mobs,items,weapons,armors,skills,stats,buffs,debuffs, and enemies to have fun with. There are 40 floors(with all dlc),5 difficulty modes,3 different game speeds(default for the normal gamer, the other 2 for casual gaming and people who want to play at a faster pace). The A.I is decent and not dumb,weapons have ranges + different accuracy rates,and abilities. Armor,weapons and items can degrade over time but be fixed. Devs are active with patches and any tweaks the community feels the game needs, and are responsive to questions of concern.Cheapest price for Gold (comes with mind games + gold edition dlc) was $1.74 @ amazon and $3.25 @Gamers gate over the winter 2013 sales. I advise you get the game with the mind games and gold edtion dlc(yes this is a dlc). Get the game already and have fun.##Detailed Review##Don't let its basic looks fool you,graphics although in a 2d style some might now like are well done.There are 5 various difficulty settings as well as game speeds(rate in which you can progress through floors).So the game should be good for the casual gamer,to the hardcore gamer.There are lots of skills you can level up with skill points + with use of the skills themselves.The animations,environmental graphc effects are a nice touch. There are a number of races you get to choose that serve as the  character classes in the game. You have various status effects that can thwart your fight through the floors. In all 40 floors to fight through,various trap types to avoid,things to hack,safes to crack,things to forage through,food to cook etc.Starvation,illness,degrading armor and weapons are just some of the things that you have to worry about constantly.Weapons/armors can be repaired if you have the skill and the repair tool needed.Food can be cooked various recipes to make different things with chances of failure to make losing you the ingredients.Lots of craftable stuff in general.Combat wise with guns act as you might think ,shot guns have bullet spread,pistols have high accuracy but not limited range ,rifles can multi-target mobs per turn.Various melee weapons daggers,swords,etc,different types of throwables, and even psychic powers that have multiple types that function differently.Mobs are varied quite well with different attack types,stats,behaviors,etc.The A.I. is pretty decent and they get tougher as you get deeper and deeper.Different environments/biomes make up certain sections of the floors as you explore.There are various debilitated items which can be restored (if successful) and then used.Lockers,beds,broken down medical items,etc can be found repaired or searched.All the dlcs add character classes,weapons,armor,items,new mobs,new skills and more difficulty.Vanilla gives you 3 classes , Gold Editon DLC adds 3 more and mind games adds an additional 2.TBH I would suggest you get the whole thing as one package.Gamers Gate had SoTS:The Pit Gold for $3.75 during the 2013 winter sale and amazon for $1.74 durin the winter sale.Retailers outside of steam sell the game + 2 dlcs as Gold/Gold Edition.The devs actively patch and tweak things the community finds to be wrong.

												First off, if you enjoy using game wikis, then you can skip this review. There are several reasons why I don't recommend this game, but for the purposes of this review I will stick to just one, and it's from the perspective of someone who intentionally avoids spoilers and wikis***This game commits one of my cardinal sins of game design: it makes the player grind for the information required to beat the game. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why this grind is unplayable.1. At it's core, The Pit is a game about efficiency.  Death rarely comes as a result of a tactical misstep, but rather as a result of running out of resources, be it ammo, food, or armor.  Therefore, all drops must be maximized for efficiency, and this requires crafting.  2. How are crafting recipes discovered?  Through ""data hacking"" at randomly placed terminals (about 1 terminal per hour of gameplay).3. One crafting recipe per hour sounds reasonable, yes? Unfortunately, these terminals have a chance of being broken and needing an RNG dependant repair.  In my experience, an average player level has about a 50/50 chance of successfully repairing the terminal. 4. One recipe per two hours?  A grind no doubt, but reasonable. Unfortunately, these terminals have about a 50/50 chance of containing only story exposition text, no recipe.5. One recipe per four hours?  Unfortunately, your player ""hacking skill"" affects the percentage of the text that is actually decoded. In my experience, there's a 1/4 chance of revealing all necessary words to infer the recipe.5. One recipe per sixteen hours?  Unfortunately, in order to test your hypothesis about the recipe ingredients, you must also find a randomly generated crafting station.  These also spawn broken, requiring another RNG-dependant repair. Regardless of whether the recipe is successful or not, the ingredients will be destroyed and removed from your inventory, so if you feel like experimenting with your fancy machine gun, some wires, and an energy capsule, you will only get to try once, and then you can kiss all three items goodbye.  Remember, as this is an efficiency game, you can also kiss this run goodbye (but don't worry, we're not trying to win yet, we're just grinding for information).There's a limit to how much time I will spend ""practicing"" for a successful run rather than actually attempting one. It's a shame, because the game does have some redeeming elements. But believe me, you cannot complete a run in The Pit without good gear, and you cannot craft good gear without a ~100-200hr grind for the required information.If you're ok reading the wiki, maybe pick it up on sale and try it out for yourself. Otherwise, spare yourself the frustration.			"

												An acceptable roguelike in a too-crowded field. There's nothing inherently wrong with SotS: The Pit. It does everything a roguelike is supposed to do. Procedurally generated levels with a high degree of randomization. A class based system that can radically alter your playstyle as well as your access to items. An unforgiving difficulty that is a mixture of luck and skill.Frankly every roguelike does that, however, and this one has very little else going for it and a lot of strikes against it. For instance, you require food to survive, a resource which can be very limited. You get plenty of ingredients, but even if you do find a cooker it is most likely broken, requiring a skillcheck and a dice roll to fix. Even if you do fix it, you have to trial-and-error your way into a valid recipe, costing you precious resources with each failure. Even if you do find a valid recipe, that valid recipe can fail, consuming those resources anyways. It's a prime example of the artificial difficulty that plagues the game. Nearly every valuable item is secured behind some sort of skillcheck.Combat is clean and simple, but boring. Warrior types are simply left-click to win, while psionics-- the game's version of magic users-- have more options, but most will be constrained to a single attack spell until well into the game. Weapons and armor have durability and proper replacements are precious, forcing you into sub-optimal strategies in order to preserve your most valuable equipment from an unseen acid trap or simply usage damage.The greatest asset to the game is its unique genre, as scifi roguelikes are relatively rare, and are helped by the Sword of the Stars IP by allowing you to play varied races in the DLCs. Despite that, expect to spend your first couple of levels fighting rats and bats all the same.All in all, simply average. Would only recommend it to people who have exhausted the many other roguelike options and strongly needed a fresh challenge.Take a look at the gameplay here:

												If you're into games that are 90% about RNG and 10% about actual gameplay, you will like The Pit. I guess. It's fun for a while to die over and over again few moments after a thought ""this run is going pretty well"". But, ultimately, I found myself bored after a couple of recent runs. I never liked rouge likes or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ online card games (hearthstone, ♥♥♥♥ that toxic online casino for blizzard sheeple) that revolve mostly around RNG element. In the end, you feel that you have little to no control on whether you will succeed or loose. Maybe I simply suck with resource management in RNG games - I don't know nor I care. It seems to me that the game is intentionally designed to have few dozens runs that end terribly just to gather recipes and deposit experience points, just to succeed on 101st try. Ok, but I have better things to do.You have loads of content, play styles, characters. But your carefully built character will die very fast if the game decides to generate ♥♥♥♥ loot or good items that are absolutely useless on your current character.I think that the most appeal in this game comes from its peculiar art style and esthetics. Combined with well executed UI, sound and voice assets, it's a very attractive production.It's hard for me to imagine someone wasting hundreds of hours to beat the game on higher difficulties, but other people have worse fetishes.

												The Pit is a great rogue-like game with expansive content, variety and charm. The game is very accessible but yet very deep. It's an ideal game for someone who wants to delve into this genre.Every class plays differently and each playthrough is a challenge. Thanks to the looting, hunger and crafting system, the game has a lot of replayability. Furthermore there is much to explore and interact with making it just a very enjoyable game.The controls are smooth and the game works flawlessly. The presentation is nice and so are the sound assets. Nothing to complain about.My only major gripe with this game is that each run can be quite slow paced and take a ridiculous amount of time, also you might feel really frustrated if you accumulated extremely good loot and you lose everything after being killed in a very unfair way. Hours of progress can instantly be lost, I feel like it should be more fast paced. Each run takes up to several hours just go get into the deeper levels.Nevertheless I highly recommend this game for it's great accessibility and replay value, highly addictive!			"

												Sword of the Stars: The Pit offers countless hours of exciting and challenging gameplay! It has everything you want in a roguelike RPG: randomised levels, tense exploration, survival, character progression, crafting, traps, foraging, a cool sci-fi environment, and hundreds of enemies, items, recipes, and weapons!The Pit throws your chosen character into a deadly underground alien facility in search of a cure for a deadly plague wreaking havoc across your world. There is no turning back - you have to venture deeper until you either find the cure or die of hunger, disease, poison, radiation, or one of the many deadly inhabitants.You start out with a selection of skills and items, depending on your class. Whether you are the marine loaded with heavy weapons, ammo, and armour, or the engineer skilled in repairs, crafting, and opening containers, but with relatively light armement - you will have your own strengths and weaknesses. Every room you uncover poses new challenges, enemies, and potential rewards.I highly recommend this game to everyone who enjoys a good roguelike RPG. It has so many items, enemies, and rooms to explore that it will keep you occupied for hours. I also recommend the Gold Edition which adds so much more to the game!			"

												(This review is based off of having all the DLC that have been released as of 09/13/2014)This is one of my favorite roguelikes.However, it's not for everyone.+  Large variety of loot+  Graphical style is mostly good+  Great sci-fi setting+  Good variety of classes+  More lore than meets the eye+  Lots of modes of difficulty+  Plays great on a controller (I play with a 360 controller)-  Occassional bad and inconsistent graphics (especially some character portraits)-  No way to unassign skill points immediately after you assign them-  Race specific loot is frustrating-  Inventory management is frustrating.  Wish they did something similar to RE4-  Crafting - very punishing to experiment when crafting (ex. you try to craft an item and that combo of items doesn't work - now those items are destroyed.  However, there are ways to find recipes to avoid this problem.  It just takes awhile to get them).+/-  Drops are highly based on luck.  You need a lot of things to survive in this game, ex. a certain weapon, food, medpacks, armor, and it can either take a while to get what you want, or you may not get it at all.  I love this because it challenges me to play in a certain way, but this may not appeal to others.+/-  Just like any good roguelike, it will take you a long, long time before you ever win.  If you enjoy roguelikes, this shouldn't be a problem.I love this game.  I love the variety of classes, the setting, the different types of weapons, the feeling you get when you get a sweet weapon that has awesome stats and fits perfectly with your build.  I absolutely love the feeling that the whole game is working against you - it like a sci-fi survival-horror rpg in roguelike form, which I think is amazing.  (I think it's survival-horror in the sense of its plot, in that  you're going alone into a dark pit filled with monsters, knowing that you are most likely going to die... It obviously isn't scary though)tl;dr - If you like roguelikes, and you like them difficult, get this.  For me, this game is a 9/10.			"

												Sword of the Stars: The Pit is an excellent sci-fi themed 'rogue-lite' that has just enough depth to keep you engaged but doesn't feel all too complicated. Definately a good pick for newcomers to the roguelike genre.It has a wealth of classes to choose from -- most of which fall in to the classic RPG archetypes or some combination of them.  (at least in the Gold Edition, which seems to be the only edition available at this time). There is really nothing much to say about SotS: The Pit but there is nothing really *wrong* with it either. I didn't expect anything mind-blowing going in to the game but I also got what I wanted -- a good, rogue-lite with random dungeons, crafting, a myriad of different enemies and several ways of disposing of them.

												When speaking of taking your DLC and going stupid with it.The Pilgrim Requires Gold, Gold Requires Mind Games, Mind Games Requires Base...  That's getting kinda silly.Has a sense of humour about itself, many little jokes thrown about.  Nothing hugely amusing though, you won't be laughing out loud.It is a decent rogue-like game.  Very high loss rate based on bad luck though, some times you just never get any ammo for the weapon you use, and sometimes you just don't get any replacement for the weapon that falls apart.All in all, I'd say Dungeons of Dredmor is a much better title with a better sense of humour.  Worth picking up, but I'd rather pick it up on sale.			"

												The pit is a solid little roguelike set in the Sword of the Stars universe. Your character is looking for a cure that is rumoured to exist somewhere in the aformentioned pit, a procduraly generated dungeon that get tougher the deeper you go. There are several different classes you can play, each with there own specialities and the DLC adds even more to the mix. The game is not the toughest roguelike Ive played and I found its reasonable difficulty helped its replayability as getting to lowest levels can take some time. Some of the discoveries you make carry over from game to game but there are also storagte containers that let you leave items for future chacters to use which also gives you a bit of a leg up If you are smart with your gear and skills you can survive for quite some time though as with all roguelikes eventually you will come to some random situation you just arent able to deal with. Still, that normally leaves me with the each to start over and see if I can get further this time around			"

												As a disclaimer, I enjoy Rouge-lites. Difficult gameplay and RNG can make for some really fun games for me.Pro: (1) I really like the style/tone of the game. Having a sci-fi Rouge-lite is pretty refreshing, given how much of the genre is generic fantasy. (2) The gameplay and variety of items/weapons/armor is really diverse. There are plenty of items you will likely never see more than 1-2 times. Ranged weapons, melee, and psychic powers (basically magic) are all valid playstyles. (3) The large variety of characters allow you to pick a focus for a playstyle you like; however, they are all (mostly) able to eventually shift into other playstyles with a little work.Cons: (1) The game is a little slow. I like Binding of Isaac and FTL for the short 30-60 minute playtimes. A good run at the Pit will last at least 10-ish hours though. This does help build the tension though. (2) The interface can be a little counter intuitive and annoying to scroll through, given the large amount of pages you need to access. It can be improved if you play on a larger resolution.			"

												So man, I just looked at the hours I've spend on this game and figured a review is pretty much obligatory. I got hooked on this game through GOG when i got it as a freebee but Galaxy is so far behind on their updates and I liked the game so much I bought it a second time here on steam and all the updates to the last.And I didn't like it at first! I tryed it, and got my ♥♥♥ kicked. I thought, mediocre graphics and a game style and lore I'm not to familiar with / warmed up to, I'll just beat it quick and get on my way.100 or so hours later as a surprise to myself, the lore and gamestyle really was catching me... but I still hadn't beaten it! Make no mistake folks, this game may just drive you mad before you complete it....Cons:- ridicuoulsy hard and punishing on later levels- random generation + perma death can sometimes mean a near unavoidable loss of many many hours of gameplayPros:- ridicuoulsy hard and punishing on later levels- supply management is tuned really tight so that everything from durability to storage space, to movement to food to ammo to weapon choice and armor choice must be managed correctly to make it far- great sense of peril and intensity the deeper you goBottom line, it's not one of those games that will likely have you with love at first sight but much like the dungeon itself the longer you spend in it the more intense it will get and less likely you are to escape it :p			"

												This game is fantastic. The controls are smooth and functional. The graphics are polished. The setting is immersive, and there is loads of content available even without any of the expansions.Roguelikes often suffer from too-steep a learning curve and impenetrable interfaces. Sword of the Stars: The Pit is really the first roguelike that has sucked me in without me feeling like I needed to do a lot of work to get into it. There's a tutorial, for starters. Then you can set a difficulty level. On easy, it takes a long time for the game to start feeling difficult - plenty of time for a new player to get used to it and confident in their ability to play. Then there's the atmosphere. You're sent into this place on a mission that really matters. No macguffins hiding behind an evil wizard here. You're on a mission to save an entire colony from destruction. People's lives depend on you surviving, exploring, and finding some sort of answer to their plague. There's not even a specific goal spelled out for you. No one knows what might be in there, but there's a chance there might be some kind of salvation, if only you can find it. You're on your own, and no one has ever come out of this place. There could be anything in here.And the gameplay really serves to increase that feeling. As you walk through the halls and decaying rooms, you hear the sounds of the creatures behind the doors. You can't see behind you (a fact that is graphically represented clearly and understandably), and there have been plenty of times when I've heard something sneaking up behind me and whipped around to find it about to try to kill me. There is a very serious survival element to this game. Food and resources are limited. This is not a dungeon strewn with discarded weapons and armor. Your equipment breaks down, and chances to repair it are rare. Items you discover are really valuable. Food can be very scarce. And around every corner are crazed robots and strange sentient blobs that ruin your precious equipment as they try to kill you.But there are many possibilities for survival, as well. You have a starting choice of 3 classes (in the base game), each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and equipment. Raw physical strength is necessary, but there's also a frequent need for technical expertise, without which you won't last long. Fortunately, every character has at least some chance to learn every necessary skill. When you level up, you can choose a few skills to increase, and you also get skill points for successfully carrying out certain tasks, so it pays to take chances. Just be careful, because when you fail, you might set off an alarm or even make something explode in your face.My only complaint is the recipe system. Some recipes for cooking and crafting items can be found by deciphering computer logs found now and then in the complex, but it appears that the devs intended players to learn mostly through trial and error -- and there are far too many possibilities for that to be viable. This is the one thing I needed a wiki for, and it seems silly, really. The game is difficult enough without making us destroy ingredient after ingredient trying to figure out what all that stuff is for. Fortunately, it's all been figured out by other players by now, so a wiki will solve the problem.Aside from that one point, this is really a superbly crafted game, and I highly recommend it to everyone.

												This is one of those games I never really stop playing. It's easy to pick up and though it can be hard to put down, 'I can clear just one more floor', it never punishes you for having to stop. I don't play a lot of roguelikes so I don't know how unique this is, but it will save your progress wherever you are and you can resume just as things were before you stopped. Death is of course game-over, but certain discoveries persist through all game-plays.The story unfolds as you decrypt messages found through-out the game; decrypting messages can also reveal recipes for the crafting system. You can cook food (which you will need) and craft items based off these recipes, or you can also try combining things to discover recipes. So if you find some cheese and some bread and you can try combining the two at a cooking station and make some grilled cheese. Messages and recipes persist through all games, so once you learn something you'll never have to relearn it. Your first couple of games will probably be spent learning as much as you can so in later games you can narrow your focus on game completion.There are several difficultly levels that I feel scale pretty well.  Easy is probably the best for learning the mechanics, there is generally plenty of food and ammunition so you can focus more one fighting and exploration than tactics and efficiency. Medium is where most of the game-play mechanics become important, and as for hard and above, well good luck. As you increase difficulty better/new items are more likely to drop and new messages to decrypt appear, so there are new things to discover and different tactics to try. I think this is a great way to encourage people to try the harder levels, as opposed to ,'the same as easy only harder'.The base game is very solid, and the DLCs add a lot IMO. Not just a couple new character, but new enemies, items and game-play elements. A great game I heartily recommend.			"

												Sword of the Stars: The Pit is a turn-based exploration / survival game somewhat similar to the likes of Dungeons of Dredmor. The basic character classes seem a bit limited and don't offer any unique abilities although certain classes are more skilled doing certain things than other classes. It's a tough game to win because even on easy, other than unlocking doors, it is not forgiving. But it's usually hard because you can't find food, you can't find a gun or the right ammunition to fight, or you can't find ingredients to craft that precise recipe to cure disease--not because you died in combat.The combat aspect of the game are indeed fun. The levels are small, yet rich with monsters to kill and other stuff to interact with. Every 5 levels down, the enemies gets tougher. Then at the bottom of the pit, the game becomes 20x harder than the first 29 levels combined because, well, they throw 20x monsters at you.Overall, the game is entertaining, but it primarily suffers from a bad crafting system that requires very specific ingredients for even the most basic items. Plus the crafting stations are usually nowhere to be found when you need them most. So ultimately you keep a bunch of items around in your backpack taking up precious space, but can never use them because that last ingredient will never be found. Still, five quarters was money well spent.			"

												Sword Of The Stars The Pit is a roguelike game where you pick a class - marine, scout or engineer - and work your way down a pit. The game's combat is focused on gunfights, but you can use melee (weapons) as well, or combine those two to mix things up. There's a lot of broken stuff to repair, unlock and decrypt and you will basically get experience for everything you do. The use of items is a bit of mystery when you play it for the first time (and even after then it's still confusing at times) but you'll keep trying to figure out what these things are for nevertheless.The Pit is a fun game where you'll die a lot. A. LOT. But it doesn't matter, you don't care; you just want to get to the bottom of the pit. A very enjoyable game ![Rating: 77/100]			"

												Good but hardcore roguelike. I never was able to live more than 18 levels. As in most RLs, you are very dependent on a favor of random.Have the meta-game elements in form of logs and recipes. It gives you backstory and keeps between games. Logs must be deciphered and sometimes gives you hard-to-guess recipes too.			"

												I've never written a Steam review before. No game has inspired me enough to write a review. But I have played this game for a shocking number of hours. I return to it again and again when no other game holds my interest. I NEVER return to games this way. It has almost endless replayability and challenge. Out of probably a hundred substantial attempts at the game, I've succeeded three times. There are now over a dozen characters to play, each with very different strengths and weaknesses, and I'll never win with them all. And that's before we start talking about difficulty levels.There are other reviews that emphasize how the gameplay actually works. It's procedurally generated, turn-based, and very strategic. Resource management is at a premium. Early play can seem easy until you realize that you made it easy by wasting stuff you need later, and now you're starving, out of ammunition, and pretty much inevitably dead. You go deeper, and then you go deeper, and eventually you either win or you die. You almost certainly die.The game is rogue-like and permadeath. For a while, each play through will help you learn things that will help in future play throughs. Things become marginally easier. Focus on marginal. I've long ago passed the point where there's anything new to learn or advantage to gain. And it's still brutal.If you like a game that kills you a million different ways, but still leaves you with the sense that you could have avoided that fate if only you'd played differently, been smarter ... this is the game for you. Death is very rarely arbitrary or random. Despite the procedural generation, the game is fair. It's just incredibly, incredibly difficult.More like this, Kerberos. Keep this sort of thing coming, and I'll buy anything you make.			"

												This game is a pretty well made ""Rogue-like""It has all the basics like permadeath, randomized level geneation, including mobs and loot, turn-based movement, exploration of a seemingly endless ""dungeon"".It is set in a futuristic setting where you as either a marine, scout or engineer, explore a base full of critters, aliens and robots all out to kill you. You do this by scavenging for supplies from breaking open freezers to hacking locked storage units, utilizing the available instalations (the ones working and the ones you're able to repair) like med bays, repair units and recharging stations to keep your self and your gear healthy and last but not least by using labs and cooking sations to cook food and and craft usefull gear either by trial and error or by using recipes you find by hacking into the varios computers arround the facility.But as opposed to most other rogue-likes the thing that makes each play-through different is the knowledge of the player and not so much a change of the game itself. The game will however help keep track of things you learn from each playthrough, stats of enemies, different weapons and recipes, but it's up to the player to utilize this added information on each playthrough. I imagine you can find most of this information on the net, but part of what makes this game interesting is the discovery of this information on your own during play.The progression within each playthrogh is done by increasing your skills and stats at each level-up but also by having your skills increase as you use them.The difference between the 3 classes cosist mainly in the differen starting point eg. gear, stats and skills. The engineer start with a lot of utility items like different tool kits, better utility skills like lock-picking and computer skill, but with a lesser arsenal containing only a knife, a revolver and a few grenades. The Marine starts with a bigger arsenal that for instance contains an assault rifle and an auto pistol, but with lower utility skills and almost no tools. The scout is sort of a middle ground between the two but also with her own specialties. However the game doesn't limit what you can do with each class, if you want to only level the utility skills of the marine, he can pretty much end up as competent as the engineer for hacking computers and picking locks. A fair warning though, even though the game alows you to save and exit any time, it is very difficult to let go of once you're in the middle of a playthrough, so you may very easily end up spending loads of hours exploring the depths of ""the pit"" and all you have to show for it is a recipe for eggs and bacon and a not about how an experiment got out of control.

												If you have ever played resident evil, and you enjoy organizing and managing your inventory, this game is exactly like that, except that the management aspect is the entire game. There are so many things to keep track of in your survival, every turn you must make sure, are your weapons reloaded? do you have room in your inventory? exactly how many steps can you feasibly take before that moon bear rips your face off? Are you faster or is it faster? Not to mention the level up system, HP bar, metoblism bar (Don't starve to death), psionic points bar, wide variety of different skills and characters... I could be here all day.This is not a game for the typical fan of space marine, shoot 'em up. This is an amazing game of managing many different things, don't ever forget that you have as long as you need every single action to make up your mind on what you will do next.

The Pit is a dangerous place filled with all sorts of monsters, security robots, aliens and goodies! The objective, is to reach the last floor of The Pit surviving at all costs in this turn-based RPG rogue-like game. It's quite fun and intense to play, however, you'll lose many times, so good luck.

												This is a brilliant and well-crafted Roguelike. Now with some skill under my belt, I never feel like the Random Number God puts me in an unwinnable situation except on very rare occasions. With your strategy, wits and a little bit of luck, you will pull through, and unlock safe rooms to start farther along. It's a fun system, and this game even has a story ingeniously implemented into a Roguelike; you find messages in terminals and desks, and must decrypt them. Some are random, some give much-needed recipes, and some still deliver snippets of story that lead you wondering what happened to Tamiko Hoshinara, the scientist recently vanished to the Pit, and why the twisted Suul'ka kidnapped her. It's dark, but comedic. It's challenging, but not impossible (except on the highest difficulty). Definitely a good buy, expansions recommended.Well, now that I've explored more, I can write a more in depth review. This game understands what it is to be a roguelike. It perfectly captures the fear, desperation, and loneliness of descending into a near-Lovecraftian monster's favourite toybox. Every step of the way you're worried about food, medicine, equipment, keeping armour repaired, finding food, but most importantly to what makes this game great: What that noise was. That deep throated growl followed by the stomp of a massive foot. It's the nature of the game, you never have any idea what's around the corner. There are monsters that are cannon fodder, ones that you will always shoot first to avoid the fatal diseases they carry, mechs to fill you wiith bullets, and of course, powerful, magnificent and terrifying monsters waiting around every corner that will make you their dinner if you aren't ready for them. As you descend (into perfectly created environments, with their own atmospheres might I add, every now and then there's a change of scenery that makes things more ominous- where can I get food here? What kind of enemies are there? From sleek hallways to blood splattered chambers, some of these wouldn't be out of place in a horror game), you never know what you will find next. And that's whats perfect about it. Mystery. Exploration. Atmosphere. It almost feels like you're there, if you can really get into a session. Kerberos? I cannot find another game that does this so well. Thank you so much. Final verdict: Buy it. Buy it now. It only gets better the more time you put into it, I have given it many hours and I suspect it shall have many more. Also get DLCs! They improve the variety many times over. I hope you find my enhanced review helpful.Expansion number three! The game has just undergone a massive overhaul and acquired a new DLC. HURRAH! Just a few comments here. I was noticing, I am encountering much more varied and surprising things much earlier along. Just by some different RNG, this game is now more than twice what it was before, every step you have to think- even early on, which was once merely finding food for the more dangerous lower floors. Never before has it been a better buy. Also expect my Juggernaut review soon!Sorry to ramble in a disorganised manner, but character DLCs are highly recommended. Many a time, I have outthought my enemies as the Shephard, clobbered them under my warhammer as the Mercenary, and now, am in the process of watching them be torn apart by zombies as the skeletal Lich. The character expansions offer new and exciting playstyles, well worth the 2$ price tag per. Kerb just keeps making good content.			"

												As a fan of roguelikes I instabought it with all dlcs when it was on sale (note, I'm newish player and haven't played it on release).I simply can't recommend the game despite it having a lot of potential. Why?1. Runs are too long and quickly get dull. I like spending longer time for a game but runs here just take too long. You call ftl runs boring cause they are up to 2 hours? Here you can easily spend multiple days on a single run if you ain't rushing like mad. Despite having somewhat good runs I couldn't finish it a single time because I got bored past 30th floor.2. The game is about conservation of inventory I get it, it's survival roguelike. I like the fact you gotta choose what to fight and what not and what items to use. Problem is that in order to play the game effectively you have to waste another hours on dropping your armor/invnetory vs certain enemies + saving every little bit of ammo. It's okay you don't get to shoot your starting machine gun 24/7 but here you just gotta walk naked for the 1st 15 floors.3. Crafting's pretty okay but the whole ''not entirely encrypted messages'' thingie makes it impossible to get most recipes without wiki, spending tons of hours in the game.While the idea, price, dlcs seems all good and makes me wanna try this game once again I simply don't want to since combat gets boring so fast.If you're a fanatic of the genre and you don't mind repetitive combat you should still go for it (entire exploration aspects are done okay).

												Original review: amazing rouguelike. Crafting system, Improve-as-you-use skill system (Ultima, Morrowind)  tons of gear, monsters, lore, everything you could possibly want from a roguelike.I have a problem with a company that releases so many DLC's that should have been in the full game. When i wrote my review it was under the assumption that I was going to recieve the full game and I feel robbed slightly. First it was a single DLC (Mindwerks i think its called) which was fine, but then after it came the ""GOLD"" DLC which I need for all future DLC because it contains everything that SHOULD have been in the first release, and then a slew of other character DLC's.... This right here is the problem with DLC's being a thing, they should have all been wrapped into an Expansion and charge me 10-20 dollars for and I wouldnt feel robbed... but now I have to peicemeal my game together with DLC'S? no thanks, theres other roguelikes with as many/more options. Go get Project Zomboid or Dungeons of Dredmoor of you want a good roguelike experience at a lower cost and less DLC garbage + workshop			"

True to its labeling, it is actually a rogue-like, and not a rogue-""lite"".If you liked Nethack or ADOM or similar, and like space/sci-fi themes, youll enjoy this game a lot.I feel some things could be improved upon, such as the HUD and information about currently applied status effects, but overall, very fun, very tactical, and true to the theme of the rogue-like with interesting twists of its very own.At that moment Ill give the game an 8.5/10, and a ""must have on discount"" to all rogue-like fans, especially the more serious ones (the game is pretty tough and resource management and tactical usage is key, true to true RL nature, but casuals usually dont like that).

												SOTS: The Pit is a modern take on ""Rogue"" or ""DND"" where you explore a randomly generated dungeon hoping to grab the treasure at the end, but this time, with a bit of a sci-fi twist. Wide variety of weapons, locks, armor, and plenty of recipes for crafting makes for a different game as you play through. Unfortunately, hunger, disease, poison, and other nasty effects await you as well (but there are counter-agents you can find or synthesize, if you find the right places and ingredients). Graphics are low-tech but that's part of the ""oldskool"" charm. No two game will be like, with 3 separate starting types. (Optional DLC adds 10 more levels and 2 more starting types). If you like this sort of dungeon crawl, give it a try!			"

												A complex inventory managment game. You loot, spend, and conserve resources, and always look for new ways to do all three more efficiently.Some things I didn't like:You have to grind to unlock an entire crafting mechanic piece by piece. There's an entire skill devoted to getting these unlocks, and you run specialists using it until you have your unlocks, which, I suppose makes it useless?You store items across games so you can spawn with them on lower floors. Not sure its feasible to win without this mechanic because the game is really long, and you're dependent on certain key items dropping randomly throughout.It's ♥♥♥♥ing boring. When you think ""sci-fi dungeon crawl"", do you think of kiting enemies into a choke so you can unequip your weapons and armor to kill them without spending durability? Do you think of crafting weapons so you can not use them, because when you have to use them, you lose them? I do, after playing this game. I wish I didn't.			"

												Insanely, stupidly difficult, even on the lowest difficulty setting.And this is coming from a guy who often beats difficult games on the hardest difficulty setting. I consider myself very good at roguelikes, and incredibly good at rpgs.And I really love a challenge too, but this game just doesn't offer any reasonable challenge. It calls the lowest mode ""easy"", but thats so far off the mark it's rediculess.Yes the first ~10 floors are quite easy, on easy mode.. But it quickly ramps up and becomes incredibly hard.Normal mode is more like most games ""Very hard""And the game has freaking two more modes: Insane and Seriously? . Insane is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, you 100% can't win most games even if you play perfect and spend insane amounts of time strategizing every agonizing move (in a game that will take 10s of a thousands of moves to complete). And seriously? I don't believe anyone has ever completed it without cheating. Hell even getting past the first few floors on that mode is insanely frusterating.I beat easy mode, after some ~15+ frusterating hours of attempting normal. I usually hate playing lengthy games on easy, as I want the victory to be meaningful. But in this games case.. Meh it should just be called Normal for easy. Theres nothing easy about it.The final floor alone took me some 4+ hours to beat, and had to use an insane stockpile of crazy rare items and cheesy strategies im really not proud of.Plus the game has no real progression system like some ohter rogue likes to give you advantages on later play thrus really. After you die, your dead and thats it. Sure there are recipes you can learn, but the crafting in this game is painfully difficult, insanely random and unrewarding.... And after 15+ hours I had no real good recipes learn anyways. So I just did what had to be done to have ANY chance at beating this game in less then 100+ hours: Checked the wiki - yea nearly all the recipes are there, and you dont actally have to unlock them to craft anyways.Protip: The most important/useful item to craft is the Quantum Scan Helmet. It lets you see thru walls and behind you, which is damn near neccesary on the lower lvls to conserve amunition/durability. But like all things in this game - its very hard to craft, requires 4 very rare drops. I managed only to make 2 near the last few levels, and the durability on them suck, so they both broke too.I think a major part of the reason for the unbalanced unfun difficulty is the dlc - I bought only the bare minimum version you can buy here on steam, which included base + gold + mind games.These dlcs do add cool stuff to the game, but the developers seem to think the main purpose of DLC is to increase difficulty.. Because nearly all of the enemies added in these, are vastly harder then the base games enemies, that and each introduces more ingredients - which you can only carry a very small amount on most classes, and more is not better, as it reduces the chances of you finding the exact ones you need for a given recipe, and makes managing your inventory more frusterating.So yea the original vanilla version may well have been balanced better. Wish I could tell, but far as I could tell sadly there is no way to disable the DLCs, nor does steam offer the game without them.Glad I didnt buy the other 2, as they seem to even further increase the difficulty of the game.So yea, what could of been a very great game I just cant recommend due to the fact its just unreasonable difficult to beat, even on the lowest settings.I see the devs are stll active ont he game tho, so I'll offer some simple tweaks that may aleviate this:1. Add options in the game to disable the DLCs. Add a notification to the game explaining they may increase difficulty.2. Rename Easy to Hard, Hard to Insane, Insane to Impossible. first 39 floors are ok but please make the final floor less ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly insanely hard. 3. Add a new easier difficulty called Normal - recommended. Reduces total number of enemies by -10% (-50% on the final floor). Reduces chances of equipment damage. Increase all items durability +50%.

												Sword of the Stars: The Pit may be one of the best rougelikes I have ever played. It has a certain depth that is easy to access, a lore that isnt forced down your throat, and the graphics and sound design create a fantastic atmosphere.Whilst it is not the deepest Rouge-like I have ever played, there is a good feeling of depth in the game, which is brought through via a the recipe system, realistic degradation, diseases, poisons, enhancements and others as well. The tutorial does a steller job of teaching you these mechanics, and as a result, the game is deep enough for rouge-like veterns to enjoy, but not so daunting that new-comers won't be able to handle all the systems.Part of the lore is brought through the environment and character bios. However, the game has an interesting way to telling you about the game world through haveing the character decipher various messages. These messages arn't just average walls of text when deciphered either, depending on your decipher skill, certain words will be missing, and so will keep you guessing, and thinking about what happened to the base.The graphics, at least in my opinion, are perfect for the game, the colours have a nice sense of degradation, without making the world seem like a constant state of bland. The animation are nice too, and it really helps with the immersion. Furthermore, the sound design is superb, and keeps you on your toes as you listen to the various animals and robots patrolling the hallways.Combat is rewarding and tense, there is a real feeling of strategy after about floors 5 onwards, you are forced to prioritise, and when you clear a room whilst taking minimal damage it really is a satisfying feeling. The game also allows you to approach combat in your own way. Due to the wide range of weapons, weapon mods, stats, psoincs and more, you can go in guns blazing, or just sneak past your enemies, maybe turning invisible, and forcing a stronger opponent to turn on his friends.The implementation of food is also a nice touch to the game, as it stops the player from becoming an overpowered powerhouse. In one game, I had a super strong armour and ammo for my weapons, however, I was living meal by meal, and my engineer died after alerting all the robots in the area to his location because he turned on an alarm looking for supplies.Overall I think if you are curious about rougelikes, or just really want another game to get your teeth into, for the price of the game, its a steal. :] "

												+ Actually a roguelike.+ Has a proper tutorial with good coverage.+ Features a kind of metagame progression, where you can hack computers to find messages which can later be decrypted to reveal recipes(which are not easy nor cheap to find by just randomly combining stuff). This carries across playthroughs in the form of an ingame database, another plus.+ What of it isn't flawed in design is well-polished.+ In terms of both metagame and individual playthroughs, the length of the game is pretty good.~ Decent graphics.~ Decent SFX.~ Acceptable controls, messy in areas.~ The vast majority of the items are highly situational, and because there are so many, any given resource is fairly scarce. Not all bad, since it usually just forces adaptive strategies.- Many categories of events are TOO random, the game's biggest flaw. This is most pronounced in poison, disease(both of which can randomly be fought off or worsen, but you cannot influence this in any way except direct usage of a health kit[which are uncommon]) and finding weapons(which eventually break, leaving you with absolutely no way to defend yourself).- Questionable balance between classes.- Levelups fully heal you and don't necessary need to be applied the moment your XP bar caps, providing a ready source of instant, full healing. Maybe it's an intended feature, but that doesn't make it any better.Value: $6.50			"

												As I was suggested this title, I was quite confused as I really wasn't into the whole spaceship mayhem that Sword of the Stars series was originally about. The Pit brings a refreshing change to the saga as it introduces the world of SotS to players in the form of a dungeon crawler/roguelike. And what a way to enter the genre it is.I suppose the first thing to get out of the way is to mention that this game is hard. REALLY HARD. If you aren't a fan of dying over and over again in order to gain progress on your future runs, I suggest you to turn away and leave this game be. Don't let even the large variety of difficulty levels to fool you. Where as most games should never be played on any difficulty below Hard to experience the game how it should be, SotS:The Pit offers you a challenge harder than any I've experienced before when it comes to games and their normal difficulties. And of course in the spirit of roguelikes, every death is permanent. Every death is one step further in the line of progress.The term roguelike might come off as the meaning of unfair to people who are familiar with it and SotS is no exception. It in fact takes the unfairness to a whole new level. The harder difficulties in this game are just brutal and they often don't even offer a realistic chance of it being teh urn. The whole grinding aspect will teach you to conserve ammo, items and just generally survive the life in The Pit better so you would have a higher chance of completing the game on your next venture.You start off the game by choosing from a variety of different classes to play and truth be told, this is probably the biggest flaw of the game. Some classes simply cannot complete the game on harder difficulties unless you get extremely lucky. You should probably be using that amount of luck on winning the lottery though since that's an appropriate depiction of the luck needed. Once you have figured out the viable classes and the ones you love playing after several hours of dying, let the fun begin. Don't get me wrong, you can get most classes to work on most difficulty levels, but it's not really worth the effort.The item variety in this game is really wide and the game even features a large number of crafted items. The crafting system is really enjoyable for only those who are really dedicated, hardcore gamers as the only way to discover recipes is to have high enough skill to access the computers you find in the dungeons. You are honestly just better off googling the recipes so you have even the slightest of clues about what half of the items you will find on your runs are good for. In the war that this game features, you will most definitely learn to conserve your ammo as it's very limited and you need to save every single bullet possible. Conserving ammo often means needing to learn which enemies can open doors and which don't and proceeding to trap those unable to do so in meaningless rooms.All in all, I suggest this game for pretty much anyone looking for a good gaming experience and not getting butthurt over the game being cruel. Once you get into the flow this game will suck you in and you will keep coming back to it time after time. There's a fine line between the game being good and the player being masochistic. I endured it. Now it's up to you to figure out whether the game enthralls you or absolutely disgusts you, simply because the game is just that damn good if you happen to fall in love with it. At the current set price it's definitely worth finding out as this game will definitely offer you a superb bang for buck value.			"

												SotS: The Pit is a sci-fi roguelike, in the traditional sense of the term: turn-based, permadeath, big dungeon, gear/character progression. You pick a class, enter the pit, and level/gear up by beating up monsters as you dive down and aim to kill the final boss to win.The game's particular flavour comes from emphasis on attrition as the key mechanic. Weapon and armour degrade with use, ammo gets spent, hunger needs to be kept in check. This results in a dungeon crawl where you need to weight the potential gains of exploration and combat (in gear, food and experience) with the costs involved in time/hunger/ammo and gear degradation. Without this, the early game feels deceptively easy until one runs short of pretty much everything about floor 10-15, resulting in a doomed run.Other random features of the game include:- Combat-centric: you'll spend most of the time fighting or planning the next fight, with movement, range, line-of-sight, bio/mecha/cyborg enemy types, props all considerations in how (or whether) to clear up a room.- Plenty of lore in messages that you extract from the Pit's computer system and decipher. These deciphered messages include crafting recipes, and are persistent over multiple games, so you'll slowly find them all game after game.- A massive amount of crafting recipes: food, weapons, ammo, armour, utility gear, consumables... These are key to doing well in the game, and if you're not patient enough to play enough games to unlock them, it's worth using the game's wiki to learn some important ones (the food recipes in particular).- Plenty of classes. Between the Gold Edition, the Mind Games expansion and the additional class DLCs, there are plenty of characters to pick from, each one with a distinct flavour. Note that the additional character DLCs also add lots of Pit props, gear, and crafting recipes. If you like the game, it's worth picking these up even if you don't particularly mind the class itself.- A psionic system with plenty of cool powers, which can make the game much, much easier. Seriously, try it out on a decent psionic class if you're struggling with pure physical runs.- A high difficulty. It'll take you a while to succeed, there's a very steep learning curve.Obviously, the game has a few issues. The main one is that the sheer amount of items and crafting components (increased over time and expansions) may result on the player entirely missing out on some rare equipment (laser weapons, adamantium claws, armour...). You learn to live with it, but it can be frustrating at times. The other potential downside is that the game is long. While the first dozen floors are quick, the deeper you go, the slower things will be as you carefully manage your actions. The game used to have 30 floors but this got extended to 40 and those additional 10 floors, while providing more chances to roll useful equipment, add a fair few hours to a run. This is not a coffee-break roguelike by any means.Overall, I like the game a lot and would recommend it, particularly considering how cheap it is. There's a playable demo out there too, so try it out beforehand to make sure it's your thing.			"

												After a plague hits your planet, a glorified military retirement home, it’s up to you to find a cure. A nearby alien facility, built long ago by some long-gone alien race, might hold the cure. Except no expedition has ever returned alive…And you won’t either. Not for the first hundred deaths at least. The Pit is a “roguelike”, a genre that gets its name from the 1980s dungeon crawler Rogue. All the genre conventions are intact: brutal difficulty until you learn the tricks, randomly-generated map layouts, unidentified loot that may or may not kill you, traps, and turn-based combat. The Pit keeps it pretty fun, light-hearted and best of all, fast. Once you get the hang of things, the turn-based nature melts away and it feels more like an action game.There are three classes to choose from - more if you own some of the DLC - each focusing on a specific kind of play. The Engineer is good at hacking computers, the Marine excels at weapons, while the Scout can zip around and try to avoid combat. Your skills, like crafting, cooking, or lockpicking, improve as you use them and when you level up. As you decipher messages at computer terminals, lore, crafting recipes and tips are revealed. These are added to your codex and remain across play sessions, helping future excursions.			"

												I've put in almost 100 hours into this game and now I can safely say that it is a lot of fun, but a whole lot of frustrating. It is a roguelike with some crafting elements involved. This is where the frustration comes in. There are so many pieces in the game that I can hardly ever make something useful. Item drop rate is pretty low and so I find that I am relying solely on drops rather than skill. I realize that all roguelikes rely somewhat on drops, but this one seems completely reliant on them to me.It is fun though, but I have ascended in Nethack and I still think this game is broken.			"

												It's hard. You will not beat it in your first run as with any rogue like. But the core mechanics and game play are so solid you'll enjoy replaying it. Each time you replay the game you'll hopefully obtain a new recipe which will mean the useless crap you've been picking up as drops from monsters won't be as useless anymore. Not to mention you'll learn what to pour your points into for each individual class and more importantly when to STOP pouring points into a stat. As with any game based around luck you'll get bummed out when you have a sequence of bad runs but unlike don't starve or rogue legacy your first hour in any run will always be radically different.

												Addictive well-crafted sci-fi roguelike. That either will make you salivate (in which case you should have this yesterday - get in the time machine now) or maybe you will wonder what that means. Let me explain as I have put loads of time into this game and I keep finding new things to make/use/kill and I just love it. It is set in the Sword of the Stars sci-fi setting, there are aliens and it is set on a far away world. You have skills and equipment and there is a crafting and levelling system. Everything is generated from floor plans to encounters to the stuff you find and so the game is very replayable - but you only have the one life. If your character dies, he/she/it is dead and there is no coming back. But do not despair! Not all is for nothing, as recipies and decoded messages are available for other playthroughs and equipment and experience can be stashed for deeper starts.And get the gold edition. Trust me, it is cheaper to get that then testing it out with the basic game and then coming back later and expanding it. Want more?

												The Pit is brilliant, but it takes some getting used to. If you're used to Roguelikes where everything must die you will end up running out of stuff and dying yourself. Fundamentally, it's about attrition. Weapons break, ammo is scarce, food is a real limiting factor. It's a constant, tense balance between forging forward at less than full strength and risking starvation, a balance between killing stuff for the XP and draining your ability to kill things. There's a shift that begins about halfway down; you go from gaining stuff to maintaining and then losing it as the enemies take more shots to kill relative to available ammo.This means you're making choices all the time instead of whacking popcorn absentmindedly until you mistakenly whack a unique and die because you weren't paying attention. There are two major problems:1. The crafting is vital but also highly annoying since recipies are hidden from you. It's kind of fun at first but eventually I just started wikiing it.2. The blue room mechanism veritably invites cheesing the game by starting characters, dumping their gear at level five, and starting over. It's tough not to do but removes a lot of what makes the game great. At the very least there should be some achievements for winning without using the blue room.Despite the above this is one of my favorite roguelikes ever.			"

A short streak of bad luck? You're dead.This game is designed to kill you even if you do everything right, which is kinda refreshing. My best result on the Normal Difficulty was getting to the 26th floor with my decked out scout. Perfect armor drops, awesome weapons... she suffers one hit from a tiny little virus. Gets sick.

												Really challenging but also a lot of fun. This game hates you and will kick your ♥♥♥. There are a lot of good reviews that go into detail about the game and explain things really well and I don't have much to add there. I just want to stress 2 things:1. Its so well integrated you may not notice at first, but this game is completely turn based. I didn't realize that when I bought the game and felt a little overwhelmed about the controls. I put off playing it for a long time because of that, but it wasn't necessary. I play with a controller for most things, and hit my hotkeys on the keyboard when I want to use an ability or switch up weapons and that actually works really smoothly for me but you could probably play this game efficiently with just one or the other. And you can take all the time you want to select things in combat. Quick reactions are not the point of this game like I thought they might have been.2. Understand the fact that you will die, and that means permadeath. Its going to happen a lot - more frequently than not, so be prepared to accept it. However you keep all your decoded messages (even the partially decrypted ones) and recipes. Those persist through all characters and playthroughs and you can stash items and experience points for other characters in your future runs, so a death doesn't have to be a complete loss, but it will happen often.

												This game is... a peculiar case. The graphics are good enough for what they're supposed to do and the gameplay is easy enough to understand even without playing the tutorial. Assuming of course you have played a Roguelike of some description before. The biggest flaw upon the games release was the lack of content, so to speak, as only three classes were available to play as. For this reason I recommend getting the Gold Edition from the get go as it ups the number of available classes to ten. It also adds the gameplay element of psionics, which is the magic-version of this game. What however is probably the biggest critique I have for this game is the absurd ability of the RNG to absolutely shaft you. I had a perfectly good run once with plenty of ammo and weapons, but no food drops whatsoever, which doomed my run to end with starvation, which was actually pretty sad to watch given how it's not instant, but procedual death as your character becomes weaker until suffering the so called Stat-death or simply being overwhelmed by enemies because of the ton of debuffs that gets heaped onto you.Nonetheless, if you're into Roguelikes and you want one settled in a Sci-Fi setting then I can wholeheartedly recommend this game.

												Addictive well-crafted sci-fi roguelike. That either will make you salivate (in which case you should have this yesterday - get in the time machine now) or maybe you will wonder what that means. Let me explain as I have put loads of time into this game and I keep finding new things to make/use/kill and I just love it. It is set in the Sword of the Stars sci-fi setting, there are aliens and it is set on a far away world. You have skills and equipment and there is a crafting and levelling system. Everything is generated from floor plans to encounters to the stuff you find and so the game is very replayable - but you only have the one life. If your character dies, he/she/it is dead and there is no coming back. But do not despair! Not all is for nothing, as recipies and decoded messages are available for other playthroughs and equipment and experience can be stashed for deeper starts.And get the gold edition. Trust me, it is cheaper to get that then testing it out with the basic game and then coming back later and expanding it. Want more?

												The Pit is brilliant, but it takes some getting used to. If you're used to Roguelikes where everything must die you will end up running out of stuff and dying yourself. Fundamentally, it's about attrition. Weapons break, ammo is scarce, food is a real limiting factor. It's a constant, tense balance between forging forward at less than full strength and risking starvation, a balance between killing stuff for the XP and draining your ability to kill things. There's a shift that begins about halfway down; you go from gaining stuff to maintaining and then losing it as the enemies take more shots to kill relative to available ammo.This means you're making choices all the time instead of whacking popcorn absentmindedly until you mistakenly whack a unique and die because you weren't paying attention. There are two major problems:1. The crafting is vital but also highly annoying since recipies are hidden from you. It's kind of fun at first but eventually I just started wikiing it.2. The blue room mechanism veritably invites cheesing the game by starting characters, dumping their gear at level five, and starting over. It's tough not to do but removes a lot of what makes the game great. At the very least there should be some achievements for winning without using the blue room.Despite the above this is one of my favorite roguelikes ever.			"

												Sword of the Stars: The Pit is a top-down turn-based rougelike game. The point of the game is to get to the bottom of the 50 level dungeon (i think its 50, and im pretty sure it's 100 with the dlc). when you start you can choose from 3 different classes (5 with the dlc) each with different specialties and items they start out with. for each level you pass the game gets increasingly harder and new items and enemies appear. The game is turn-based because you get a turn where you can move a certain number of spaces, use items, open lootables and attack, and then the enemies get a turn. Although the turns go by so fast because you can only go 2 spaces each turn (with the marine), use items, or attack once, so you'll barely even notice its turn-based. personally its one of my favorite games of all time. everybody should play this. EVERYBODY.			"

												As I was suggested this title, I was quite confused as I really wasn't into the whole spaceship mayhem that Sword of the Stars series was originally about. The Pit brings a refreshing change to the saga as it introduces the world of SotS to players in the form of a dungeon crawler/roguelike. And what a way to enter the genre it is.I suppose the first thing to get out of the way is to mention that this game is hard. REALLY HARD. If you aren't a fan of dying over and over again in order to gain progress on your future runs, I suggest you to turn away and leave this game be. Don't let even the large variety of difficulty levels to fool you. Where as most games should never be played on any difficulty below Hard to experience the game how it should be, SotS:The Pit offers you a challenge harder than any I've experienced before when it comes to games and their normal difficulties. And of course in the spirit of roguelikes, every death is permanent. Every death is one step further in the line of progress.The term roguelike might come off as the meaning of unfair to people who are familiar with it and SotS is no exception. It in fact takes the unfairness to a whole new level. The harder difficulties in this game are just brutal and they often don't even offer a realistic chance of it being teh urn. The whole grinding aspect will teach you to conserve ammo, items and just generally survive the life in The Pit better so you would have a higher chance of completing the game on your next venture.You start off the game by choosing from a variety of different classes to play and truth be told, this is probably the biggest flaw of the game. Some classes simply cannot complete the game on harder difficulties unless you get extremely lucky. You should probably be using that amount of luck on winning the lottery though since that's an appropriate depiction of the luck needed. Once you have figured out the viable classes and the ones you love playing after several hours of dying, let the fun begin. Don't get me wrong, you can get most classes to work on most difficulty levels, but it's not really worth the effort.The item variety in this game is really wide and the game even features a large number of crafted items. The crafting system is really enjoyable for only those who are really dedicated, hardcore gamers as the only way to discover recipes is to have high enough skill to access the computers you find in the dungeons. You are honestly just better off googling the recipes so you have even the slightest of clues about what half of the items you will find on your runs are good for. In the war that this game features, you will most definitely learn to conserve your ammo as it's very limited and you need to save every single bullet possible. Conserving ammo often means needing to learn which enemies can open doors and which don't and proceeding to trap those unable to do so in meaningless rooms.All in all, I suggest this game for pretty much anyone looking for a good gaming experience and not getting butthurt over the game being cruel. Once you get into the flow this game will suck you in and you will keep coming back to it time after time. There's a fine line between the game being good and the player being masochistic. I endured it. Now it's up to you to figure out whether the game enthralls you or absolutely disgusts you, simply because the game is just that damn good if you happen to fall in love with it. At the current set price it's definitely worth finding out as this game will definitely offer you a superb bang for buck value.			"

												+ Actually a roguelike.+ Has a proper tutorial with good coverage.+ Features a kind of metagame progression, where you can hack computers to find messages which can later be decrypted to reveal recipes(which are not easy nor cheap to find by just randomly combining stuff). This carries across playthroughs in the form of an ingame database, another plus.+ What of it isn't flawed in design is well-polished.+ In terms of both metagame and individual playthroughs, the length of the game is pretty good.~ Decent graphics.~ Decent SFX.~ Acceptable controls, messy in areas.~ The vast majority of the items are highly situational, and because there are so many, any given resource is fairly scarce. Not all bad, since it usually just forces adaptive strategies.- Many categories of events are TOO random, the game's biggest flaw. This is most pronounced in poison, disease(both of which can randomly be fought off or worsen, but you cannot influence this in any way except direct usage of a health kit[which are uncommon]) and finding weapons(which eventually break, leaving you with absolutely no way to defend yourself).- Questionable balance between classes.- Levelups fully heal you and don't necessary need to be applied the moment your XP bar caps, providing a ready source of instant, full healing. Maybe it's an intended feature, but that doesn't make it any better.Value: $6.50			"

Although i suggest picking up the DLC Mindgames aswell, since its make the game even more accessible, even to players who are new to the genre.  The visual style of the game has a hand-drawn retro cartoony feel to it, which i like and attracted me in the first place to this game. The interface and combat may take a few minutes to figure out but after that it is smooth sailing. Its by no means the best rogue-like u'll ever play, but fun nonetheless and hard to put down. "

												Out of the roguelikes that I've played so far, SotStP is the one that I've enjoyed most. I think the devs have achieved the correct difficulty balance, which is important because this is permadeath only with random map layouts. Luck is a factor, but not so much that the game can screw you over in one move. Playing as the marine on easy, the combat was very forgiving, but I still had to be careful when low on ammo or when my weapons were badly damaged. Normal is actually very brutal and I haven't even got halfway yet. There are two higher difficulties for crazy people :) Combat is turn based and there is alot of weapon and enemy variety, which adds up to good tactical depth. Non combat skills and equipment can help in interesting ways. Graphics and sound are okay, but unfortunately the story is hidden in encrypted data files that I didn't have the skills to read. I didn't notice any bugs. A full playthrough should take around 8 hours so you get good value for money at full price.			"

												I felt the need to write about this game since when I looked earlier I had close to 150 hours on it. I've been playing this since it's release and have been keeping up with the updates. Over time the game went over drastic changes both via patches and DLC but still stays the same game. In short I most certainly recommend this game but warn people that it will test their patience.This is a rouge like sci-fi game where when you die you have to start over. While some of the recent updates lets you start at a specific level, for the most part the feature is not as relavent as it was when it was introduced. You start at floor 1 and work your way down to floor 40.  The floors get progressivly larger and filled with more dangerous enemies. All gear is randomly generated through the floors so there is no guarantee of anything. You need food to survive? Tough luck, I've had characters that starved before. Game gives you ton of ammo but no weapons? Yeah that will happen too. A lot of times your overall progress depends on luck while your small term progress (going from room to room, encounter to encounter) depends on your knowledge of the game and your cautious nature. Crafting is present in the game and it's rather important. Some of the best items are found via crafting. You can craft by either putting random stuff in appropriate medium, follow a recipe you found in the game or elsewhere. My suggestion is to bookmark the wiki page with recipes. it will make your life significantly easier and with less frustration than usual. But beware that even if you do have the proper ingrediants the craft can fail and you lose all your ingrediants upon fail...YeahThe game started with three classes: Marine, Scout and Engineer, each more or less the same but with different starting attributes. Now with two DLCs, where there is inclusion of several non human classes and entirerly new psi magic system the game expanded to a better complexity.Game is fully turn based so you can take your time, leave the game in the background etc. So why to play this game? Well success in this game feels legitimate. It's an extremely harsh environment where with a great deal of skill, knowledge and luck you can prevail. If that strikes your fancy this game should give you a great deal of entertainment, but betware that there is plenty of trial and error and just bad luck to happen. I had an enemy destroy my pocket tesseract(larger inventory), this threw my armor out of my inventory, which made the next attack kill me, all during the enemy's turn. Stuff like that will happen. If you have the nerve to look past it and start over you will certainly find a great deal of fun here.			"

												I love challenging roguelikes, but this game has too many flaws to recommend. It's a shame because the flaws are easily fixable if the developers would adapt to feedback. Specifically:1) Grinding for recipes: might be fun for a small percentage of players, but it's extremely tedious and boring for others. Suggested fix: make grinding for recipes optional for players who are willing to waste the extra hours to do so, but do not force it on players who want to enjoy the rest of the tactical challenges the game has to offer.2) Tediousness of traps: some trap doors eliminate critical items that effectively end a run. There are known workarounds used by some of the most dedicated players (e.g. LuckyLuckLuc's hardcore playthroughs), but the workaround is to tediously drop each item in inventory and tediously pick them all up again. Stupidly essential, but not remotely fun.Going through a roguelike phase and loving other games in the genre, I came back to this game over a year later to revisit it, but am disappointed to see these flaws remain. This game could instantly become one of the best roguelikes available on PC if it addressed some of these simple issues.Traps can be dangerous/hardcore and still be fun. An example of a game that does this superbly is Shattered Pixel Dungeon for Android (free, open source, no ads, 100% excellent). Examples of good traps (from SPD):- start on fire and need to get to water or risk losing up to 30% health and burning valuable scrolls- toxic/paralysis gas: need to escape immediately - cursing trap: severely undermines 1-3 key items until curse can be lifted(common theme: all are challenging, and ideally avoided, but can be survived and don't instantly end a run. The game does have a few extremely punishing traps in the last 3 floors, but by that point a savvy player has ideally acquired enough scrolls of magic mapping to navigate most/all those floors)Examples of bad traps (Sword of the Stars: The Pit): sit and tediously drop all your items before walking through a door or sorry your run is done.It's a shame to see a game with such great potential remain so terrible due to a few easily addressable design issues. Bought this game and would still like to revisit it some day if these issues are ever addressed.			"

If you play your cards right, you can get far.  None of the deaths on the first floor mishaps you see in many rogue-likes.  Keeps you interested and playing.

												Some people think that investing hundreds and hundreds of hours into a game that they will never see the end of is fun! I am one of these people! Sword of the Stars: The Pit is one of these games! Therefore it's a game I'm going to keep playing and playing over and over again, right?Well, it would be if it actually had something to offer than lessons in food and ammo conversation as well as doing a better job telling me what stats do. And lowering the amount of junk items that aren't actually useful. Or giving more hints as to what to do with the five sets of monster teeth and the thirty loaves of moldy bread that accumulate in my inventory rather than just starving me of ammo, filling the level with monsters five levels higher than I am, and calling that a difficulty tweak.It's not me, The Pit.

												A roguelike game. Decent graphics and wonderfull ideas, ruined at practice by the unbalances and illogical limitations topicals of this so-hyped genre. The issues of tactics, survival or crafting do not matter, because beyond from middle levels, odds will turn against the player by many ways, for the uncertainly of logistic items and absence of a stealth system, that pushing him to fight against all foes at sight, while everyone in the sorroundings tries to attack him: the advance turns in a mere question of luck. Even with a low price does not worth.			"

												This game is amazing...my only complaint when it first came out was that it sucked when you died and had to restart everything all over...but with the expansions you can now bank some xp and items...so you can give yourself a better chance on your next playthrough (helps with the difficulty) but definitely doesn't make it too easy. Add to the fact they keep releasing DLC for the game for a buck or 2 a pop (new characters, levels, weapons etc) and this game keeps on getting even bigger. I have yet to beat this game despite playing it off and on for quite awhile lol..but i keep coming back for more. Balancing your food requirements/weapons, what skills to develop and when to use what is a constant balancing act throughout the game. Basically, this game is really fun, there is lots to explore, so much content and characters and each plays differently..when coupled with the fact levels are randomly generated, every time i play this game it feels like new! Plus now you can save and quit (since not everybody has hours and hours to play a game in one sitting) so you can come back from where you saved when you boot up the game again.if you like rpg/rogue like games at all...buy...this...game. You will not be dissapointed! I hope they keep making dlc for this game..bc i have bought it all..its all good! "

												A game made to punish completionists and waste your time. You will spend roughly 6-10 hours on a single playthrough, and have nothing to show for it but a sour taste in your mouth. Especially if you do manage to make it to stage 30, which is a gauntlet of 100 or so of the hardest enemies in the game... each taking a clip of ammo to down.Take my advice and avoid this title. It is made to punish you, to the point of being rage inducing.it only takes 1 terror mine to send you into a room full of mechs who will steal your armor and vaporize HOURS of effort.			"

												Sword of the Stars: The Pit is a challenging, and fun to play roguelike that will keep you busy for hours.Pros:+ 12 Classes (technically 13), Many ways to build them+ Psionic Powers replace the traditional magic spells and they're easy to use+ Many Weapons to find and choose from  + Many different kinds of weapons( Melee like blades and Fists and Guns like Assault Rifles and quite a few grenades )  + Weapons may even be crafted+ 40 brutal levels to travel down+ Tons of monsters to fight+ Characters all have their own story and reason for descending the pit+ High risk, high rewardCons:- Incredibly luck based  - I personally have had times where I find Food and no Ammo or Ammo and no Food. Hell, I've found both but my armor breaks and literally the next two armor lockers were An. Things happen in the Pit.- Class ARE races (Psion Human, Warrior Hiver, Lich Zuul etc.)- Some weapon don't mix with certain classes and racial de-buffed weapon are found often  - This is bad for the Liir (Seeker), Morrrigi (Striker), and especially the Warrior (Hiver) who heavily relies on weapons and not psionics for damage- Psionics are needed for all classes. Well, if you don't want to tear your hair out.  - This does get in the way for some classes don't gain as many skill points as others. For example the Scout gets 8 skill points and the Striker gets 3 skill points. Now, the striker does have higher bases but they're all JUST out of auto-leveling range. Meaning the lower down in floor you go, the striker will struggle if unprepared. All your skill will be lower except the 3 you chose to level. The Scout, however, can auto-level her skills until 45, then start leveling 8 skills. This is also the Scout is recommended to newer players.So why do I recommend this game? Well, truly I recommend this game to people who want a challenge. Who want to take risks and seek rewards.The game is well-priced, finished, and high in content. If you're interested, go for it.Final rating: 8.5/10			"

												Its a rogue-like settled in a scifi-environment. Choose a class and fight your way through 30 random-generated levels. On your way, you will grow stronger, specialize after your will and use your skills to collect new information, equipment and loot, which partially can be used to craft new items as well, which i found a very welcome addition.On the negative side, you will permanently need to still your hunger (which you wont be able without knowing cooking recipies, which you simply dont know at the beginning, and have to learn over several walkthrough. And even if you know recipies, you will always lack ingredients or the proper skill level), suffer from poison and deseases (which will kill you at some point, if you dont have the proper cure at hand), while your armor and weapon loses durability over time and will break, if you dont find machines or equipment to repair them, which resulted in unnecessary stress for me, to a degree, where i lost interest in playing any further.I like hard games that require lots of thinking, but i dislike unnecessary stress and unfair game mechanics.In the case of SOTS, random generation can lead to bad situations, where you dont get the things you will always need, as well as stuff you need situationaly.

			http://cramgaming.com - A review for the expansion for Sword of the Stars The Pit in the Mind Games which offers two new classes t mess around and die with.		

Depending on what sort of gamer you are, you'll either love or hate the hair pulling offering here, but the reality is, the game requires some respect as it truly makes a welcome change from easy street. If you're starting out new, then having two new classes to choose from is great - although the Psion is perhaps reserved for more advanced players.  Anyone else will no doubt already be playing this, and if not, then you should be as the Mind Games offers an excellent set of new skills to mess around with making the game feel fresh.Sword of the Stars The Pit: Mind Games is addicting punishing gaming that's not for everyone but well pleasing for those who ""get it"".

												A roguelike should be difficult, IMHO, but not impossible. You can do great and conserve ammo and health and fail because the game decides you're never going to get more ammo, health or to destroy all the machines you try to repair/use.The game looked great at first glance, but after hours of playing it never felt I was rewarded for being good or punished for doing bad decisions,	 it just felt random. And the thing is, because of this imbalance, you won't know that the game has decided to starve you (leading to your inevitable demise) until it simply does which can be in many levels and there will be nothing you can do about it.To clarify I'm not saying the game's impossible. What I'm saying is that it can be, from the very start, and you can't do anything about it and it might take an hour or two of playing before you realize this. A game whose best outcome is pre-decided entirely by chance, and can possibly be ""failure regardless of the skill and experience of the player"", is not a game. At least not by any modern standards. It's flipping a coin and ""winning"" on heads. Saying that the road up to the inevitable defeat is ""the game"" is like saying lifting weights is ""the game part"" of flipping a coin.So you got skills in that particular weapon and you've actually had the luck of finding that sort of weapon? Sucks to be you then, because you're not getting any ammo for it. Trying to make due with that melee weapon of yours? Well, it'll break soon and we will never give you any replacement because random. Out of weapons? Look, a repair machine. It blew up because random. Having fun yet?No. Stay away.This review was originally written for GOG. Removing comments referring to my Steam playtime and other ad hominem fallacies since it's irrelevant and misleading. Same goes for direct impoliteness, of course. Also, I'm reviewing this from the perspective of determining if it's an enjoyable game or not (...or a game at all). "

												Swords of the Stars: The Pit is a bad game. Don't buy it. If you're a roguelike veteran, you're going to be bored out of your skull, and if you're a newbie, there's a cheaper, deeper, and more flavorful option in Dungeons of Dredmor. Here are more reasons not to buy this bad game:1. It's slow.--This is the number-one killer for me. Each turn, each attack, each use of an item, takes between one and four seconds, depending on how many animations have to play (for attacking, getting attacked) and how many things are moving (you and all monsters). For those of you who aren't familiar with classic-style roguelikes like Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup, this might not sound like a big deal, but trust me, when you have to spend 3 minutes walking across a level you've already cleared, or a minute on a fight against a horde of small, easy to kill monsters, you will begin to get bored very quickly.2. It has bad mechanics that aren't properly balanced.-- Your weapons disintegrate over time and with use, which in theory could be an okay mechanic, assuming this is balanced with reliable ways to repair your weapons or a steady influx of new weapons to replace your broken ones. Failing that, your base attack with no weapon should be a viable last-resort option that gives you some hope of staying alive until you find a new weapon. SotS:TP takes none of these options. Weapons are very rare to find, as are repair stations, and your base attack does almost no damage (and does not scale with level, melee weapon skill, OR strength!). Around level 15-25 you will find that you are entirely out of weapons, and that you have just wasted the past 4 hours of your life, and that you want to kill yourself for having bought this bad, bad, game.3. The crafting/item system is horribly flawed.This game has the ability to craft about 60 different items. Discovering these crafting recipes organically is right out, because the game destroys your items on a failed attempt, some of the ingredients are very rare, and you have to combine between 1 and 5 of these 30 different items to make a new item. There's absolutely no indication of what will work, and what won't. Do the math and you'll find there are literally tens of thousands of ways to combine these items. There is a way to slowly uncover a few recipes in-game, which is a nice touch, but personally I went to the wiki after 5 hours of play netted me about half of one recipe.That's only part of the problem with the crafting. A much bigger issue is that there are only one to two uses for each craftable item. Your inventory is going to start filling up with dozens of useless items very quickly, and if you don't go to the wiki and spoil everything, you won't know what to keep and what not to. It's really shoddy design.4. It is Dungeons of Dredmor, but worse in every way.--Don't get me wrong, I don't like DoD either (many of the complaints I've levied here could easily be applied to it as well). But The Pit feels like a giant step backwards in every way. No spells or activate-able skills, all passives. Only three classes (five if you get the DLC). Way fewer monsters, rooms, traps, weapons, and everything else that makes roguelikes so fun and replayable. The writing is worse, too. The Pit brings literally nothing to the table.5. Combat is boring and choices are non-existent.This is inexcusable in a roguelike, because combat and choices are pretty much all the genre has going for it. In The Pit, all of your skills are passives, all of your combat is melee and ranged attacks. There is nothing to this game except for moving towards/away from enemies and attacking them. It is unbelievably boring.In conclusion, I would not play this game again if I were paid to do so. I hope the developers read this and put some serious thought into their next game. I would say that there's potential here, but the best The Pit could hope for is to be as good as a game that's already out there and already has a decent following, as well as several expansions and a modding community.

												I believe everyone know that this is a roguelike. Roguelikes have a big emphasis on being random (floors, enemies, loot e.t.c.), being hard and having permadeath (can't load once you die). You shouldn't be discouraged from playing a roguelike because you die a lot and have to start over. It is part of the fun experience since every run is unique. Thus this game has something to live up to since it is a roguelike. So here's what I don't like about this game:1. Gameplay. Since it is expected to die over and over it is important that every run feels unique and fun. While the game has random floors and loot you only have 3 different classes and all of them are humans. In the expansion 2 more are added and one of them is an alien, the tarka ranger. But the game doesn't differentiate between races and classes so you can't be a human ranger or a tarka engineer. Race and class is all in one package. Now compare these 5 different ""starting kits"" with what other roguelikes offer. DCSS (Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup) has for example 24 races and 27 classes. That means there are 648 different ""starting kits"". So unless you have played that game for very long you can always try something new when you die. And it's not just starting skills and equipment that are different, most races in DCSS have something unique to add. Such as if you are playing as a Mummy you don't need to eat food, if you are a djinni you don't have health and mana, you have essence which is both your health and your mana. If you're a Troll you can't wear most armor since it's too small for you but your health regenerate very fast. This game doesn't have that.And it's not something unique to DCSS either, most roguelikes has several races and classes. ADOM (Ancient domains of mystery) has 12 races and 22 classes. Dungeons of Dredmor doesn't have races or classes but instead something they call ""skills"". There are 53 of them and you pick 7 of them for a character. So you could take for example Swords, Blood Magic, Vampirism, Assassination e.t.c.Something else I find lacking in this game is the loot. The game uses a crafting mechanic which means you find ingredients and you craft something with it. The problem is that unless you play the game for a long time and find the recipes you can't use the ingredients. You could check the wiki but that will ruin the whole ""find recipes as you play"" experience and will make classes such as the engineer less useful since he's good at finding recipes. So since most of the loot you will find are ingredients and you don't know the recipes it means that the majority of the loot you find will be useless. Items such as armor and weapons are very rare, for instance in 6 hours I have found 1 armor. The game doesn't have the typical unidentified scrolls, potions and wands you can find either. Now I'm not saying that a sci-fi game should have magical potions, it could be for instance nanomachines (Hideo Kojima forced me) instead of a magical potion.So I would say that the loot is very unsatisfying. The next point I would like to make is that the gameplay is slow. Specifically because you always have to do some check and wait whenever you manipulate something. The classic example is a locked door, and there's a lot of them. You lockpick it, but you have to wait about 2 seconds. This is because it takes a few turns to open it so enemies could come and attack you. The general idea is good, that enemies could come but since you have to wait in real life for every single thing you manipulate (opening fridges, lockers, doors, repairing stuff, hacking computers, reloading e.t.c.) it slows the game down quite a bit. And all the loot you find will be in something you have to manipulate. Except enemy drops. Even resting takes a long time to do. You are already paying for it with food, why do you, the player, have to wait a minute or 2?2. HUD/Graphics. First of all, I very much enjoy the graphics. Most roguelikes don't have graphics and those who do have sub-par graphics. So it's not that which is the problem. One thing I don't like is that you cannot see your health, mana and food in numbers. You have to hold your mouse over the bar and wait for a tooltip to show you exactly how much health you have. You could also open the character screen. Either way it is annoying. The info on food for instance tells you how much food it will give in numbers. To make that information useful you have to know your characters food value in numbers. A lack of mini-map is also something I don't like. There is a map that is called a mini-map in-game but there is nothing mini about it since it covers the whole screen. This leads me to my next point which is the zoom system. The game has 3 different zooms, the problem with using any zoom other than the largest is that the graphics will suffer. Things such as door icons will look blurry and you will lose the sharp graphics which the largest zoom has. So naturally you want to play with the largest zoom, obviously this is a problem since now you cannot see all the enemies, for example they can shoot you off-screen. Navigating will also be a problem since you can only see a small portion of the floor you're on and the game doesn't have a mini-map. So you have to constantly zoom in and out and check your map. Which just adds to the already slow gameplay.3. The locker. The locker was added in the expansion pack and it is a locker which you find every 5 floors. You can dump items in the locker but you cannot remove them. There is also a ""xp locker"" where you can dump xp instead of items. The only way to access these are to start a new game and select whatever floor you dumped the xp/items at. Then you will begin at that floor and you have access to the items and the xp with your new character.This is very much against the spirit of roguelikes. Not only can you skip part of the game but it removes the whole ""make due with what you find"" experience which roguelikes are known for. It also promotes grinding since the best way to tackle the game would be to make several characters, dump their xp and items in the locker and then make the real run with all the xp and items. What happened to every run is a unique and fun experience? How many runs do you have to intentionally ruin to make your real run? And your real run is a joke since you don't start at the beginning and you have all these items to start with. If you die on that run you have to start your grind all over again. I asked the devs why they implemented this in the first place and their reply was:""They were implemented to innovate and give people options. SF is about evolution of the form ;)And I am sorry about your likes or dislikes but a rogue that introduces valid meta gameplay elements is, in my opinion, worth a dozen rogues with minor gimmicks. It's kinda what we do around here citron...we take chances and we innovate. Hopefully that will grow n you over time ;)""I'm all for innovating and especially devs that talk to their community but I don't see how a feature that promotes grinding and removes a aspect of the genre is something good or fun. Surely there were some thought behind this feature? If I were to implement a thing I would first think why I do it and then if it would make the game or whatever I'm working on better. Not ""It's innovative"". It's not just a optional thing either, you are artificially raising the difficulty of a already hard game if you're not using it. Saying it's optional is just a cop out. You could say that anything with a problem is a optional feature. If psionics could kill all the enemies in the game just like that I could say it's not a problem since it's optional to use it.To sum it all up: I find the game has slow gameplay, unsatisfying loot, lack of unique starting choices, questionable hud design and it promotes grinding. That's why I won't recommend this game.			"

												Bored bored bored BOOOORED.Everything is slow as poop. The joke enemy ""easter bunny"" attacks eight(8!) times every turn, but barely damages. The devs know you're just wasting time.The combat is simply you and the enemy alternating fire until the other dies. You can't ever flee, everything wants to kill you, and everything is able to find you. There are no choices to be made in combat.EVERYTHING is random, from the map generation and enemies to every container you open to the amount of times you can use a stove before it explodes.Healing is instant even during combat but mines take five turns to arm. Mines already set when entering the level don't explode on enemies, so you're not even safe walking a path an enemy just did.Crafting destroys items used, even when experimenting for a recipe. Garbled messages of which every word has a percentage chance to be decoded can hold recipes, but 80% is ""lore"". All this does is make you feel shame if you go to the wiki because there's a legitimate way to get the info.And an ending consisting of two sprites talking four lines of text. Commodore 64 games had bigger endings.Yet only one negative review in the first ten pages of reviews. I bet there was some policing done.			"

												For such a simple-looking game, The Pit has depth to spare (literally and figuratively!) A fun, turn-based rogue-like that can actually be played in ""pseudo-realtime"" just by continuting to move and act. Hard, merciless, and yet a lot of fun. Don't grow attached to your characters - it helps if you imagine you're the commander sending these poor explorers to their grisly deaths. Over, and over, and over.			"

												What I like: -The UI is very clean, though it lacks some key features, like recording discovered recipes.What I dislike:-The first 8 floors (I stopped playing 8 floors in) involved no tactics whatsoever. I had to keep a mental list of ""this monster is scary enough to donate some bullets to it's face"" and that was it. No positioning, no abilities, few combat consumables.-The game felt like a total grind. Every door can be picked for exp, every crate jimmied open, every station hacked. There are a large number of such objects. -Character customization felt... lacking. You can put points into various skills on level up, but I did not notice a significant impact, particularly for combat skills. It seems equipment is far more important for what form your character takes, and as that is pretty much totally random, it can hardly be called customization.-The crafting is awful. Even Morrowind stored past recipes for you. SotS? Better keep a notebook of what strange combinations of bindings, cloth, and animal detritus obtain you useful equipment.  Sure, you can find hints to recipes in-game, but cross-referencing the ingredients listed in hints. (Note that crafting or absurd luck seems to be necessary to get decent equipment)-Hoarding ingredients for crafting is awful. You can't craft just anywhere, you need to find a specific bench to craft each variety of item. You can either horde every ingredient (bad idea, inventory space is valuable) or track what ingredients are needed to make the thing you want. I'm sure it's possible to derive enjoyment from this game, but to me it felt like a slog.			"

												Firstly, the title is a rogue-like, turn-based survival game with a medium-small sized lore where you must advance through floors, levelling and collecting equipment as you do so, to survive and win. The main problem comes with the limited variety of gameplay, and the methods to attempt to make the game more fun and unpredictable. This review is of the base game, without the use of any downloadable content or otherwise.The game is always biased, giving a painful experience almost every playthrough due to such luck-based gameplay. Skill of the player is judged simply by how much one can utilise poorly thought out and tedious mechanics. The game seems to try to portray an extremely hostile environment with just enough for a competent player to survive but in reality the gameplay is almost completely based on finding overpowered items.   The textures and animations in the game are mediocre at best, usually including painful delays on attack animations and slowing the game down unnecessarily and forcefully without option to remove the feature.   When one modifies their computer, the save data including logs and recipes is completely wiped from the game due to lack of utilising of the steam cloud and inability to find save data on the computer's memory, despite such data being automatically recognised on most other games, wasting countless hours of gameplay.To conclude, the game is unique in it's role as a turn-based rogue-like, but lacks any decent amount of strategy for serious gaming, and since most fun is taken from collecting new logs and equipment, it is hopeless to think many who would enjoy the casual uncontrollability would enjoy the slow-paced, turn-based gameplay for a prolonged time unless they enjoyed obtaining collectables.

The game is similar to a lot of other dungeon crawlers, with a sci-fi setting.The only thing that bothers me is, having bought the game before the gold version was available, according to the DLC descriptions I have to buy both the ""Mind Games"" and the ""Gold Edition DLC"" in order to have the ""Gold Edition"". When you consider that the cost of those two DLC is $8 and buying the gold edition itself is only $13 it seems strange to me that I end up paying $2 more than someone who just bought the gold edition in the first place.It's only two dollars, but it's still weird to me that I would end up paying more to have all the DLC than if I had just not bought the game at all and instead bought the gold edition now.

												Sword of the Stars: The Pit does very little to advance the rogue like genre forward. While in no way innovative, the game succeeds at being an incredibly fun and addicting game that will keep you coming back again and again, trying to clear all 30 floors of the pit, which is no easy task. You can chose one of 3 different characters that all play very differently, allowing you to play the game anyway you want. The game can be frustrating at times, with enemies that can look like objects in the environment in the later levels that spring out and reduce your health in a heartbeat, and weapons and armor being incredibly scarce, meaning at times you have to pick and choose your battles if your weapons or armors durability is running low. Nothings more frustrating than playing a two hour run, just to have it thwarted by a camouflaged enemy destroying your body armor. For those looking for a good challenge and a solid rogue-like, I can't recommend this one enough.			"

												I'm a huge fan of rogue-like games such as FTL, Dungeons of Dredmore, and Binding of Isaac, etc, and I've played these games as far back as Temple of Apshai on C-64, so I'm no stranger to the genre.I really like some of the ideas introduced in the Pit (I especially like the sci-fi setting), but the game just feels too long for the type of ""throwaway"" deaths it inevitably throws at you. FTL and Binding of Isaac have great short game times (about an hour or so on average full game), while Dungeons of Dredmore did tend to drag on too long imo. But while Dungeons of Dredmore had some long playing times, you would never (to my memory) run into an instant ""you die""! scenario that you find in The Pit. And by instant ""you die!"", I mean situations that don't have a defense and result in immediate or eventual loss of the game when they occur. I.e. use the human mod station and become ""ravenous"" for food, trapped doors that you are forced to pass through that destroy your food/weapons/armor/etc,  disintegrate yourself when trapping a machine, or get knocked unconscious in a single shot and then be subject to whatever grab/acid/radiation weapon types that will ultimately kill you, even if you don't die in that encounter (missing your weapons, or radiation which doesn't have enough ""cure"" items). I also hear you can be vaporized by a single enemy shot, regardless of health, but I haven't encountered that yet.My own opinion (and everyone is enttiled to their own) is that the game is not bad, but might have been better off with shorter playtimes to keep me compelled to keep trying, instead of spending hours to die to something unavoidable. And even if the death is avoidable (such as not using human programming machines EVER), the rate at which you learn about the death traps is a little too slow for my tastes.Bottom line for me: too much time investment for what little knowledge (if any) you gain with each death (most of them unavoidable with no defense possible)The Pit has potential if the devs shorten the game time and remove some of the instant deaths.

												Does a great job of capturing the essence of 'rogue' with a scifi theme and ""8 bit"" type graphics, plus adds some crafting aspects. This is a true roguelike game and you can and will get unlucky with the procedural generation randomness. As usual, expect to die all the time. Conserve ammo like crazy. Loot everything you can. Watch out for those unidentified ??? items which can and will screw you over. All the usual great stuff you've come to expect when playing rogue, hack, nethack, or moria, but with a much nicer more elaborate skill system that makes character progression much more interesting.I personally think the controls in this game are rather well done. I feel the need to point this out because, well, not every game gets this right.			"

												Ah, another roguelike, this time in space! I don’t feel that the production values are quite to the level of Dungeons of Dredmor, but it’s a damn fun game all the same. Like any roguelike, there’s a heavy emphasis on survival and there are a few classes you can choose from the start, though it doesn’t affect the game THAT much in the long run.  What’s really fun about this one is there are several ways to forage equipment including hacking, picking locks, prying back steel, deciphering text, reprogramming equipment, and all kinds of different stuff…and all of this is kept in the form of different stats.There are also many types of weapons, which also have their own individual stats.  There aren’t any “abilities,” per se, so that’s a minus, but it also makes it more straightforward. If you’re looking for something a little different that has a space theme and is fairly priced, this is definitely up your alley. If you don’t already have Dungeons of Dredmor, though, I’d recommend getting that first.			"

												I'm a huge fan of rogue-like games such as FTL, Dungeons of Dredmore, and Binding of Isaac, etc, and I've played these games as far back as Temple of Apshai on C-64, so I'm no stranger to the genre.I really like some of the ideas introduced in the Pit (I especially like the sci-fi setting), but the game just feels too long for the type of ""throwaway"" deaths it inevitably throws at you. FTL and Binding of Isaac have great short game times (about an hour or so on average full game), while Dungeons of Dredmore did tend to drag on too long imo. But while Dungeons of Dredmore had some long playing times, you would never (to my memory) run into an instant ""you die""! scenario that you find in The Pit. And by instant ""you die!"", I mean situations that don't have a defense and result in immediate or eventual loss of the game when they occur. I.e. use the human mod station and become ""ravenous"" for food, trapped doors that you are forced to pass through that destroy your food/weapons/armor/etc,  disintegrate yourself when trapping a machine, or get knocked unconscious in a single shot and then be subject to whatever grab/acid/radiation weapon types that will ultimately kill you, even if you don't die in that encounter (missing your weapons, or radiation which doesn't have enough ""cure"" items). I also hear you can be vaporized by a single enemy shot, regardless of health, but I haven't encountered that yet.My own opinion (and everyone is enttiled to their own) is that the game is not bad, but might have been better off with shorter playtimes to keep me compelled to keep trying, instead of spending hours to die to something unavoidable. And even if the death is avoidable (such as not using human programming machines EVER), the rate at which you learn about the death traps is a little too slow for my tastes.Bottom line for me: too much time investment for what little knowledge (if any) you gain with each death (most of them unavoidable with no defense possible)The Pit has potential if the devs shorten the game time and remove some of the instant deaths.

												I love this game so much. The hours I've spent on it should be evidence. A rogue-dungeon game where you can level up your character. If you get the dlcs, they add so much to the gameplay. So many items, armors, weapons, and monsters to fight. I was always surprised! More characters as well. My favorites were always the Scout and Tarka Warrior. You should try it. Definitely worth it if you have several hours to kill. Ending is... meh, but I enjoyed getting past every level. :D			"

												I love this game. It's very fun, yet also challenging. The game is similar to a lot of other dungeon crawlers, with a sci-fi setting.The only thing that bothers me is, having bought the game before the gold version was available, according to the DLC descriptions I have to buy both the ""Mind Games"" and the ""Gold Edition DLC"" in order to have the ""Gold Edition"". When you consider that the cost of those two DLC is $8 and buying the gold edition itself is only $13 it seems strange to me that I end up paying $2 more than someone who just bought the gold edition in the first place.It's only two dollars, but it's still weird to me that I would end up paying more to have all the DLC than if I had just not bought the game at all and instead bought the gold edition now.

												SOTS:TP will always hold a special place in my heart. It was one of the first roguelikes to really suck me in. The music and aesthetics are really nice, and games last a while as you methodically make your way through the levels. While the gameplay can get repetetive at times, as you get better you clear levels quicker and that problem largely disappears.  My only complaints would be that you have to grind out recipes(unless you cheat on the wiki) and that the RNG of drops has a huge influence on your run(mostly because of the vast number of possible drops). Difficulty is definitely up there. DLC is great for added classes.			"

												Well, I finally beat this game after many, many tries and I can definitively say that it's... NOT good.Where do I even start. There are some really major issues with the game that hold it back from being actually worth your time, and I'll try to list a few.HUNGER: Perhaps the biggest problem with this game, that also ties in to many other problems, is the hunger system. It's so poorly balanced. You're either going to be drowning in the over-abundance of food, or you're going to be unlucky and just starve without being able to do anything. The hunger system makes at least 3 classes not viable on anything above easy. To me it seems like it exists solely to pad out the crafting system and to add more difficulty to the inventory management.BULLET SPONGE ENEMIES: No, I'm not talking about dangerous enemies who are hard to bring down. I'm talking about pointless time wasting enemies like Large Protean or the Ape-type enemies: they're awful game design. They deal trivial damage and force you to waste a large amount of turns bringing them down. The before mentioned Large Protean is the guiltiest of all the enemies: it damages your items in your inventory, but you can work around that by just dropping everything and smacking him with melee. Which takes forever. But you have to do it if you want to conserve your ammo/psi, which is essential for victory.NATURAL ABILITY LEVELING: Another time-wasting aspect is the fact that all skills can be leveled to 45 without putting points in. And so you are forced do useless tasks like unlocking doors you don't want to, or missing an enemy 20 times to skill up a particular skill before actually putting points in to it, unless you want to be horribly inefficient. Which you can't be, because this game punishes you HARSHLY for that.THE ENTIRE CRAFTING SYSTEM: It's just bad. Too many components, VERY few useful recipes, and you have to find/unlock new recipes. Have fun browsing the wiki for the list of recipes every time you want to craft something.RNG: Honestly this is about the most random roguelike I've ever played. Even skilling up is random: you get +1-3 points in a skill when you skill it up. There are far too many crafting items that clog the drop tables. There are some very powerful and interesting items in the game, but you will rarely see them thanks to the all the useless junk that will be dropping out of the containers. I swear, there are some items that I've seen ONCE even after playing +200 hours.			"

												I really like rogue-likes. This one is unforgiving, but the causes of failure are extremely annoying. It's a failure, even if you manage to ignore the slow pace of the game (say hello to robots withs animations lasting 15 seconds for EACH turn). After spending hours of meddling through the randomly-generated levels with barely differences in design, you can end up being wrecked by 3 ennmis is one has the ""deadly"" abilities : name it yourself : sleeping darts, poisons & diseases which will eventually make you unconscious. It is very funny to be gangbanged during 2 minutes with a black screen with NO POSSIBLE ACTIONS. Don't buy this game, don't accept it if someone offers it to you, just don't try it.			"

												It could have been a nice Rogue. But it isn't.- Experimenting with crafting is bad, since everytime you use the wrong ingredients you destroy them. - the only way to know recipes is by computer data, but you have to decipher them, and if your stats aren't high enough you'll just read useless gibberish- in this game you ruin your meelee weapon by touching doors and objects. Why should i want to destroy a ""bed"", a ""computer"" or a ""health center"" with my blade? Pointless and frustrating- you will find armors and weapons which can't be used by your character for background reasons. Diablo 3, you again? "

												I really enjoy roguelike games, but I found this game to be fairly unpleasant and underwhelming.  There is a story to the game (which you collect in bits and pieces) and there are several starting characters to choose from.  You can take as long as you like to plan out your moves, because enemies only act when you take action.  For me, the degree of randomness was just too high.  In games like FTL, you at least always have a chance (unless you limp along to the final boss with no real weapons or extra systems).  That doesn't seem to be the case here.  The game is also long enough that doomed runs just seem to carry on and wind down slowly.Get Dungeon of the Endless instead.			"

												Sword of the Stars: The Pit is a harsh roguelike. Is it a good roguelike? Well, that's where opinions differ. It seems to be missing that key roguelike experience that the community values. But what is it? It has hunger, a scarsity based ammo system, spell trees, randomized numbers and chances, and different classes. What's missing?Fun. That's the statement of this review. SotS: The Pit is missing fun. Roguelikes have always been a unique genre in which its fun to win OR lose. And losing in The Pit is not in the least fun. You either have enough ammo, or you don't. You have food to explore, or you don't. That computers skill roll works, or it doesn't.    There's no ""mushroom"" in this game of rock, paper, scissors. No surprise element to keep the early game from feeling like a grind; no hilarity to make bad runs enjoyable or memorable.The Pit ends up being too binary. New roguelike players might not understand this, but The Pit definitely suffers from the poor design choice of bad or good. No middle. There's no crazy builds, no adaptation. You place your stats in nearly the same things, find your first weapon, and go from there. Experimentation is reserved for easy mode or not at all.If you enjoy challenges, you'll enjoy this game. If you enjoy games, you won't enjoy SotS: The Pit. Even if you are the first of the two, you may find your frustration venting out at the developers for clearly not knowing how to balance roguelikes.			"

												Very neat game, which works very well with the rogue like approach. Like a lot of rogue likes, you are very unlikely to beat it your first time, due to learning the mechanics, and unlocking recipies, but once you get your feet wet a bit, its amazing to go deeper and deeper.  You can choose to go balls out in combat, sneak around enemies, open up stashes, research archives for info to help you survive, and craft tools to help, ranging from improved weapons, food to keep you going, healing items, and all sorts of stuff in between.Feels somewhat like fallout 2, but with a much more user friendly UI. Definately give it a try, even if you aren't a fan of such gameplay, it certainly has a good amount of replay value behind it. Plus slowly discovering the mysteries of the pit, as well as expanding your knowlege to better survive is quite addicting.			"

												This must be the best rogue like game I have played thus far, it lets you dwell into the futuristic theme without being too punishing early on, but it soon catches up. There are plenty of ways to tackle this game and each character available has different options available for you depending on their stats, there are a lot of numbers to choose from when you level up.You start as a footsoldier equipped with the essentials for your chosen character, a few weapons, food and and medikits to help you started. You can choose to melee, shoot, run or a bit of everything in order to stay alife and keep your equipement in decent shape.As you progress you will learn to craft from recipes found in the game which will help your endevour a great deal, you will learn to adapt to new challenging foes and find new strategies. This is also a game which easily fits into a 10 minute break of your busy schedule, save and quit at any time and return when you wish for more monster slaying.The graphics are perfectly suitable for this sort of title and everything looks and feels polished. Nothing is perfect however, there is room for improvement.I can warmly recommend this game to any adventurer outthere looking for a rogue like game and remember ... KILL THE RABBITS ... they may be furry and cute .... BUT KILL THEM.			"

												I spotted Sword of the Stars: The Pit listed as a flash sale on Steam for 75% off of the normal price of $9.99 for a low down price of $2.49. Curse you Valve and your ridiculous summer sales! You managed to suck quite a few bucks out of my debit card on games I may or may not ever get around to and Sword of the Stars seemed to be one of them. Intrigued on trying a top down turn based RPG rogue game this time I decided to try out The Pit and see what is up.The plot of The Pit, as simple as it is, is pretty straightforward. The Zombie Apocalypse or something close to it is occurring on some remote planet and some magical mcguffin that could end it all might be in some place referred to as unoriginality as… The Pit. So you start up a game as a Marine, Engineer, or Scout (actually a pilot, but we called her the scout class anyway!). Ready. Set. Procedurally generated dungeon crawl!And off I went with a Marine, hacking and shooting my way through a seemingly unending supply of rodents and bats. Then a few robots, a couple aliens, all the while watching my health and food bars slowly drain away. And then refill them up with heal kits or rations I brought along then watch them drain away again. Then fill up health from leveling up then watch it drain away again. And then finally, I died. It wasn’t some great last stand or some frightful fleeing for my life, just eventually ran out of health and died. Ho Hum.And then I went again with an engineer. There’s lots of… things scattered randomly around in the rooms and they can be opened with different skills. The engineer is the best at this but he is horribly outgunned and unless you get lucky with one of these loot drops eventually he’s going to die soon to. And then I tried the scout expecting a more sneaky fast person who can run past everything. Nope. The scout is just like the Marine except she’s better at using crappier weapons. *sigh* Speaking of weapons the promo page on Steam boats of “Over 50 weapons and armors with a variety of special effects including flamethrowers, rocket launchers, plasma cannons and powered Brawler armor!” but all I found in my play-throughs were a dinky sword, a piece of ‘stealth’ armor, and a rifle. Meh. I’m sure there’s better stuff way deep down but I never made it and started getting bored quickly.And I started to try to figure exactly why this game is so hum drum boring. At first glance there appears to be some very some good ideas. A complex and important skill system. Lots of loot, a variety of different looking enemies, a randomly generated experience each time you go. But each level looks depressingly bland, the enemies all act boringly stupid, and I was yet to find any awesome loot to scratch at that progressing itch. Outside of having slightly higher chance of succeeding at unlocking things and getting a free heal, leveling up feels downright pointless. I didn’t feel exceptionally stronger at level 5 as I did at level 1. Worse is I felt an incessant need to scour each level and attempt to open every box, fix every console, and unlock every door in hopes of collecting every precious drop of exp I could get my hands on. All in a false hope it would make me strong enough to press on but instead it just wasted my time. There even appears to be a complicated intricate crafting system but I could only scratch the surface of it while trying in vain to get deeper into THE PIT.After seeing a rogue-like game done so well, The Pit feels uninspired. Each time you go into a level you pretty much stand in one spot fighting enemies, waiting for them all to rush at you one at a time. Walk around the level clearing up what’s left and then go deeper. If you are unlucky you’ll run into a high level mob earlier than you should and get crippled. Or worse, you’ll run into a trap and want to rage quit. I wouldn’t exactly call the game unforgivingly difficult, more of just cheaply difficult. Open up a door and stand face to face with a giant machine gun toting mech that fills you with bullets, or worse, the only way to progress is to pass through a door trap. Unlike floor traps which you have a chance of detecting and deactivating, I found no way to deactivate door traps. The most sadistic of all destroys a random item from your inventory. And if it decides to destroy one of your weapons or your ammo, well you might as well just quit now and start anew.In stills the graphics look decent for the sprite style often common of indie games but in action it feels incredibly blocky. It feels exactly like what it is, token pieces moving around a large square grid system. And for turn based combat it is an incredibly uninspired repetition of: point, click, kill. Target an enemy, shoot ‘em with a gun or hack at them with a melee weapon. Or after you’ve gotten really deep and your melee weapon was destroyed and you’re out of ammo, hit them with your fists until they kill you. I especially hate the limitations placed on combat with only 2 moves and performing a combat action ends your turn. The game could have really taken a page from other turn based RPGs with a more intricate action point system that actually felt like I was doing more than just standing in one place and clicking. There also are no stances, cover to hide behind, you cannot move after attacking, jump, sprint, anything. The light scout has no real speed bonus nor does the heavy marine have any speed penalty. Its just simple and dull and really needs a lot of work.In the end, even though the game cost me less than what I’d spend for lunch, I wouldn’t recommend it. There is a lot of potential here for a nice intricate game but the combat system is just so bloody boring and uninspired.Final Score:Graphics: 4/10Game Play: 2/10Music / Ambiance: 3/10Story: 4/10Value: 8/10Overall: 4.2/10Read more indy game reviews on my blog!http://markofithian.com "

												I love rogue likes. But honestly this one had me really frustrated. Dying and losing all your progress is not the thing that upsets me, the thing that makes me frustrated is the absence of balance in item spawns. You could be carrying 5/6 pieces of a recipe for 15 floors and still not get what you're looking for. You could be stuck with the same weapon for the whole run and then just end up dying because you could deal enough damage. I had a few runs where I found shotgun ammo everywhere and not a shotgun in sight. So basically a completely unbalanced system of drops and crafting. So unless you like spending hours of your life on a game that basically goes nowhere then go ahead and buy this.Otherwise steer clear of this pointless game.			"

												It's difficult to recommand this game...Facts are:+ The graphics are totally retro nice! --> like 8-bit RPG's+ The gameplay is easy to understand and ok for both (keyboard&mouse/gamecontroller)+ The Scifi elements get to the heart --> kinda Metroid+ Baseground System (you are going down every Stage, every time more difficult) --> excactly Isaac ;-)But... and this ""butt"" is big...- The difficulty is hard... in my opinion to hard.- It's a bit to slow... I like roundbased games but thats kinda waiting for death...- Crafting is nice! But come on... starting at zero it's not takeable to ""guess"" what works (and much to expencive to experience...)- Story is the Intro...and after that your imagination, until you are I guess a pro who can decipher the computers... (not a contra point, but with this intro...it kinda sucks ^^')- You have to look at a walkthrough and that is an element i don't like about this game...I think for some people it is a good game!But to be a recommendable game it could be made much better!If you like a round based fighting system, can work with trial and error crafting, need not much storytelling and have a lot of time to walkthrough the game over and over again... you can take a look at it!But if I look at the details... the game will get lost for me... fast :-( "

												If the RNG wasn't complete ******** this would be a great roguelike. The problem is if you sit down and actually track the number of times you fail 80%+ skill rolls on normal even, you can prove mathematically the the numbers listed are in fact complete ******** and that there is something behind the screen just saying ""Nope you fail 95% once again, your luck is awful."" I get that the game is designed to be abusive, but this level of abusive is bad gameplay overall. Playing thousands of rounds just for one good one is rough, if not the defination of insane. If you like the possabley of never winning this game even on easy or watching 10 95% chances to open something fail in a row often then this game might be for you. I could list many good and bad things about this game but if it can't even give you the proper numberd % chance of you not ****i*** something up, why ******* bother? For extreme masochists only.

												I didn't have a good time with Sword of the Stars: The Pit due to its slow paced combat and its often confusing set of controlls. To be honest I gave the game a chance trying to look past the bland environments to see if the core mechanics of the game could please me enough to continue the quest, sadly I barely could finish the tutorial before wanting to exit. The gameplay experience is bogged down by simple turn to turn game-play that should be (in my own opinion) part of a board game not because of the dynamic but because of the mediocre control. With that said one thing that really bothered me in the tutorial was the way they implement other friendly units making you stop every couple of squares for them to catch up to you makes me feel like im playing an Atari. With hopes high I came into this title hoping for the best and leaving with dissapointment, save yourself the trouble and play/buy another game.			"

												While the game has a lot of potential as a simple Diablo style dungeon crawler I found the random nature of the game just too frustrating.  Slowly starving to death because not enough food was generated, running out of ammo for every weapon you have because not enough was generated at later levels, dying simply because there were no disease or poison cures given.  These annoying and frustrating aspects detract from what could be a very fun little game.In the end it was just too annoying to keep on the computer.			"

												Do you like the rogue-like genre and want to have the best options of all other games combined in one game?Then in my opinion this game is a good choice!Without all the DLC installed (I have them all because the devs earn the <2 dollar they asked for the DLC) you already have tons of skills, items and crafting options in the main game.The gameplay is smooth and the graphics simple but clean. Combat is turn-based, but the gameplay is fast. And every monster have is own stats so you can really make your own strategy and use your book often to read about items and monsters you already discovered.A lot of games promise you that no two games are the same, but only a few keep their word about that.Everytime I play this game I discover new items and monsters even in the first three floors.I didn't even change my main character yet and already have so much fun with the standard marine with his comprehensive skill tree. The balance of the placement of items, objects, monsters, rooms, secrets and traps is fair but every time very different.Off course you need some luck, but it really mind if you try different tactics. The tactics are in the details of this game. For example with Ctrl pressed while you move you just change your field of view without moving so you can not be surprised at your back. If you use all your bullets at low lvl monsters at the beginning you possible ends up with your inventory full of useless guns.There is so much more positive to tell about this game, but my advice is to really try it yourself.It's more than Dungeons of Dredmor in space. It have a lot of detail, it's more random and in my opinion the graphics are more fresh. And I like Dod!It's a lot of gaming for <10 bucks. "

												I played for 3 hours and did not get any enjoyment out of the game.  Unlike similar games like FTL and Binding of Isaac, I found no exciting loot or choices whatsoever. For instance, I found these mutation bottles on several runs. How exciting I thought. It turns out that they give like +-3 to some random stat and has an extremely minor affect on game play. BORING!The game's combat played out much like cookie clicker for the first few levels. (The combat mechanics are not very exciting.)The crafting in this game is no fun whatsoever. You start out with no recipes. If you want to craft anything you have to resort to trail and error.  And you don't want to make an error while crafting in this game. Trust me.Seems like too much of a gamble to continue playing the game in the hopes that I might start enjoying it.Play the demo. I did not. "

												Wasn't very fond of it.Just lacks a lot of polish, the systems in the game feel uninituitive. I recommend Dungeons of Dredmor far over this game. Both are kind of cartoony, but Dredmor has a far better sense of humor and is a far deeper and more robust roguelike.The Pit is an interesting experiment, but it just didn't come together for me.

												I love it, a perfect mix between survival and fighting. Not only do you have to fight your way down through 30 floors/lvls, scavenge for food, weapons and ammo, you can also level up your skills to unlock doors and repair crafting benches.  Yes, there is also crafting and upgrading. Even on ""normal"" it is really challenging but never unfair, (didn't make it past lvl10 yet after 6 hours of playing and dying.)			"

												Horrible game. The guy telling you what to do never shuts up. The game doesn't tell you which key to press, it tells you what button on a 360 controller to press. You can't look at the key bindings unless you're at main menu. Why can't ""interact"" and ""pick up item"" be the same key? If this game is good, then I'll never know because the effort of trying to get into within the first 5 minutes is too much. Maybe I'll give it another chance one day but for now, just save your £0.99.			"

But this game (On normal, not the harder settings) has weapons wear out before you ever get a chance to craft new weapons.And if you try to combine two items, and they aren't a recipe - those items dissapear. Seriously, bread and bacon doesn't become a sandwhich - in this game it gets destroyed because there is no bread and bacon recipe.			"

												Shallow, repetitive, rogue-like in space with hideous art style and overly strong randomization. There's too many enemies and not enough armor, weapons, or ammo to deal with them all. If you somehow manage to get to lower floors, there's also the problem of disease (snowballing DoT and stat debuff that is extremely hard to remove), starvation, and enemies that level up faster than your weapons. It is not uncommon to reach floor 10 and find no new weapons, or even worse, find weapons but no ammo for them (or visa versa).All of the randomization is too strong, stat and skill systems are shallow, combat is tedious and repetitive, and the overall difficulty is unrealistic. Be prepared to die to lockers setting off alarms, ammo boxes exploding, and randomized traps randomly disintegrating your main weapon. There are better rogue-likes available (most of them free), better sci-fi games, and better $10 games on Steam.			"

												The Pit, like most rogue-likes, is all about navigating a vast, deep dungeon while gathering equipment, learning skills and killing monsters. As you progress through The Pit, you will increase your skills such as lock-picking, computers, mechanical, and more. You can use these skills to open doors, hack computers, and repair broken machines, and each successful attempt to do so will increase your associated skill. If you can imagine fallout, remade as a rouge-like, it would be similar to what The Pit offers.A great feature of The Pit is the vast number of items and weapons included within the game. The Pit's weapon selection spans across a number of class types such as melee weapons, pistols, rifles, assault weapons, grenades, and more. Ammo is actually quite limited, this really makes you think about weapon selection as you battle your way though the game. Weapons will also break after continued usage, but items can be found to repair your damaged weapons. Besides its arsenal, The Pit includes items to help increase your abilities, and armour to equip to protect yourself.I found the games controls to be a bit more hassling then they should be. By no means are they bad, but a better control interface would have been appreciated. For example, it would of been nice to be able to control more actions with the mouse or via on-screen buttons. It gets annoying having to continuously hammer the g key to pick up loot from fallen monsters, instead of having the ability to right click on the ground to simply pick them up.I purchased the game during a steam 50% off sale for five bucks, which is a great price for this game. To justify The Pit's ten dollar regular price, I would have expected better graphics and features out of the game. If you are a real keener, feel free to jump in for full price, otherwise, wait for a sale on this one.For more info check out my full review here: http://hashron.com/display.php?id=16 "

												If you have some money to burn and you want a decent roguelike you can't really go wrong with Sword of the Stars: the Pit. It's got all the traditional roguelike tropes: turn based movement and combat, hunger, and the ability to equip all sorts stuff. Add the great Sword of the Stars Lore, a great art style, hundreds of cratable items and several unique character classes and you have all the makings of great game. As an added bonus, this game has gotten tons of support and added content, if you look at the DLC options you will notice a total of 3 DLC with even more to come. And this isn't ""vanilla ware"" DLC with like 1-2 weapons and some skins or whatever, each DLC adds character classes and tons of items, resulting in an extremely varied game. If there is one criticism though I think this game is not mod friendly, so compared to something like say Dungeons of Dredmore it has less content even with all the DLC. With that said though, this is still great value for money and a must buy for any fan of roguelikes or the SOTS universe.			"

												Rogue-like games can be real time-sucks. You get addicted to permadeath. Every time you make it a little bit further is just motiviation to keep playing. This game is very difficult and does all the things rogue-like games should. It's not a bad game, but I can't recommend it because there are just better rogue-likes out there. Nothing pops about this game, it doesn't have a style or spin that distinguishes it. Also, while a good rogue-like does depend on luck to some degree, the luck factor seems to be out of balance with this one. If you don't get some great items early on, you'll spend a couple hours before slowly fizzling out of supplies and dying, no matter how skilled you are. If you are a rogue-like junky, go ahead and play Sword of the Stars: The Pit, but if you're only going to play one or two rogue-likes, I'd suggest Dungeons of Dredmor or FTL.			"

												If you've played Dungeons of Dreadmore then you'll have a basic idea of how this game plays. Basically a sci-fi turn based isometric roguelike. Quite intricate in its application and fun to play there is a robust crafting system as well as a range of stats and skills to manage. Each move or attack takes one ""moment"" and to keep you from just grinding there is a food mechanic where you will starve if you don't keep going and finding more. Not one for the faint of heart as you will die repeatedly and be forced to start from the beginning again and again but if you can live with that then this game is worth the effort.			"

The crafting is well done and simple to understand, and the sorting for known recipes that you have all the ingredients for to the top of the page is especially helpful.The food system at times will seem redundant, however, if you forget that your food is a finite resource, you will starve to death, thankfully I haven't had that happen yet.All in all, an amazing game, and I would recommend it to any fan of perma-death games.

												A hidden gem that is extremely good. It's a roguelike, so you will have to start over when you die - and you will die because this game is hard. However, there's a sense of progression as you decode more and more messages and recipes. In addition to several DLC's that actually have reasonable pricing, the devoloper adds some free content every once in a while.Did I mention it is hard? Some deaths will be devastatingly sudden, others will be an inexorable slow grind towards death via hunger or poor equipment. If you want an easy game, pick up Nintendogs. If you want a challenge that is well worth the price of admission, then this is a pretty damn good choice.			"

												The Pit is, at first glance, sort of an odd roguelike. Certain classes seem to rely more or less on RNG, and some runs can feel like The Binding of Isaac where unless you get the ""correct gun"" or ""best equipment"" for your build you're going have a lot of trouble. A lot of the game is about learning and skill-based though, meaning the more runs you do -- and I'd recommend your first completion on Easy, as it's a lot more forgiving -- the more tricks you're going to learn. That means you're going to have an easier time on your next trip, and an easier time on your next trip, and it goes on... Worth the $10 price if you're the kind of person who boots up roguelikes every so often for a run or two. If you're the ""beat it once"" kinda person, I'd probably wait for a sale.			"

												I'm not a big fan of roguelikes, but the SciFi scenario and the graphic style is right up my alley, so I gave it a try and SotS didn't disappoint.The story is pretty generic, but I guess also not that important in these kind of games. Here it goes: Plague starts on some planet, dude/chick (you) goes to mysterious alien mountain base full of dangers in hope to find a cure. Messages can be found at terminals which contain some more lore, story elements and crafting recipes, but only if your character can decipher them.You can pick between 3 classes (Marine, Engineer, Scout) that come with different stats and equipment and play reasonably different. More classes are added in DLC (up to 10 in total). So what do you do exactly? Well, you fight your way through many (30 I think) randomly generated floors full of increasingly difficult enemies, while trying to find better equipment and prevent starvation. To help you with that, the game comes with a wide variety of guns, armor and tools as well as recipes for food and more guns/armor. In order to get those you must pick locks on containers, hack terminals and, when you're desperate, rummage through recycling bins. To increase your odds of successfully fishing a piece of yummy bacon out of a rotting garbage pile or hitting an enemy, you gain XP and spend points on several skills like ""Foraging"" and ""Assault Rifles"". Combat is (semi-)turn-based: If no enemy is near you can move freely but once spotted, it goes turn-based and you can only move a few tiles or attack each turn. SotS is not a short game - Although it's perfectly fine to play for 30 minutes and clear 1-2 floors every now and then, getting to the bottom floor of the alien base will suck a lot of time out of your life, even more so on higher difficulty settings when you dying will become a regular event. The difficulty curve is quite steep - on my first easy playthrough I pretty much breezed through the levels, but now I'm already struggling to make it past the 10th floor on normal. There are many different enemies with different abilities and strengths and an important part of survival is knowing how to counter them (and keeping cures ready for all the negative status effects they can inflict). Soundtrack and effects aren't that good, but like the story it's not something I care too much about in these games. I don't see anything wrong with the controls - simple but effective. The only thing that keeps bugging me is the limited inventory space. With all the guns, food, ammo, crafting materials, etc. your inventory is constantly full. But I guess the hard decision between keeping a potentially life-saving food item or an equally important Medkit is part of the fun.I enjoyed it a lot and will keep playing. It's fun to tune in for 30 minutes to clear some floors and find loot. If you played a lot of roguelikes, SotS might not offer you anything you haven't seen before, but it's still a very solid game. If you're new to the genre, it's a good albeit difficult start.About the DLC - As mentioned before they add new classes but also new equipment (+recipes), enemies, messages, status effects, etc. Mindgames is the biggest one, adding all that plus new skills (Psionics), extra floors and new rooms. More than what you would expect for DLC and worth getting. Gold Edition DLC has less content (mostly equipment and new classes) but is also cheaper. Nice addition, though not a must-have. Can't say anything about The Pilgrim DLC since I don't own that one.			"

												If you like FTL or Dungeons of Dreadmor, which are rougelike games, then this game is perfect for you. This game is a rougelike set in the sword of the stars universe. Side note I have never played or bought sword of the stars but that is not important. It has turn based combat once enemies are sighted and is quite hard like FTL or Dreadmor. Its a nice change of place compared to most rougelikes which take place in fantasy enviroment. Basically this game is just fun so give it a shot!!!			"

												Fun Sci-Fi rogue-like with a lot of depth and replayability! Each class has a distinct feel and plays differently. Finding recipes for building and cooking stuff in the game can be frustrating, but easy to find on the internet.

												Your pulse quickens, you ready your weapon.   You open the door to see........Anything!This rouge-like tests your survival skills, as well as planning skills, as each move you make could be your last.  Ration your ammo carefully; you never know when you will see an ammo crate or weapons locker again.  Also, the food you get at the beginning of the game? It will not last you the whole game.  You will need to make more; sadly, sometimes you'll be forced to eat something raw.This game also incorporates recipies made with the mob drops.  Just do not go crazy, as failed attempts will result in all the items used in the failed attempt being destroyed.The story does not really end at the bottom of the pit.  The DLC continues on the lore.  Just what is at the bottom of this pit? What attracts our heroes to it? Just what is with the messages from the consoles?Play and find out.			"

												Sword of the Stars the strategy game had a wonderfully thick amount of lore behind all the races, their habits and backstories. Only sad that studio kinda fell on their face with SOTS2. The pit is a fun roguelike that takes all of that backstory and makes great use of it, as well as being obstensibly a fun scifi version of your typical roguelike. Get alot of bang for the buck too. The graphics and sounds are very good, wonderfully animated which is actually rare for the rogue like genre where aside from FTL most of these kind of games go the retro pixalated look or skimp on visual design for gameplay. This has both. With the gold edition they also added more of the interesting SOTS races as playable characters and they each have a unique strength and downsides to change up the challenge of playing through. Very good buy.			"

												The PittReviewChris HumphriesI didn't used to like Rogue-like games but this one won me over. The rpg system balances the fun/challenge ratio very well. I like the idea of not having a main/permanent character, it made me less concerned with optimizing the stats as particularly as normal.The simple art style makes the tactical elements easy to focus on. The enemy designs have a lot of character.

												The best Roguelike with graphics I've played so far. Very replayable and fun. Even when I die after 8 hours of playing it still feels like 8 hours well spent :)TIPS FOR NEW PLAYERS:1. Choose Easy difficulty and prepare to die at least a few times.2. Use wiki to get crafting recipes. Once you craft something, the recipe will be visible in the game.3. Try different classes. It's hard to choose your favorite without playing at least one game with each.4. Figure out the rest for yourself - stats, skills, equipment, monsters, devices and a whole lot of strategy.Beware: This game is time consuming. One succesful playthrough even on easy can take 10+ hours.			"

												First thing's first, this game is not for everyone. Sure, it's a casual indie, but believe me, it's not as casual as it may seem on first look. Even on easy mode this game eqates to most normal to semi-hard modes in other games, that is, if you're willing to search every nook and cranny of (every) level and see what's in store for you. The old school aroma simply oozes from SotS, as you loot, craft and research, building up your skills while trying to survive at the same time. The only real beef I have with it is that music is scarce, but you can always play something in the background. SotS is achievements galore, and pretty hard to collect as well, which only adds to the classics we all loved because they were so damn difficult and addictive.A brilliant little gem worth investing your time in.

												Needs only a bit to be epic. Sadly isn't. It feels like Fallout 2 dungeon exploration with System Shock (predecessor to BioShock) mood. Great mix - and since both were dark sci-fi schemes it blends well. Most of the levels seem tiny. So they also seem to start to look alike. On the + side all the side skills (computers, repairs etc) seem to have a point in this game. That's great! Happened rarely in other games.In conclusion - good another rogue like, but still just another rogue like. With Tome4 and venerable adom available for free we should start to demand more :)			"

												I would like to start off that the Pit is a great roguelike, however, it is not without it's flaws, which I will try to clarify. When The Pit was first introduced, I saw it as an amazing Roguelike that was not afraid to kill you, because no good Roguelike game should make things easy. However, after spending time with it, and after a few updates which I feel are a hindrance rather than an improvement, I have trouble recommending this game.The biggest problem I feel is the introduction of a storage system. This feature allows you to store both Exp and Items every 5 levels of the pit, allowing other characters to inheret these benefits. This is a large problem, because, in order to have a good ""attempt"" at the harder difficulties, it is far more beneficial for you to GRIND sacrificial characters to boost up your ""real"" attempt.Turning a Roguelike into a grind is a terrible idea. However, if you feel that you can ignore that the storage system even exists, you will find a very challenging and rewarding Roguelike system. Be prepared for a VERY long journey however, this is far from a casual experience. A trek through the pit can take a few days even if you have a lot of time to set aside for it, and when your character dies after spending 20+ hours with them, it can be very demoralizing. This was improved somewhat by the ability to ""speed up"" the game by skipping floors, however in higher difficulties it can be incredibly difficult to survive when you have not had the opportunity to scavenge what you need.If a long difficult journey with lots of stat points, flavor, sci fi, and a beautiful art design with lots of items appeals to you, by all means pick up this game.It is a great game despite it's flaws.

												Hard. As. BALLS. Rougelike in a sci-fi setting based off the Sword of the Stars series of games. Taking the role of the hardcore Marine, skillful Scout or mindful Engineer, you must take the monsterous RNG, terrifying acidic creatures, constant threat of running out of useful equipment, or accidentally frying yourself fixing a device, and that's not counting the gauntlet of terrifying beasts that make up the final floor, if you ever reach it...And you'll love every second of it, if you are interested in the genre.

												If you have some money to burn and you want a decent roguelike you can't really go wrong with Sword of the Stars: the Pit. It's got all the traditional roguelike tropes: turn based movement and combat, hunger, and the ability to equip all sorts stuff. Add the great Sword of the Stars Lore, a great art style, hundreds of cratable items and several unique character classes and you have all the makings of great game. As an added bonus, this game has gotten tons of support and added content, if you look at the DLC options you will notice a total of 3 DLC with even more to come. And this isn't ""vanilla ware"" DLC with like 1-2 weapons and some skins or whatever, each DLC adds character classes and tons of items, resulting in an extremely varied game. If there is one criticism though I think this game is not mod friendly, so compared to something like say Dungeons of Dredmore it has less content even with all the DLC. With that said though, this is still great value for money and a must buy for any fan of roguelikes or the SOTS universe.			"

												A missed chance to deliver a great game.The pit is about finishing  30 levels(40 with the expansion) and  you can say that it is a perfect definition of roguelike with random levels, some items are with random stats and the permadeath.The problem is that we are not in 1980 and being roguelike doesn't mean you cannot add contents because the game is all about what I just wrote.If i wanted to play a simple roguelike game, i could simply use my old gameboy and play it.I mean, it would have been nice to have bosses every 10 levels just to ""motivate"" the player to go on with the jorney or it could have been nice to have more interactions and not just the open things and traps.You see for 30 levels the same tables, same boxes, same kitchen, same walls with different colors and few moved pixels...There is a great variety of mobs but all with the same pattern, same strategies(keep distance from those who near you, focus on those ranged).I like the idea to start a game anew all the times, but at the same time, as i stated before, we are not in 1980 and you can save content for the next gameplay(in faster then light you unlock new spaceships, in other games you unlock weapons etc..).Here you save the recipies for food and items and that's all.In the end for me it felt like a missed chance for something greater then this and i will not buy other 10 levels with the expansion.I don't even want to say how stupid was the 30th floor and how stupid the game ended...NB: I'm not interested in archivement but those of this game are just about beating the game in all levels...at least in the game ""Dead Pixels"" did that if you beat an harder mode the easier is beated too.

												Rogue-like games can be real time-sucks. You get addicted to permadeath. Every time you make it a little bit further is just motiviation to keep playing. This game is very difficult and does all the things rogue-like games should. It's not a bad game, but I can't recommend it because there are just better rogue-likes out there. Nothing pops about this game, it doesn't have a style or spin that distinguishes it. Also, while a good rogue-like does depend on luck to some degree, the luck factor seems to be out of balance with this one. If you don't get some great items early on, you'll spend a couple hours before slowly fizzling out of supplies and dying, no matter how skilled you are. If you are a rogue-like junky, go ahead and play Sword of the Stars: The Pit, but if you're only going to play one or two rogue-likes, I'd suggest Dungeons of Dredmor or FTL.			"

												As a fan of RL's I think this game is fantastic. The dlc in the game adds plenty of life as well. I find that the gameplay is always just hard enough to be brutal, without killing you off instantly at the start. Which makes you always strive for that last 50% of the game. All the items, combinations, skills, add up to a very complex game. There are some faults, like a lack of discriptions of skills. However you eventually find out what everything means.			"

												When I first reviewed this game, I gave it a thumbs down. I said, ""The game is okay. Worth more than what I paid for it, that's for sure. But it got old pretty quick. I didn't find enough variety to keep me interested.""The only thing true in that statement now is the worth more than I paid for it part. They added a lot of stuff since I originally bought it. Which in itself is saying something. But the game is fun. I mean alot of fun. It's loaded with a variety of enemies, loot, recipies and whatnots. It ain't boring, that's for sure. Even the generated maps are more fun to play on. They got the balance and leveling system right IMO. I mean, it can be frustrating at the harder levels, but that's how games should be; CHALLENGING! And I was doing fine with my marine until I realized I was leveling him awfully wrong, man. Yeah, he was strong as hell and devistaing with that blade. But he was dumb as ****! Electronics & Engineering? HA!I I couldn't unlock JACK. I couldn't repair JACK. And losing out on those ammo crates, boy....that really hurt down the line. I was surviving on Mech kills.Got my butt handed to me when I ran out of bullets for BOTH my weapons and had to face those E-Worms with a blade on the brink of breaking.Like homeboy said in Predator, ""That's no way for a soldier to die.""Let me tell ya, sometimes...those teleporting traps are NOT YOUR FRIED!

												In short:Great concept and lot of fun to be had in theory but regrettably the steep difficulty make it less enjoyable than it could have been and ultimately I believe that, while fun to some extent, it is a game that doesn’t respect the player and that’s unfortunate.More details:I understand the concept of roguelike and I have many of them in my library but this one proved to be too rough for me.Your mileage will vary but this game turned out to be too punishing for my own liking and I would say not well balanced unless your goal is to suffer. You will likely end up losing a lot of your precious time by dying for stupid reasons which are in a lot of cases out of your control.It is unfortunate that they did not allow players to fully enjoy the game by letting them tweaking the difficulty. By example the size of some levels could have been smaller or contained queues to the direction to take to get to the exit to facilitate the experience of the players – making the food and armor less scares in the last levels would have been welcome.Due to the reasons above (and many more to be honest) I am almost tempted to mark this game as not recommended due the difficulty and frustration it brought me… Had it been made available with a somewhat customizable difficulty wise it would have ended on my top list for sure!

												Do I recommend this game? ""Kind of"". For once, I will aim to give an extremely brief review.Roguelike games are a dying genre - as in, actual roguelikes, games that follow the genre of the original title for which the genre is named. One can make a powerful argument that so-called ""Roguelite"" genre - games that incorporate the 'permadeath' aspect, and often have some kind of progression system between multiple runs/tries at the game - are the successor to Roguelike games, and they are numerous with countless quality entries on Steam alone, from Binding of Isaac, to Risk of Rain, to Sunless Sea. Games that may not share typical 'genre' mechanics - they can have elements of platformers, action-RPGs, exploration titles, side-scrolling shooters, first person shooters - but all share that same 'you'll die, but you'll get better' overarching progression path, or unlock path (and, possibly to play into the permadeath aspect, most have a rather dark tone).But actual Roguelikes? Turn-based, resource-management driven games? Very rare, and this is one of the few titles that fits the genre to a T. Huge amount of content, high production quality, and obscenely difficult. If there's a weakness to the game, is that your only hope of success is to 'exploit' non-intuitive mechanics, like not entering your stats screen for a time in order to 'stock' level-ups like a resource, or unequipping armor in the early levels to avoid damaging it, or unequipping weapons and punching doors and other objects for stat points. However, even un-intuitive mechanics still are balanced in some way - the cost making itself known in food, health, psi, anything.This game is a niche title by every definition, but if someone was already into roguelikes, I'd encourage it highly. If someone wanted to TRY a roguelike, I'd honestly recommend the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games (at least the first two generations), which are very high quality games but, obviously, aimed at a younger and lower-skilled audience, and THEN this.If you're 'on the fence', don't get this game. Nobody can deny that it is a frustrating experience.			"

												True roguelike game with stats affecting your chances to find loot, hit, heal and so on. While it has a good enemy and item variety and it is very strategic, it unfortunately (in my honest opinion) focuses a little too much on the luck aspect. You may end up with 300 rifle ammo and yet, no rifle, for example. The crafting system of course may help with the problem once you unlock more of them, but so far I've only unlocked one recipe after 20 hours. (On Insane difficulty.)To be fair, half of my deaths have been my own mistakes, but finding yourself in a situation that you can not survive whatever you do is not anything too rare.			"

												I've played this game extensively outside of steam, please do not judge by my hours played. I'm one of the (very) few to sucessfully complete the game on ""Seriously?!"". This game is extremely difficult and often not fair, as the randomness of the game can ruin a perfectly fine run. If you just found a fantastic weapon, and you're holding onto it for the 40th floor, and then you accidentally walk through an item destruction trap. Well. I hope you have a second controller/keyboard. All of this said, learning and understanding the nuances of this game make it quite rewarding, and it's definitely worth a look. It's cheap and you'll at the very least get a few hours out of it.

												A brutal sci-fi roguelike that's easy to pick up and play, but hard to master. Think Dungeons of Dredmor, replace the humor with guns and add a lot more emphasis on resource management.An easy recommendation to roguelike lovers.			"

												I reallly thoroughly enjoyed the gameplay of this title. It's turn based, there is a crafting system (of sorts) although I didn't bother with the painstaking process of figuring it out, it's quite difficult, and it has plenty of potential hours. Rogue-like is definitely an adequate adjective for this game. My only qualms are that the story that's in it is sparse. I would like to see a sequal that perhaps involves a change of scenery instead of just the same old dungeon crawl, and perhaps a little more story to get attached to. I recommend this title.			"

												Best game I've played in years.The Pit is very addictive and challenging. It took me around 50 hours and dozens of tries to finally manage to complete the game on Normal difficulty... and not once did I feel bored. Every playthrough is different and exciting, and if you're not careful and start to get overconfident from the great loot you somehow manage to find, it can all come crushing down very fast. Make the wrong rash decision, and suddenly the energy sword you used to cleave your way through the previous levels is vaporized and your left standing with your bare fists and a buckload of ammunition for weapons you don't have. This game really forces you to learn from your mistakes and plan ahead.I recommend the normal vanilla version over the DLCs (Mind Games/Gold atm). They add just unnecessary stuff and excessive complexity to the game, which it doesn't need. The vanilla version is perfect. I purchased the DLCs a while after my successful vanilla playthrough and soon regretted it, because at the time there wasn't any way to disable them.			"

												Only 6 hours in and I'm hooked.  A really accessible Roguelike experience, based on the world of Sword of the Stars.The premise is simple.  Get to Level 30 of The Pit to retrieve a vaccine and save humanity.  To succeed you'll need to hack, build, cook, upgrade, inventory manage and fight your way down.  With only a single life to do it in, everything's to play for.Priced modestly at £6.99, there's little reason not to jump into The Pit.  ;)			"

												Although it's obvious the makers of this game put some serious love into their project, SotS: The Pit just isn't quite interesting enough to put it in competition with some of the other free roguelikes out there. To its credit, it has solid sprite-based artwork, a decent soundtrack, and a research system that helps make even a failed run seem worthwhile as it unlocks new items for future attempts. That being said, the combat and exploration get repetitive fast, the multiple characters don't have all that much distinguishing them apart from different voice actors, the dungeon is MUCH too long, and gaining access to the crafting system that makes higher difficulties less impossible requires replaying the lower difficulties again and again to harvest recipes. While not a BAD game exactly, you can find better roguelikes elsewhere.			"

												Are you looking for pain? For suffering? For brutal death? You've come to the right place!SOTS: The Pit is a sci-fi roguelike, but you probably saw that in the description. The important part is that this game's not just a rehash of the old ASCII roguelikes. It's inspired by that rich history, but Kerberos doesn't stop with the classics. The crafting system, lore tidbits, creative enemies, and those frakking Adaptoids all combine to give this game a flavor and flair all its own. I'll freely admit that I've only seen a small portion of this game so far, but I've enjoyed many great deaths.If you're even slightly interested in roguelikes, you owe it to yourself to give this one a try!

												Foreword of advice: I suggest you search for videos on YouTube for a better idea on what the game is like, because, as always, a textual review accounts for very little and does not give a proper impression of what this (or any game, for that matter) is like. There is a demo available, you should probably check it out if you are interested in this game. Also, for a more intricate look into skills/stats/characters, feel free to visit a community wikia at http://sword-of-the-stars-the-pit.wikia.com/wiki/Main_ContentTD;DR #1: My opinion of this game - Amazing, even if with a few pretty major problems;TL;DR #2: Short summary of impressions (Good points, Debatable poins, Negative points):Good points:+ Randomly generated - alot of replayability and variety in your gameplay, each game will be different; You will get your money's worth, if you like these sort of games;+ Many character classes (as of Gold Edition - 8 + 1 secret character) - different strengths/weaknesses which must be accounted for;+ Simple and functional graphics - this will run on a potato;+ (personal) Gameplay - I enjoy these types of games and this is one of the few games that really nails it, think NetHack and you will probably understand what kind of game this is, minus the item interaction hilarity that NetHack had;+ Bloody hard as nails;Debatable points (these are as subjective as they can be):+/- Relatively simplistic gameplay - I like the simplicity, but there's really not alot of nuance to it. Although many advocate that your skill (decision making) is more important, I do not believe it is so, as not finding any equipment by about mid-game is NOT salvagable by your skill;+/- Randomly generated levels can dictate how easy/hard your game is going to be;+/- Some characters are easier to play with - Some characters start out with psionic powers (Psion(Mindgames)/Seeker(Gold Edition)). This allows them to be less dependant on luck and more dependant on skill due to having all the tools necessary (Psionic powers in this case), which allows them to be less dependant on equipment for starting levels;Negative points:- Each run will require alot of time to play - clearing even 10 floors can easily take about 2 hours for me (as I have a tendency of trying to clear the whole floor) and as you go deeper, each  level requires more time, due to stronger enemies, unless you are fortunate with your gear;- This game features unlockable recipes (crafting), which you get from Consoles. Unlocking all recipes (or some potent ones) will require alot of time ""grinding"". This game does not require crafting to win, but some recipes are nearly essential for survival (Aggressive Antibiotics, for example. Without this, you are very often going to die on your run);- Bloody hard as nails, damn it!A short review of the content:Sword of the Stars: The Pit is a roguelike game, where the levels are randomly generated (rooms/loot/enemies), but to some extent (i.e. you will see harder enemies/better loot the deeper you go). There are multiple characters which you can play as. During the game, you gain levels for your character upon gaining enough experience points. Each character starts with different strengths/weaknesses and different statistic and skill point gains. There are 5 difficulty settings, with the most notable is 'Easy', because it is not, and also, you can only unlock first 50 messages (Messages #1-50), which do contain very good recipes, but will limit the recipe unlockability. Anything above 'Easy' will allow un unlock all messages.At the most basic level, the combat is very simplistic, all you can really do is choose your weapon (good luck with having any!), aim at a target and shoot, hoping the dice rolls go in your favor, although Psionic Powers (Mindgames and Gold Edition only) add additional threats (now there are monsters that use psionic powers) and elements in combat (you can use psionic powers as well).The resources are extremely scarce at the beginning (because you don't find weapon lockers too often on early levels). And the deeper you go, the more you have to try to avoid combat, since enemies get alot stronger and there is more of them. This game can be really harsh on the dice rolls and on more than one occasion, I actually didn't believe the silliness of the dice rolls I got. Also, items (armour/weapons) have durability, which can decrease on successful use, depending on your skill.This game features crafting. Now, this is one of the biggest problems I have with the game - to create something, you require a recipe telling you what you need to create this something (you do not need to unlock the recipe to craft items, but, for the purpose of the exercise, I assume we do not use external resources to find out the recipes before we unlock them). Unlocking those recipes requires alot of time, as out of all the messages (I believe it it about 250+), less than half contain some recipe.The process of unlocking is: finding a console (may requires repair - chance to fail), downloading a message (chance to fail) and decoding a message (you have a percentage chance to decode each word, rather than the whole message, which causes you needing to get the same message multiple times to get the recipe - although sometimes you can figure out the recipe from reading unfinished messages. After crafting something, you will be able to see the recipe, regardless of whether or not you had it decoded fully). Some recipes are damn near essential for living - examples of such are Aggressive Antibiotics (must have, unfortunately) and Hero Sotswitch (less must have, but still a must have).The ""grinding"" of recipes, along with the general time it takes to play out a single run (I often clock at about 3-4 hours for about a 16 level run due to my tendency of clearing the whole floor) means that it will take a long time before you unlock all the recipes. And the best character to unlock these recipes (Engineer) is extremely poor in combat, which means you will die alot more often.In conclusion, this game is amazing, even if it does have a few flaws (I am sure only a few of what other people may have found). It has amazing replayability, simple combat (which is a flaw to some degree, but I really like it), although somewhat alleviated by psionic powers (but not all characters can get them, realistically speaking). The variety of characters is beneficial to the gameplay, there are also alot of items/weapons/armour. Also, Kerberos (the developer) are a really great company, they released 2 DLC, which are actually expansions, because each adds alot of content (Mindgames - not only new items/enemies/whatnot, but an entirely new gameplay element - Psionic powers; Gold Edition - no new gameplay elements added, but, in my opinion, still totally worth it; a lot of content was added - new classes/items/etc).This game will eat your time, which is both a blessing and a curse.....and trust me - there will be alot of cursing involved. Good luck!P.S. The Casual genre tag is an absolutely ludicrous claim, this game will kick you in the groin and laugh in your face, while savoring your tears of frustration. I guarantee you, you WILL rage at some point during the game, because this game is bloody hard as nails.			"

												Rogue-like games can be real time-sucks. You get addicted to permadeath. Every time you make it a little bit further is just motiviation to keep playing. This game is very difficult and does all the things rogue-like games should. It's not a bad game, but I can't recommend it because there are just better rogue-likes out there. Nothing pops about this game, it doesn't have a style or spin that distinguishes it. Also, while a good rogue-like does depend on luck to some degree, the luck factor seems to be out of balance with this one. If you don't get some great items early on, you'll spend a couple hours before slowly fizzling out of supplies and dying, no matter how skilled you are. If you are a rogue-like junky, go ahead and play Sword of the Stars: The Pit, but if you're only going to play one or two rogue-likes, I'd suggest Dungeons of Dredmor or FTL.			"

												Sword of the Stars: The Pit is a great roguelike title with plenty of depth and only some minor drawbacks. The Pit features so much randomization and replay value that it becomes quite addictive to continue playing once you're say... 15 minutes through a game. Being a roguelike, there is of course permanent death in this game. You die and it's all over, your score is added to a high-scores board and then you have to start all over again with one of three playable characters. But chances are you won't really care all that much, as beginning a new game doesn't really feel as daunting as you would imagine it to be. This video game is also a very user-friendly title for anyone that may be new to the roguelike genre. If you have ever played and enjoyed Dungeons of Dredmor and fancy a change of setting, consider this to be the sci-fi DoD.			"

												A missed chance to deliver a great game.The pit is about finishing  30 levels(40 with the expansion) and  you can say that it is a perfect definition of roguelike with random levels, some items are with random stats and the permadeath.The problem is that we are not in 1980 and being roguelike doesn't mean you cannot add contents because the game is all about what I just wrote.If i wanted to play a simple roguelike game, i could simply use my old gameboy and play it.I mean, it would have been nice to have bosses every 10 levels just to ""motivate"" the player to go on with the jorney or it could have been nice to have more interactions and not just the open things and traps.You see for 30 levels the same tables, same boxes, same kitchen, same walls with different colors and few moved pixels...There is a great variety of mobs but all with the same pattern, same strategies(keep distance from those who near you, focus on those ranged).I like the idea to start a game anew all the times, but at the same time, as i stated before, we are not in 1980 and you can save content for the next gameplay(in faster then light you unlock new spaceships, in other games you unlock weapons etc..).Here you save the recipies for food and items and that's all.In the end for me it felt like a missed chance for something greater then this and i will not buy other 10 levels with the expansion.I don't even want to say how stupid was the 30th floor and how stupid the game ended...NB: I'm not interested in archivement but those of this game are just about beating the game in all levels...at least in the game ""Dead Pixels"" did that if you beat an harder mode the easier is beated too.

												If you've played Dungeons of Dreadmore then you'll have a basic idea of how this game plays. Basically a sci-fi turn based isometric roguelike. Quite intricate in its application and fun to play there is a robust crafting system as well as a range of stats and skills to manage. Each move or attack takes one ""moment"" and to keep you from just grinding there is a food mechanic where you will starve if you don't keep going and finding more. Not one for the faint of heart as you will die repeatedly and be forced to start from the beginning again and again but if you can live with that then this game is worth the effort.			"

												when i fisrt got my steam account this faster than light and team fortress 2 were the first games i got and i wasnt disappointed with this little gem. it is the perfect dungeon crawler with the right balances between damage dealt and recieved and with a great end game goal. i have never reached the bottom of the pit but 60 hours in i still love this game. the items are variant in the extreme and really shows the effort in making the game and all of the classes are specialized nicely. although the marine is fun i almost always choose the engineer. with different skills affecting the likelyhood of opening different types of containers the game creates diversity and a disire to keep going to see what lies ahead. opening a container with a 30% chance of sucsess with make you cry with joy and failing to open a container with a 99% chance gives me a huge laugh. in the fist 10 hour the pit is mysterious and full of surprises. the tutorial covers the basics but leave the specifics out which leaves you first run full of discoveryand exitement. the feature i like most about the game is the message logs. throughout the pit there are consoles that hide messages. if the console can be repaired and hacked then an incripted message will appear. the messages once deciphered with either show you a recipe or tell you some useless information. recipes are scarce as a result and allows the game to retain its sense of discovery everytime you come across a console. ultimately there is little i can say that is bad about the game; allow the features are developed and refined and interconnect nicely to provide a gaming expeirience rare in indie games today. ten dollars ( what i payed ) bought me 60 hours of gameplay and i gaurentee whatever you pay will buy you just as much.

												I really enjoyed my time with this. Most roguelikes follow the set formula and adjust it to their liking, normally the setting is still in a dark dungeon, this doesn't do that.This isn't the first to do this, but it's a reminded of how much a change of location can greatly change the footing. Kobolds become aliens, treasure chests become abandoned freezers and utility stations. It's a fun game which doesn't rely on an understanding of the game series that it is a spin off.			"

												Hard. As. BALLS. Rougelike in a sci-fi setting based off the Sword of the Stars series of games. Taking the role of the hardcore Marine, skillful Scout or mindful Engineer, you must take the monsterous RNG, terrifying acidic creatures, constant threat of running out of useful equipment, or accidentally frying yourself fixing a device, and that's not counting the gauntlet of terrifying beasts that make up the final floor, if you ever reach it...And you'll love every second of it, if you are interested in the genre.

												Roguelike? check.  Brutally difficult? check.  Unfair to some?  Well... depends on if you consider looking up crafting recipies as cheating I guess... but this game is definitely unfair sometimes.  You will die, a lot... but would it be rogue-like if it was any other way?  I was going to pass on this game before I saw TB's WTF on it and decided to give it a shot.  (Give the man some royalties already)  Definitely a good game if you like this genre.  Even if you think you have enough rogue games this one has a cool sci-fi theme and a lot of replayability.  I've played 2 classes so far.  I'd recommend the Marine if you are just getting your feet wet.  There is a slow, painful way to extract recipies from computer console messages in the game... you can choose to try and figure them out on your own or go to the publisher's forum to find them out ahead of time.  The farthest down the pit I've made it is level 11 or so playing a squishy engineer on normal level.  There are 2 harder difficulties, yikes!  Anyways worth the $10 if you like turn-based rogue-like games set in space.			"

												An uncompromising turn based Rogue-like based in the Sword of the Stars universe, The Pit provides hours of enjoyment (and frustration), as you make your way down through 30+ increasingly difficult levels.  While the end-game payoff is disappointing, the replay value is extremely high, thanks to the crafting system , choice of classes, and loot mechanics.  No two games can be played the same way, as the choices you make are based on what you may find during your run.  Easy to learn, difficult to master, The Pit is a fantastic time sink for those that love the tension of knowing that perma-death may be waiting behind that next closed door.			"

												Cant say enough good things about this game. Its veryaddicting and if your careless before you know it your night is gone. Pretty unforgiving at times but so are most games that are heavy on the RNGesus. I recommend buying this not on sale for the simple fact this company deserves your money.

												This is the first Sci-fi Roguelike Dungeon Crawler that I played, and I was not disappointed. Really liked various difficulty settings and classes, that allows you to challenge yourself to try different playstyles. Good craft system with little downfall of what you have to learn pretty much recipes trough experimentation or look at recipe list in the internet. Overall, a very good game, if you like Roguelike Dungeon crawlers, when it's a good buy.			"

												Do you like Rogue-like game? Do you like building and modifying items? Do you like solving puzzles to learn new recipes? If yes, then Sword of the Stars: The Pit is for you!While I can't really understand the ""Sword of the Stars"" tie-in for this game, this is a great rogue-like game set in space. There are three classes to choose from, each with their own stengths and weaknesses. You have to use your character to explore the abandoned space station. While exploring you will run across monsters, defensive robots, aliens, and traps. Plus you'll find lots of loot and items that you can combine in workbenches or kitchens to make new items, or food, ro help you on your way.Items become damaged through use and battle, and charges run out of electronic devices, but you can repair these and recharge these provided you find the appropriate tools and stations.Death is permanent, and the maps are always random, so the game has high replay value. This is a very fun game and I reccomend that anyone who enjoys a good ""light"" RPG or Rogue style games to take a look at this.			"

												A laptop-friendly strategic roguelike. This game is pretty complicated despite looking so simple and is insanely frustrating the deeper into the levels you get. The variety of foes you face keeps you constantly judging your current tactics and there are a multitude of risks and little things you can do to min/max your character. Given recent updates, there are even more characters and options on how you want to clear your way down the depths of this hellish dungeon.I'd say it's a pretty good game, but I find it hard to agitate myself into getting back to it. It's not exactly a game like Binding of Isaac you can pick up for ten minutes and do a whole run (or most of a whole run), be satisfied and put it down for something else. You have to sink a lot of time into each run to really get it anywhere, but at least it lets you save your progress, unlike other roguelikes.3 out of 5 trapped doors. "

												Sword of the Stars: The Pit is a great roguelike title with plenty of depth and only some minor drawbacks. The Pit features so much randomization and replay value that it becomes quite addictive to continue playing once you're say... 15 minutes through a game. Being a roguelike, there is of course permanent death in this game. You die and it's all over, your score is added to a high-scores board and then you have to start all over again with one of three playable characters. But chances are you won't really care all that much, as beginning a new game doesn't really feel as daunting as you would imagine it to be. This video game is also a very user-friendly title for anyone that may be new to the roguelike genre. If you have ever played and enjoyed Dungeons of Dredmor and fancy a change of setting, consider this to be the sci-fi DoD.			"

												SotS: The Pit is my favorite modern Roguelike, in that it gives you the same hopes of Nethack with the RNG as merciless as Jubilex wielding a dead cockatrice.  Instead of random ?s and !s you get random equipment mods and doorway traps.  Ammunition remaining becomes as critical as the # of charges your Roguelike wands had.  An addicting mix of crafting and exploring and good 'ole fashioned turn-based combat.  The gold edition adds a lot (especially classes / loot), but isn't required for A+++ fun.			"
