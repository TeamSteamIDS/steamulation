												I would call ‘3079 – Block Action RPG,’ a ‘cult-classic’ even though it’s still fairly new.  The reason I say that is because I feel that you’re either going to love this game or hate it.  Personally, I could not get into it.  I restarted the game about 12 different times, each time seeing if I had ‘missed’ something or simply didn’t understand the concept.  However, even after 12 times, I continued to scratch my head – wondering about the many facets of this game.I really loved the music, it does a great job driving-home the ‘futuristic’ vibe of the game.  I also love the ‘mechanics’ to the game.  You progressively get better at skills in the game by doing them – don’t like your terrible aim with that rifle, then keep shooting at things (all the things!).  I also noticed that the game included skills such as ‘mining’ and ‘stealing,’ which is awesome!Though, I believe what ruined this game for me was the story and setting; I think that’s what made me restart the game so times, too.  The, seemingly, inconsistent size of the NPCs, the strange location of buildings (yes, I realize it’s a randomly generated world, but there needs to be some consistency for an RPG), and the way items are distributed to the player (randomly generated on the ground, just sitting there or sold by a vendor – very inconsistent).  I tried to discover the reason, but it didn’t appear to be laid out anywhere obvious to the player, no in-game ‘books’ to discover with clues, no conversation with NPCs to help get answers.  The world needs to be 'plausible,' (not to be confused with possible) and the developer has not achieved that.I feel that a video game has the same mark that books, movies, and television bear – these outlets have a very small window of opportunity to grab their audience, if they miss that window it’s gone.  For me, ‘3079 – Block Action RPG’ missed that opportunity, and I really wish it hadn’t.			"

												I wasn't sure how this one was gonna go:  it is either a tentative recommend or a just barely, spend a paragraph trying to sell you on the game anyway, ...unrecommend.   Ultimately, there is enough of a cool game here for me to keep putting time into it.The games name is strange, don't worry about it.  Here's what jumps out:  Action RPG.  The game is an FPS action rpg.  It looks like an ASCII Minecraft, but has all the ARPG symptoms.XP grind?  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ RIGHT SON.  Your skills increase as you use them.  Pick some pockets dawg, raise that stat.Loot? Yo, the big guy over there wielding a sword with fangs that one shotted the NPC from your faction?  You take his life, you take his blade.""... But clizzy, this dudes sword SUCKS BALLS dewd!""  Yeah, it happens.  But you can sell that piece in almost any area.  Items scale with the enemies, who scale with the zone.  You're in a level 9 zone, the level 9 enemies drop level 9♥♥♥♥♥♥that usually be sellin' for a pretty penny even when they are booty butter.  This is awesome because....There's mad cool♥♥♥♥♥♥to loot in this game!  This is my favorite part:  your character can equip jet packs and grappling hooks that give you crazzzzzzzzy mobility.  You can fly into sky fortresses, or zip around the landscape with non-stop grapple shots.  Thing is, though, these ♥♥♥♥♥es also scale.  Level 1 hooks/packs can be used when holding 40 weight, no more.  Every level adds an additional 40 lbs.   It's cool zipping into a high level zone, on a mad hunt for the shopkeeper or drop zone with the clutch twink grappling hook/jet pack.  You have to get out alive too, because when you die you lose an item.  The game is sadistic, it will eliminate the item you hold most dear.I suppose I wish the game felt more complete.  I've put some goodly time into it and I'm not sure if there is anything else to do but loot grind.  The building mechanic?  No idea what's going on there.  Completely arbitrary, in my experience.However, I have to say that I haven't got many quests done in the *main* story line.  There's a little bit of RNG involved with quest givers having to give you a specific reward to advance - it can get a little frustrating.   Hunting for the right people always devolved into loot grinding and murdering things.  This was really fun for a bit, and I'll probably sit down a few more times to see just deep the game goes, but it becomes nothing more than pure carrot-sticking.   Still hours of fun.6.9/10			"

												Great game, I enjoyed, and will still, many hours of this game. It is a sandbox game with elements from Borderlands and Skyrim. (No it's not a minecraft clone because of the blocks!)The feeling you get when you found a better sniper than before and succesfully install a upgrade element to it never gets old.I highly recommend trying the demo of the game first (which can be found on phr00t's website.) to see if you like the game enough.

Also, early game is a little difficult, the monsters have waay to much health for the beginner weapon you start out with.			"

												I got this game when it was in Alpha from Indie Royale. Please keep in mind that this game is made by one person and is only a few dollars. So let's get to the pros and cons: Pros: 1. Nice difficulty curve - the farther you get away from the starting town that harder the enemies get, and the greater the loot gets. After you get some pretty good gear you upgrade yourself to fighting demons instead of Neanders (I think that's how you spell it).2. Cards - They don't typically sell for much, but hey; buy a cheap game, get a few hours of gameplay and some free cards. Cons: 1. Lack of random encounters - sometimes you may see a spaceship. You can damage them, but I have never been strong enough to destroy it before it kills me. Other than that, it's just more of the same old enemies over and over.2. Uninteresting quests - There are only like, 4 quests possible to take; Protect this herp, destroy that derp, kill that guy, hack this computer. That's literally all the quests I have ever seen, and with as many hours as I have on record, you would expect a bit more. Other comparisons: 1. Weapon types - if you want variety, you will be disappointed as there are very few weapon types. Sniper rifle, Pistol, Grenade launcher, Shotgun, Sword, and Demon sword (which is only for demons) are the only ones I can think of. Although you can install upgrade circuits into your weapons and armor to upgrade characteristics that apply to you character, which is actually kind of cool.2. You better not ever accidentally shoot one of your own people, 'cuz if you do they all gunna keel you (It's pretty unforgiving). This can be fun though If you ever get bored you can always turn on your own kind and start stealing from people and become a nomad, so there's that (PS if you do this, there's no going back).That's about it. Not a very big game, but if you buy it on sale, it's not too much and you'll have some fun. SO, expect that, a few hours of entertainment and some cards.			"

												Wasn't really sure what to expect with this game. It looked a lot like minecraft so I took a chance. That being said, it plays nothing like minecraft.

												I first went out, found 3089 (didnt look at PC requirements*) tought it was special, and after that I went after it's precessor (this game) And after a while I am ready to give my full on opinion...   THIS GAME oh, this game is just sooo goood.Example- how to take out every ""thing"" in a building.1) Guns a blazing.2) Go cloaked, use thief items/ steal, then take them out one by one with a silenced pistol.3) Use a grappling hook, get a nice vantage point, snipe in the windows, and get the rest using cover and a assult rifle.4) you get the point. (ect.)Also, there are two main reasons this game is misunderstood, 1) Not a Minecraft clone- It's just a voxel art style, 2) It's a LOT more fun and interesting  (whith tons of replayability) than you might think, Try it for your self!*It now works! Thank you for updates, now i can enjoy this game to it's full potantial!			"

You get dropped on a world where a war wages on between biped, quadrapeds and some Red Demons you just can't kill early on... you level based on what you use, there's cool little gadgets to find and kill for, and they give you a tool you can build a shelter with out in the wild... it's fairly fun.

												Weird and a bit unpolished, but surprisingly fun. Quite short though - only took me 5 hours to complete.This game may look like Minecraft, but there's actually no crafting and mining is an optional extra. The core of this game is fighting your way through a randomly generated world, doing random quests, improving your stats and getting better items. Yes, this sounds like every other randomly generated game out there, but 3079 is novel enough and short enough that you won't get bored of it.			"

												Just bought the game on Steam and holy damn does it look good. Not only does the world feel organic and full of dangers, but there's solid gameplay utilizing the best parts of both the building of Minecraft and item-searching in dungeon-diving of rogue-likes.Also, it looks good 'n artsy. None of that Minecraft monotone but rather some creepy and original style to it. Randmization really makes stuff interesting in this game. There's definitely lots to see, meet and explore.As to the difficulty, it's the game's strong point. This world is relentless and does need you to take it seriously. You need to acquire skill first, then items in order to survive and advance in progress-indicating levels and power.But what I'm really looking forward to is what's in the future of the game. It does seem it could easily get some servers with communities similar to those of DayZ in order to make the game feel even more organic, purposeful and alive. Not to mention patches and mods.It's a world ever at war. And you need to shape it.			"

												Man I don't even know. I respect the amount of work that went into this game, but it just feels so cobbled together with no strong sense of what you're doing or where you are. The game claims a full story line with a purpose but all the missions I find seem to be procedurally generated from the same 5 basic mission types. That might be fine if the game was more set up like a sandbox style game, but I just found myself running around shooting things, and then getting money to go shoot more things because some dude with a star somewhere told me to just because.This game might have been mindblowing if it was released in 1994, but this style of gameplay design just doesn't cut it for me anymore.

												3079 is similar to a combination of Borderlands and Minecraft, as its a very open world, with a very 'blocky' look. I was attracted to this game due to the Steam Reviews, which seemed to indicate a very unique game, with lots of replayability and exploration. I have played this game for about 4-5 hours, not the 7 minutes reported, due to the game not reporting to the Steam Client as it opens up in a Java window....Unfortunately, my experience has not been very good. Initially, the game would not run, and required 2-3 reinstallations from Steam to ensure it would open as expected. Once in the game, there is not a lot in the ways of a fluid or organic flow to the game. You sort of just walk around, hoping to figure out things as you go before you die. The monsters are not that exciting to look at, and the animations are very poor. I have attempted to play with a friend, and even then, the game was not any clearer. I would describe this game as a cult-classic type favorite, where you either LOVE the game, or you HATE/DON'T UNDERSTAND the game. Unfortunately for the developer, I easily fall into the ""Don't Understand"", and ""Don't Like"" side. Since the game is cheap I find it hard to give a bad review, but this game unfortunately goes into my 'Pile of Shame'.TLDR; not a great game, not well developed. very cult-like following, but was not able to enjoy.

												This is an absolutely fantastic game, despite the simple graphics. It combines a ""start here and expand out"" progression style with a very Borderlandsesque loot generation system. Along the way you'll find plenty of equipment (armor, weapons, and batteries for example) as well as little chips you can use to upgrade your existing gear. The one problem I have is that the game doesn't tell you that your jetpack and night vision goggles both consume energy (your universal ammunition).			"

												Very fun once you get the hang of it. I made the mistake of not turning my jet pack off right at the beginning (which isn't explained at all) and had to start with nothing in my inventory. It wasn't a problem though because I soon found things lying around and got enough credits to buy some much needed gear. The music is pretty nice to listen to and the characters look...interesting. In order to interact with the generators and things you have to click on them in your inventory (took me a while to figure that out). Worth the money in my opinion.			"

												Very ambitious game.  The graphics are bad, but the gameplay is mostly sound.  Movement speed is too low however, and capital ships are impossible to defeat to the point of missions to take one down being worthless.  Otherwise it's a solid shooter/action/RPG game.  A warning though, in the early stages of the game, the difficulty level is unforgiving and the penalty for death is high, so frustration is inevitable.  The sequel, 3089, is also worth checking out			"

												When I fired up this game for card drops, my first impression was that it was just a minecraft knockoff, but at the very worst I'd say it's merely minecraft inspired. There is a lot that's very novel and addictive about this game. The quest and weapons system is very engaging and I wish minecraft had something more like it! Still trying to figure out all the nuances of this game, but so far, I'm very impressed.			"

												I got this game on Desura when it came out, and I believe it came with a steam key. I'm friends with Phroot and I know he puts all he can into his games. I have about 20 hours on the Desura version.This game mixes elements from games like Borderlands and Minecraft (you can build, although to a restriction). You start out falling from nowhere and a war is going on. You automatically teamup with the friendly race you desend upon, fighting against the Neanders. I won't spoil anything, but you can team up with them eventually.In the middle of the war, there are these demons that are impossible to kill without a special blade. They are a bit rare, and you have to do missions for them.All in all, it's a fun game and the multiplayer is still the best part. It does get old after a bit, and by a bit, I mean about 4 hours.			"

												No, nothing like Minecraft other then some graphical similarity and a very simple construction mechanic. The game does not start well.. after having to update Java and change some windows filetype priorities for the game to even run, I was thrust into the world only to meet instant death. Not the most inspiring of 'introductions'.. In short, the game is very vague - you are forced to learn everything yourself - the hard way. An in depth tutorial and some easy beginner missions would have gone a long way here.. Graphically you know what to expect if you have seen the trailers/screenshots. I had to disable ingame music to stop the game from crashing. It's an interesting concept and I'll recommend it based on this, though if you want to have any fun at all, be prepared to work hard for it.			"

												3079 is an Open World FPS set on an alien planet where you are sent in to stop a never ending war between two species. At least that's what you’re told to do but upon landing you instantly pick a side of the conflict and work as a mercenary for hire. The species friendly to you at the beginning are the humanoid looking aliens but you can switch sides by killing enough of them to please the other side. It may seem like a good idea to immediately head out of the city and hunt some aliens but as you will soon find out they are soldiers that only know war while you on the other hand are the space equivalent of some random dude running off to the battlefield with a Nerf gun. You will immediately realize how useless you are at fighting at the beginning and it is an important lesson to learn since dying means losing a random item. I say random but most of the times they seem to take away your grappling hook or your most used weapon.  It is a really rough introduction to the game and even if you manage to knick a weapon off of an enemy killed by someone else you will not be able to use it. There is no ammo in this game, instead everything relies on your energy meter and the more powerful a weapon is, the more it uses. At first you may as well be carrying a broken gun as you will not be able to fire off a single round without it overdrawing your energy and harming your health. This game features skills like stealth, energy and charisma to name a few, which get more effective as you use them in a certain manner. Unfortunately the way to improve them are usually insanely tedious. You'd think that by using energy its stat will go up but the way it works in this game is that by using more energy than you have and harming your own health it will eventually increase. Since in the beginning you can barely fire off any rounds at all that means you will spend most of your early adventures staring at a wall and repeatedly firing just to get your energy up. Enemies regenerate health so by the time you have enough to fire again they will be mostly healed meaning you must use the better weapons with heavy energy usage.  Honestly, this energy thing is what harms the game the most and will be a problem for the entire game as you need more and more energy. Stealing is pure RNG and requires you to get caught in order to increase its stats while being hit when you are camouflaged makes you better at Stealth. The progression system is a complete, nonsensical mess sadly and by that logic I'll become a mathematician by failing my math tests. Seems like a petty thing to complain about it but it is honestly no fun and means you only get better by either doing tedious things or getting shot in the face. The only thing you really get for killing enemies is their weapons to sell to a vendor later on. Vendors are the same as any other alien but with a ”$” symbol on their shirt. You could buy useful objects from them like grappling hooks, armor or generators that increase your stats while active. These generators can have some rather cool effects such as increasing your jump height enough to be able to jump houses and walls which makes you feel pretty awesome as you take down several enemies midair.  You can tell any none busy ally to follow you around and gather up your own posse to hunt down the enemy if you so please. It is a really handy feature, especially early in the game when you are pathetically weak. The AI is not all that great so they are only useful in open fields, don't expect to be rescued while in buildings. AI is embarrassingly bad for the spacecraft that fight like if you had a giant magnet to your face and will stick right on you until one of you is dead. You can attempt to hijack which is a pretty cool feature and lets you zoom around the skies though it is rather weak and likely to get you killed if used in a fight. It's also a bad idea to go too far out as the further you go the stronger the enemies are. Along with the two species at war there are also demons that look like red gummy bears out to kill everything. These are a very annoying as they will pull you in near them no matter the distance between you two. They are not rare and it is not unusual that you have to fight with the controls just to escape their gravitational pull any time you want to go somewhere.  Demons can only be killed by a very specific kind of sword which brings me with another issue. You can only equip 4 weapons or items to the hot-keys at any one time. The rest of your number keys are useless and you will always want to have the demon sword and grappling hook equipped so you only have two hotkeys to work with. This adds completely unnecessary micromanagement whenever you need something else like a satchel charge, your drill or your construction tool. You can mine the randomly generated world for gems though they offer very little money compared to simply scavenging guns from a battlefield. This game does feature destructible environments but only with the satchel charge unfortunately. Building your own base is possible but ultimately pointless as the point of the game is to move further and further out into the map while staying in a low level area is useless.  Grappling hooks in this game are a ton of fun to use and have a pretty long range making you feel like a mix of Spider Man and Rambo as you quickly navigate the environments. There is an anti-gravity device that allows you to float around at the cost of not being able to recharge your energy. It is really useful for reaching the floating buildings and did lead to an insanely awesome moment where I was near death & surrounded at the edge of a cliff, jumped off and managed to activate it a few feet from the ground. 3079 does have its moments and incredible potential but seems to sabotage itself at every turn. Like the previously mentioned grappling hooks an anti-gravity device can only support a certain amount of weight from your inventory. It sounds reasonable enough but as you head to a higher level area which happens quite often, everything starts weighing more and more. That's not anything unusual in video games but it feels so artificial here where even the health packs start weight over 30 pounds. One area will have a grappling being sold with up to 400lbs usability and the next one will have one with 440lbs. You don't think “Wow, I can carry more now!” instead you're feel the need to facepalm as everything suddenly gets heavier in order to make your gear obsolete  time and time again.   You receive missions from allies with stars on their chest but they are rarely worth the price. There are main missions that revolve around the fight against demons and you will need to do at least one of those to get yourself a demon slaying sword. At the end of the day 3079 implements a ton of ideas into one package but fails to make the overall product fun. As an example you turn on your night vision and grapple onto the top of a tall tree with a sniper rifle to take down some enemies. Multiple things keep this from being fun. For one your night vision goggles only pick up enemies of a certain level so you will have to keep buying new ones every time you enter another area until you can't be bothered. Second your sniper uses up a ton more energy while using the scope yet has no added damage, so you may as well use it without the scope which defeats the purpose of a sniper. And finally, it is not unlikely there will be a demon in sight that will cause you to fight with the controls just to keep your footing in the tree even if it is far away and unaware of you. 3079 has a ton of ideas and a ton of heart no doubt but I'm afraid its progression system, annoying mechanics and combat heavily hampered by energy make this a game I simply can't recommend.

												3079 is a FPS set in some kind of Minecraft-like world, with the addition of futuristic weapons and gadgets. There is not much to tell about the story, you were dropped on this planet to investigate life, and wound up left there to fight for your life.I strongly recommend you go through a guide first because the game doesn't explain much at the start, nor throughout the game.There are two 'races' in this game called the Humoids and Neanders, you start friendly with Humoids, but can become an ally with the Neander race if you start killing Humoids. There is also a third race aka the Demons, which are enemies to both races and can only be beaten using a demon smiters, which can be obtained by doing quests for leaders (they have stars on their body). So at the start of the game you might wanna avoid those guys, because you will die...a lot.Enemies drop loot which you can sell for money (to merchants, they have $ sign on them) and buy better weapons for yourself. Best features of this game are a grappling hook, which is used the same way as in Just Cause, and an Antigrav pack, which lets you float around so you can avoid terrain obstacles. But both of those have weight limits and cannot be used after you pass the said limit.Weapons are plentiful and everyone will find something they will stick to, from quick blasters, to shotguns and rocket launchers. There are also mini fighters in the game that you will use to bring down the big ships, but I found them a bit too slow for my taste.As you fight you level up and increase your stats: Strength - carrying more items, Stamina - health, Firearms - weapon damage and Energy - used up for shooting, represents ammo capacity in the game). Skills you can develop include: Mining - getting gems to sell, Charisma - more likely for NPC's to follow you around, Engineering - efficiency of upgrading armor or waepons, Stealing - pretty obvious).And one thing that annoyed me a lot is that every time you die you lose 1 random item from your inventory (so you can lose that awesome gun you just bought in a split second)So to sum it all up:+ satisfying shooting+ grappling hook and antigrav pack+ lots of fun- takes a while to get familiar with the game mechanics- losing an item when dying is annoying (you will die a lot)- repetitive questsAll things said, I still had fun with the game, but certain aspects stop it from being a really good game. 7 / 10			"

												Wanting to know more about the game, I checked out the Community forums. The top post is ""NOT a ripoff of Minecraft.""The whole post is wasted on just the graphics. 3079 is a minecraft clone in that it moves, feels, and acts like Minecraft. Being a Minecraft clone is not a dirty word. In the 90s, if you were a FPS, you were a Doom-clone. If you were a 1vs1 fighter, you were a Street Fighter-clone. Tetris-clones were everywhere. But then there was Dr. Mario, and Tetris Attack, and the block-puzzle genre was born.Now that we got that out of the way, let's review 3079. It's a big open world with a randomly generated properties. There's a lot of the same. Once you've seen one building, you've seen them all. You're exploring and doing quests that surrmount to basic fetch quests. This is a game where you get out there, and shoot stuff and watch your numbers get bigger. I spent the next few hours scratching my head, wondering, ""What am I supposed to do?"" 3079 is sparse. With a better tutorial and more interesting 'ah-ha moments', there could be something here. But not right now.			"

Then the server hosting is just god awful with hugh amounts of lag spikes and just random disconnects and most of the quests simply being just fetch quests is suffice to say to save your money and buy something else.

												I was sold from the video, it looks great. Minecraft with guns and a grappling hook! Like Just Cause 2 in Minecraft. What's not to love?It is like Minecraft with guns made in Java. Before the developer was done with this game, he was already hyping up the sequil. This is great for a first time developer. It is a simple Minecraft with guns. The guns work well enough, the enemies are giant and easy to hit. When you die, that's it. You crash back to the launcher. Speaking of the launcher, that's the only way to adjust the settings. Including controls. This is probably the 2nd worst button configuration I've ever seen. You select what the key does, then you find the key from a drop down list. When you set a key, chances are it unsets another key that has nothing to do with the key you just set. Such as if I set something to use the 'Right Key' then I set something to the 'Enter Key' it will set the previous 'Right Key' to the 'F2 Key.' Huh? Again, this is clearly someone's first game.With all that being said, the game generates a random world and yet always starts you suspended high above the ground in orbit, suspended. When you find out the gravity button to drop you from the sky you might die on impact. It is quite unforgiving. If you survive the fall through the use of the gravity button, you're immediately in hostile territory. Sometimes the floating red monsters will murder you before you even land. From the start, the guns are underpowered. When you run out of ammo, you start losing health when you shoot. An understanding of enemy levels would have been nice, such as a beginner enemy should take one or two bullets. Then as you progress they take more bullets and then you find better guns or upgrade so they take less bullets.The only redeeming factor about this game is multi-player, but really, if you're playing with friends any game will be fun, because you and your friends will always have fun. That's why they're your friends.There are far better FPS games, which this is a FPS. I can't even call it Minecraft, since there's not much crafting or world craftability as there is with Minecraft. I just can't recommend this game. It is also very telling when a game took so long to be Greenlit.			"

												When I first bought this, I thought it was going to be Minecraft with guns. That couldn't have been further from the truth.3079 is a procedurally-generated voxel-based world, much like Minecraft, but aside from occasionally breaking down blocks, that's where the similarities end. Everything else is just as the title says -- ""Block Action RPG."" The majority of the game is spent acquiring new quests, obtaining and equipping/selling items, fighting enemies, and retrieving objects -- all of which are fully randomly generated. Everything in the game (and I mean EVERYTHING) is generated procedurally, and while this never creates any particularly memorable characters or items, it does mean that on occasion you might stumble upon some pretty great rewards, interesting landscapes, or intense quests completely by accident.I'll just come out and say it.... Graphically, this game is ugly, and by that I mean most other games I've played suddenly become eye candy. That being said, something about the horrible ugliness is genuinely charming. These two-legged ""humoids,"" four-legged ""neanders"" and bright red demons are all wonderfully childlike in their portrayal, with simple dollar signs and stars on the bellies of vendors and commanders, respectively. I thought the simplicity of the graphics would put me off, but after about fifteen minutes of gameplay I fell in love with the world.And gameplay is really the redeeming factor here. No, the stat system doesn't make sense (and is mostly based on failures rather than successes), the leveling system doesn't make sense (your level is determined by the highest-level creature you've killed), and the vehicles are merely a switch from walking to flying with the image of a ship HUD plastered across the screen. But damn, is it fun; I had more outright fun with this game than a lot of the AAA games I've played in the past year. In one particularly exciting moment I was charging into the skies after a demon ship, blasting away (weakly) with the ship guns, when a nearby demon annihilated my ship. I started falling through the sky and in a state of panic pulled out my grappling hook, aiming at the nearest thing -- the demon ship. As I flew forward I let go of the grapple and switched to a rifle, sending the ship into an explosive oblivion as I soared through the debris, curving downward toward the planet. ""This,"" I thought, ""is fun."" Just pure and simple fun; it doesn't take a 1000-person team and a $60 million budget to create fun.... Just a developer named phr00t and the patience to give his game a chance.This is one of those rare games where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. On the surface it looks like what you might expect from a one-man indie game (an ambitious one, at that), but if you give it a serious chance and try to beat the game at least one time (a two or three hour venture at most), you'll find yourself enthralled with this creative rendition of the future.

												A game that has... had potential, I origionally bought this game because It looked quite interesting, I'm not extremly picky about graphics as long as gameplay is good, but in that term this game is difficult. It offers no real insight to anything you do, the quests are confusing and make little to no sense, and you die about as often as you  click the keys in a button masher. The gameplay can be good, if you know how to fight, and you have good gear, but in that sense, getting good gear is almost impossble without googling how. Refering to how this game had potential, since the begining of the development of 4089, its all you see on this page, there hasn't been an update on this game in months, and the developer continously keeps posting about 4089 on the 3079 page, its rather infuriating, seeing as I'd like to see news about 3079 on the 3079 page. Beyond that, if you want a good time waster this can be pretty good, but in the long run, its not gonna suit you for long. If you wanna give it a shot you can, but its not something to put a large amount of time in.			"

Restarted several times until i watched a video guide Once i got energy, followers, and demon killing figured out things got fun. The game is random, which can be both a bad and good thing. The further out you go, the harder things get. Im only one town out from where I started, and 2 large scary looking ships bombed the crud out of the place. Got to love the random, destroyable enviroments. Now only if i didn't lose my level 5 demon smiter when i died.It gets repetative, yet addicting. Would love to play coop. That would make things more intersting.			"

												Don't turn away this game because it ""looks like a Minecraft rip off"" because it isn't. Surprisingly, the only similarties are the blocks, and the building system, which you rarely ever use. I'd compare it to games like Strife instead.The game isn't very friendly to newcomers. You start out in this giant space with lots of broken, chipped astroids. Only after watching a video, do I realize you have to float downwards in order to get to the planet. The game still isn't easy after that. Enemies take a lot of hits, and guns don't seem to be accurate. And waiting for guns to recharge after shooting takes a long time.  Buy the grappling hook early on. It will help a ton. One of the complaints I have with this game is that you move way too damn slow. Thankfully, this can be fixed by purchasing speed generators and speed upgraders with in-game credits you earn by either selling loot found from carcasses of your enemies, or completing quests. This is thankfully, improved in the later games where you can now sprint at the cost of not being able to shoot your weapon.This game is also surprisingly well balanced. Hell, even the difficulties are balanced. Easy mode makes you dish out more damage, at the cost of your energy replenishing slower than normal mode. A quip I had with most AAA games (Looking at you, Halo.) is that if they have some sort of cloaking device, you can only use it for around 30 seconds before you're uncloaked, which is annoying. Stealth is about patience, waiting for the enemies to move in a certain spot so you can take them out without alerting others. When you're forced to panic kill an enemy because your cloak ran out, it's not fun, and just feels tedious. In this game, however, the cloaking is balanced well; Cloaking makes you move slower, and you cannot regenerate energy while cloaked. However, you can cloak for as long as you want. This is what cloaking in games should be.The graphics are pretty bad, but it IS an indie game made in 2011, so you do have to give it some rest. Graphics don't make a great game, evidently, shown by here. I have had a few graphical glitches (invisible textures) but they rarely occured, and didn't ruin the game experience much.The steam run does not start up the game itself, but rather a bat file that loads up the options menu. This means that the game cannot use steam overlay. I suppose it's easier to run the game this way, I guess.Pros:+Fun gameplay+Randomly generated; It's different each time you start.+Game is quite challenging.+Grappling hook is great.+Trading cards+It's cheaper than beer.+Can run on a toaster.Neutral:*The game is not forgiving to newcomers. This may make it more challenging to others, but it's not exactly for the casual players.Cons:-Guns are incredibly inaccurate. I believe this depends on the gun itself you pick up.-Graphics are poor, but it is an indie developer making this.-Graphical glitches.-No steam overlay.-Only a few songs in the game. One of them sounds pretty good, but the others are royalty free songs.Would recommend? Yes.I do recommend this game if you want to see what 5089 is like. Keep in mind, there are still some improvements in 5089, including graphics and menu system.			"

												While I admit, I was pretty sceptical going in, this game didn't half deliver. I've never had such compact fun in all my life. The grapple is super satisfying to use, and me and my friend basically just found ourselves traversing miles of landscape instead of actually progressing towards our objective. The building is kind of finicky, but once I got the hang of it, it was EZ. GGWP.			"

If you want, you can play the game more than once; each game is different. Your character is always different, the map is always different, there's always something to do. It should provide a week or so of fun, for sure.			"

												After receiving this and 3089 as part of a bundle, I thought it might be fun to give them both a shot. 3089 was much more fun than this, and much less frustrating. While I like the premise of a story, and that the grappling hooks are much more responsive, its next to impossible to complete any quests given right off the start. Partially because players are tasked with either killing an enemy without being detected (which is next to impossible in both the killing or being undetected portions), or being sent to acquire an item in the battlefield without killing anything (where ships seem to have a perfect knowledge of the players whereabouts, and drop immediately down to shoot them into a fine dust). Demons are also scattered about while trying to complete quests which allow you to actually harm them, killing you in the progress. Dying in the game results in automatically failing a quest, and losing a sometimes vital item from the inventory.I've tried on several occassions to prep as much as I can before even beginning a quest, but it always ends the same: I get killed by something stupidly powerful with no way to gain aid in game, die, and suffer a huge setback by losing some vital item. At least in 3089 the friendly NPCs were actually helpful against opposing forces...			"

												Sheesh, this is one hell of a game.  I'm an old gamer that has been around before PCs used DOS, and I still can't get over this game.  I got this game on sale this week at $0.49 and it is worth a whole lot more than that.I've been strafed by two planes at a time.  I've been fired upon by a Flying Fortress in the heat of multi-squad battles, exploded the Fortress with my AI buddies while it was doing a bombing run over us and it crashed into us with a huge explosion, forming a real time crater beneath us while doing so ... and lived.  Now, I don't know about you, but that's about as good as it gets.  Who needs a combat MMO when you can play this with AI and no internet connection?Do the game's graphics look a bit like something out of the Stone Age?  Sure.  But this game takes Combined Arms to the limit.  You were told there was a violent war going on, well they weren't kidding.   The whole terrain is littered with pits, craters, used by some as fox holes and others seem to be having moments of extreme war fatigue in them, and you'll join them soon enough.The first couple of hours you'll be wondering what the heck is this thing called 3079.  You'll feel like a poor rube who somehow got caught up with the resistance, but you don't even know what a war is.   When you land, night and day changeover quickly.  The nights even from the starting town, have not only the sounds of flak and gunfire in the distance, but you can actually see the tracers and explosions of vehicles and men out there beyond the town's fortified walls and above the tree tops.  And those tracers and explosions are the real deal, that's actually happening out there.  They are not canned ambience tracks or graphics for effect, it's the news come to life. Yep, this is one wild ride.  It may sometimes look like a throwback, but few games give you an experience like this of war.  You'll be confused, out-flanked, cowering in fear -- and then slowly but surely you'll get your bearings, start looking for battle and heading out to the action, using buildings and terrain as best you can.The game has things which annoy.  The lifts are easy to get momentarily stuck on, just back into them and adjust so your back is fully to the lift blocks and away from the edges and you'll be fine.  You'll be bumping into the roof on the highest level, but you'll figure that out.  The ""Demons"" in the game are a pain to deal with, pulling you towards them with some unknown telekinetic power and attacking everyone, friend or foe.  But once you get some Demon Smiting Swords via Quests, you will have a solution.  There are a few too many buttons and nothing is that well explained, but that's why I wrote a basic tips guide for newbies in the forums, in case the videos on the game, which are really terrible, don't get you over the hump.  You can also talk to npcs that aren't giving quests or aren't merchants for a random tip or two. Ever wanted to be an astronaut/soldier/special forces guy sent to investigate war on a planet and try and stop the war and bring peace?  Neither have I?  But that's what you are up to here, but good luck getting there in one piece. Do yourself a favor, on the launcher menus, choose Easy Mode, it's still exciting as heck, and you'll still die enough to learn to respect the game.  Also, up the FOV to 115 or so, in this game the camera positioning really needs it and you still we be caught broadside from your flanks easily enough.For those of you looking into this game, I've posted a basic starting guide to help on the forums.  I'll probably move it into the 3079 Guide section later on.All I can tell you is that most of the YouTube videos are made by people who have no idea of how to play a game and on early beta versions.  You can catch some of the early excitement, but good luck getting any tips on playing the game.  For example the following things said in some videos are wrong.  The game can't kill steal, you up your stats by overloading any action of that stat.  Test your limits to improve, it's not that confusing. So overload and empty your energy in your batteries, you may up your total energy.   Overload your inventory so that the weight is too high, barely walk that way and soon you get extra strength, and by soon I mean in a matter of 10s of seconds.  Think of overloading a skill as leveling and improving by necessity. The game is cool like that as it wants to promote the way you decide to play.  I actually enjoy this game more, so far, that 3089, even though 3089 has more polish and a lot less seemingly irritating things in its GUI.  They are similar.  But the gravity of the situation in 3079 is a lot more tense, you are a lot more confused from the start, and combat is almost visceral in that weird alien way.  Just forget the graphics and experience what is going on, and you'll probably end up enjoying it as much as I do.  3079 is more raw and brutal than 3089 and on sale for $0.49 it's worth taking for a test drive.  Learn to survive, because if you think simple graphics makes for an easy game, you don't know Phroot.  To get past the initial confusion, however, is going to take at least 2 hours.  So, if you wish to be protected by the Steam Refund Policy, I suggest you read a basic guide and maybe look at a couple of videos before you play.  Or just buy it on sale next time and stomach the two bits you paid. If you can get past the graphics, you are in for one hell of a ride.On top of that, the game has night vision goggles, allows you to build fortifications, you can use a grappling gun to climb buildings, ride and jack into airplanes.  It has suspended flying cities in the atmosphere.  You can teleport, you can cast effects on your enemies or yourself using Transfer Effect guns.  You can capture towers via hacking the enemy computer in enemy towers if on a quest.  That's just what I've learned and experienced so far.  It has a ton of different weaponry, heavy guns, assault rifles, pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles, explosives, grenade launchers, jeez.  All of them have the potential to have additional modifiers on them to stats.  A lot of them don't really make sense, since when you equip your weapon you can't mine for example, you need the mining tool on you, but still it's like Diablo 2 met Battlefield on a crucial Hill 49.Highly recommended, if you can get past the graphics and first 2 hours. If you can't get past the graphics, I recommend you take a look at 3089 and 5089.  Those games have a better user interface, much fewer irritating issues, and look better.  They are easier to get into since more info is available in game as tips and help.  It's not as wild a ride, but it covers the same type of gameplay.  (This game runs fine on an Intel HD 2500 Integrated GPU.  So if you have that or later on a laptop, it should work.  I can't speak for the AMD Integrated Chips, it may work just as well.)			"

You meet a group of aliens, who give you random quests and rewards thereof. Enemies are ""demons"", really tought things that fly through the clouds. They are the main focus and plot of the game. There are also other alien races. You run around getting quests and items, fighting bad guys, and trying to stop the demon incursion. Simple, really.

												If you like minecraft-esque games then you'll love this. Incorporates an RPG style leveling system for your character. The more you use a specific skill the better you get at it.This game was fun right up until the point I realized that the farther you go in any direction the higher the monster level, and higher the gear they drop. So basically you start off, kill a monster and grab a level 1 gun, then run until you hit level 3 or 4 monsters, kill them, grab their level 3-4 guns and gear, and basically repeat on into infinity. Pretty fun little time killer though.			"

												3079 is not the kind of game that you would give an award to because it's a great game. the story isn't that interesting and the graphics could be better, but the core gameplay is amazing. this game is more for the person who just likes to have a good time and doesn't really care about how it looks, the people who like this game would look at the game in a different light than the average viewer would. saying that, this game is not easy, not in the slightest. i've played the game  at the time of me writing this review for about 120 hours. i've  only beat the game once (as far as i can remember) along time ago, and im\'m not even sure if i beat it or if there is an end. would i reccomend this game, yeah, but you can't look at it head on you have to look at it differently to really apppreciate what they did here. overall i would give this game an 8/10. it's not perfect but i personally think it's a game that could turn into alot more if they put even more effort into their next one.

												While I wouldn't personally recommend this, it's got some things going for it. It does a good job of blending in the RPG elements with the sandbox gameplay while still giving you absolute freedom. Took me a few tries to figure out what the hell was going on but once you start slapping on weapons, upgrades, jet packs, and grappling hooks you can enjoy yourself.Maybe it's more to your taste than it is to mine. It's got Trading Cards so may be worth checking out if you're curious and it's on sale.			"

												This game was barely developed. You will realize it as soon as you start it. The opening cutscene bugged me out and the world is cluttered, ugly, and confusing. The controls and movements are loose and sloppy. It's not playable or fun.Play at your own risk, this game is a sham.			"

												It's been a long time since I've played this game, but when I first bought it on Desura I logged many hours. This game is really great in that it keeps getting harder and harder, but at the right pace. I think it could theoretically stay challenging forever. Tons of fun with friends, I highly recommend!

												It's a cult game to be honest, and while I can usually get into a lot of cult games, I just can't with this one. The difficulty curve is too steep, the graphics too odd... it's weird in a way that's just unintuitive, difficult in a way that you can't beat by getting better at the game, and written in a way where you're not sure if the dev fell asleep at the wheel. I mean... it's functional, it doesn't crash often but it's not what you are expecting going in. I reccomend you don't buy it, even if it's on sale because it will just sit there in your games list forever until you decide to hide it.			"

												3079 is a pretty good game single player. But playing this game co-op makes it a really fun game.Sure the game doesn't have a server list but hosting and joining is really easy. No port forwarding is really needed to play with friends. Well I'm not sure though cause I use hamachi and play with my brother. But I'm pretty sure you can play with friends that are far away using hamachi. Anyway, I think this is great game and you should give it a try. But you should buy it on sale, It's a better idea anyway.8/10			"

												Playing this is both very enjoyable and incredibely frustrating. It's a somewhat difficult first person shooter with a bunch of RPG elements. Procedural generation and randomized aspects, such as algorithmic quests and unscripted faction battles that will certainly change the topography of the map, give the game a majestic feeling and some replay value. At that appraisal, I should have nothing but love for this game, but unfortunately it frequently dips into the realm of taking otherwise good ideas and implementing them in the most extreme, unenjoyable ways.	For example, simply starting a new game is a matter of chance, as the starting equipment you receive may not match your play style, and it is very easy to die in the beginning of the game even with desirable inventory, often due to low-damage, low-accuracy weapons. Meanwhile, enemies get very accurate weapons that are often scaled far better than your own. 99% of better weapons can be found on dead enemies.	If you survive your first several hours, you will discover that the difficulty and shop scaling is based on how far away you go from the initial spawn point. This makes some sense, to keep the player from constantly being bombarded by overpowered baddies, but it also turns the beaten paths into a tedious slog with little reason to ever backtrack, except maybe for a quest.	The difficulty is the most noticeable problem, however. Apart from inaccurate guns, there is also the constant issue of rules that just don't apply to enemies, but do apply to the player. Enemies don't get hurt by their own explosions. Their ships never crash. Friendly fire is off for them.	The biggest problem is the punishment for dying. Upon death, the player loses one random item, and this can absolutely cripple a character build if the item in question is particularly useful. For example, if I die and lose a powerful antigrav pack, which allows the player to fly, then replacing it with an equally strong pack requires a trip back to the intense enemy territory where can be found the only stores which sell items that useful. In the worst case I had, it was a 20 minute round trip. Long story short, the punishment for dying is really just that, punishment, not really fun or interesting at all. I did find a bit of a way to circumvent this, by filling my inventory with crap that I don't mind using, but, surprise surprise, I can't fly like that either.	As much as I've complained about it here, this game is actually quite worth the money. It's addicting, and it provides a decent level of depth. There are the parts that make me want to tear my hair out, but that's balanced out by fun.			"

I picked this game up because I had the money and it looked like something I would enjoy, and yes I had a great deal of fun robbing people blind and selling them back their stuff(steam doesn't keep track of playtime once actually in-game) it is a fairly fun game. However, I felt a lot was based on luck and building your character past what wepons you wanted proved difficult. It is a very fun and addictive game but if you get stuck over encumbered and very far from any npcs it gets very dull very quickly and when you die you have no idea what might be lost untill it's far too late. Very fun, pick it up if you have the money and feel you want to spend it on this otherwise try to get it on sail.			"

												This is the worst of Phr00t's X0X9 series, but it's not a bad game. If you can get it cheap, you might want to pick it up, esspecialy if you like the rest of the series. You can explore, and as you go farther out, the higher level the 'bad guys' get, so you can stick around areas that you find not too tough at your point in the game. The fighting is fairly simple. Weapons come in a nice varity, from swords and daggers, to sniper rifles, and even a few rocket or grenade launchers. Weapons for every kind of person! The various enemies are separated in 4 types most of the time, Walking melee, walking ranged, flying melee, and flying ranged... and sometimes the 5th type, spaceship. You can guess what each one does. They all have somewhat randomized body shapes, the team you start on has 2 legs, and the other has 4. That is the main way to tell who you're with. Though flying people don't have any legs...If you decide to build... something, you have to find or buy a special item. Even if you don't want to build a house, it can be useful, because you have healing blocks, and turrets in the building section.Missions have a small bit of variation, some you have to pick up an item, others you have to kill a thing, others you have to protect a guy, and they give various rewards, usualy money or weapons. Some you also don't want to be seen, and/or kill anything.On the subject of stealth, you mainly use an invisibility... thing, and... ok, it's been a while since I played this. I never used this much tbh.Overall, it's a decent game. Give it a shot if you can get it cheap.			"

												What seems like it's trying to be a ""big"" game ultimately ends up feeling small and limited.  3079 is plagued by a number of issues, and the bizarre appearance of the enemies is the least of them.  There are a few interesting or fun elements, but everything that 3079 does right, 3089 does better.There is no reason to purchase this game.  If you are thinking about getting this game, get 3089, instead.  It's better in almost every way.			"

												It's a good sandbox game, kinda like minecraft if you will. But from my experiences unless you are THE MOST CAREFUL PERSON IN THE WORLD you just get shredded! Even on easy that's right EASY I got teared apart by any enemy regardless what weapon they were using. It's fun the first minutes sure, but when the difficulty kicks in you are in trouble. I played this game once before it came to steam and i had one heck of a good time with it, but as with all games updates arrive and i found it more and more difficult to survive more than 5 minutes without having to run and gun or spam health packs. The quests in the game are good, but there is almost no variation to them at all. From what I've played i've done killing sprees, protection, hijacking, assassinations what else can I remember? Almost nothing as I don't see this game as memorable in the near future at all! The trading/byuing in the game is good though, but having to destroy crates and digging for gems to get a lot of money or just to earn a few extra credits just to be able to afford that one item that you see as life saving isn't worth it.Back to what I said about run and gun. This game has you either run from your enemy that quickly reach higher levels than what you might be prepared for, or it has you fight until you die in one spot with close to no help or followers that just die almost right away. Unless you're playing with friends it's almost impossible to win this game.In the game you have three bars, one health, one stamina and one that I have no idea what the hell it does. You also have strength which you can increase via melee weapons or carrying way more than what your character can handle, and then there charisma, thief and so on. Try just walking right in to a cluster of enemies with some friendlies mixed in there and look at your health bar, unless you're ignored that bar will go from max to minimum in less than 10 seconds. Stamina! Don't even bother!! If your weapon can't be used because you have to little stamina and you try to shoot it you lose health to slowly up your stamina. Want to find generators or batteries that increase your stamina? Good luck! Any good generators/batteries are a long way north, west, east or south! You also use stamina to power your jetpack(Game calls it ''Anti-gravity pack''), your night visors(NVG, Night vision, Night Vision Goggles whatever you prefer),  I do believe it's also used for your radar? Not sure about that, and also camoflage! Yeah camoflage! Good idea right? No... From my experience everyone can see you if you have it activated! Enemies or if you have accidentally attacked a friendly they all see you! Oh and friendly fire is more of a b**ch than gravity it self! And I forget what else it's used for, oh yeah! YOUR WEAPONS REQUIRE A LOT OF STAMINA!!!!!!! Assualt rifles and blasters not much but any other type (melee weapons don't count as they use 0 stamina for some reason) demands a lot of stamina! And as I said good luck finding any good generators or batteries!I do not reccomend this game if you were expecting good variety, easy challenges, good experience, good shooter or a good RPG system (something close to or similar to Mario RPG, Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger or something like that). Oh and it has a good open world system but it just doesn't have a lot of different terrain. It mostly consists of a few hills every now and then, mostly flat ground, oh hey a lake! every now and then otherwise the lakes are just what I call puddles, and a WAY to huge dessert that you get way too quickly lost in.

												The game is fun but gets stale too quickly. I gave up on the story after it asked me to take down a borg cube-lookalike demon ship with a flying vehicle that explodes after just one hit and me trying that for an hour. The demon ship requires like I-don't-know-how-many hits as it keeps healing back up and I can't avoid not get hit long enough while I evade enemy fire from multiple sources at the same time. I assume this is likely me doing it just wrong.I kept walking West instead as I noticed earlier enemies become stronger if you keep walking, hoping to find a vessel that lasts more than one hit, but nope. I bought armor instead, did some of the neverending skirmishes around town, sold all loot I didn't need, walked West again, more skirmishes, shiny new weapon... and so on and so on, until... till after everything was around level 80 and capable of killing me in like two hits - that's because of the way your character improves: it gets better as stats and abilities are frequented. So, if you don't take damage from enemies as you move up in levels your max life won't increase. This requires you to stay in an area, work on your skills (as in take damage on purpose, for example) and only then move on.It doesn't help when you think, you could just travel far for a shopping tour, come back and enjoy the game that way. Yes, you can do that but the progress remaining is the progress itself. If you can make it far and survive somehow in higher areas there's no point in going back as everything from back there is also right where you are - always. Except the little Minecraft-ish things you can build, like /home, chests, lamps and a few blocks. THAT does not move with you.Then it came to me: This isn't going to stop, it keeps on rising, so yeah, 3079 is incremental!? I bet, someone already made a Youtube video of how far he could make it and end up in like level 3400 with 12400 stamina, or something. It wouldn't surprise me. If not, it should be made but I won't be the one doing it.What I do love though is the grappling hook that turns you into Spiderman, tons of fun to use and the soundtrack is b!tching too. This kept me playing for a few more hours (as I was looking for plot) than just the two it takes to see it all. What the game lacks is a proper story, sturdier flying ships (!) and maybe a few bosses, then it would be a decent game rather than just a fine one that feels unfinished.			"

												My favorite in the series.As much as I love 3089 and 5089, nothing quite captures the surrealist atmosphere and intricate cities like 3079.When I first played 3079, I was dropped straight into a dystopian Scifi world, literally! You fall from the sky and get attacked by demons who have taken over the heavens! You can either die and wake up inside someone's house nursed to health (which is what happened to me) or you can evade the demonic forces and use your wits and your jetpack to land safely on the ground, while the face of the world is being altered by constant faction warfare.Call me nostalgic, but 3089 and 5089 just don't capture the same vibe for me, and as much as I enjoy 3089 and 5089, they are very ""Arcade"" in comparison to 3079, which has cities that light up at night, giants that patrol the streets, with giant walls preventing anything from getting in or out, which of course you overcome with your trusty grappling hook.3079 also features bases in the sky you can raid and take control of, and you can also change faction relations depending on who you are attacking! Want to switch sides? Shoot humanoid Humoids and start working for the arachnid Neanders.Bases are distincted by the colors used on specific lights, which gets the job done, but a lot more could have been done. Buildings overall have much more interesting layout than in 3089 or 5089 which are based more around outdoor combat with hoverboards and attack ships.While there are Attack Ships in 3079, the controls are not as polished as in 3089 or 5089 from what I've experienced, though I don't fly much, because I usually crash.While the visuals for 3079 aren't much to look at, they really drive home the rather alienating and surreal atmosphere, and the voxel-based environments allow for destructible environments and terrain, akin to Minecraft and the like.I have yet to blow holes in buildings, but I've certainly dug a few holes with high-powered explosives, something I have not done in 3089 or 5089.This game is best described as ""Minecraft meets Stalker in a galaxy far far away"", but that might be stretching it a bit.

I really love phr00t's games. His other games 3089, 4089, 5089 and Gentrieve 2 are amazing!But I can't get used to the look of this one, the blocks, the incredibly, incredibly ugly and childish looking creatures.I am sure the gameplay contains a lot of fun elements you can find in the later games, too. But 3079 is the only game from the series so far that didn't convince me at all. Thus, I can not recommend it. It feels.. unrefined.That said, make sure you get 3089 and 5089. If you like those, go get 4089, too. And if you want to get a feel for his kind of games, you can grab Gentrieve 2 at IndieGameStand FOR FREE.			"

												This game isn't very good despite the popularity. The reason being is that the multiplayer function doesn't work (for me at least). I bought this so me and my friend can play, yet despite typing in the ip multiple times it still hasn't worked.The game drops you in with no explanation, controls, or anything. Example: I haven't beaten the first mission yet, (which I think is kill a demon king from the info I collected, I still don't know yet) because the game doesn't give me any feedback at all where to go, so I have to wander around the big world aimlessly until I find it.Pros:+Good Music+Good Gun System+Good GameplayCons:-No Explaination-Overdone Concept-Empty World-Bad MiniMapIt's Probably better with multiplayer if you can figure out how to work it, but I give this game a... 5/10COULD'VE BEEN BETTER			"

												3079 feels a bit like it's trying really hard to find a niche. The game has a lot of replayability and a campy feel to its visuals, setting and even missions.The thing stopping me from playing more of the game though, is its lack of instruction. I couldn't find any weapons so was unable to do any missions. I'm sure I'm stupid and there's some easy way to figure things out, but I wasn't hooked in enough to keep trying.The coolest thing I saw in the game was the random NPCs wandering around the world, fighting each other in unscripted mayhem. It felt weird, in an awesome way, to be standing so close to these different armies at war with themselves almost completely unaware of me.I do not think I will be playing 3079 again any time soon. Though it might be fun multiplayer with some friends that know what they are doing! "

												WOW this game is something else. The best way to describe this game is a girl that is everything you like in a girl both looks and personality. But therre is one downfall she is moody and is a pain to deal with but when you get past the bad it is amazing fun but with frustration. When first starting this game you are a level 1 in every sense. No weapons,weak,poor, cant complete quests right away,etc. But when you level up and are able to finish your first quest and get some money and loot you will become more powerful. Eventually you will do a quest that offers a demon smiter. Now you can finally kill those unfair ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and continue the story. After killing more demons and completing more quests you will become even stronger and able to explore now. At this point the game is beyond amazing but you are not invincible. Cheap deaths will happen still or demons will get you when you have low hp so keep that in mind. This game is just ♥♥♥♥ing amazing if you can make it through the brutal begining the game opens up to one of the most refreshing action rpg's I have ever played.			"

												I got this game with Indie Royale Alpha Bundle #1 (Along with Wyv & Keep and Towns) and I didn't swap it to Steam until yesterday - but this game is awesome. Anyone can pick it up and play and enjoy it somehow - RPG fans, sandbox fans, or shooter fans. This game gives you options of base building like a sandbox game, but surrounds you constantly with enemies and gives the weapons to fight them. While it is worth the money, it usually goes on big sales (as of writing this review, it is on sale for $0.49!) so I would wait for that.			"

												I do not advise buying this game.  The game itself is very simple.  The only 'Quests' that you can find in game are related to the main story and help you beat the game.  There are no side quests or missions that allow you to really explore or do anything else besides hunt demons.  I was able to beat the game in a little over 2 hours......  It is overly simplistic and does not offer much variety. The game is not worth paying money for.			"

												I would recommend this game a thousand times over if I could. The reason this game is good is because of the unique style. The easiest way to explain this is that this game is a mix of Minecraft's terrain and characters, and the battles and random generation from Call of duty (Battles) and the random generation of Spelunky. I hope many people support this game, and the TWO other games being updated and made at this moment.			"

												This initially appears to be a minecraft ripoff because it basically is.   There's a few notable differences in gameplay and theme, but the guts of what's going on here is still deep in minecraft territory.While Minecraft is a notable success in part because of it being part of the now flooded survival genre, 3079 eschews survival for a more traditional RPG which, if it was any other game, might have worked out well.Gameplay: You generally have to figure out the game yourself or watch youtube videos/walkthroughs to get started on questing.  The plot is hammy and slapped together and none of it really makes a lot of sense.  Thematically it just misses every mark and fails to hook you into the RPG side of things.  You do collect a bunch of different items and instead of wandering around in procedurally generated hell, you run around in half finished lazy developer hell. Graphics: Terrible... the game does run in 4K but it's still very amateur.   Minecraft mods show that voxel based games don't have to look ugly, so the ugliness here is because the developer was lazy, unskilled, or deliberately wanted to make the game look bad.  What sticks out even if you want to humor the developer being ""artsy"" is poor design language - some textures are great (so probably stolen from someone) and others are hideous.   Fonts and interface styling is all over the place.Technical - controls are clunky, but it does work okay with mouse and keyboard.  Graphics options are limited, which is a shame because that would have been some easy marks for the developer to try hide his lazy effort on the quality of the artwork.Just buy Minecraft and mod it if you want a voxel game.  Play Ark if you want a survival game.  Play Skyrim if you want an RPG.   Those are just examples - there's so many games better than this.			"

												This game isn't terrible, but its not much fun most of the time either. The ""quests"" consist of finding an NPC with a star on his belly who will pay for tasks to be competed. These tasks are totally inconsequential for the most part and have no bearing on anything short of getting more loot and money. Its a rendomly generated grind fest as you're constantly on the hunt for better loot as your sole purpose (not to have and adventure or anything, just loot, loot, kill, kill) It feels unpolished in many areas and the buildings are outright boring on the inside.

												""I felt everything was very clunky and nothing was exciting to see or do.""This game is definitely unique, when I first saw it I was really tempted to buy it, so it came on steam a year or two later and I had to give it a go. I'm sad to say unfortunately i wasn't particularly blown away, I got through to the end of the story, and I really wasn't interested in the game anymore. I didn't like the graphics, i felt they were just patchy and weird. I found the combat, maybe a little different because of the gun variety, but still to be a bit floaty and not so riveting.Don't get me wrong, i never really cared about negative things, since they aren't as bad in this game, i felt it just didn't have anything really positive. Its a mediocore game that was slightly dull and a few strange decisions within the art style and gameplay. I felt everything was very clunky and nothing was exciting to see or do. I found the building capture missions quite clever and the stealth system doesn't exactly suck, just as said before, not to exciting.I hope in the future the developers learn from their mistakes and make something more fun. I felt they tried to keep everyone happy and doing so dulling out their game.

THE ORIGINAL REVIEW CAN BE FOUND BELOW vvv.3079 -- Block Action RPG is an RPG in space. It is a voxel-based game as well. While the graphics style is almost alike, the two games (Minecraft and 3079) are significantly different. In my first review, I hadn't had the capability to play really any of the game, but once I upgraded my entire computer, I realize the framerate issue i had was simply my original graphics card. At this point, one of the only complaints I have with 3079 is the gunplay. The starting pistol is next to useless, and its inaccurate as all hell. There are no iron-down sights, but I don't feel the game would benefit from it anyway. Now that 3089 has been released, I think complaining about this is pointless anyway, just avoid all enemies.I still can't recommend this game. Even after playing at a stable framerate, I still didn't quite understand what I was intended to do. The ""storyline"" isn't specific enough, it's too broad and it honestly doesn't tell you much. Tell you what, if you enjoy games that are just a f!ck all shoot-em-up, by all means, buy this game. But if you're looking for an experience, an in-depth storyline with lovable characters and great gameplay, I'd sooner recommend Postal 2.Final scoring:Storyline: 5/10Gameplay: 3/10Replayability: 6/10Creatveness: 9/10oh yeah, about the price. One of the comments said I shouldn't be telling a dev how much to charge for a game. They were right, I shouldn't be. I've had plenty of failed Kickstarters and failed Greenlight projects, so I understand the frustration of someone telling you your hard work isn't worht what they thought. I apologize for saying what the price should be, $7 is a good price if you're into games like this.ORIGINAL REVIEW:::::Let's all be honest here. This game, like Ace of Spades or Guncraft, looks exactly like Minecraft. Difference between Guncraft and this game is that the theme/idea is executed a whole lot better in Guncraft than in this game.Let me give you in introduction to this game. You are an astronaut (I believe) who spawns in the game roaming through space. You're told by an unknown ""commander"" to reach a base. Naturally, you land on a planet and think things out for a few minutes, because there's NOTHING ELSE IN SIGHT. You're told to avoid evil red creatures, but if they catch you, you (obviously) die.There's an introduction. That's all I got out of it. When you die, you go to an unknown place. Not just any unknown place, a laggy unknown place. On low graphics, I got maybe 15 FPS at best. I get better FPS when playing Borderlands 2, and I don't play that much because it's too laggy. Let me ask you this. Based on the infromation I gave you, do you really want this game? When I first bought it, it wasn't in Early Access, so I figured the game must have been finished enough to play. But I was sadly mistaken, I seemed to have wasted $7 on a perfectly useless game. Once I left the laggy unknown place... oh wait, you can't! When I died, my jetpack was taken away.Overall, 2/10, 15/100, 47/1000, 127/10,000, etcI get what Phr00t is trying to do. Don't get me wrong, an open world block shooter game is a great idea, but it needs to be executed in such a way that is doesn't cause lag, and so that the storyline can somewaht make sense. Also, this game was made using Java. A game made by a free software, and he's charging $7. To be honest, you should only pay maybe $3 for this.			"

												The game is fun to play only if you know how to. I recently got this game, and I tried to assasinate people in the village, only making me acqiure a reputation as an enemy. It's hard to get through this game as an unexperienced player, because conserving build points it so easy. I really dont like the whole build point idea, because if you dont know how to get them, your doomed to your constant death if you waste them.			"

												This game is bad. Really REALLY bad. It is not fun, it is boring. You run around fighting block monsters and collecting their weapons and the wooden crates on the ground. Eventually you will find a tool that lets you build a house, but there is no reason to do that as far as I can tell.Graphics: Laughably bad.Gameplay: Awful attempt at a Minecraft clone, but with guns.Music: DecentThe only redeeming feature I have found so far is that I haven't found any bugs. The game definitely works, it just is not good. The longer I played this game, the more I kept asking myself these questions:How did this game get on Steam?How did this game get Greenlighted? Does this really qualify to be called a game? (Yes, but just barely)Do not touch this game.			"

												This game, while an excellent idea, fails in its delivery. While playing I found myself consistently frustrated at tasks that were nearly impossible to complete (due to the fact that everything, missions and terrain, are procedurally generated). The controls are fairly hard to get used to (especially in the aircraft), and the only tutorial is a screen with control mappings. Because the game is significantly different than most other games out there, a fully realized tutorial would be immensely helpful.While there were parts of the game I really enjoyed, I thought some serious polish was still needed to be playable in the long term. I will certainly try out the sequel (3089) and see if they've polished these issues, as the concept is quite excellent.			"

												This game is both metaphorically and literally, a large♥♥♥♥♥♥of content, jumbled into a chaotic mess for the sake of calling it creation and art. While it clearly borrows assets from other games, it also fails to establish any of its own. Between spending time on finding how to control the game, and then playing the damn thing, you've already sunk several hours into a game not worth playing. Once you've got to the deepest depths of the game, you feel as if you've only scratched the surface. 1.5/10 I do  not reccomend this unsatisfying pile of crap advertised as a game.			"

												I founf 3079 to be more of an exercise in frustration than an RPG. The idea is interesting. The system seems well thought out. Yet, the insane difficulty is a complete turnoff for me. 2 hours of trial and error and I finally got to the surface with all my gear (which I don't think was supposed to happen). But that's okay because it still didn't matter. It didn't matter which quest I took, I inevitately failed miserably, each death resulted in one less item and soon I was essentially defenseless. The final straw was a mission to sneek out and retrieve something without being seen. So I turned on my camoflauge (slow movement) and crept to the area. As far as I could tell there was nothing nearby it should be a cakewalk. I ended being blown up by ??? I don't know there was nothing there! I wasn't spotted (which would have ended the mission) before hand, I was just dead. But of course death ended the mission. This follows a series of equally inane and frustrating mishaps where I found myself slaughtered and useless over and over and over again. If I wanted insane difficulty I would play a rouge-like, but even then there is a sense of progress - not here.			"

												Saw this game on sale, and thought it looked pretty neat. Me and my dad bought copies, as we were looking for something to play. First Start up. Boom crash. Next start up, world doesnt load. Horrible first impressions. Then I get in the game. It looks really neat...And im just in the air. I spend 10 minutes looking for what to do, then i see the box on the bottom, with the worst story telling ive ever seen in my life. So i finally get down to the surface ( after dying against my will to the games coding ). *HQ are you there?*     20 seconds later   *HQ!*  ( where have we heard this before? EVERY SPACE MOVIE EVER) So my dad says to me, I spawned in a house. So, we spend the next 15 minutes looking for eachother as the map has no indication of where you and your ally are. We finally get in to the gameplay! We both get guns, and start to look for a quest. Finally, we find a quest giver ""Find a demon slayer and kill 2 demons"" ....what? -_-. After a timed quest of looking for said "" demon slayer "" We quit. a good 30 minutes of pure 3079. What is pure 3079 you ask? Utter crap. 0/10 "

												A good game to play every once in a while.Good things:-Lots of equipment options allow you to pick your stats and play the way you want.-A fair difficulty. You'll probably die 1 or 2 times at level 1 but once you figured out how to get gear you can take on enemies that are 2 levels higher without to much of a problem.-Many playstyles available. You want to be a thief? No problem. You want to fight with guns? No problem. You want to rush to enemies that are 100m away in 2 seconds and kill them with your sword? Good luck but no problem.-The ability to place your own blocks. You can build your own house, storage and place several blocks that are both helpful in your home and on the field as long as you have the ingame money to afford that playstye.Bad things:-Horrible ai pathing. Don't expect the ai to be any good. You can yell at an ai when there is a straight path to you and they will still have difficulty reaching you. The movement of the ai is pretty much random making it difficult to aim. In general the enemy's make for easy targets while friendly's are mostly useless.-Boring graphics. Even when it comes to block based games the graphics are not impressive. They are not bad enough to ruin the immersion but they definetely don't help it a lot.-Very few options to customize your house. You have 2 types of building blocks, 1 type of door block and the only options other than that are home blocks and storage blocks. The only reason to actually build a house is to get protection from the demons but you might as well set up in an existing building.-Many types of humanoids and neanders should just not be in the game. Many of them are way to big to do anything other than be a target or shoot a target. While there also are clearly jetpacks for sale there are only 2 types of neanders and humanoids when it comes to movement. The floating ones and the ones that never leave the ground.-The map is pretty much useless. You can only set 1 waypoint at a time which gets removed when you reach it. Meaning that you basically have to write down coordinates if you're building more than 1 house or find something interesting. And even with the coordinates you're looking for a while because they only indicate a big area and not a single location.My conclussion: It's a nice game to spend a few hours on every now and then but don't expect to play it for many days in a row. There are plenty of better games that you can buy for this price. Only buy this game when you have a few hours to waste and can't find a more interesting game to buy.			"

												I found that you really learn the game after putting effort and enjoying the game for more than a day or 3-4 hours you begin to truly feel the game. When you explore theres more to explore and where I'm currently at feels like some high level mountains all high level stuff. Yet still a long way to go for the leveling on my gears and such. I honestly say you should try it for how much it's worth is awesome. I think what you really need to know the only lacking for this game that MIGHT feel lacked is the way the npcs look from super sized and small, it could be more better and then with a nice improved normal sized npcs then it may look more improved. As I worry that people don't take the game because it's a decent fun cheap game but the npcs looks obvious to some people that it's ""urghh.."" I hope you understand what I mean but umm besides that, it is an epic game. Play it for a week or so and keep trying to try harder and lvl higher and so on. I personally think you should play this for a while then play the newer version.			"

												3079 - Block Action RPG is open world RPG game. It is not a game that has a good graphics, but it has fun and enjoyable gameplay. Your main mission is to kill the demons. To do that you need to gear yourself up with suitable armor and weapons. All the stuff you need can be obtained by killing enemies, doing quests or you can also buy most of the stuff from storekeepers. What more you could ask for ? I can't say it is a good game, it's pretty mediocre, but it's worth playing for few hours just to keep yourself entertained.			"

												A really janky game that is largely randomly-generated, repetitive MMO-style quests and which is more frustrating than it is fun.  The feeling of improving gear and stats is undermined by a harsh penalty system and encounters that last too short to really apply much strategy towards (including the ""Block Action"" portion of the game).  The dev seems nice enough, and the sequel sounds like it's been improved upon, but this one is not really worth the headache. If you insist, try to find a tutorial first.			"

												Ein Action-RPG, angesiedelt in der fernen Zukunft. Der Spieler strandet auf einem hart umkämpften Planeten, wo er den freundlichen Humoids in ihrem Krieg gegen die Neanders und böse Dämonen zur Seite steht, sowohl zu Lande, als auch in der Luft. Die auf Voxel basierende Grafik ist stark von Minecraft inspiriert und dementsprechend besteht die Landschaft aus Blöcken und ist extrem verpixelt. Ebenso können manche Blöcke zerstört und neue Blöcke oder auch Fahrstühle und bewaffnete Türme mit dem entsprechenden Werkzeug gesetzt werden, allerdings nur in begrenztem Maß, ist das Werkzeug aufgebraucht muss ein neues her. Das Spielprinzip erinnert stark an Titel wie Borderlands: Es gilt dutzende Items zu sammeln, darunter verschiedene Arten von Schilden, Medikits und Radars sowie diverse Arten von Waffen, wobei manche wie bei Borderlands durch zusätzliche Effekte entweder mehr Schaden austeilen oder dem Spieler z.B. durch schnellere Energieaufladung helfen. Auch das Levelsystem erinnert an Borderlands. Die Waffen verbrauchen keine Munition, sondern Energie. Je stärker die Waffe, desto mehr Energie wird pro Schuss verbraucht. Ist der Energiebalken leer, muss einen Moment gewartet werden, bis er sich ausreichend aufgeladen hat. Dem kann der Spieler durch das Sammeln und Aktivieren von Generatoren und Batterien entgegenkommen. Seine Aufträge erhält der Spieler von den sogenannten ""Leaders"" der Humoids, welche mit einem Stern markiert sind. Überschüssige Items können bei den mit einem Dollar-Zeichen markierten ""Merchants"" gegen Credits, die Spielwährung, verkauft werden. So findet man sich ratzfatz in einem absoluten Sammelwahn wieder, immer auf der Jagd nach noch besseren und schlagkräftigeren Items.FAZIT: Man erhält hier viel Spaß für wenig Geld und Festplattenplatz. Für Fans von Minecraft und (vorallem!) Borderlands ist dieser Titel definitiv einen Blick wert! Vorallem aber auch, weil es durch sein Oldschool-Spielprinzip und die verpixelte Grafik an die guten alten Zeiten erinnert, als ein Spieler nicht nur kurz in Deckung gehen musste, um sich zu erholen.

It's like being thrown into an alien world with a bit of equipment and a bit of intel and basically trying to figure out what the hell is going on. There appears to be some sort of war and some quests and stuff too... Plus it plays like a ""sub-standard"" minecraft clone(IMO)but it's not terrible by any means, I enjoyed being able to build and dig. All in all this game gets a 7/10 in my books but if you need lots of ""handholding"" to enjoy a game this isn't for you. I think it's a good game for the price... Oh and I got it on sale for like $2, but it's easily worth $3.50 =)			"

												Voxel graphics, pretty nice art (I'd call it old-school-alike), quests, items... This game is pretty good! Even though it's written in java - it's worth to play it (game seems pretty optimized).WARNING! It's nothing like Minecraft! It doesn't have anything to do with it! It's a diffrent, original game!

												Updated ReviewThe first time I played this game, it seemed interesting and quirky. I got some gear and a quest to bring an item to another NPC. To do so I had to shoot the NPC just so he'd come low enough for me to give him the item, as he was a flying guard. I should have known that this would be one of the less aggrivating parts of this game.I started a new game and played for about half an hour. During this time I died five times. I never completed a single quest, and so I made no progress whatsoever. I would explore the different buildings, breaking wooden crates to sell the material right back to the vendors in the same buildings. I would finally have enough to buy an item or two, or sometimes found items while exploring, but none of them seemed to make a difference.The quests I tried to complete are as follows.""Destroy the capital ship."" The small pistol I had bought seemed to have no effect until I got close enough for the ship to open fire on me and reduce me to a fine red paste.""Protect this Humoid for X seconds."" I made it over to the target fine, and things seemed to be all right. Until a hostile flying ship flew over and hammered him into the ground before I could even pull my weapon out. And then it killed me.""Kill X Neanders in X seconds."" This wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't standing in the middle of the Humoid city, and there's no sprint mechanic. With a little abuse of the grapling hook, I was able to quickly hop the nearest wall and went to fight a Neander. This one, the only one in the area, happened to be considered a 'giant' and so was doing ridiculous damage to me. I had previously lost my pistol to a death, so all I had on me was my melee sword.The only time I maybe killed an enemy? When I was on one of the floating buildings, apparently owned by Neanders, and used stealth to hit a guy. The knockback tossing him off the edge of the platform; I have no idea if he actually died or not, because a shopkeeper in the same building quickly killed me again.I'm sure the game might be worth $6.99 to some people, but it's just too tough for me, and I played on the 'normal' difficulty. After the time spent to make zero progress today, though, I don't really see myself playing it again. All in all this game seems like an interesting idea, but it feels like the ideas they put forth - RPG elements, material harvesting and crafting, science fiction storyline - are all handled much better in other games.

												I tried... I swear I tried (my play time is 4 hours on Steam but I played the DRM-free version too before it got on Steam)...But I'm probably missing something since I find no fun in this game. Shooting isn't fun, except when you're in a vehicle When you die, you lose one of your items, randomly. If you lose your radar you're basically f**cked Everything looks the same and it's not a pretty game I never know what I'm supposed to do and the missions are generic and no funMaybe you'll like this game but I can't recommend enough to try it before spending any money on it.

												If you want a flashy game with the best graphics, one with a linear storyline which guides you by the hand the entire way, look elsewhere. If you enjoy open ended games with tons of replayability you have found a great game. First off I just want to preface this review with saying that I am fascinated with procedural generation in games. The univerese is a unpredictable place with random chance occurrences happening everywhere. It is unpredictability which makes life so diverse and interesing. In this game all chatacters, weapons and the world itself are randomly or procedurally generated. This creates a unique experience everytime you play. It also creates hilarious moments where unexpected things happen. Procedural or random generation is a two sided sword. Because of the random generation, the game experience is not always balanced. Sometimes you will get your *ss handed to you by powerful enemies, sometimes you will find a item which gives you an enormous advantage. The random god giveth and the random god taketh away. I think a good way to judge a game is similar to judging good music. Does it make you experience emotion? In 3079 you will experience every emotion in the spectrum. Happiness when you take out a huge enemy capital ship or find a very good unique weapon. Anger when you see a demon hacking up your fellow humoids, Fear when a demon is pulling you in and you don't have a demon smiter sword and you are over your weight limit on your grappling hook, Exiliration as you fly from mountaintop to mountaintop with a combination of grappling hook and antigravity pack. Pride when you build a inpenetrable underground fortress or capture an enemy building and see your fellow humoids come to inhabit it. My suggestion is to not rush through the game and see how fast you can beat it but to take the time to learn the different styles of gameplay and explore the emmense world created for you.This game is very underated. Most of the bad reviews are from people don't have the patience to learn how to play. You have to be selective in choosing your gear in this game by paying attention to the stats as they vary dramatically. If you just run out into the world with out a strategy you will be slaughtered just like the people who give up after 20 minutes of playing on many of the let's play videos on youtube.			"

												3079 -- Block Action RPG is an interesting title.  First off, I don't know if I would call it a role-playing game at all, it's more of an adventure FPS that has quests, equipable items, and skill increases...well, maybe that's enough to be an RPG.  Either way, the engine and music in this game are very good.  It's a very fun, sandboxy experience; however, as far as it being a game goes, it needs some work.  The game is in desperate need of a tutorial, and it takes quite a lot of trial and error to figure out what you're supposed to do.  Even after reading all the help menus and tips it took me three new game instances before I figured out to go into my inventory and turn of my jetpack to land instead of flying around aimlessly until I got killed by demons.  The quests are also recycled a lot and it's pretty difficult to get anything done without dying.That said, if we don't look at this title as a game and instead look at it as a sandbox engine and tech demo I'm pretty impressed.  As stated above the music is *really* nice, and it's fun to play around in the engine for an hour or so (the grappling hook is my favorite).  There's also a boatload of settings to go through (anti-aliasing, field of view, completely customizable controls - always a big bonus!) and a pretty simple multiplayer feature that hosts a local server with the basic game client.Although I'd pass on recommending this game (unless you're looking for a well put-together sandbox game engine) I'm impressed with what the developer has created so far and am looking forward to future, more gameplay polished releases.

												This is still my favorite game by Phr00t - it's like a massive game of Tribes with destructable terrain and crafting!You start out landing on the planet, completely neutral and you can work build influence with one side or the other, and there are ships and demons that attack everybody.You can mine and build, but the best part IMHO about the blocky terrain is that it is destructable: it's neat watching battlefields get torn up as the munitions start flying.Complete missions and recruit followers, jump in and play online. It's a little goofy looking, but this is a solid action/RPG.If the graphics turn you off - it's big brother 3089 plays much the same with more modern graphics. They're both good!			"

												Intresting but repetitive, you will spend most of the game finding merchants to upgrade your gear, then getting repetitive escort, retrieval or assassin contracts, get the money and reputation to unlock more contracts, rinse and repeat, the game doesn't use the block building mechanic enough to justify its graphical design as bases are relatively useless to the player outside of your home and fortifications and guards aren't useable so you will end up going outside to fight them anyway, the factions are virtually identcal to one another with almost no variation, enemis range from ships, big enemies and little enemies, thats it, the enemy size only determines health and hitbox and ships you might as well avoid since they drop nothing of import, the game feels bland as level design is very generic space world, only the skys hold anyreal intresting items like the daemons, all in all give it a miss, there are plenty of Block based games with more intresting concepts than this and the fan faveourite minecraft probably has a mod that can recreate whats found here, even if its on sale it will most likely end up never being played for more than an hour, don't bother with it			"

												It's a great game and all, but honestly, there's not much to it. Shoot monsters, build shelter, that's pretty much it. Just survive. Not much TO surviving though.I liked this game to start with, but now it's kinda just driving me up a wall.3/10, should update things again. This is a great game, with not a lot to it. Thanks for making it, though! It was pretty fun while it lasted.Update: Ok, it's 2017. I mean.... IRL... not in the game. Anywho, I have played it again, and it seems I was wrong. There IS more to surviving. What I also figured out? Not everyone's mean. XDYou can take on quests, buy/sell stoof, put on armor, take off armor, activate crap, and a ton more things I never knew you could do!8.5/10, I'm sorry I gave such a crap review. I didn't know that there was more to the game, and so to the developers, I am genuinely sorry. I didn't know you could do all that. Thx, and stay happy! :D			"

												I like the game's progression in items, stats, and just about everything with how it's generated and plays. The only few issues I had in the past was the game being way too dark at night, and the netcode being pretty poopy so co-op wasn't as awesome as it could have been. All in all, I enjoyed this game, and hope that future games by Phr00t will have similar character progression based around doing activities related to the stat/skill instead of spending skill points like in the later games I've seen so far.
