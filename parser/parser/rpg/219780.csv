												Divinity 2 is a game where you can (at will) turn into a dragon, attack a flying fortress & its army of dragon riders, land on the courtyard, kill the guards with a mix of sword fighting and destructive spells, subdue the fortress’s commander and then read its mind to know his deepest secrets. All this 100% gameplay, no cutscenes involved. It has to be the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ best RPG ever made by man, right?Sadly, not quite. Larian Studios was held back by time constrains, lack of resources and, worst of all, the focus on consoles and their limited hardware. While the game overflows with original ideas and Larian’s usual clever writing, the execution doesn’t deliver. It’s not a bad game by any measure; the gameplay is good, some quests are creative (and funny) to do, and it succeeds in giving players interesting mechanics to play with (like mind-reading). But sadly it lacks that “special something” in its execution, making the game somewhat repetitive and mediocre by the end. Still, is a great game that’s not afraid to break the mold and bring something new to the table. "

												I can very much recommend this game to action RPG fans, and it is worth even its regular price tag; even better with a sale.+Graphics are excellent for  the most part+Writing and voice acting both very well done, story lengthy and in-depth+Fully voiced dialogue+Dragon powers like mind reading and transforming into a dragon+Controls are fluid and intuitive+Several skill trees and attributes to advance along as you choose+Variety of regular and magic/rare equipment and weapons+Choose your own rewards after quests such as XP, gold, or items+Playstyles suited for melee, ranged, or magic combat-Some limitations on dragon powers (mind reading costs XP, dragon can't fight ground enemies)-Some battles feel overly difficult and will frustrate some players away-Quest tracker is of minimal use-Aiming/highlighting can be off at times			"

												Solid 3rd person RPG.  A little older, and it shows, but hardly a pixelated nightmare and it's still entertaining.  Lots of side quests, accomplishments, and so forth.  Helpful maps and (mostly helpful) journal.  Initial character setup is non-binding as you can change your name, appearance, and respec your skills within the game.   Loot is varied and reminiscent of Diablo-style randomization.  You can't craft, yourself, but you can direct others to do so and so customize your armor and weapons and potion loadout.  Quicksave, which I don't normally use, is very convenient here.  The developers made some interesting choices to ensure that you are not an overwhelmingly powerful dragon that can easily obliterate your puny human foes.   In the main game I found that my dragon form missions were not all that difficult.  The expansion, however, made up for that with a much more challenging ""escort mission"" battle sequence.  Flying as a dragon was...  well, comfortable, but unrealistic.  Hovering and circle-strafing seems almost magical!  :)  There is some platforming required to complete the game, but it's minimal.  Very little to no issues with responsiveness of your character, getting stuck, etc.  No camera control at all, which was occasionally annoying but not really needed; they did a good job with the automatic camera.

												Divinity II Ego Draconis and Divinity II Flames of Vengeance comprise Divinity II: Developer's Cut.  The former the original and the latter the expansion.   Depending on how you play the length of the entire production can easily extend past 100 hours. To start, customization was a disappointment.  Selection is limited to a male and female model with appropriate sound samples from which to pick.  Want to sound like a noble or a soldier then Larian has made that happen.  What Larian did not make happen was allow me to choose an avatar in my chosen image.  The hair and beard and color of both can be chosen but only female or male and human at that.  The game has goblins, why can't the player be a goblin?  Once my disappointment over the customization screen had dissipated it was time to immerse my self in the world of Riverlon.  Much like Risen, the player starts as a complete non descript.  In terms of the game's systems,  the player character might as well have been just expelled from the womb.   Barely any attributes or acquired skills make up your profile and depending on your skill level as a gamer and how you allocate your initial allocation of attribute and skill points, the game can be rather unforgiving.  Some would think challenging forcing a strategic approach, others may be put off.  I thought the former and welcomed the challenge eagerly building my character for the tasks ahead.  Im that context the game starts the player much like Risen or Gothic.As you progress in Divinity II you become more powerful and the game eventually will become easier.  Late in the base game there was a distinct lack of difficulty balancing by Larian.  While the game continued to be entertaining the lack of eventual difficultly was a serious issue.  While the game has multiple difficulty settings encompassing casual through nightmare, this wasn't enough.  An additional difficulty setting was needed or the skills needed to be toned down though the game does make you feel very powerful from a role playing perspective.  My opinion on difficulty may be more a product of playing as a pure Mage.  I cannot speak for Fighter, Ranger or playing a mixed class.  Also note that for a good portion of the base game the game was extremely challenging even on normal.  Divinity II is not on rails and you are free to explore areas outside of your capabilities. The player is free to allocate skills to any category.  Categories are broken down by Priest, Mage, Fighter, Ranger and general category to remain unnamed.  Want to be a Battle Mage, a Ranger Priest, no problem.  The elasticity of the skill system allows for such combinations with the only limitation being that the skills are level locked.   Divinity II tells the story of a budding Dragon Slayer who eventually is recruited to become a Dragon Knight and defacto a Dragon.  Morphing into a Dragon is cool and a significant divergence in game play.  Like the Dragon Knight, Dragon abilities can be allocated and strengthened through skill points.  Game-play as a Dragon will have you battling all sorts of flying beasts as well as entrenched land based weaponry.  At this point in the review if you are reading through the spoiler tag I want to point out that anyone who likes their flight controls inverted is in for a big surprise and for this Larian gets an F for failure and not caring about a portion of their fan base. Larian left out inverted flight for the dragon.  Thankfully we can send human beings into orbit and utilities exist to help correct this issue.  Using Xpadder I was able to setup a profile to control the Dragon on an Xbox 360 game controller and invert the flight controls in the process.  This meant playing the Knight with the keyboard and playing the Dragon with the game-pad.  A minor inconvenience but the PC version should of been patched as the Xbox version had inverted flight.Potions, Crafting, Botany and Gemstones all play significant roles.  Potions can be purchased though there is an alchemy system based on plants.  Potions are not limited to health and mana and include attribute based potions as well.  Potions interestingly have many level classifications with the strength of the potion increasing with the level.  Crafting is gem based and like alchemy, the ability to craft is available to every player character.   When you become a Dragon Knight you get your own Battle Tower and the tower has servants.  Servants of which you may weaponize and armor.  Servants that will collect gems and plants for you.  A welcome time saving feature implemented by Larian to keep game minutia to a minimum.Divinity II is a 2009 production and looks like it was made in 2009 though in some places the game visually shines but over all the game still looks good.  Voice acting is top notch and professional.  I was disappointed to see the re-use of npc models, a pet peeve of mine, though Larian did an adequate job covering up this sin and the issue didn't appear to be as egregious as Gothic 3.Combat was simply fun and skills utilized by the player are accessed via the standard 1 through 0 keys or can be reassigned to any key.  All game functions can be re-mapped including quick save.  Combat is as simple as swinging your weapon and using skills.  Blocking is non-existent and points can be put into the passive skills like evade.  The player can also roll out of harms way.The Developer's Cut allows the player to start the base game and expansion as originally released or in what amounts to a debug mode.  Both versions are save game compatible.   In the debug version, the console is accessed via F11 and you are free to do as you wish.  Want to give yourself an apple ?  You can do that.  Mostly I stayed out of the debug version though I will come clean so to speak and admit to pumping 5 points into encumbrance to satisfy my pack rat tendencies and because I'm no fan of dealing with limited inventories in action rpgs.  It bears to mention that the starting inventory limit can be managed without putting any points into encumbrance.Divinity II and expansion are worthy for multiple reasons.  Divinity II comprises originality, professional voice acting, great game-play, questing and a great soundtrack (accessible via install).  A top notch action RPG.			"

												tl;dr If you somewhat enjoyed Witcher games, Risen and Kingdom of Amalur, then you will appreciate this gem.===== Review =====Enchanting menu music promises an eventful and compelling journey. The game does not fail in that regard.= Audio 9/10 =Have I mentioned the intro music? Because you will find yourself sitting in the menu, not having the courage to stop the flow of mesmerizing chorus. While other in-game music is engaging as well, it is not always introduced seamlessly. Voice over is quite colourful and I'm yet to notice any repetitiveness. You will be yearning for the soothing sounds of nature and waterfalls however, but only your footsteps and void are around.= Story 9/10 =You better listen. Because it is very thorough, multisided and there will be a quiz... literally. This is my first divinity game, and the lore is astonishing and comparable to giants like Elder Scrolls and Witcher. The beginning does feel like continuation of a story, but you can get the whole picture from books and dialogues. Speaking of ...= Dialogues 10/10 =This needs to be an example for the nowadays writers. Mischievous, profound, logical and surprising. I have not enjoyed English like that since white man was a President (i.e long time ago).= Gameplay 8/10 =On insanity, you will hide behind trees and stones because someone will break your bones, you will run away like teenager from his first date, wriggle like a snake, jump as a cheetah. Most games get repetitive after couple weeks of playing, however in here, new game modes will be available, skill reset allows you to try out everything without having to start from beginning. Eventually you will get a teleport stone to access trainers and other NPCs.= Interface 9/10 =A game that was built for the PC. No silly checkpoints, radial menus, unnecessary limitations or vague descriptions.= Graphics 7/10 =It does look like another Asian online MMOsomethingsomethingRPG. But there is a reason for that, you will have a chance to checkout everything from the birds view. Com'on, tis from year 2009.===== Tips =====Skills. Don't worry too much. You will have the ability to reset em. I do recommend invest in Lockpicking. Simply can't stand the sight of an unopened chest. Do not waste anything on backpack room.Experience. Mobs do not respawn, but you get drastically more/less depending on enemy level. Skill books. First couple locations - first map has one, the first tavern, hanging on a chain separately from other hanging weapons.Save/reload ho. Before you kill an enemy, or before you come near to a chest, you can save/reload the game to get different loot. Cheap but oddly satisfying. Not sure if otherwise I would have been able to finish the first half on Insanity. Choices. Careful what you reap. If you agree to kill or raid someone, you could loose other potential quests from that person/area.Items. Sell all non-quest or skill books after you read em. Keep a rope for one quest. Keep only items that you are going to use, or disenchant. Sell useless potions. The only resource/gem worth saving is the malachite gem, because it will be easy to get unlimited amount later on.===== Final thoughts =====Despite its shortcomings, the game is very engaging and quite refreshing. Be warned however, it is very long.			"

												This is an excellent game, defnitely one of the best single player action RPGs out there. There is SO MUCH content, too! It's not an open world/sandbox game, but rather sets the player on a specific path with the option of doing many side quests. It's old school in that it often requires intution, guessing and puzzle solving on the part of the player. It doesn't hold your hand like some games do, but does point you in the right direction and leave you to find the secrets for yourself. What I like most about this game is that you have a completely open character build - you can put points in any tree at any time and create a hybrid class, though I find that picking a class and sticking with it is a highly effective playstyle. What sets Divinity II apart from many other games of its ilk is that you gain the ability to transform into a Dragon and fly through the game world. It is great fun to fly around the valley battling airborne foes and destroying enemy structures, then turning back into a human to enjoy the fast paced action/rpg combat. The game does have a handful of bugs and glitches that were never worked out. A handful of side quests are not possible to complete and others can accidentally be restarted, but it is not game-breaking. Given how good the rest of the game is, it is a minor issue at best. This is defintely an underappreciated gem and I strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys RPGs like Dragon Age, Mass Effect or Neverwinter Nights.			"

												This RPG is seriously like a underrated diamond in the RPG genre. In my opinion as a fan of the RPG-genre, Divinity II is a title that you should have played or tried for at least once.Story + NPCs: The story is kinda typical for a RPG with a medieval setting: Dragons, magic and war. The game itself focuses on exploring, completing quests and interacting with the huge number of NPCs.The NPCs are really well and realistic written and each one of them shows a kind of own personality with a background - which is for me - the most interesting part of the game. The dialogues also get accompanied by a really good voice acting. It's fun to read and listen to what the NPCs are saying. The humor in this game shouldn't be ignored too. What to say about the quests? The missing map-marker for target places makes them some kind of difficult and sometimes you have to choose the right option to finish a quest. But this doesn't have an influence on the story-line at all. (The worst thing that could happen is that you failed the quest and won't get a reward.)Sadly, the setting doesn't make you believe anything what the story is actually telling: The story-line brings you in a sunny forest at first - more like an idyll. Nothing there reminds you about the war, the dark magic and the possible end of the world. The monsters mostly appear like totally out-of-place.. After all - the story is pretty weak.Graphics + Technical aspect:I personally think: The graphics are beautiful. The animations appear fluent and everything has the right atmosphere to create that kind of feeling that brings you even more into the game. Well, the textures could have a better quality and the environment appears blurry.However. If you aren't the  ""ULTRA-4k-1080p-I-NEED-3-NVIDIA-780TIS-TO-BE-PLEASED-WITH-THE-GRAPHICS""-type of person, you won't be bothered by it.Ok, the character design could have been a little bit better like sometimes you get that feeling that all the soldiers were created in the same laboratory with the same genes (or everyone is just a product of incest). Technically, Divinity II reminds me of a game from the early 2000s due the fact that you got no auto-save - which is awful (When you die, you have to load an older savegame and start everything from the beginning). So there is a reason why I am already over 25 hours in the game and haven't finished the first part yet. Another point is the missing map-marker. That's just soooo out-of-date. Enjoyment:Well, it's obvious that I really enjoy the game. But not only for its atmosphere or its great-written dialogues - I love it because it's actually pretty damn hard. I have never found myself dying so often or restarting a level than in any other game. It's indeed a challenge, but not frustrating. (I haven't played Dark Souls yet pssssh)I got it for like 1 buck in a steam sale and I couldn't be happier. It's more worth than that! Pros:+ No rushing since all the monsters do not respawn+ Cheap (It's on sale during every big steam sale and you even get the key for like 2-5€ online due a humblebundle)+ High difficulty + Amazingly written dialogues + Interesting NPCs+ THE ATMOSPHERE + Choose your preferred reward (exp or gold) after a completed quest+ Cinematic cutscenesCons:- No Auto-Save (and even putting the 'auto-save' on a shortcut-key didn't work for me at all)- Blurry graphics and low-quality textures- Weak story- No multiplayer(English is not my first language and changes will follow after I got time to finish the game.)

												Divinity 2 is a massive fantasy RPG spanning a huge world and hours of your time. You play as a Dragon Slayer; a soldier of an order dedicated to wiping the last of the dragons off the face of the world. Early in the story, a wounded dragon mind-melds with you giving you the soul/powers of a dragon as well as a Dragon Slayer. You also learn of a much bigger threat facing the world previously only known to the dragons. Unfortunately, as a dragon you are now an enemy of your former order. With no allies you set off on an epic quest to save the world!Combat is set in third person with basic attacks coming from mouse clicks and spells/special moves triggered by the 1-8 keys. The style is similar to World of Warcraft and its ilk. Overall, it feels solid and satisfying and the animations are well executed. The other part of combat is in dragon form which plays more like a flight game. You mainly fight other flying enemies and ground anti-air defences by burning everything with fiery breath! Unfortunately, the dragon form feels much weaker than it should and could have been better.Character progression is your standard Diablo-style RPG; with stat points, skill trees and hundreds of pieces of randomly generated loot as well as sets and uniques. Further customization comes from enchanting, alchemy and necromancy (for your summons). There is lots to play around with and no two people will play it exactly the same.In closing, the game is well worth your time if you enjoy this kind of RPG and it should last you 100+ hours if you like to do lots of side quests and exploring.

												I bought this game after thoroughly enjoying Divinity: Original Sin. Do I love this game just as much as Original Sin? Definitely--and I love the developers for maintaining my faith in RPGs. Some plus points: + Questing. Minimal hand holding, quests that were actually fun and required you to be aware of what the characters tell you. There is some freedom of choice on how you want to complete them as well. + Exploration. The game rewards you for taking your time to explore the world. There are many secrets hidden around, whether on paper or in a locked cellar--to which the key you'd have to find using hints the game subtly gives you. + Wonderfully written dialogues and like able NPCs. I'm someone who enjoys games with characters that can make me feel for them. This game has no companions, but the NPCs are so quirky with their own individual personalities, it more than compensates.+ Music and voice acting. If you played Original Sin before this game as I did, you might hear some familiar tracks. I didn't mind, they're well done and really help keep you immersed. Voice acting was a joy to listen to. + Combat difficulty. Many modern RPGs I've played at normal difficulty are much too easy. I feel that Divinity 2 has done a good job at balancing. I had to make use of obstacles to avoid missile attacks, dodge and heal and not simply button mash mindlessly. Some negatives: - Camera angle during combat when using certain skills bugs out a little. - Not much character customization - Crafting and Enchanting are done through NPCs, oversimplified in my opinion. I loved the manual crafting system available in Original Sin. (Of course, Original Sin is newer.)Summary: Recommended for fans of story driven RPGs. Great for players who appreciate immersion and do not like too much hand-holding when it comes to questing and progression. Also great for those who love to explore and find secrets! Lastly, if you do decide to buy and play it, make sure you play the second part (Flames of Vengeance) that comes included in the Director's Cut as well! Happy Gaming :) I sure had a good time.			"

+Classless character building with various skills to choose from  +Fine graphics even on 2015 standards +Characters voice acting & gesture modelling +Fine comedy living in harmony with serious story +A lot of fighting but also some cool puzzle solving (even platforming) +Lifetime (50h+) +You can be a DRAGON!-Main Story could have been deeper -Occasional peaks in difficulty -Quest tracking takes time to get accustomed to Masterpiece! Divinity 2 Dragon Knight Saga is a great and high quality RPG game which haven't nearly reached the reputation it should deserve. The basic plot begins in a small village of Farglow. The main character is a potential freshman recruited by Dragon Slayers - a sect which primary objective is to kill remaining dragon morphing Dragon Knights who have lately  caused more destruction than usual for reason or another. However, through twists and turns protogonist receives the powers of a deadly wounded Dragon Knight thus ironically hunter becomes hunted. Following events reveal real threat who plans to destroy the whole game's world of Rivellon.Gameplay in Divinity 2 is great. Along with main quest player receives experience and rewards from sidequests, loots better equipment from enemy camps and dungeons, charms weapons, etc. The world of Rivellon is filled with nasty enemies like beholders, undead and goblins and it is best to be prepared for fight. As one should be prepared to use mind as well for some areas may have hidden treasures within and can be only accessed by solving a puzzle or finding a key from near.  While the fighting system is simple it's also addicting. Left click is primary strike and skills are used by pressing keyboard number buttons which are possible and advisable to be replaced in a right -  and thumb mouse buttons. There is no blocking - only some buffs granting bonuses in attack, defense or spellpower. In addition of buffs there is more than plenty of different active and passive talents to choose from. There is also 5 attributes like strenght and intelligence for an example. The character develeopment is ""classless"" so you can freely choose to build your character as warrior, archer, summoner, battlemage or something between. I recommend to pay attention for character building though because poorly set skills can cause problems later in a game. Fortunantly there is NPCs who can free already spent points for money.As I already mentioned protogonist may become Dragon Knight and this means that he or she is able to transform a dragon, which has its own set of skills and equipment. Con is that as a Dragon movement is limited and it's not possible to burn down enemies moving on foot - only flying hostiles and buildings. In a midway the protogonist claims control of the battle tower where various allies serve with different ways like brewing potions and fetching ingredients.By looking at the graphics it's hard to belive that the game is already over 5 years old. I found myself admiring the landscapes several times through playthrough. Voice acting including many european brogues and was mainly above moderate. I also noticed well placed gesture modeling during dialogues that made characters feel more alive.The adding ""Developer's Cut"" in titles name means that the entire game can be played in developer's mode allowing player to access few tools which are mainly insignificant. However, I found free skill setting helpful to decide which skills to choose and it also allows to reset spent skillpoints without cost.In conclusion Divinity 2 is really good RPG with really good value even if tagged with its normal price. It provides enjoyment for dozens of hours and while the main storyline threats to flatten in the end I was not dissapointed a bit. One of the best of its genre.			"

 Divinity II: Developer's Cut  is one of those older games that really surprised me. I could describe it as Skyrim's little brother who chose a not-so-open-world but more story driven style.I really didn't expect much of a game that I bought for 4,99€ but was this a surprise.TL;DR version. Old visuals, mediocre 'on foot' combat, but awesome dragon combat, somewhat good storyline, lore-heavy story, and again, dragon batles. Don't buy if you hate speaking but love beating because there is a lot of speaking involved.Oh and here are some numbers.  Category Rating   Graphics 7   Gameplay 7   Story 8   Dragons 10 First of all, I would like to say that the game is old and the visuals definitely show it. Somewhat washed out textures and pixelated shadows are noticable. Although, the lightning, motion blur effects and character armor models look pretty good. The dragon battle sequences is where the visuals really shine (literally).But honestly, who cares about graphics?If I could describe the game's genre, Journey RPG comes to mind.Whenever you kill some goblins, bandits or black ring soldiers, they are dead and they wont ever come back to life. In other words- the mobs in the game don't respawn (with DLC as an exception), which surprised me but it made sense as I went on. In fact, it's an important part of the game since it forces you to explore the game world. Also, as you progress through the story some areas become inaccessible which is why it's not fully open world.Speaking of exploration, the game is begging to be explored and will punish you if you don't. Meeting npc's and questing is an essential part of the game. There are no markers or pointers which point the player straight to the direction of the objective. Most of the time questing means solving a puzzle and there are a lot, and I mean a lot, of puzzles. When exploring, the player can get gems and ores for enchanting, plants for potion making, money for bartering and most the most important skill books, which give skill points.Let's get this out of the way, you'll become a dragon, that's half the reason why people buy this game ^^.Sadly, first ~10h of the game you'll be spending becoming a dragon, which is a good thing because it adds to the character development. Oh, and once you morph for the first time it feels amazing :).Dragon gameplay sequences are the most fun by far. Shooting fireballs, releasing novas and just burning the living hell out of anything that opposes you is just as fun as it sounds.On the other hand, 'on-foot' combat feels old and stiff. I've only played as a full build, classic warrior so I have no idea about archer or mage classes. Also, there are no definite classes, it is possible to make various hybrid classes as you are allowed to spend your skill points where ever you want.One of other important things is the verticality of the game. Using the dragon form to reach different heights to access caves, dungeons, abandoned houses etc. allows the game to feel like an open world. But it's semi-open world at best due to the reason listed above.One of most important aspects of this game is the humor. A lot of dialogue options are hilarious. The game sometimes doesn't take itself seriously and simply makes fun of itself.All in all, I only recommend the game to patient people, who can tolerate older graphics and who don't mind spending 50% of the game interacting with NPCs and the other 50% burning and, in general, laying waste to the black ring.

												This game is a hoot...'Divinity II: Developer's Cut' is a great game.  It is a fantastically fun game.  It's a wonderful romp of a game.  It is not, however, a roleplaying game.  'Planescape: Torment', this is not.  Sure, it wears the moniker of ""roleplaying game"", but it's a lie.  This is the sum of what you'd get if you mixed 'The Legend of Zelda' with 'Diablo':  an action / adventure game with some roleplaying elements.  It's a singleplayer 'World of Warcraft'.  By roleplaying elements I mean, of course, quests, stats and loot.  ""But it has character customization and skill specialization.  I can even choose how my voice sounds..."" you say.  Nope.  Sorry.  Roleplaying involves playing the role of a character as though you were that character and making choices that distinguish your playing of the game from, say, your neighbor's.  The game simply doesn't do that.  In an actual roleplaying game you'd be able to express in the dialogue your distaste for Thieves and Bandits, because you're a Goody Two-Shoes Paladin.  You'd be able to grumble at Elves, because you're a racist Dwarf.  Or you'd receive a clever dialogue option due to a high Intelligence stat.  What you get here in dialogue, generally, is a ""normal"" response and a ""funny response"".  Unless you're looking to roleplay as a Comedian, I don't think this cuts it.  Intelligence has no effect on dialogue options.  In fact, outside of the status of quest objectives, nothing does.  It's all very static.  Divinity II is really good at what it does.  Deep storytelling it surely isn't.  Sure, it has a backstory, in-game readables and a bit of a thin (and I mean thin), plot.  The game world itself is large enough, beautiful, and whimsical, but it rarely makes sense.  There's quite a bit of video game logic where the game world layout is concerned, particularly regarding layout and enemy encounters.  It is, sort of, free roam.  You have to be able to defeat the enemies in a given area to proceed, and if you can't, then you need to explore somewhere else for awhile.  In that sense, it's not entirely free roam - you have to have the goods to venture into new territory.  That said, due to enemy scaling, fighting higher level enemies yeilds considerably more experience.  At this point I should mention a factor in the game: mindreading.  You can read the minds of NPCs in the game during dialogue.  The benefits are sometimes great, sometimes mediocre, and sometimes there is no benefit beyond a bit of expositional text.  This is the one part of the game I absolutely hated, because mind-reading is confusing, in my opinion, and creates an experience debt.  So, say you have 3000 exp, for arguments sake, your next level up is at 6000 exp, and you just mindread someone for an experience debt of 1000 exp; you have to fulfill that experience debt of 1000 exp before you can proceed to gain experience towards the next level.  With that said, it's pretty vital to completing the game that you DO mindreads.  In fact, progress in some parts of the game can't be gained without it.  I've read of people who have mindread everyone in the game and been selective in other playthroughs and the comparative ends were negligible.  Take that for what you will.  In my own playthrough, I referred to a walkthrough/faq online whenever I encountered someone in the game.  I used the walkthrough only for the mindreads, because, as I said, I found the whole concept confusing and I didn't wanna fudge my game.Every character in this game is voiced.  Every dialogue in the game is spoken.  In fact, many parts of it includes narration, like when you're looking at objects or reading readables.  I think this is, not only uncommon, but also extremely well done here.  You will never hear dialogue spoken in the game and think, ""oh, that sounds awful, or cheesy, like they couldn't afford real actors"".  The voice-acting here is top-notch and there is so much dialogue in the game that it makes it all the more impressive, in my opinion. The game is hilarious.  It truly has a sense of humor.  Sure, it's facade is of this epic adventure, but there is so much humor in this game it's almost unbelievable.  There are parts that are just laugh-out-loud funny.  The humor is easily one of the motivators for my own determination to play it through to the end.  The graphics are beautiful.  I had no complaints in the visual department.  They obviously built the world very carefully and put alot of thought into it's design.  I only found a handful or so of geographical errors, which is pretty impressive given the scope of the game world.  Running around and exploring the game's world was always fun and rewarding.   The enemies are varied and plentiful.  The items to be found are also varied and plentiful.Here I should mention how much this game follows the Diablo vein of item-finding.  Most items found in most chest/barrels/whatever.... are randomized.  You can save/reload for a different find.  The same holds true for the quest and boss fight rewards.  It's to a very large degree randomized.  Always saving and reloading looking for better loot would certainly make for a considerably longer game though.  There are certain specific chests and rewards that are always going to yeild the same result, but it's mostly a dice roll.Like Diablo II the game has prefixed items and it also has set items.  On top of that some items come with enchantments and can also have charms placed on them.  So items will have varying numbers of enchantments and charms (between 0-3 of either) as well as static statistics.  So you might get a bow that does 21-43 damage, 2-5 magic damage and health regeneration of .023, as static statistics, but have an empty charm slot and two enchantments (say, additional 100 damage, +5 spirit).  Charm slots can only be filled once.  Item enchantment slots can be disenchanted and re-enchanted as often as is possible or needed.The game has no sense of morality.  You can rob good people blind.  There's even a chapter in the game where you get to choose who out of 4 of 8 people will live and serve you.  The other 4 die.  Why do they have to die?  Excellent question!  The game doesn't provide an answer.  In one of the more extreme examples there is a quest given to execute a man being held.  There is evidence to suggest he's innocent, but freeing him and aiding his escape yeilds no reward whatsoever, but executing him provides considerable reward.  In another, more comical situation, you come across vegetables that talk.  They were all people polymorphed by a witch.  You can restore them to their proper selves, or....  you can eat them.  Remember, you're supposed to be the ""hero"".The game has mucky controls.  It's clearly a game better suited for a gamepad, which isn't supported on PC.  The game is so much an action-oriented console-style ""rpg"" that it even has platforming tropes.  I kid you not.  There are several instances in the game where you have to be on your ""A"" game in order to succeed in a platforming task.  To make matters worse, the keyboard controls are not the most responsive.  So, prepare to be frustrated.At the end of the day, this is a great game that will definitely entertain.  It will also frustrate on occasion.  You might encounter a few bugs, as I did, that will test your patience and resolve (just try again or come back to it later), but I can definitely say this game is worth the time and the money.  It's not a game I'd be much interested in playing a second time through, but that's just me (I'm more of an RPG purist) and it's so worth playing at least once.			"

												A new gimmick is introduced: Mind Reading. You can spend some of your exp to read minds and find out various useful information, like passwords, locations of items or keys, or even get the illusive stat/skill point boosts.As well as turning into a dragon later in the game where you can pretend to be the pyro and do the W+M1 thing.Combat is in 3rd person, and only in 3rd person. It's like a more floaty Fable, or Enclave, or something, except you can't block, and you can only dodge and jump. You got your Melee, your Ranged, and your various melee, ranged, and magic active and passive abilities. Also speaking of 3rd person, like the previous games, theres plenty of items strewn about the world, as well as some hidden switches, but why they didn't put in any first person mode is beyond me, because your character's neck is really stiff, and you can only look down so much, and its a general pain to pick most stuff up in general, unless your looting a container, or those floaty item bags enemies sometimes drop.Thankfully, there isn't like 9 different stats to choose from on a level up like the last game. Instead, there's just 5. Although for some reason, instead of the traditional 5 stat points per level up, you only get 4 this time around. That kind of sucks.The game's difficulty is like a coin, on the first half, the game is hard and vaguely unforgiving, and on the other half, it's ♥♥♥♥ easy. Like any good RPG I suppose, the previous games did pretty much just that too, and until you get to the second half of the game, you will die many times, and when you die, the game does not respect your time, locks the controls, and shows your character twitching out and dying. So trying to go to the menu or quickloading in rage won't work until the game finally tells you the obvious: You've died, load a savegame. Although quarter way through the game you get access to the battle tower, a base instance of sorts where you can *finally* stash your items, increase your cap of certain skills from a trainer, as well as access to an alchemist, necromancer (managers your minion which you can then summon after you first enter the battle tower), and an enchanter. You can also send out 3 dudes out on an adventure to gather ingredients, ore, and gems for you. They can be equipped better for a fee to do it ""faster"", and reduce chance of injury. So finally, the game gives you a breather after you reach this damn tower. As with the other games, it prettymuch gets easier the further you are in the game. My strategy towards the end of the game was spin to win: Whirlwind spam, as its literally faster than my standard attacks maxed out and knocks everything within range flat on its ♥♥♥ or dead. Ahh, classic whirlwind spam. As well as using the not-omnislash move on enemies that must absolutely positively die, that's always fun, especially when it glitches out and plays a really corrupt version of a transformer transforming.The game progresses a bit similarly to the second game, and is roughly split up into 3 acts, once you're past an act, you can't go back. Each act has a fairly big overworld to explore and quest in and whatnot. Waypoints from the first game are back, except you don't need a scroll to activate them. You just approach them and use them, and you're off to an activated waypoint of your choosing. You can jump 4 inches in the air, then later 8 feet in the air, but why you can't sprint in this fairly vast world just brings my slightly impatient ♥♥♥♥ to a boil. Although you can get around pretty fast when you have access to your dragon form.Divinity as usual has it's sense of humor, and it's references. I always get a good laugh every now and then from certain dialogues.Divinity II uses the Gamebryo engine, roughly the same one that Oblivion used, so it runs slightly like garbage, although I've only had one crash in my nearly 50 hours of playing. So it's pretty stable, and it loads areas relatively fast. Let me tell you one thing though, it does not feel remotely like Oblivion, except for the somewhat dodgy framerate, some of the lighting, and those silly 2D sprite tree leaves. Although I did get a Morrowind vibe from the game treating herbs and ore veins like loot containers, although unlike MW, this game actually has a take all items hotkey (E), so you don't have to get hand cramp PTSD flashbacks.When physics objects like barrels roll around, they play some sort of ominous death beat on a pair of ghost bongos. I don't know either. It's kind of funny but also really disturbing....And like every good RPG, the merchants will rip you off blind, aka charge you 10,000 gold for that rusty old dagger thats been sitting up the merchant's bum for the past decade, and give you jack ♥♥♥♥ for that literal holy grail in your posession. You can mind read merchants to (usually) get them to lower their prices by like 5-10%, or some other minor amount. Doesn't seem to help with selling stuff to them though.A lot of things feel very finite, like herbs will never regenerate, and enemies don't seem to respawn, at least not until the last third of the game. This is what the previous games seemed to do, but it was mostly fine, because the previous games weren't ultra stingy with potions in the first third of the game, and merchants actually restocked. You'll find yourself stuffing your character with food consumables to save on potions early game.Let me remind you, like the other games' AI, enemies will relentlessly pursue you until you're at least a thousand feet away, or incredibly dead. So you have to deal with them, or somehow convince your character to get the lead out and run away for twelve hours anyway.Although the fairly finite resources thing is remedied after you get access to the 3 runners in the battle tower, in which you can send them out, return to the field, return to the tower, and they'll be back in an instance, hopefully not injured and ready to give you the stuff you asked them to find. So you can pretty much farm most of your alchemy/enchanting materials to your hearts content if you want, or you could avoid the serious cheese and just do it every now and then if you have a crippling fear of the game getting too easy.Speaking of cheap, the RNG containers are back. So you can once again save and load over and over until you get some good materials, or recipes, or equipment or whatever. One time I got 2 of the same exact potion recipe in the same chest. Neat.After I beat the game, I was like ""Oh boy, that was pretty decent, now time to take on a silly bonus campaign with my now overpowered character, Dragon Age style!"" Then I proceeded to click New Game - Flames of Vengeance, only to find out it was the last 3rd of the game overall. *facepalm*It's a pretty fun game and gets easier once you get the hang of it. Wish it could have been deeper and more indepth like the older games as well as being a bit more vast.			"

												Wow this game has the highest resolution textures i have ever seen used in a video game. At first it might not be noticable. But when you start making your way through the game and go inside some houses and dungeons. Its just like wow. Best surface texturing i have ever seen in my gaming life.Wow where has this game been hiding? I got it in a humble bundle of like 8 games all for a dollar. So i basically got this game for mere pennies and its given me $100 worth of entertainment. The graphics are sharp and the textures are extremely high resolution, the animations are incredible, and the voice acting is the best i have ever seen in any video game period. There is also really funny dialogue from some of the people you speak with along your journey.One female warrior commander said something along the lines of ""you can enter through the lower back door"" and one of the response choices was something like ""I thought you had more self respect than that commander""			"

												Roundhoused a hen, picked locks in front of owners, stole keys, took their stuff, made sassy remarks and no one cared, helped a blacksmith steal another man's wife then he gave me discounts.  10/10- will steal againThis game has a lot of content and I have found myself enjoying it so far. I tend to do more dodging than fighting, but I'm doing ninja flips so it's worth it. Some of the dialogue is really funny (I found it funny) and the combat is alright. You typically only have one attack button for melee and spells can be assigned to keys. There is more than one mode and it's really fun just to mess around. It runs smoothly on my laptop. Make sure to save where you want it to save. Autosave doesn't come 24/7.			"

												Divinity II has charm, I'll give it that. It has a beautifully realized fantasy universe, excellent writing with snappy dialogue, engaging characters, and a genre identity that seamlessly blends serious epic fantasy with satire and humor.Despite these wonderful marks in its favor, however, the game itself is rife with flaws. Divinity II is a hard game, but not in the satisfying or rewarding way that many other RPGs claim to be. The gameplay is typically uninteresting at best and painfully difficult at worst, thanks to many random and often nonsensical difficulty spikes. The story, while incredibly well-told, is still typical fantasy tripe involving the monster-hunter becoming the monster, an evil megalomaniacal sorceror, plot-twisting betrayals that can be seen from a mile away, and more McGuffins than you can shake a stick at.Transitioning between Dragon form and Human form is perhaps the worst offense that the game commits. While you can transform at will at almost any time, your enemies are tracked separately. Having trouble with a particularly tough pack of necromancers? Turn into a dragon and burn them to a crisp from above, you might say! Well, because of the way the game works, you can't. Those necromancers suddenly disappear along with every other enemy when you become a dragon, magically reappearing right in the same spot the moment you switch back to human form. This creates all sorts of other problems as well, like using dragon form to reach an otherwise impossible floating platform, only to be eviscerated by the sudden appearance of enemies as soon as you land. And don't get me started on how aggro is handled...Despite its flaws, I couldn't help but enjoy Divinity. I enjoyed creating my character out of every skill imaginable. This wasn't just a fireball-spewing demon-summoning plate-armored dual-wielding berserker, it was MY fireball-spewing demon-summoning plate-armored dual-wielding berserker. As painful as the transformation process was, I couldn't help but get a gleam in my eye and a smirk on my face as I soared through the skies in dragon mode while epic fantasy music blasted in the background. Divinity is a game that really wants you to like it. To be fair, it does fix most of its big issues by the second half of the game, Flames of Vengeance, but the first half of this 30 hour adventure can feel like a bitter ordeal up till then. The writing and charm, however, keep the game alive. It is truly a beautiful game, and one I did enjoy, personally, but it's not one that I could recommend in good faith. It is definitely a game that is worth borrowing or picking up in a sale, but unless the charm infects you, and it just ""clicks"" for you, there are definitely better options out there for you.			"

												I don't always spent a lot of time playing a single game. Divinity II broke that rule. Although the story itself it's not the best, (It's a normal story for this kind of games) it got a couple of interesting plot twists that make it even more interesting.Let's admit it, it's a game rather ""old"" by now. (Let's keep in mind that Ego Draconis went out in, I think, 2009). But, even if the graphics were upgraded with Dragon Knight Saga, (Yes, if you had ""Dragon Knight Saga"", the game upgraded itself to the ""Developer's Cut""*) there are some textures that could be better and some minor bugs. I mean, I don't want to be disrespectful at all. I feel nothing but respect to Larian Studios. They proved that it doesn't take a worldwide company to make an awesome and unforgetable game.One thing that I think the game lacked is better character customization. There're just a couple of options in hair and face. Nothing deep at all. And, other thing, (And, this is just personal) I'm, let's say, an achievement hunter. I find both entertaining and challenging to try to earn every single achievement every time I play a game. So, the lack of Steam achievements is one of my cons. (Still, it has in-game achievements. But, I don't know. I like to have them in Steam)But, I have to admit that the dialogues were hilarious. The game if filled with amazing NPC's and, each one, has a very funny personality. (Take, for instance, Bellegar. I love the way he talks)Overall, I have to say that I recommend this game without any doubt. It's everything that a RPG should be and, sadly, a very underrated game. The amount of different skills is incredible and you can chose whatever you want. Battlemage? Sure! Rogue with a big giant hammer? Why not?There are a lot of great armor sets and legendary weapons to find all over Rivellon and tons of funny quests. Even if you're flying as a fierce dragon, spitting fire all over the Oroba's Fjords or just chilling in the Battle Tower, you'll have a great time.*The developer's tool it's pretty cool, if you want to play the game by your own rules. I would recommend to try it, at least, once. You'll see, it's very fun.			"

												If you're tired of Skyrim, but still in need of an RPG where the story seems interesting, this is the game for you. If you want to have a game where the plot is a story driven by your progress, but the number of choices you take don't have a complete effect on the storyline, this is for you. If you want to be a DRAGON this is for you!! The number of references to mothy python and other oddly humorous movies makes the game flow even faster, and the plot takes you places you haven't been expecting. The skill system makes combat varied, as it is possible to get skills from each class as you choose to. Unfortunately the enemies don't scale very well in levels. The combat is really hard in the start, which is really interesting, but as the game progresses the enemies don't get harder. It's a sad trend which makes you enjoy the rest of the game just for the plot but not the combat.			"

Skyrim was the closest game i found that was similair to Divinity2. Great soundtrack to listen to while exploring. About 80 Hours of game play which makes games like these really worth your money. Its a nice gem of a game, and for 10$ or less its a great deal!I hope you dont like sleep, because you may stay up all night playing this game.Also, Don't forget to SAVE frequently. Especially when there are bosses or groups of units.

												First, let me say that ever since I discovered the Divinity series I've loved it.  Larian clearly puts a lot of thought and effort into their games, and it is most welcome.For this game specifically, if you're a dragon lover like me, just buy it.  Do it, you won't regret it.  It is an incredible amount of fun to fly free and burn everything that dares approach in the skies, but it retains challenge enough that if you get careless, flying demons and corrupted dragons can easily bring your flight to an abrupt halt.In human form, there is an enormous amount of skills and spells that are ideal in differing circumstances.    The variety of enemies is significant.  Many of them fall into categories that make them similar to others, but they're certainly not identical.  Attack patterns are often similar, but even so, don't count on never getting hit, especially with numerous attacks with limited homing capacities or that hit instantly on being released.  As such, there is still a great deal of value to changing strategies against different opponents.  The bosses, however, are where the real challenge shows up.  Even if you've had no trouble up to the boss in question, be prepared to use everything at your disposal, from potions to underhanded tricks such as abusing the terrain, to win.  When you have to fight tooth and claw to get there, though, it just makes victory all the sweeter.The story is quite interesting, though I highly recommend reading up on what happened before the game begins first.  The Divinity Wiki has a story article that gives the background to Ego Draconis, which is the first and main part of the game.The graphics certainly aren't amazing by modern standards, but honestly they're not that bad.  They may not be pure cinematic beauty like something like The Witcher 3, but they're hardly an eyesore either.  The music and voice acting are quite impressive as well.Also, unlike so many mass-marketed open-world RPGs, Divinity II offers actual reasons to explore, in the form of unique equipment, hidden treasure troves and interesting quests.  Poking around in odd corners is likely to turn up something special that was hand-placed there, rather than just another chest of randomly generated equipment that is worse than what you could buy or make.  And even if it does turn out to be random loot, it's likely at least as good as most merchants carry.Unlike Skyrim, with its unlimited supply of boring fetch quests, Divinity II has quests both in towns and in odd corners of the world that have some story and challenge to solving them.  You also won't see a huge floating arrow saying ""quest target is right here!"", instead you will have to use the information given to you by the quest giver and your journal to locate the target.  Don't worry, it won't be that hard to find if you pay attention, and it makes the game significantly more interesting and immersive.I could go on and on, but I'll cut it here with one final comment:  Easily one of the most addicting games I've come across in a very long time.  The others that prevent me from putting this alone at the very top?  Same developer.  That says a lot, I think.			"

												First off, let me start by saying; GET THIS GAME.I'll explain, I've played many open world (and closed) RPG games, and I can honestly say this rank among the top 3 for me. I played this game ALL THE TIME on the Xbox 360, and I'm SO GLAD that PC had a version of it aswell. This game, is a game you can VERY EASILY sink hundreds of thousands of hours into, and I honestly mean that.I'll get to the pros and cons, but seriously, just buy this game.PROS:The dialogue is funny, crisp, and refreshing. There are SO MANY WAYS to approach any scenario in the game. A conversation which can end in bloodshed can just as well end in a new ally gained. VERY GOOD if you enjoyed some of the older Dragon Age games.The storyline is amazing and feels so intricately designed.The characters are unique and memorable and bound to earn your love.The gameplay is dynamic and well polished. Combat is intense and you have a vast array of weapons and spells to tailor to your liking.There are SO MANY quests, and each and every one of them feel unique and crafted with love, not following standard RPG clone formula.The music, the environment, the creatures, all of which are aesthetically pleasing on a grand scale. Every location is beautiful and unique, and you actually feel immersed.The load times are very short, which is nice when you just want to get into the game and play.CONS:While I cannot necessarily fault the game for this, I still must bring it up. The content was heavily reduced and many features and areas were cut for the sake of portability to consoles.No mod support. I feel like this is key for maximizing the life span of an RPG game (look at bethesda titles.)Combat, while I did praise it in the Pros sections, it can be a tad bit clunky at times. That's it. I really can't think of anything else to write here. If you're like me, and love beautifully crafted games...buy this game.If you're STILL hesitant, at least get it on a sale, they have them pretty frequently.			"

												Divinity II has been my favorite western RPG of all time since its original release as Divinity II: Ego Draconis in 2009 (Skyrim is a close second). I just finished my first PC playthrough for the first time today (2/8/2017). Full Disclaimer: I own both Divinity II: Ego Draconis and Divinity II: Dragon Knight Saga for the Xbox 360 and have about 400 hours put into the both combined, and have beaten the game an estimated eleven times. My 30 hour gameplay is shorter than average and does not include the Flames of Vengeance game content. Most first time players can expect to get about 45-60 hours worth of content depending on character build, how many side quests you complete, etc.Divinity II does something no other RPG has ever done to such a perfect extent: its main theme offers a duality of humor and depression, creating a juxtaposition not often found anywhere else. Throughout the first fifteen or so hours of the game, much of its humor shines through. Some of the most unique side quests found in RPGs of the era are thrown your way here, and choices are given to you as to how to treat the quest givers, what rewards you receive after a quest (pick XP, gold, potions, weapons, or sometimes even tableware, ha), or even how you complete a quest. You can decide whether your character is a kind hero, a ♥♥♥♥-talking ego-maniac, or something in-between, and sometimes this affects the outcomes of quests you partake. After the first fifteen in-game hours or so, the game opens up and reveals its simulation elements, allowing you to own your own battle tower and upgrade wings of it to better serve you (necromancy, alchemist, skills trainer, and weapon/armor enchanter). This will also be the part of the game that gives you the ability to turn into a dragon, something sorely missing in games of any genre, and it is aptly epic. You can level up your dragon abilities separate from your character abilities however you'd like, and you'll be able to reach places you couldn't before and even partake in some boss fights as a dragon. You are given multiple fortresses to take on however you'd like, utilizing both your human and dragon forms.This is also the part of the game where you begin to see Divinity II's more depressing themes shine through. Evil is spreading through the land like a virus and it is up to you to stop it. Friends will become foe. Villages and people you've helped before will die, and quite tragically. Without spoiling anything, the game's ending is a punch in the gut and more memorable than any other game I've played yet; the game's ability to throw RPG ""heroes make everything better and everything turns out okay"" cliches into a fire pit is one to be admired. While the ending did make some people upset during the game's original release date, they updated it to ""fix"" it for fans with the Flames of Vengeance content. While I give kudos to them for being  people pleasers, I personally feel the creator's original intent is best. It is one of the reasons this game stands out to me above all others. While I have played the Flames of Vengeance content many times, I always play it separately; I like to think of the original game with its depressing and twisted ending as the full package, because it means a lot to me.What are some flaws? Very few, but for one, the game was released in 2009, and its graphics are quite aged, as to be expected. I prefer graphics from the late '90s to mid '00s era to current, but most do not, so that's something to keep in mind. Also, the game is quite challenging when compared to others in the RPG genre. My husband (who is the reason I even found out about the game back in 2009, since he played the 360 demo) finds it too challenging and has never gotten farther than Sentinel Island. With quick reflexes and the changing of tactics, this should be no problem, however. (Also, it should be noted that the Developer's Cut PC edition is VASTLY easier than Ego Draconis from the 360, which is, in my opinion, a flaw. I preferred the challenge.) Lastly, the character models are so similar between every NPC, so while you meet many different characters, they do end up all looking like they're related.Divinity II is a game I just can't stop playing. I play through it at least once a year because it offers so much that others in the genre simply don't. The soundtrack is my favorite of all time as well, even moreso than Journey, and I have a physical copy that I keep in my car. This game is the reason I became a fan of all things Larian, and while I am very happy at their success with Divinity: Original Sin and its sequel and have bought and played this game's predecessors (both here and on GOG), Divinity II will always be my favorite. There's just ""something"" about it. I love this game with a passion, and I highly recommend it to any fan of RPGs or to any fan of endings that aren't always cheesily happy. This is one of the few games I can in good conscience give a 10/10.			"

												Some things that brought me to the game and allowed me to like the game for it:-For the game's time, the quality is incredible, if you have the CPU power to back it up.-Surprisingly large amount of options in terms of quest decisions, character customization and combat strategy.-The ability to transform into a dragon, of course :P-Great story and voice acting.-The ability to, in a sense, play god and read minds.-Battles never seem boring and at any difficulty present a challenge. Harder difficulties require a battle plan rather then charging head first into the fray.-Surprisingly next to no bugs or glitches.-Incredibly immersive.However a few things that bother me:-There's no day/night cycle, just a constant bloom of an awkward quality sunset/sunrise depending on location.-After a certain point in the game you can fail quests just for progressing in the main quest. Unfortunately it's part of the story but not a big bad thing, just sort of a let down that for someone like me with slight OCD to have to restart the game again just to finish all the quests before leaving the area.-Battles can be harder then they should due to mobs spawning in hoards almost all the time.-Too much dependancy on a pet.-Ground mobs and sky mobs seem to vanish based on whether you are in dragon or human form. Immersion breaking.-Harder difficulties require a limited set of strategies, usually picking the enemies off with bows or magic.Lots of pros and cons but probably one of my new favorites in terms of games.

												A good RPG game that is very much in the Larian mold, though it does have a few blemishes.The (ground) combat is quite basic, aim at a target and mouse click for each attack (no combos, just attacks) with a hotbar for skills, potions, etc.Combat in dragon form is... underwhelming sadly. Much the same as ground combat in terms of mechanics but with the added annoyance that normal ground enemies despawn when you take flight so you can't even make a good zombie bbq.The actual combat difficulty swings between very easy and keyboard-breakingly hard, depending on how tanky you are and if you get stun-locked into place while every critter in the area takes a shoe to your scaley butt.The storyline is good, but not earth-shattering and if you have never played the previous Divinity games you may be left scratching your head as to who certain characters are and why they are so significant.The voice acting ranges from being solid and entertaining to hillari-bad, but overal its tollerable.The graphics are pretty enough, though not jaw-dropping and the game's performance is fairly solid most of the time, with occasional weirdness like the odd ""falling through the world"" glitch cropping up a couple of times and a persistently occuring choppiness and slow-down that kept cropping up after the game had been running for a few hours.So where (if at all) does this game shine? For me, Divinity II shines in the humour that persists throughout the game. There are references, easter eggs and zany antics cropping up throughout the game, but they are rarely rubbed into your face. Rather, when you spot them you can smile to yourself or facepalm at one or another.Score-wise, I give Divinity II: Developer's Cut a 7 out of 10. An enjoyable title set in an established world which fans will enjoy, marred by a slightly temperamental game engine and a B+ narrative. If you like RPGs then its worth playing at least once.			"

												Beaten main game - 33 hours.Pretty fun RPG with some minor rough edges.Pros:- Well done realized world.- Fun skills and abilities- Good sense of exploration and adventure!Cons:- I had to cheese some of the bosses as they were too difficult. Maybe it was the level I was.- Sometimes it is a bit difficult to use the map. As in I have quests, but it doesnt say specifically where they are? Inno.- I had to look up a few times how to beat certain quests.BUGS:After beating the game, it was supposed to go to the expansion, but after freezing my pc multiple times even when trying to do a fresh game on the expansion, I couldnt get it to work. So moving on for now.			"

												I had fun with this game dispite it's flaws, so it's worth a try if you can spare some cash. Playing as a dragon and fighting on the ground both present a decent challenge, it is impossible to fight enemies on the ground from the sky or vise versa. this does make sense from a balance perpective but it can be rather frustrating to morph into a large group of foes.The scenery is nice enough during gameplay, it is mostly boring and forgetable. The only location that stuck with me after I stopped playing was the battle tower, your personal fortress and base of operations. The dificulty was another problem I had with this game. It is possible that i am just bad at the game, but as any class other than archer I was frequently being killed by basic enemies.Dispite those problems the game was still fun to play so it gets a recomendation from me.

												The sequel to the 2002 hit Divine Divinity, Divinity 2 as well as added DLC, take us further into the world of Rivellon with more modern-styled graphics from it's 2002 predecessor. Still an RPG with interactive conversations, puzzles, and Quests, Divinity 2 allows you to make choices which affect the events in the game. This is a key ingredient in an immersive RPG. Divinity 2 looks appealing, and allows you to tailor craft your character similar to the way Divine Divinity did, but without the need for a specific starting class. The game offers crafting options, as you would typically find in more modern RPG's, such as; Alchemy, and Enchanting, but also offers Necromancy, to control and customize an undead pet. This game looks and feels like a really fun RPG and the DLC is supposed to be even better, so I can't wait to dive into that. If you enjoy RPG's, I think this is one you shouldn't miss. You won't be disappointed.			"

												I don't remember the last time I had as much fun transforming into a Dragon and mind controlling people within quest chains to do my bidding. Actually, I don't remember doing these things in any other game, except maybe doing the latter with Jedi mind tricks in Knights of the Old Republic.Divinity 2 is entirely different from the other Divinity games. Larian studios aren't afraid to do new things from different perspectives and they did a great job an Divinity 2. Not necessarily a must have milestone of gaming, but a great game nonetheless. "

												Easily one of the best RPG's I've ever played. I'm a big fan of Morrowind, The Witcher (1), Gothic 3, etc. This game is on par with all of them. The first hour or two of the game, it seems like any other RPG. However, the game just gets better and better (plot wise and gameplay) as the game progresses. The sequel in the developer's pack was also very good, and it looks like there could very likely be a third installment. I'm a pretty harsh critic of rpg's because I have played most of them, and they all follow similiar formulas.The way you can craft your character is unique, and the armor/item enchantment are really cool and essential for late game survival. The game is very hard, and if it ever isn't challenging enough for you, you can set it to ""nightmare mode."" The graphics are good but not top of the line, but who really cares about that. Go play crysis if all you want is graphics. In conclusion Larian Studios has found an avid new fan - for creating an RPG MADE FOR PC GAMERS (so tired of console ports), and you can tell they spent a GREAT deal of time on every aspect of this game.Ratings:Gameplay: 9/10 (What other game can you turn into a dragon and attack flying fortresses? The transition is flawless).Music: 10/10 (Really great original music - made the game that much better).Plot: 7/10 (It's hard to have a completely original plot, but I don't know of any other dragon knight games...the plot was good enough to keep me interested and the boss fights are awesome).Graphics: 7/10 (Very good in some areas, okay in other departments).Game length: 10/10 (Very long game - and the side quests are usually worth it and actually interesting).Overall: 9/10GOOD JOB, LARIAN STUDIOS!! THANK YOU TAKING THE TIME TO MAKE A GREAT RPG FOR PC GAMERS!			"

												Divinity 2 looks like classic fantasy RPG at first, which takes itself too seriously, but if you give it a shot, you will explore surprisingly great story, quests and characters with just a pinch of humor and weirdness in them. Once you get into second half of game, everything changes radically concerning gameplay, you are no longer knight/mage but a ♥♥♥♥ing dragon flying around and spitting flames everywhere. Combination of two gameplay styles make the game really unique compared to all other fantasy RPGs.			"

												This game is an unappreciated gem of an action RPG. There's so many little thing about it that add up to an amazing package. The music is wonderfully composed, the graphics are clean and expressive, the story is well paced, the humor is done surprisingly well without mocking the serious objectives of the game, and the combat is fluid and exciting. Playing as a dragon is a cool concept if a bit underused, you can only do so in the last half of the original game and the last mission of the expansion. My only real complaint is the combat as a dragon. All you really fight are ballista towers and other dragons while in this mode. As such, you can't fight ground enemies as a dragon at all, so no chance to sweep some goblins with your fire breath. Even so, turning into a dragon in free fall more than makes up for this.One thing in particular I liked was the mindreading mechanic. It opens up a whole slew of new posiblilites for you as a player as you try to decide which character would know something helplful to you. From rare items, stat bonuses, ability points, and all kinds of other little secrets, you'll find a much richer experience if you open your eyes and ears. If you decide to pick this up, spring for the Directors cut like I did. Comes with the full game (which was tweaked from the original version), the expansion (which is really necessary to experience the story in full), Developer Mode (if you like to cheat like I do), and all kinds of extra bits like music from the whole divinity series, behind the scenes videos, and concept art. It's a total bargain for hours of the kind of quality RPG that you can just get lost in.			"

												""Divinity II"" is a rather... interesting game. It is an RPG in the same vein as ""Gothic"" or ""Two Worlds"". But what makes this game unique? The dragon form of course! Yes, in ""Divinity II"" you can turn into a dragon at almost any time. Sounds fun, right? It totally is. I had a lot fun playing this game. However, the game does have some major flaws.The character creation is very disappointing. There's a male and a female player model and a small selection of different faces and haircuts, that's about it. That character progression, however, is quite fantastic. Skill and attribute points can be freely distributed, making every kind of character possible. Want a ghost summoning ranger that wields two-handed swords? Totally possible.One of the biggest issues with this game is its inconsistent difficulty. Some enemies are weak while others are powerful as hell, making combat often a bit frustrating. Close to the end of the ""Ego Draconis"" campaign a certain boss had an extremely powerful ""Magic Blast"" ability that killed me in one hit, leaving me no time to do anything at all, so I was forced to lower the difficulty to ""casual"".Certain types of enemies are outright annoying to fight. I don't know why Larian thought it was a good idea to give enemy archers the ""Stun Arrow"" ability. Yes, they can stun you. And when there are more than 3 of them around, they can even stunlock you.Some of the difficulty issues are offset by the regenerating health. When you're low on health, you can just hide somewhere and wait until you are at full health again.Another problem is the dragon form itself. In human form you will fight different enemies than in dragon form, for some reason. Human-sized enemies will disappear once you enter the dragon form, and they will reappear again when you return to human form. I don't know why Larian did it like this, because it takes away a lot of the fun, in my opinion. Exploring Rivellon in dragon form is quite fun though. You can tell that the game's (small) world was crafted with great care. It features beautiful mountains, canyons, towers, everything. It looks fantastic.It is pretty apparent that Larian put a lot of effort into the NPCs, as they are definitely one of the game's strengths. The voice acting and behavior of the NPCs feels quite realistic. The dialogues are a bit disappointing, though. Most of the dialogue options don't even change the outcome of the dialogue in any way. But you can read the minds of most NPCs, which will often reveal new dialogue options and quests.I was quite surprised by the seamless transition between ""Ego Draconis"" and ""Flames of Vengeance"". Once the former's outro cinematic ends, the latter campaign's intro begins, without having to start a new game for ""Flames of Vengeance"". However, the expansion is quite disappointing, partly due to the fact that you're forced to play the majority of it without being able to use your dragon form. The game's story is overwhelmingly unoriginal and I'm not a fan of the ending. It's lack of closure is rather frustrating. I hate it when developers end games like this and then don't release a sequel for several years. And with ""Original Sin II"" being in development right now, I doubt there will be a ""Divinity III"" any time soon...Although ""Divinity II"" has a few flaws and even feels a bit incomplete sometimes (it is quite apparent that Larian wasn't able to release the game's full potential, likely due to time constraints), it is undeniably fun to play and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in RPGs.

												An excellent light Action RPG to tide you over waiting for a real RPG to get invested in. Initial learning curve is kind of steep, especially if you lack rpg experience (for two examples; basic navigation seems to confuse people - you get a rough map and it is up to you to find the points of interest, and abilities such as 1% dodge per point is an ability I think a lot of players who aren't savvy are tempted to over-invest in and as a result feel gimped) but gameplay is easy enough to grasp and gear is not really a factor unless you're using the higher difficulty levels. As a compensating factor there are plenty of guides available to those who are willing to spend a few minutes reading in order to avoid those easy misteps.			"

												I started playing this game FEB 6 2016, first time in i played 14 straight hours. second time in 12 hours straight. This game is so addictive, its ""nearly"" on par with skyrim in my own opinion. the autosave function could use some work but you can save manually anytime without needing to find a certain spot. manual save often cause you could walk into a new area and find a 10 lvl gap between you and your enemies. you will die alot in this game, but thats like half the fun:). the default resolution prolly wont work for most so i suggest changing it to the second from the last on the list so you can read the stats on your equipment better. As far as what i like about inside the game, for example: the puzzles and tricks you have to solve are pretty challenging but not too hard. as in some main quests require you to find an item like a book inside a verry messy library... yea. its more like exploring is the quest. (who doesnt like to explore?) when in dout, read your books! besides that KILL EVERYTHING IN SIGHT!!!! I'd love to add more but spoilers  :P			"

												This game does NOT hold your hand. I thought playing oblivion was enough, but it obviously wasn't. There isn't a convenient marker that shows you exactly where to go. You have to memorize the direction given from NPCs and actually use clues given throughout the game.Although that makes it alot harder, it does well to add immersion. I'm liking it so far.The only gripe I have is the combat. It's a bit clunky and dated, and it shows. But everything else makes up for it enough to earn a thumbs up.			"

Nightmare difficulty, which is hardest, is insane.+ Great variety of enemies with different abilities+ Vast world to explore, with many secret dungeons, hidden quests and even more secrets.+ You cannot spam potions / health items- Cons -- Absence of weapon, armor and accessory blacksmithing (creation from scratch)- When shifting to Dragon Form, all the enemies present on the ground (except Towers) will DISAPPEAR and you will NOT be able to attack them as a Dragon.- Ranged classes are overpowered, you can just dodge everything and spam arrows / magic to defeat anything- Ingame anti aliasing is non existent, must be forced via video driver a- You can teleport to your base, when you have the possibility to do so, at any time to refill health and mana. Also in combat. Larian guys haven't you learned this is bad after 2 games?- No respec of stat points, and respec of skill points costs a lot of money===This is a very good RPG. After the failure that was Beyond Divinity, this new chapter is fresh and well made.Complex enough (but not too much compared to other titles), vast and entertaining, it will be good for both newcomers and veterans of RPGs in real time.

												I really like this game a lot, it's a good RPG, very engaging, interesting story, nice open skills and combat, with a lot to explore.At first I found combat a bit hard, but I find the gameplay and combat fun action oriented and got the hang of it eventually and combat feels too easy now, past lvl 15 I don't have much trouble beating anything. I like the skill tree and that if you decide you don't like the skill you can reset your points and change it. In most games I usually play as a ranger or thief. I of course chose to be a ranger and use a bow, and I like the ranger skills, though the stun arrow is good, but with each point put into it, it only increases the stun duration by 1 second. With combat I follow a pattern, fire a skill and strafe to dodge whatever the enemies fire at me, I hardly ever get hit.And you can't just rush in, I did every side quest possible in Broken Valley before even attempting to do the main quest. Not recomended for those who don't wish to explore, take their time or read.But it also took over 20 hours before I could become a dragon and also get my battle tower, the main base which you store your items, it was annoying lugging around all that stuff and having to sell things I didn't want to as  I was running out of room. It's awesome that you can become a dragon and fly around, but also limited to aerial combat as enemies on the ground will disapear and will only reappear when in human form. And you can't fly too freely as you get invisible walls above and below which is restrictive as well as kind of weird but also undestandable that it's for balance so that it does not make the game too easy if you can just torch all enemies on the ground would make the slayer a bit too overpowered.I also dislike the very random loot in chests, I mostly end up with stuff I don't need unless I want to play the reload 100 times till I get what I want game. I hate that to use the mindreading ability you use experience points, so you end up with xp debt. It is a useful skill as it gives you passwords and lowers store prices or you can find locations of secret hidden items. But also alot of the time you don't know if they will have useful info as often it's just someone thinking something about how he hates guard duty. At first I would save before using it and reload if the mind read was useless, but that got tedious so I just mind read everyone. Doesn't seem to affect my lvling up, I always get plenty of xp and I always choose bonus xp as a quest reward. So not really a problem.Overall it's a very enjoyable game with good graphics, fun game play, beautiful sound track, quest choices and exploration.  I recomend it.I'd rate it 7/10			"

												At first a traditional RPG, it soon shows its true colours as a charming adventure full of wacky characters (Bellegar, the Rhyming Mage, is great) and weird quests, but also with many dramatic moments and cruel situations. Personally, I liked that swinging mood a lot, as it offers a contrast with other more straight-forward RPGs. The story in intself is quite long, so it should take you more than 50 hours to see the end.Technically, the graphics are ok (it has aged pretty well) and both music and voice acting are very good. The controls and animations feel a bit disjointed, and that can be a problem in some combat situations and specially in the platform jumping related puzzles, but in general they work well. Also, combat can be a bit unbalanced on ocassions, having you advancing trhough hordes of minions without a problem and then being one-shot by a boss (luckyly, this only happened to me in very few instances, and I was finally able to overcome that pesky enemy). The dragon form didn't add much to me, just another layer of exploration to the huge maps.All in all, a good experience for its presentation, story, quests and characters, with some minor problems with controls and combat.  It goes on sale from time to time, so for my is a win-win.			"

												Once upon a time, a long long time ago i saw this game for sale on xbox 360. i thought ""it can't be that bad, ill give it a go"" little did i know that this game would not only be one of my favourite games of all time, but one of the funniest aswell.this game isn't perfect ill admit that, but the story and gameplay just makes up for everything that brings this game down (which isnt much really except for some small details here and there such as not really being told what you're meant to do but hey you get used to it)this game also will make you angry at point, there are some very, very difficult boss fights, and parts of the game where you will struggle severely to get through but at the end you will always get a nice reward. some of the puzzles in this game made me scratch my head for hours before i figured them out. then it comes to one of the best and unique parts of this game, turning into a freaking dragon! if blowing up towers and killing other dragons mid flight with fireballs and other nasty features of a dragons arsenal (whatever that may be) this is the game for youoverall this is one of the most fun games i have every played and being able to play it again on pc brings back so many memories. if you like 3rd person RPG's that have a nice mix of humour and deep story then this is very much the game for you.

												Another good game from the Divinity developers. This game's mechanics and areas are to me, unique. I love the aspect of becoming a dragon and flying around. Not as open world as I had hoped but flying around and finding new items and areas you couldn't reach before was fun for me. This game is definitely worth a 2-3 time playthrough depending on how you want to go about the game. The fighting mechanics aren't that bad either. I recommend this game fully. Story line is actually good.			"

												Hidden RPG gem which I haven't heard much about prior buying. Had a blast playing it!Pros- The combat is challenging. And fun.- The story is fun.- The quests are fun. Fantasy power rangers? You bet!- You can be a DRAGON, flying as one is awesome.Cons- Slow start. Especially on higher difficulty, when you quite often just stay on the spot and wait for your health to very slowly regen.- Kind of old school approach, where nothing is handed to you for free. So there is quite often a lot of backtracking or even googling to be able to move forward (could be in pros for some :).- There is part of a game where you just keep on killing hordes of enemies. Fun for a while, but it gets tedious very quickly and lasts for way too long.			"

												Third person action RPGs are my favorite genre, and I can't believe I missed out on this for so long. The world, its lore and characters, are just so interesting while the combat strung it all together so nicely. As a ranger I would go around launching exploding arrows at groups of enemies while my undead summon pulled aggro. But there was also a lot of moving around and dodging enemy projectiles as well. Lengthy stuns and instantaneous flinch attacks can make fights pretty frustrating, though. And then there is the dragon combat. You fly around hitting towers and other flyers with your fire breath and fireball attacks for the most part. You can't attack or even see ground units which means when you switch back to human form you can drop into the middle of a group of enemies and not even realise it till you're dead. Theres not much else I can say about it other than it makes for a nice change of pace. Overall, there are a lot of side quests and a lot of different places to explore. There weren't many variations on the dungeons, but they never got stale. If you're a fan of the genre I don't see how you could be dissapointed with this game.			"

												This. Game, Man!This is one of the most inspired games out there, it's more than clear that this world was developed with love and passion over the desire to make profit and sales. Gameplay is somewhat floaty and will require some getting used to but offers an amazing range of variety and clear and significan progress as you level up.The story is nothing too shocking but a good one nonethless, I enjoyed it even though it was predictable and average, you might not be to impressed here.The game's world and art style is what drew me in the most, it has amazing towns, very classical looking while offering new area that will later spawn nostalgia if you play long enough.Humor, something not common in RPG's but this one does splendidly well, even though they try and present this serious and critical situation of dragons and demons, the character's dialogue can be hilariously cliche and the developers clearly spent time focusing on making this game what it really is, a game. Of course one can demand immersion from RPG titles but do not go into this looking for that. The dialogue is clearly written to lighten up the feel of the game and bring smiles without breaking your experience. Voice acting is mediocre with no lazy work, all characters are voiced professionally and respectfully.Although the game promises an open world, the player will have to make some progress before in the story to reach the core of the game, having the dragon power, and even then the game continues to be a challenging one.In the end this stands a solid RPG made by a very dedicated and passionate team, although by no means a triple A title, the game holds a firm standing in the RPG genre as a unique and creative title. Play.This.Game.			"

												I would like to write about this game since I looked the Divinity series with big contempt and this was a shame. The reason was that they always called Divinity an Action, Diablo-Clone RPG and I am a more traditional RPG fun. No matter whatever are the superficial similarities between them, Divinity is very different than Diablo. It is more like an old school RPG, with action gameplay. The Rivellon lore is quite generic, but the stories and the quests are interesting and unique. A better comparison of the game would be the Gothic series. This means no hand-holders in the quests, Few quest marks, and solving quests through reading books and thinking. There is also a lot of exploration and a lot of hidden things in the game. But let's be more ConcreteStory: At first sight it looks like an effort to cash in the fantasy fans love for dragons. This was also another reason for my initial contempt. Even if this is truth, the Rivellon world is full of shady characters and violence which exists beneath the surface of a fairy-tale-like fantasy. Even if the creatures living in Rivellon are quite generic, nevertheless their actions aren't. The plot can get boring sometimes, but it get's really good after the Hero goes to Aleroth, which is full of interesting quests and a lot of funny characters. For this reason STORY 7/10.Gameplay: The game has aged a bit and it is obvious. There are some game bugs but they are not gamebreaking, Using the Dragon can also get cumbersome sometime. Riddles can get annoyingly difficult sometimes. but usually in the side quests. There are interesting and immersive battles and a nice addition of a baldur's gate like pause system. Companions AI is cute, but not fantastic. For this reason GAMEPLAY 8/10 (or 9 if you are lenient because of the age of the game)MUSIC: 10/10(whoever is involved with the Divinity series knows whyVALUE FOR MONEY(I bought this extremely cheap because I liked the Divinity Original Sin in an Anthology offer): 20/10GRAPHICS: OLD BUT CUTE 8/10IS IT FUN? HELL YES. OVERALL: 8/10. An well above the average RPG with it's own personality and being able, despite the flaws to keep friends of the genre entertained for about 100 hours.			"

												Divinity II has a huge world, interesting story and characters, lots of quests, and all dialogue is voiced.  However, it also has slightly clunky combat, controls and the difficulty level seems to change eratically, mostly due to with the open nature of the world.  You can easily go somewhere that is well beyond your current level without realising it.  Nonetheless, this is a great RPG that embodies what developers can do when they pull out all the stops.  If you can get past some rough spots, there is a rewarding (and possibly addictive) RPG here that deserves your time.			"

It was so enjoyable talking to NPCs and even reading the in-game books and descriptions because they were written so well.- The dragon flying mechanics were actually pretty good. I didn't have many expectations coming into this game, but I was blown away nonetheless.- Graphics were beautiful, story and sidequests have some interesting twists, and voice acting was really well done.- I am a huge fan of Dragon Age, so this game was like heaven to me.

												I played the DKS version though the Dev Cut is exactly the same single player campaign.Divinity 2 starts off like a lot of typical Western RPG’s with a seemingly standard introductory storytelling experience.  Just when you think the game is being too generic for its own good it suddenly gets epic, it actually takes you by surprise.  Welcome to the world of Divinity 2, Larian Studios most ambitious RPG title to date.The land of Rivellon is a whimsical yet foreboding ecosystem filled with colourful characters and sinister creatures, all of which are surrounded by a gloriously thought out fantasy realm powered by the same Gamebryo engine used in Oblivion. It is a place where talking to obnoxious fruit and getting seduced by lascivious treasure chests is the norm.This sort of fantastical absurdity makes Divinity 2 all the more engaging and places it in a class above the normal RPG fare.Divinity 2 is real time action orientated Role playing experience with dense, yet slick old school RPG elements.  The character creation process is simple yet effective as your characters progress is shaped through the course of levelling up. Unlike some other games in this genre, enemies do not scale and level with you which is a refreshing change, if you fancy taking on a new area with low experience prepare to get your ♥♥♥ handed to you – you will be slaughtered!   This element may initially force you to stay close to home, but it also allows you to flesh out your abilities, strengths and weakness and work towards the goal of combating these high level foes.  If you do manage to take out some high level enemies, the XP gained is truely worth the effort.Throughout the realm there are tonnes of hidden caves, chambers and areas filled with all sorts of loot, all of which will help in your quest.  Weapons, garments and armour can also be charmed altering the statistic values based on the type of charms used as well as enhancing your own skills. Levelling up allows you to assign points to various skills, all of which are accompanied with an introductory video on what each skill does in the real world – a great touch.Later on in the game you get the ability to transform into Dragon and be in command of your very own Battle Tower, I won’t go into any spoiler specifics with this but it presents the player with a completely new gaming mechanic in regards to both combat and fast travel.  Certain locations can only be accessible in Dragon form and populating your Tower is an excellent well thought addition to an already astounding RPG.Pop culture references feature throughout Divinity 2 in humorous abundance adding to its charm and appeal.  NPC voice acting is fantastic, breathing life into a densely populated land.  The characters you meet all have there own motivations and needs which you can manipulate to your advantage with the Dragon Slayer power of Mindread – with often hilarious results.Both Divinity 2 and the sequel Flames of Vengeance are excellent examples of the RPG genre that are definitely not dumbed down for the masses and will provide a richly rewarding experience for any player willing to invest some time in the land of Rivellon.I can definitely recommend Divinity 2: The Dragon Knight Saga if you want an in-depth, charming and highly playable action RPG, I grabbed it on sale off Steam a while ago and have put well over 100hours into this game. Divinity 2 has all the popular RPG staples such as lore, books, thousands of weapons, items that can be “charmed”  and presents itself with golden age RPG sensibilities with no constant hand holding.

												Dropkicked a chicken - 10/10 would do againI wouldn't recommend this game at full price, but I got it on sale for 85% off ($3.00). It's sort of a cross between Fable and Skyrim. If you're expecting Dark Souls type combat you will be sorely disappointed. When reading about locking on to enemies and roll dodging in the manual it sounded reminiscent of Dark Souls, but I had to remind myself.There are a lot of interesting abilities that are limited by both mana consumption and cooldowns. There's also not a strict class system which I really like in RPGs. There's not a huge amount of character customization in terms of appearance - much closer to Morrowind than Skyrim in that regard.There are some annoyances such as not having quest markers for NPCs. There was one who gave me a quest, but then moved to a different location because he was involved in a side quest. Due to him being involved in that side quest, I wasn't unable to complete the original quest he gave me until went back to the town where he originally gave me the quest.			"

When I had the previous one I had issue with going from the main game to the expansion.

												After finishing this game, I've concluded that it is a solid game with a solid story.  There are some rough graphics in the game but overall it is very enjoyable.  The Developer's Cut of this game goes through the Dragon Knight Saga and the Flames expansion too. So when playing the game, don't worry about starting a Flames campaign unless that's the part that you haven't played yet.  Every quest in the game was pretty unique in the sense that it was to get certain items or do certain things.  The overall story is solid and has twists and turns that is like a book.  The story was refreshing to see it all play out.  I recommend this game to any RPG player.			"

												This game left me with very mixed feelings. It felt like there was a downside to every positive.The mindreading mechanic was interesting, but paying XP to do so - often for nothing useful - invited tedious save scumming. Combat offers some interesting options, but is undermined when enemies get stuck on the environment or simply forget about the fight and stroll away while you shoot arrows into their back. It also feels pretty simplistic when compared to other games of its genre. Seeing enemies in Kingdoms of Amalur dodging arrows and reacting to being set on fire made me realise just how basic combat is in Divinity II.There's some enjoyable quirky humour, but also plenty of bland and tedious lore.The game generally looks good, but the animations during dialogue are bizarre; the characters appear to be undergoing a seizure while speaking.The prospect of playing as a dragon is exciting, but it takes a fair while to get there.When you do get there, it's rather disappointing. It is a feature which is essentially walled off, not only from certain locations but all ground combat. Worse still, it can be graphically  overwhelming - the dragon battle with Zagan prompted me to uninstall, being one of the most disorienting and frustrating segments of a game I've ever encountered.There's a lot packed into this game, but I just couldn't embrace it.

												* ignore my time played, I am at least 20 hours not logged in steam, will explain later.There are 2 reasons I can't recommend this game.The first is the horrrible game balance issues.  Enemies do not respawn in this game which means there is limited gold/xp in the world.  This means if you do not build your character correctly it is possible to get stuck in the game as you have no ways to improve your character to take on certain fights.  Also health and mana regen extremely slowly so if you are using melee or magic you end up just standing around waiting until you are ready to take on the next fight.  An increased regen out of combat could have fixed this.  Other than these issues from a gameplay perspective the game is reasonable.  The interesting part of the game that the game sells itself on is the ability to turn into a dragon yet you only gain this abillity half way through the game.Secondly there are technical issues running this on newer versions of windown (definintely windows 10, possibly 7 and 8).  If using win10 the game will lock up after 2 world transitions.  This makes it very painful to play as you need to contantly save before every door.  I was able to fix this by using a 3rd party program to hack the executable to use 4gm ram however this also resulted in the game not running from the launcher and had to be run directly which resulted in the game not working with steam ui or logging time.  I also discovered that during the install process the game installs an old version of PhysX regardless of whether you have a current version.

												I'm surprised I hadn't heard more about this game earlier; it was fun, funny, and featured a pretty compelling story.The graphics are a touch dated looking but nothing so antiquated that you can't look past, just something that would have been pretty cutting edge a few years ago. The art direction was a fairly typical high-fantasy look without going too wild. As 'real' a world as you're likely to see in this genre.The music was extremely well done. Not much more to say about that. It was very good.Gameplay was mostly smooth, there seemed to be some issues with jumping and it became advisable to always jump just a little ahead of what you thought you'd need. There were also some issues with clipping on objects but didn't occur often enough for me to get frustrated by it.Levelling was very smooth - each level actually made you feel more powerful but never took you to a point where there was no challenge at all. Different builds (Can't really call them classes, it's a classless system, you just choose the talents that you want and level them up as far as you want) may get different mileage but by the time I was near the end of the game the only thing I really had to watch out for were large groups of ranged or magic users since my health was tightly tied to hurting things.Overall it felt like a slightly more primitive version of Dragon Age in many ways. Certainly preferable to what they did to DA2! Also, no spoilers, but you WILL feel like you've been kicked in the neck at the end of the game, don't worry, the expansion makes up for it.Yeah... the expansion. I should mention that you don't import your character and you don't start with any of the gear you had, or indeed any at all, just enough gold to help buy things to get you back on your feet. Also, it takes away your shape-shifting ability until right at the end, that felt a bit dickish. So, while the 'world' was smaller and the play more limited, it did still have a reasonably engaging story to help get you through it.Made me all the more eager for the studios upcoming Original Sin game set in the far past of the same world.

												Avoid this game. The voice acting is the only solid part of it. The writing is terrible, characters are forgettable, the combat is awful, the battle tower lacks any real features, and the voice stuck in your head all game is incredibly irritating.

												I love this game. It's the first that stopped me from playing/modding elder scrolls completly until finished since BioShock Infinte. It's a typical old-school RPG, but a damn good one. I don't think it's really hard, nor easy. Seems just about the right difficualty too me. It has a nice storyline, the kind of humour I love from RPGs (like the guy who's SoulForced with a chicken, or the ability to spread pretty bad rumours) and gives some unique features like mind reading and becoming a dragon. It's somewhat old but it does still work well gameplay wise.I havn't had any problem with balancing. Regen starts slow, but the game is pretty easy at that point, and with the right armours and skills it can become quite fast (I never used potions during this game, I just jump arround until my health is refilled). Just like in elder scrolls, it's possible to mix and match all RPG classes, so you're not limited to warrior, rogue or mage. After you have become a dragon, you will be able to reset your skills (at that point it costed me at most 10% of my in-game money, pretty cheap, but price will go up every time you do it), so little misstakes and skills you tried but didn't like can easily be fixed. There is indeed no respawn in this game, so limited gold an XP, but I managed to stay overleveld during the game. I defiantly got more gold and XP then needed and also have been able to beat places that where 5 levels above mine, so it's not really a problem. I actually think you'll become overleveld easily if respawning would be included.The only downsides I have is that the in-game AA doesn't work (like there is an option but it doesn't do anything), and that shadows on characters are horribly blocky (but environment is great). Turned shadows off and made some Re-Shade preset (which I also gave some Ambient Occlusion to fake shadows) and it looks quite decent, considering it's release date.Next to that the game has an issues with newer(mainly faster) hardware. It will tear on 60FPS (because my hardware is rendering faster then the engine can handle). Capping the game at 30 easily fixed the problem and makes the game look smooth again. Otherwise I haven't found any issues on performance (running Windows10, gtx1080 (2000+MHz), i5-6600K (4.2GHz), 16GB DDR4).Also the autosave is horrible. It only saves before some plot parts for main storyline. If you die you will have to reload a save, so it would be good to get used to saving manually often.Still, my biggest archievement in this game is when I find some pants that have good stats for my level, because Larian loves miniskirts it seems. Just makes me think someone forgot to put on her pants/leg protection in the morning.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. I found the story compelling and was pleased with the content. It is very story driven, not so open as an Elder Scrolls game, but not quite so linear as a Diablo clone. Its also quite large with several major acts making it longer than anticipated. There are hordes of side quests and many ways to achieve the goals. I have found myself a tad overpowered later in the game. Some of the areas that are definitely supposed to be harder can be made pretty easy with a quick resist potion and having a good deal of regeneration and life steal. I found that as long as I kept fighting it was almost unnecessary to use health potions or spells because I regerated and stole life so fast.			"

												It took me a couple of sittings, looking at the game, getting a tiny ways into the game and saying ""nah, boring"" before I became completely consumed by this game. Then, I spent most of my freetime for the next week playing this game, and the story and the playstyle are fantastic!I usually prefer open-world RPGs and don't like linear RPG's, but this one made me change my mind! The game combines open world feel with a linear play through. There are a couple world sections that you can travel to at different times. Each section is worth exploring as there is a lot of fun side quests and loot. However you are in a fixed storyline in each of these sections and often returning to old sections is pointless. On a scale of Open-world to Linear this game falls as a little more Linear than Fable III (You have a central hub after a main questline and can go to different areas to pick up stuff you missed, but once the end sequence of the game begins there is no going back).The BIG downside to this game is that there is 0 replayability. Which is a shame, because it really is fun to blow stuff up as a dragon.			"

												Great game if you like open world 3rd person action rpgs, the game has great personality, and is very self aware, which leads to typical Larian studios humor. The fighting mechanics can get stale, but that's where as a player you can mix things up and change how you play, the game has quite a bit of customizability and a great balance of rough, but forgivingly difficult gameplay.

												The words ""flawed gem"" come to mind.  Divinity II is one of those games where you struggle between giving credit to developers for making an enormous step forward from their previous games, and yet are faced with a standard experience at best.  For every single thing the game does well, it botches in another or similar area.  The combat can be very challenging, but is marred by the most boring skill system I have EVER seen in an rpg.  Not only are these skills uninspiring, but nearly all of them scale terribly.  In most cases it's simply not worth having multiple points in one skill.  The classes are divided into warrior, mage, and archer archetypes.  Warrior is boring, and mage is outright disappointing, I have not played the archer.  Outside of the types of skills, the system is classless, and you can put points where you want, although damage skills are modified by stats.  There are limited enemies in the main game (Ego Draconis), making your skill point distribution a weighty choice until you can reset them about 40% of the way through.  Even worse, acquiring or advancing many quests (several key ones in the expansion) require you to sacrifice xp in the form of mindreading.  You can reset your skill points, BUT for some reason you cannot reset your Stat points which are largely responsible for the damage bonuses / resistances of the game.  Really?  How hard would it have been to program that in?  The dialogue of the game is near-poetry, but the plot fails to deliver at several key points and not only manages one unsatisfactory ending, but two with the expansion pack.  You will labor long, and you will probably not like the end result.  How you feel afterwards is purely dependent on how much you enjoyed getting there.  As you can see from the pictures on Steam, the game allows you to transform into a Dragon.  What it doesn't show is that you inexplicably cannot attack ground troops.  You are limited to aerial enemies, none of which are a match for you anyhow, and equally mundane offensive structures.  For what is undeniably a major feature of the game, and receives significant buildup in the story, I found its application completely lazy.  The environments are nicely-detailed, as are character models (even if weapon/armor textures for the character are re-used more often than I'd like), but the game-world itself is actually fairly small and limited for something proposing to be an epic rpg.  This is generally offset by having many interior cells, but you cannot help but feel somewhat confined the whole game, especially since the entire expansion takes place in and under the city of Aleroth.  This ""one step forward, one step back"" ideology can mar some of the better qualities of the game.  Much of the dialogue is gratifying, and at numerous turns I was happy that many of the dialogue choices (though not as extensive as a Bioware game) were sentiments very similar to what I would actually say.  The other fact is there's a lot of meat here - quite a lot to do, if in such small spaces.  This can be a good thing or a bad thing.  Many of the sidequests are interesting, even if they largely offer inconsequential rewards, and you really have to explore every nook and cranny for all the treasures.  Once you acquire your base, you can send items directly there from your inventory no matter where you are.  You can also access your base from anywhere within the game via a stone that you carry.  You can have runners fetch you enchantment and alchemy supplies, work on your partner creature, enchant gear, brew potions, increase skill caps, and access your storage.  Storage has a limit, but as a packrat I can tell you you'll never run out of space.  These features are excellent.  In terms of performance, I run the game at max settings, and still had a crash-to-desktop a few times.  After several hours of play the game becomes choppy and requires a restart to smooth it back out again.  Other than occasionally dicey summoned-creature AI, the programming is pretty solid.So, if you're hard up for a new rpg, I recommend the title.  Truthfully though, the replay value is slim to none, but if you're looking to burn about 60 hours, you could do far worse.			"

												This is one of the most fun RPG's I have played in awhile. Deep Skill customization to make the character like you want him or her to be. Want to be a unarmed preist who can beat his enemies into a pulp with his fist and summon deadly monsters to aid him, no promblem. Want to be a powerful mage who can still use a giant hammer and still be effective with that hammer while burning your foes in fire, go for it. I wish more games were like this one and that the devs would make another one like this instead of Divinity original sin or Dragon commander(still great games but I want another rpg third person game like this one) I give it a 10/10If you don't like to know about the story don't read on some people may consider it a spoilerThe game also has a pretty awesome vilian named Damian who wants to destroy mankind for killing his girlfriend, he is soulbound to her before she died so he became immortal (soul bound is when you use magic to bind your souls, if you die, they die or reversed, but it also works on the soon to die in a different way). The game starts out as you being a initiate to a elite force of dragon hunters called the Slayers. Your mission is to hunt down the last dragon knight and put him or her to death. (dragon knights are people who can turn into dragons) well this dragon knight screws you over by forcing her powers on you and ruins your life. I'll let you figure out the rest. I give it a clear 10/10 can play the same game hundreds of times but to be warned it is almost as hard as darksouls on normal, so do every side quest before  even thinking on taking on the bossess.

												At first this game requires some patience but when you get past the first tutorial part you cannot stop playing. Also some ""item hunt"" concept can consume your time as you want to save right before a boss and see if you can achieve even better loot by killing the boss over and over. The mind reading of NPCs' minds is a very nice feature which adds some more depths to the story. Also you can take form of a dragon later in the game and fly in this open world! I highly recommend this game if you like other games like the Gothic serie, Elder Scrolls serie and such games.			"

												You turn into a dragon and wreck ♥♥♥♥. You sell the possessions of ghosts to a necromancer instead of their grieving family members just because. You read minds to figure out who in a restaurant is secretly a food critic, and make sure the chef gets his exquisitely stinky cheese to impress her.That all sounds inconsistent together in one paragraph because it is. That's kind of how this game goes. You're here for these vignettes, not the mediocre combat system or the unbalanced skill tree, and certainly not for the pedestrian main plot.

												Just do yourself a favour, and play through the first (rough) couple hours, it gets better as you progress; clocked in a total of 78 hours to clear out the majority of quests and the two story lines.  Combat is definitely showing its age but the voice acting, the quests, the puzzles are well worth it.As you progress if you pick the right skills combat becomes super easy, if you are looking for challenging fights, this may not be the game for you.  On the other hand, if you are lucky for quirky humour, puzzles, hidden quests and definitely its share of guessing then you will love this game.Finished the first story line (Ego Draconis) around level 26, and the second story line  (Flames of Vengence) at level 45.

												This ends up being a fairly good game. It sticks to game mechanics that are simple but work, the graphics are quite ok and the story line is decent. It's not exactly Skyrim or The Witcher but if you're looking for a 3rd person fantasy game, you'll likely enjoy this. The drop system is that of Diablo which is frustrating as it's very random indeed but the skill system is good. The dragon combat is perhaps a bit too arcade-like but I had a bit of fun with it. The first area is better than the second, I felt, but it's nice to see a smaller production like this still managing to reach decent graphical heights.

												Pros:* Very customizable playstyle* You get your own tower after a while, a base where you can return and craft, upgrade, train etc.* Game looks decent* There is more than just a shallow story* I _love_ the theme that's playing on the first screen, when you choose to play normal mode or developer's mode.* Some funny side characters, quest characters and dialogue that made me chuckle.Cons:* To be honest, I found the dragonform so boring, I skipped all the flying fortresses except the ones I had to do to advance the plot. I actually took a 1 year break when I was about 4 hours away from finishing the game, just because I got so tired of the flying fortresses. I got back because I am a completionist at heart and I wanted to see how the story ended.*The dragonform fighting could definitely had been more developed, considering how much you are supposed to use it. It held a lot of downtime* In fact, the normal fighting style (I fought as melee) also held a lot of downtime in terms of special moves, making it boring sometimes.* The story could have been so much more! The potential is there, but... I never really felt drawn into the story, engaged in it, not like some other games in the Genre.Comments: In the very end, we're talking the last 30 secs, of the whole game, the cinematic crashed for me. I don't know if this botched it for me, but I didn't seem to be able to import my main character into the expansion, Flames of Vengeance, so  just stopped right there. The game just wasn't interesting enough to play an expansion, especially not if I didn't have my main char. It was fairly entertaining to play this games at times, but not enough that I'd wanna replay it, and now I'm pleased to leave it behind. I would recommend it if you can get it on sale, are a big fan of the genre, and don't have anything better lying in wait. So, it's a very weak recommendation.Rating: 6.5/10			"

												I have not finished it yet, but boy am I having an amazing time with it. Divinity: Developers Cut is a fantastic, under the radar RPG that most people have never heard of. Now, I can't say that you'll pick it up and be immediatley engrossed, it most deafinatley takes some time to get into, but if you're a hardcore RPG gamer, it is absolutely worth your time. When I say hardcore RPG gamer, I mean you've gotta know how to figure things out on your own. Occasionally there is a quest marker, but usually it's just a quest description, the rest you gotta figure out on your own. Some people could be turned off from the crazy difficulty in the beginning, but the only reason it's so hard is because the game demands that you go out and explore, do side quests, and level up, gear up, instead of jumping right into the story. When I started out I went straight for the main story and got anihallated almost instantly by some skeletons. So I went out, explored, killed goblins, did some quests, and about 2 hours in I started the main questline. The combat is probably the low point of the game, but even then it's not bad, just kind of clunky. You have a pretty standard skill tree but the nice thing is you can branch out and choose whatever skills you want. Wanna be a two handed sword wielding brute that also likes to use healing spells? Go for it. But other than that, it's all pretty basic RPG stuff with some mildly messy hack and slash type combat. The world is nice and open offering tons of exploration and secrets to be found, just don't expect there to be a huge variety of enemies, because there isn't. As far as I've played, there is really only one real town too. But I dunno if there is another later on. Now, lets talk about the awesome stuff. If you can give it a chance, about 9-10 hours in the game goes from pretty average but fun, to really really cool. If you can manage to get to the point where you get to own the Battle Tower, things start to look waaaaay up. You have 4 different wings in the Battle Tower that can help you out. You have the Necromancy Chamber which allows you to create your own creature out of dismembered limbs of fallen foes. You have the Alchemy Chamber which allows you to brew potions with probably the most easy to use potion creater ever in a game. Then there is the Enchanting Chamber which allows you to enchant/disenchant armor and weapons. And then there is the Training Chamber which allows you to use gold to buy additional levels for your skills so you can level them past 5. Then aside from the chambers, there is also your team of runners. Runners will go out and find whatever crafting materials you may need. You can also equip them with gear so they don't die while out in the field. Also awesome is the fact that at the same time you get your battle tower, you also gain the ability to turn into a dragon at will and wreak havoc. If that's not a game seller, I don't know what is. All in all Divinity 2 is a pretty awesome game. There are some low points like little enemy variety and mildly clunky combat, and the beginning is pretty boring for like the first 2 hours. But if you stick with it (Especially if you make it to the Battle Tower) you will find that it's a pretty rewarding game with lots to keep you busy. Verdict8.5/10			"

												Simply put this is a arche-typical Fantasy-setting RPG - Single Player only.Some things people may be wary of are:1. The Hint system (mind read) is used by expending Level up XP to use. While this is what the description says, it's not so much expending as extending, and what I mean by that is you never really *lose* the experience you already have, you just go into what's called ""Experience Debt"" which has to be repaid before you can continue to gain normal experience. 2. The Tutorial Assumes you are already firmiliar with at a minimal RPGs, and probably assumes too much about your experience with action-games. What I mean by this is: The Tutorial doesn't go over more ""basic"" RPG Elements such as ""Equipment"" or ""Gear"" let alone ""leveling"" but it does give you basic controls. What I mean by it assumes too much about your experience with Action Games is...for the tutorial to cover controls is fine, but more of the advanced moves (ie rolling/jumping/dodging) are not well explained until AFTER you need them. Long Story short - the tutorials are very basic, and could use some polishing towards total newbies.3. Although the game is a bit dated (circa 2008 - 2009) the actual game-play/graphics details and other ""Preformance Effecting"" Details are quite up-to-par with modern standards. This game was obviously ahead of it's time even though it's time was a while back.***WARNING: The Next Few Sections MAY contain some spoilers. Reader Descretion is advised***4. I have -not- encountered any spiders - yet. I have to make mention of this because this is something I personally like, but realize not everyone wants. To Progress roughly 20~ Hours into the main-line quest stream and not see a single spider (albeit some webs) enemy is a good thing to me, because I am among those who are afraid of spiders (however - I am most certainly NOT afraid of Scorpions so I'm not ""Archnophobic"" by a typical detail). Mostly the Enemies I *have* encountered are undead/humanoid/demihuman types. Ie 2 Legs 2 Arms and Some Form of head and torso. The ghosts have no legs just two draping sheets tho.5. The Dragon Form - about the dragon form, although it cross-interfaces with the human form it feels more like the enemies are split into Dragon-Class (flying/structure mostly) and Human-class Enemies, and there is little combination of the two. Although you can fight some dragon-class enemies with a bow, the structures and such will not fire at a human. Moreover - the Ability/Skill system is only slightly different between human and dragon abilities, the major difference being you have (afaik) no ""Natural"" Skill Points in Dragon Abilities (you have to read some kinda book to get points etc). Also Although the Human form regenerates overtime at a variable rate - dragon form only heals when actively healed (ie with a spell/ability) which means you'll be using alot more of your dragon time using abilities rather than breathing fire.*** END -Possible- Spoilers ***Overall the game is good enough that I'd continue to play it for quite some time, however the aforementioned flaws are some of the things I wish had been explained to me before I found out on my own (which took some time) The Story in particular is excellently told, and personally I find myself continuing to play the game mostly because the story is so mysterious and intriguing. Good Example, One quest (which I have yet to complete) has you facing against a ""Veggie"" Witch, which to say nothing of the comedic standpoints is very unique among the thoughts of curses when someone evaluates a game such as this. Well-thought out the story is, but at times is just plain comedic to be sure. The Main Plot is no laughing matter though, but I'll leave that for you to discover. Advice: Get Used to Dying even on the easiest settings if you don't pay attention to what your doing. On the other hand, on the easiest settings there comes a point at which you become nigh invinicible late game.			"

												I can't really say that I'd recommend you to play this game if you didn't start with the original. It suffered from Larian's ambitions to make the RPG game that will flare them all, but when you've got a small team, you never have enough time to implement everything you want. They did not know how to set their goals properly and you can clearly see that from their PDFs included in Developer's Cut. While playing the game you'll notice the bland autogenerated landscapes. You will suffer beating the repetitive flying fortresses in a dragon form. And you'll definitely get bored and quit it for a few weeks or months a few times. Also, the ending of the original story is rather spontaneous and I can imagine people, who bought Ego Draconis back in 2009 being really disappointed. But then they released Flame of Vengeance, which takes place in Aleroth, and this is where things go nuts. The game turns into sugar, spice and everything nice perfect aRPG with dungeons, lots of quests, lots of people to interact with, puzzles, etc. As well as design is way better as it clearly was manual work as opposed to automated lanscapes. If I could give a separate review then I'd only recommend Flames of Vengeance, but there's no sense to play only the 2nd part of the story (even though you can actually do that). So that's it.			"

												A pretty decent action RPG with some unusual features. Ground combat works perfectly fine and is satisfying, but by the time you're able to turn into a dragon on command, you'll be so powerful in human form that turning into a giant, fire breathing death lizard feels like a step down. I dunno how they managed to have being a dragon make you feel /more/ vulnerable, but they did it. You don't have all the armor and weapon bonuses you've been stacking up when you transform, so it'll take some time to adjust to the increased difficulty of the flying segments at times. Still, there's plenty of loot to be found, a killer rabbit, and you can be an absolute backstabbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you want to. Gotta love multiple choice dialog. I recomend getting Divinity 2 when it's on sale, it's a good game but not the best of it's kind on Steam.			"

												A superb gamePro: Excellent RPGGood and totally unexpected twistsAlthough you will make use of skills, it is not a game where you just order up all your attacks in advance, you will have to do the fighting (I found being a ranger with a little summoning good)Cons:I do not want spoil anything, but I feel like, storywise, this game ended up contributing little to the divinity universe. I have only ever played this and Original Sin but I still feel this is true.Whilst the main game runs for about 40 hrs and the expansion another 10-20, I feel like there should have been more areas to explore.Overall: Great game, get it, especially on sale. My cons in this cause are simply things I wish they could have done more with, what did do was superb.			"

												This game isn't Skyrim but that doesn't mean its not any good. This game has been one of my favorite RPGs. One that I will go back to time and time again. It can be over the top, cartoonish, and childish at times but thats what gives Divinity 2 its charm. Days worth of content await and much more for the player who's willing to overlook its dated gameplay and graphics. Combat may not be as easy and the entire experience may vary per person. Dialogue can range from rich to shallow humor, but with the amount of easter eggs and homages, one can be sure that conversation can be quite a treat. The dragon form is one of the best aspects of the game as it is unique in itself. I found myself flying a good bit of my playthrough and just attacking fortresses in the areas presented. There are some glitches and bugs that can make it a chore to play at times but nonetheless it is a very good game that blends two distinct genres.  My only regret is that Larian wasn't able to make this game the way it was supposed to be due to budget cuts. Its not Skyrim or Dragon Age but it is still quite a gem of a game and highly underrated, that is if you are willing to overlook its flaws. 8/10.			"

												Great roleplaying game with easy and fun gameplay. Story is good and gfx looks awesome even in todays standards in 2014. I love the music in the game as it fits the world perfectly.Its easy to choose path in the begining warrior, archer or mage. And you dont really need to follow that path as you can progress in all paths later by leveling up and put points in all categories. Build your favourite character and enjoy a game you havent played before ;)I enjoy alot that the developer have putted humor in this game that can be found out in the huge world of divinity 2. You can feel that the developer have had fun to create the game and putted alot of thoughts behind them.This will be my gemstone for a longtime to play now and then. Love to complete the achivements ingame but I do miss gamecards and real achivements in steam. So if you read this DEVELOPER please put it on for us fans.			"

												It has dragons so how could I refuse. Having read some reviews and seeing it on sale I decided to give it a go. I see now that this is a big game and its going to take a while to complete so I may add to this review later. My first impressions are good having just finished what could be classed as the first area. There are similarities here to other RPG's in that you have a bunch of side quests and then the main one. Thats  where they stop as the rest of the game is quite original in that your character is a dragon slayer pretty much with an open book skills develoment tree. I like this because you can customise your path to be either a pure class or a hybrid. A kind of pick and mix of skills. I've varied my character up to this point and he seems ok in combat so at this stage there doesn't seem to be a penalty for being a mixed bag. That may not work for everyone though depending on your play style. There is a certain strategy when dealing with opponents and it is this that may make you think more about the skills you buy. For instance I found my survival chances went up when using a bow against certain opponents as opposed to just charging in. This is why I am warming to the game because its a thinking mans RPG. Skyrim it is not but at least you can be a dragon in this rather than just riding one. The story is also fascinating with lots of historical references which add meat to the world you explore. The decisions you make also have consequences from small to large depending on what you do. The graphics are quite nice with varied scenery and architecture. Monsters range from little kick them in the butt types up to larger more challenging ones. Often you will get mobbed so its wise to learn some aoe skills or face oblivion. Its a game of secrets as well and some are not easy to find. NPC voice acting is pretty good and adds to the atmosphere. I like all the different personalities you encounter on your journey.As it stands if you are a hardcore RPG fan then give this one a try. If you are new to the genre you may find this one a bit difficult to get into due to its depth.			"

												I am about 10 hours into this game and I must say it has been fun so far. Game play wise think of a single player MMO style campaign. Combat is very much like Guild Wars 2. I really like the fact that you can mix and match skills from across multiple classes to create a unique and custom class all your own. Combat is fun and requires you to actually dodge attacks. If you stand and spam spells you will die! This game requires some level of skill althought not a ton. Although I can not play on max settings to comment personally on the graphics, I have seen them on YouTube and they are quite good. The game has clever humorous moments and dialog so its not completely stale and serious.			"

												I have not had this much fun with a fantasy RPG game in Years.There isnt really a ""class"" in the game you being a Dragon Slayer/Dragon Knight you can mix and match however you want :DThere are Priest spells: Which is summoning different creatures and spells like Fear, Blind, Charm and others.There are Mage Spells: Which are Magic Missiles, Fire Blast and I think there was Ice Lance as well oh and one of the most powerful ones later in the game is Firewall for when the enemy gets in your face ^^ and dont forget Heal :)Priests and/or Mages usually do good with 1h maces because they mostly have intelligence stats on them and you can either dual wield them or find a shield that has spirit on it like I did.There is also the Warrior way with Whirlwind, Rush Attack, Fatality (like Execute) and other attacks or Defensive Posture if your more a 1h and Shield kind of person :) Which also works nicely with Whirlwind :)Warrriors can either dual wield 1h weapons like Swords or Axes or they can use big 2h Swords which are slower but of course do more damage :)And of Course theres the Archer way of playing where there are skills Like Poison Arrows, Ranger Suprise(Lowering the enemies defences), Stun Arrows, Explosive Arrows and other attacks :)Obviously Archers use a 2h Bow for their attacks :) and you dont need to worry about buying arrows because apparently you have a unlimited supply :) either that or they're magic ^^Oh and you can Equip 3 sets of weapons at the same time and switch between them whenever you want :)When I had things more or less figured out I had my main weapon set be Dual wielding maces with that intelligence on them and my second was a 1h sword with a nice shield and my third was at some points it was a bow which I never used but it was a just in case thing and at some points it was a awesome 2h sword near the end there which I actually used more then my dual wielding weapons.There are also a couple Dragon Slayer abilties which 2 of the biggest ones  I think are Mindread and Lockpicking :)But there are also skills like Wisdom (increases your xp gained by 1-2% per skill put in it. And Encumbrance which increases the capacity of your backpack. (I know it may not seem so usefull at first but if you loot everything you get your hands on to sell or use later you will most likely put all the points you can in to that skill ^^ that being 5) and of course the weapons expertise skills Single-Handed, Dual-Wielding, Two-Handed, Sword and Shield and theres even Unarmed expertise if you wanna try that out.Im telling you this game got A Lot to do in it :)I almost forgot, there is a quicksave in the game and I suggest you save often because your choices can change things, as they say in-game ""Your Actions have Consequences""May I just say one more thing that will guarantee you will be interested in trying this game.After you get to a certain point in the game (Its pretty early in the game) you are able to turn into a fire breathing dragon at will! At the push of a button! (Default being Q) :D But you can only attacking flying enemies or Ballistas and other buildings that attack you. Oh and there are several DIfferent Armor Sets that gives bonuses to your Dragon Skills :) You get your first one after you get your dragon form if you check your Storage Chest in the tower :)Only bad thing is at some point it got a bit repetitive, but that may just be because the way I played it with magic only. I leaned more towards using bigass swords near the end because I got them and it was way more fun at the end :)			"

												Overall 6/10 If you like Fantasy-RPG dont think play this game. Rating is low because objectively gameplay is a deciding factor.If you have no problem you'll enjoy the game. Comparing to lots of other games except gameplay this game has very orginal parts Good or Bad.I first played Ego Draconis when it first came out and it had the most interesting and unique ending for a game.Which is first half of this game. But if you end up playing and See the First-Half ending dont forget the 2nd half came out a year later and people had to live with that as ending which was awesomely unique ending that nobody saw it coming.There arent even 10 games who'd have such a bold ending.the Good------------------------+Story is good and interesting.Specially if you like fantasy genre.+Suprisingly quests are not repetitive and has a lot of orginal quests.You can get a quest from a blind Philosopher or help a cheating wife deliver a letter to his lover.+Again I can never forget the Ego Draconis part ending and didnt even know there was a second part on the making and had to live with that.Even for just that part its worth to play this game.+/- Has good cutscenes and very very sh*tty cutscenes so its hard to put this in a place.the Bad--------------------------Voice acting is bad for the most part.-Combat is a one-way ticket to same skills.A lot of interesting useless skills and you end up using same skills at the end.-If you dont craft the combat is hard, if you craft it is easy.No middle ground.the Ugly--------------------------! Gameplay is bad.Some mechanics are making me say ""Why?"" a lot.! Stats are mostly useless and unnecessary.Has stuff like stun resistance in gears instead of being linked to main stats you have.And for most part Only useful stat is Vitality which is a bad thing for a RPG game you need stat build depth.

												This game doesnt' take itself too seriously and as such doesn't grind you down. The plotting and pacing of the story and humor are set at a nice jog. Oh, you still realize the seriousness of the main quest. BUT the light hearted, comical situations confronting you on your road there keeps you amused and entertained. And when you're not engaged in fluid and fun combat with the local monstrosities, stop and smell the virtual roses and taste the eye candy There may be a hickup or two in the package, usually concerning the sequence and or location of trigger effects ( i believe i encountered two). However these bumps in the road are minor.So if you want to stick your head out of the dank dungeon of typical RPG's for some fresh air, Divinity 2 just might be the breath of fire you need.			"

												As much as I love Divine Divinity feels a little 'incomplete.' I don't know why but it really gives that not-so solid feeling whenever I play the game. Don't be fooled with my game time because I bought and played this game a long time ago on Good Old Games together with Divine Divinity and the sequel Beyond Divinity.Anyway, aside from that obvious fault the game surprisingly have a lot of content for you to complete. The skill system is flexible enough that you can choose whatever skills you want to develop which makes your character unique as you progress through the game.I think the game should have been released as is without the developer's console command.But since I love the developers and they are really passionate about creating games, I don't mind playing this again and I think I will enjoy it this time given to the fact that it's a Steam version that I can easily upload screenshots and make game guides.[...]The idea behind the Developer’s Cut was to create a new SKU (the publishing term for a new version of your game, comes originally from Stock Keeping Unit, a unique code to identify the game). And the idea behind that was that it might get us some extra attention at the time of release, sufficient to get attention from those RPG players that didn’t try out Divinity II yet.We thought long and hard about what we could put in this SKU and came to the conclusion that it would take us too long to put some meaningful content in. Our gut instinct therefore told us that we shouldn’t do it,  but then the idea originated to make some kind of a developer’s version of Divinity II.It’d be a version where we’d share the story of making Divinity II in the form of a documentary, include the design documents & the milestone videos we’d made for the publishers at the time, and the cherry on the cake would be the inclusion of the developer console we’d been using during development. This would enable players to see how we actually looked at the game during development, and allow them to do things only we could do (like flying around in areas you’re not supposed to fly or turning yourself into any creature you could think of). It’d be something we’d give away for free to those who had already bought DKS, and something that might tickle the interest of those who hadn’t.In short, it was a new SKU created from an old SKU without too much effort, exactly the kind of thing we were looking for, even if – tbh – to this day we still only have a vague idea of what exactly a SKU is, other than what it says on Wikipedia.So we decided to go ahead with the Developer’s Cut, and thus create an Anthology that would include Divine Divinity, Beyond Divinity & Divinity II: The Developer’s Cut. But saying that you’re going to make a new SKU and actually releasing it are two different things.Because the Developer’s Cut included the patched up version of the original Dragon Knight Saga, we needed to browse through all of our existing contracts and get an OK from any previous publisher that might have rights in this, which turned out to be quite a job, worthy of yet another separate blog entry and good for eating up about a quarter of my time – leaving me with a measly three quarters to take care of all the rest.Other than new contracts, the new SKU also required a new logo, new descriptions that needed be translated in all kinds of languages, new Steam listings, new promo material etc… and the process of getting all of that in place, you’ll never guess it, is worth another blog entry on its own. Suffice to say that even at the time of writing this current update, not all of that is finalized. But I have good hopes ;)In addition to that, we also had to localize all the new material and because we changed the code of the game, that meant we also had to engage in new rounds of QA. Now, saying ‘QA on a 100+ hour game’ in the same phrase as ‘multiple languages’ is in general enough to intimidate any development director, no matter what his pedigree.Luckily, the QA part wasn’t as bad as I thought it was going to be, because the cool part about including the Developer Mode is that you can actually use the cheats while testing. I’m told that Octaaf, our lead QA, can finish the game in 1 hour 43 minutes and 22 seconds. (Matthew, the lead gameplay programmer on Divinity II can do it in 1 minute – he says – by issuing the “oe end “ command in the console ;) )[...]http://www.lar.net/2012/10/09/hatching-the-anthology/ "

												I can totally recommend this game and for that i have many reasons.Me, as a fan or RPG games played this game as you can see about 20 hours and im still not done - I dont even know how long it will take me.The Mainstory line is typical for an RPG in some ways but the fact that you always feel kinda special becuase you are a not just the symbol for a warrior of freedom your also the enemy of those and the story is well based on that. The amount of sidequests is god damn high but this doesnt mean that they are too boring or too hard. For example in one quest you would have to find out about a murderer or finding an talkin melon you have to find the other fruits to open the dorms and kill the witch who made them fruits. - so even the sidequests are of the kind that you wanna find out more about the thing itsself.In Divinity 2 it is not predicted if you choose mage warrior or bowman. You can mix  them all. You can - for example be a bowman how can switch to some claymore, does damage and gain hp back by that.Another aspect why I like this game is that it is definately not easy but why is that bad ? You can find many potions that increase your magic spell power or other potions to increase a resistance against fire damage. Yes the game is hard but using your brain and stuff makes it possible. So if you dont just want to slay all enemies down than this game is pretty awesome for you. ////// sorry that my english is not perfect is hope this still helps to decide if you wanna buy it or not ///// "

												8 out of 10 Divinity 2 is a top down 3rd person role playing game.  It is a typical swords, bows and magic type of fantasy world.  The one addition to your normal RPG is the ability turn into a dragon at specific points in the game.  It is hard for me to state why I enjoyed the game so much.  It is just a great and interesting top-down RPG, something that is hard to find these days. The good: 1. The normal RPG type stuff is done excellently.  The quests, equipment, skills, etc. The bad:2. Your character always sheaths his weapons during dialogue.  Thus after talking to enemies you have to redraw your weapons wasting valuable time.  You may die before you even drew your weapon. 3. Movement during combat is not always fluent.  If you are hit (e.g. by an arrow) while jumping the character is instantly moved to the ground and staggered wasting time and momentum.  Even worse, when swinging your weapon there is no correlation between clicking your mouse and actual swings.  Sometimes attacks are fast and sometimes slow and I have no idea why. 4. My personal preference is for RPGs where you deploy a team of units with different skills.  Here you only have yourself and summoned creatures. The ugly: 4. Being a dragon is totally disappointing.  When normal you can only attack ground units.  When you are a dragon cannot attack ground units only certain towers and flying units.  Surely you want to be a dragon to flame those annoying units that swarmed you on ground.			"

												Interesting RPG with graphics that hold up nicely over time. Character customization leaves most wanting, as you can only control gender, very limited facial features and hair. Also, some of the movement and jumping controls feel awkward. I do like the freedom you have with skills, not limited to a class you choose in the beginning of the game, often without any knowledge of how it will play out. All in all, I'd rate this game at about 7.5/10 so far, but I still have more to go before a final decision can be made.			"

												Divinity 2 is one of my all-time favourite games. The RPG game is enjoyable to some people, but not to others due to its nature: it's more of like reading a book. The skill tree and combat in general aren't very tactical: it doesn't really matter what you choose. The reason why the game is so awesome in my opinion is the voice acting and plot. It is one of the few games that have actually managed to give characters a value! All characters are unique, the way they talk, the thoughts they think (yes, you can mindread), the things you learn about them from other characters. It's not your standard RPG with combat, leveling and gearing points. It's a well written, interactive story you follow with your also unique character whose uniqueness comes from the choices you make and the impression you leave.The game fits in the same category with Star Wars: KoTOR series.

												I put this game on a shelf a long time after buying it (well Steam Sale^^), but im happy i finally fired it up. The Game did the 3 ,imo, most important parts of a RPG right. Great atmosphere,great story/storytelling and good character development(skill and itemwise). For me the game had a similiar feel to it like the gothic series and i loved those games (1-3), so everyone wo liked those games might give it a try.The advertised Dragon transformation is nice, but for me it was more like a built-in minigame, then a part of the game itself, if this would be your main reason to buy it, you might want to reconsider.There were only two bad thing i would really mention. 1. The early (character)levels are a bit to hard and the later levels to easy, but some might like this ""getting op"" feeling. 2. Sometimes the mouse responded slow or stopped working alltogether ingame. This was fixed by a game restart, luckily the mouse in the menu still worked, so i could save everytime and lost no progress.			"

												I'll try to keep this short, but Divinity 2 is so vast in content it'll be difficult for me to contain my excitement.This was a game worth buying. For never having played a singleplayer, story driven game like this, I found it addicting and very enjoyable to say the least. I'd recommend this to anyone who loves adventure, fantasy, a good story, and DRAGONS. The game is all sorts of challenging, giving the player all sorts of fighting styles and decisions. There is no designated class that your character is stuck with, and no huge stat boosts applying to one particular 'class'. The thing that captured me most about this fantastic game was the beautiful soundtrack, simplistic yet stunning graphics, and above all the Dragons. Anything I'd ever want in a dragon game, I found in Divinity 2.By far, one of the best games I have ever played.			"

As this is the Developer's Cut, you get the ability to play the game in Developer Mode which is a lot of fun! Also, the game comes with a host of developer materials such as Artwork, Music, Movies  and even the Developer's Journal.I particularly enjoyed reading the Developer's Journal as it gave a great insight into the journey Larian Studios has taken from it's foundation up until today. Best of all, it's an honest account and you get to read in detail about many of the ups and downs the team experienced. In the end, they have made a number of great games despite the obstacles they encountered along the way and I wish Swen Vincke and his team the best of success in all their future games!			"

												I won’t lie…this game is frustrating, cheap, and unpolished. And yet, it is exactly what I love about lesser known action/RPGs. At first glance it almost looks like Fable or even Amalur, then you become both disappointed and immediately intrigued by what lies underneath, which is a similar feeling I had when playing Risen 2.  It’s certainly not a bad game, just lacking. Typically when you think RPG you envision a game that through good skill, strategy, planning, and good decisions overall, you triumph.However, you often get blindsided by stupid flaws within the game engine, cheap attacks by enemies, or in general don’t have enough in your favor to win by traditional methods.  You yourself have to become cheap…or it could just be that I expect a genuine straightforward fight, especially since I play as a warrior in these games. Either way, it’s an action/RPG that’s definitely worth a second look.			"

												Hard to write a coherent review of this game. First of all, it follows the best traditions of the previous Divinity games (and the story as well), including the not-too-serious tone, lot of NPCs and side quest, while adding a ton of new features: 3D world instead of isometric; dragons; mindreading, etc.On the other hand, the difficulty curve was quite interesting: I had really serious troubles cleaning out the flying fortresses in Ego Draconis (I needed to find and use every boost, and proceed very-very cautiously), on the other hand, Flames of Vengeance did not provide a lot of challeges (at least for me). It might have something to do with a bad skillset, or something like that, but I don't know. If you don't mind dying several times to hordes of nameless grunts, while acing the boss battles, than do not consider this as a weak point .:)Alltogether, it was really fun, the jokes/quests were great. The main story is mostly cliché, but the other stuff is more than better. If you like RPGs, I strongly recommend this title.			"

												Divinity 2 is a game I have started on several times a few years ago, but finally decided to go for a full play through when I discovered it in my Steam library including the Flames of Vengence. I had previously logged around 2 hours on the game before starting a fresh character in total I have around 60 hours as a few hours were played in offline mode and not recorded to my overall play time. I can say for sure that this game is well worth your money if you can get into the game. The game has a quite decent story line, even though the plot twist is visible from a mile away. As for the general mechanics of the game they are pretty basic as are the classes. The ability to turn into a dragon is a nice feature but too limited as you cannot use it against ground based enemies. Overall a great game!			"

												Having initially passed Divinity II when it first came out because of numerous glitches and low performance issues I picked up Developer's Cut in a recent sale and I was pleasantly suprised by the amount of polish this game has received from Larian. Overall, Divinity II is a pleasant looking, approachable, yet not easy, game. I had quite some fun during the ~60 hour playthrough and I am sure I missed some spots here and there. There are *a lot* of smartly hidden stuff to discover. The story is not spectacularly novel but the overall writing is funny, refreshing and witty on par with the excellent Divine Divinity. Graphics are nice and the high resolution textures really help the somehow aging engine. The only visual issue with Divinity II is that quite a lot of NPC faces are repeatable to a point that breaks immersion. Music is really good and fitting and the voice-overs fit the ""not-too-serious"" style of the game.Overall great game. Good job Larian!			"

												A decent RPG with standard loot, stats progress and skilltree. What different this one from others how ever is none boring quests, there not much kill this, deliver that and repeat. Also your choises will change your game story and you may read NPC's minds with the cost of XP giving you more information or additional quests and treassures. The game is filled with humor and refrences, just the way i like it. You may save whenever you like, and with perma death you will have to. I don't know why they even had perma death with unlimited save, could as well had some kind or respawn rather than letting the player replas the content they forgot to save. I had a few problems where i managed to get into places where i shouldn't and thought that was a part of the current game but if It's not obvious, it's propably not how It's done :p It's not 100% polished, you might need to look the quests up on a wiki and it could have had a bit more different mobs but if you like RPG and enjoy conversations, decisions and story this is a game for you.

Yet, after playing I begin to wonder how fair that has been. Certainly the story and the world portrayed is quite inconsistant in tone and design. It can be both serious and a spoof, and that might turn off some players. However, this dissonance is the source of the game's charm, and in terms of depth and gameplay, it does deliver, though it can be a little wonky. Definiately, if you can get the Anthology, the game is worth it. The disc version also comes with DLC for Dragon Commander, a Divinity series strategy game which has just been released.			"

												Buying Divinity II ( or Ego Draconis, and the confusion revolving the fact it's the first game but somekind of spiritual successor to Divine Divinity) was a shot in the dark when it was released. It had been forced out of production too soon for the developer's taste due to lack of funds, I found out after I had played it.What you actually recieved out of the box was a brilliantly written storyline that kept you engrossed pretty much from the start, a combat system with more depth and variation than it initially lets on and with graphics that could rival any AAA game on the market during the time of its release. I was shocked to hear the developers claim they were disappointed because it lacked so many things that they wanted to put into the game, but couldn't due to financial strains. The main rival to D2 was Dragon Age 2, and the fact Larian Studios, the developer, was disappointed in themselves meanwhile mopping the floor with every other RPG on the market, (in terms of game quality and not sales) says a little about their selfstandards. This is pretty obvious in Divinity: Original Sin if nothing else.For a game that lacked half the content it was supposed to have, you'll wonder exactly what that content was when you come out an odd 40 hours of gametime later when you've finished one of the most engrossing and twisting storylines this side of a classic JRPG. As an example the Divinity Dragon Commander title is actually a byproduct of what was originally supposed to be an RTS part of Divinity II.If you enjoy any rpg from Diablo to Skyrim, I would recommend trying this out. It is challenging in that the combat system is used to its' full extent throughout the game and there is no one tactic that would work on all enemies or situations. It is varying in that the scenery changes everywhere you go and not much is reused in terms of assets and nothing feels rushed or left out and it is, of course, engrossing thanks to wellwritten characters and a twisting storyline with many small pitfalls that you decide the outcome of in best D&D spirit.If you've played Original Sin, or anything from Diablo to Skyrim, you would probably enjoy this game. If nothing else than to blast airships as a dragon.			"

												Great stuff... There is little not to like about Divinity 2 (Dragon Knight Saga/Flames of Vengeance), except maybe the final FoV Mission. Decent user interface, OK graphics, decent combat system, decent questing, maybe a little bit hard in the beginning and slightly to easy in the later levels (played a melee character, with all stat points put into Strength and Vitality), and perhaps a little bit to time consuming for my wife's taste. I loved the Dragon elements, and I have no problem with the sometimes somewhat repetitive grinding elements (up to the final fortress, where I just jumped into the final boss chambers after destroying all defense buildings as dragon). I thoroughly enjoyed this gem, and whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone enjoyng a good RPG now and then.			"

												 Real Hidden Gem of a game, I like stats to build on and skills that aren't only locked to a certain class so if you want a dual wielding Battle Mage you can which im making on my first play through. The graphics aren't bad the animation can be a little clucky during combat but you get use to it in the first hour of cleaning up the map. The game reminds me of kingdom of amalur but you can jump in D2 even tho it is a little awkward but you get use to it after awhile. The music is well done the story and NPC's are well written. Well done voice acting.  If you have any doubts on buying it I would wait for it to go on sell, but for moi im digging it. "

												For a game that is as old as it is, DIvinity II: DKS offers a thoroughly rewarding and entrancing experience even in the face of newer games. It's fluid combat system, easter egg references, comedic value, and enticing plot line is well worth the money it takes to buy it. Play as a dragon, fly around, blow things up, and then jump down to the ground and chop things with your sword, riddle them with arrows, or blow them up with magic: it's all up to you. It's armor and weapon meshes (although they may seem to all look similar) are intricately designed, and impressive for its generation. It's facial textures leave something to be desired, although they are far from awful. Besides, you'll be too busy looking at your amazing helmet textures (unless you're playing a ranger class, sorry guys) to notice how wierd your face can look sometimes.			"

												I won’t lie…this game is frustrating, cheap, and unpolished. And yet, it is exactly what I love about lesser known action/RPGs. At first glance it almost looks like Fable or even Amalur, then you become both disappointed and immediately intrigued by what lies underneath, which is a similar feeling I had when playing Risen 2.  It’s certainly not a bad game, just lacking. Typically when you think RPG you envision a game that through good skill, strategy, planning, and good decisions overall, you triumph.However, you often get blindsided by stupid flaws within the game engine, cheap attacks by enemies, or in general don’t have enough in your favor to win by traditional methods.  You yourself have to become cheap…or it could just be that I expect a genuine straightforward fight, especially since I play as a warrior in these games. Either way, it’s an action/RPG that’s definitely worth a second look.			"

Honestly I picked up this game to have something to play until the games I really want are out later this year. I have to say I was surprised how much I liked it and I was disappointed when it was over. I was skeptical at first but it sucks you in pretty quickly. If you have a few bucks to spare, I say give it a shot. I played 65 hours and still haven't found all the things hidden around the world, and also who doesn't want to play as a dragon!

												A decent RPG with standard loot, stats progress and skilltree. What different this one from others how ever is none boring quests, there not much kill this, deliver that and repeat. Also your choises will change your game story and you may read NPC's minds with the cost of XP giving you more information or additional quests and treassures. The game is filled with humor and refrences, just the way i like it. You may save whenever you like, and with perma death you will have to. I don't know why they even had perma death with unlimited save, could as well had some kind or respawn rather than letting the player replas the content they forgot to save. I had a few problems where i managed to get into places where i shouldn't and thought that was a part of the current game but if It's not obvious, it's propably not how It's done :p It's not 100% polished, you might need to look the quests up on a wiki and it could have had a bit more different mobs but if you like RPG and enjoy conversations, decisions and story this is a game for you. A few hours will quickly pass.			"

												[note: I only played origional game and the expansion but I did not use the developer's cut bonus material]Divinity is a single player sandbox (ish) RPG by Larian Studios.  The game features a classless leveling system where points are freely spent in any of 5 trees. Hitting shelves in early 2010, the game's graphics are still solid 4 years later.  In Divinity II you will have to discern the truth from the lies in history as you hunt down and try to stop one man as he tries to ascend to the lord of evil.The Good: Divinity II really gives an RPG fan almost everything they could want.  Skill and stat points to spend, many weapons and armors to find, forge and upgrade, an excellent home base with a smithy and alchemist (among others), good music, large lands to explore and loot, a bunch of side quests and a pet to customize and build to help you on your quest.  The game was just plain fun to explore and to move through.  It is also pretty long, I spent just over 70 hours on the original (Ego Draconis) and the expansion (Flames of Vengeance) and I still didn’t have that “man, I wonder when I get to kill the boss” feeling I get on some games.  If you enjoy Might and Magic 6 & 7, Morrowind, Oblivion or other open world exploration and loot games than Divinity II will be up your alley!The Bad: The game is pretty easy once you get the hang of it ... and it isn't very hard if you don't get the hang of it either.  I played on normal difficulty and I really wish I cranked it up.  I had one tricky spot in the game but I realize that at level 30 I still had my level 16 gear on and I had not forged any weapons yet.  After forging a custom set of armor and weapons I was so powerful that I was killing everything in just a few hits; normal hits not powerful skills!  These weapons were so good I also beat the expansion at level 45 with these same level 30 weapons.  The only really hard fights were fights that had a strange gimmick.  One boss have a 45 second fear … you could go get a drink while your character ran away!  Also any monster that can heal WILL completely heal themselves at least once, the percentage based heal should not have been given to monsters!The Funny: The mindread system is really neat in this game but half its worth seems to be comedy.  When you read minds you get special quests and sometimes skill points but you also get embarrassing facts out of people.  It costs you a little experience but it is worth it to mind read; for the laughs if nothing else.The Summary:  I give Divinity II: Developer's Cut a solid 8 out of 10.  It's a great little diamond in the rough that, even 4 years after release, is a great game.  Also, since I've helped myself to many a skill list online before but never contributed, I took it upon myself to fill in the lack of skill information online for Divinity II!  This my gift to you dear reader, I have personally tested and written down each and every last level of every character skill in the game and made them available on the Wiki! Follow this URL ( http://divinity.wikia.com/wiki/Divinity_II_Skills ) and you can see the skill details and my notes on every skill! Happy Adventuring!			"

												For now, it's the best RPG I've ever played (gothic 2 is beyond classification). It has absolutly balanced and vivid word, where everybody wanted or expected somethig from you and it has your own base, my favorite part of game! It much better that same one from DD:OS, for it feels like home you want to protect. And the roster of villains/henchmen is great, they are hard to find and fun to fight. Bellegar was awesome! The lore is rich and features so many little (and not) things from previous and following games; everytime it was like nostalgiapunch. And walking through ruins of Maxos' and dragon knights' legacy was some exciting experience. And then you realize that the coolest (by lvls) loot in game belongs to dragon slayers (second game) and black ring madman (first game), badumtsssIt's tragic and comic at same time, with mindblowing twist in the end of first part, and very chamber adventure in second part. And it's great. Thanks again, Larian Team!			"

												Awesome game the dialect can be very humerous and all npc are interresting .sometimes monster fights can be ridiculously hard and very frustrating but still if you do beat it all it is very rewarding.The world is beautiful and feels alive with small animals running around and with monsters being around almost every corner you will never get bored.The story itself is also very good and worthwhile to listen to.And a big plus you get to be a dragon witch is just great even tho the fights can get a bit alike but from my standpoint it never got boring.The game is full of little things that just make it even better like with your health and with it it will say little things to have a funny edge to it All in all the game has flaws and they can be pretty large but if you can get trough that you have a wonderfull game "

												If you like story-driven RPG games, I think you'll love Divinity 2. This the second game I've played from Larian (the other being Divinity: Original Sin), and I can say, I'm extremely impressed by this studio. Larian manages to incorperate almost every character and every location on the map into a quest of some sort. This game feels extremely deep and broad in its scope, and it shines with its great expansive dialog, huge item sets, and multiple playstyles. If you're new to the series, the gameplay for Divinity 2 is a positive mix of The Witcher and Diablo with an original, epic, story and top-knotch writing. It had the rare mix of being fun to play and fun to explore. I enjoyed playing it immensely.			"

												(Ignore the 5minutes thing, Steam refuses to run it and I have to run the .exe file from my computer directly. I completed the core game and the expansion pack ""Flames of Vengeance."")Divinity 2 is an EXCELLENT game, if you haven't played the first two games. Basically their main story and lore take it up the pah-tootie. There used to be seven races, now we're down to just humans. The main villian (Damian) should not be in this dimension according to the game's lore, as he is cursed to remain in another dimension until aided by the forces of good. Etc. Etc. I could point out plot holes all day, but they only really apply to people that played Divine Divinity and Beyond Divinity.Everyone that is coming in new to this will LOVE IT to pieces. +t's an excellent example of the action/rpg genre.+The snarky writing is hilarious, Larian Studio's humor shines all the brighter with every new game.+You can read people's minds and see the ghosts of the dead!+You can turn into a dragon and burninate the country-side!+You get your own Battle Tower, complete with alchemist to make as many potions as you could ever want! <3-WAY too many sub-quests, not enough main plot stuff. I think this game wants to be an MMO.-Golden ""!"" and ""?"" for quest-givers, lame!-You can't flirt with men, but there are plenty of sexy things to say to women in this game. (Larian has a history of mistreating its female characters and players. Everything is he/him/his in the main dialogues, even if you're playing a woman.)-The ending is a SLAP IN THE FACE, and I was FURIOUS when it was over. I won't spoil it, but my GOD it sucked!7/10-- Would recommend to friends that wanna get into action rpg's. Play for the game and the hilarious writing, and ignore the ending.

												I like the Torchlight/Diablo-style games somewhat, but I love the way they did this game a lot more.  I prefer these third-person, open-world RPG's.If you like the Tomb Raider-like gamestyles then this is the game for you.  While the combat isn't exactly what most gamers would like, it was more than satisfactory to me.Personally, I hope the next Divinity game plays in this style instead of the Diablo/Torchlight style.

												The game itself is very good, it strives to make the player laugh and the soundtrack is very pleasant to listen to. There are a moderate amount of sidequests and plenty of content to find that's hidden away. Although the game feels very linear, i'd say that it's worth the buy.			"

												I played and beat this game on Xbox 360 (both Ego Draconis and Dragon Knight Saga), it is one of my personal Favorite Fantasy RPG's. If you ever wished you could TURN INTO A dragon in an RPG, welp, here yah go! The story is BEYOND BRILLIANT! The acting is good (according to my memory), there are actions you make that will affect things, one of the biggest being later in the story when you aquire the battle tower and get to choose between 2 people for each posiiton and the one you don't, dies. There is necromancy that gives you a summoned creature in this no matter you're class choice. There is the 3 basic types, Warrior, Rogue, Mage, and it branches into really cool abilitys, you can mind read people, the ghosts are weird but kinda silly and even creepy looking in this. The Developers cut gives you the ability to have full control over the game and your character, changing everything but the story, it can of course get buggy but still! I would highly recommend if you ge this to beat the game without any mods first, then go nuts on a second playthrough. I recommend this because it feels different from other RPG's and is very engaging and fun, one of those that follows mechanics of Bioare's Infamous RPG's (mostly with dioalogue choices and such), if I remember correctly your character DOES! talk as well....I could be wrong it's been a while. To give an example of some my personal favored RPG's that if you're a fan of I would recommend this as well are,Knights Of The Old Republic (1 & 2),Mass Effect (1-3),Kingdoms Of Amalur; Reckoning,Two Worlds (1 & 2),Elder Scrolls V Skyrim,there are others but you get the picture. As a bit of added thing I recommend, I'm one of those people who enjoys listening to music, finding soemthing to add my own soundtrack to games that fits perfectly well with, and when I originally played this game music That always makes me think of the game I listened to at the time was music by, Sonata Arctica and a few songs by Free Spirit. I highly recommend this game to RPG fans! REMEMBER THAT! This is not played anything like ""Divinity Original Sin"", it is a completely different story and completely different style of gameplay, Original Sin is top down and Stratedgy, this is 3rd-person real time combat.

												An excellent game with a beautiful world and outstanding musical score throughout the game. I very much appreciated the diversity in quests, often with a funny or unexpected twist, which helped keep the game fresh. Also, the world is full of (optional) secrets, but you really have to work for them, since the hints to find them are often subtle and depend on you being 'ready' to think and involve other senses. This makes it all the more rewarding. Having played 'Divine Divinity' and 'Divinity: Original Sin', I loved seeing the typical Larian humour in dialogue and cut-scenes again.Overall, one of the most fun games I have played.			"

From my Steam library I can right click on the game and go down to properties.

												Trochu nepravom pozabudnute jedno z najlepších fantasy RPG od šikovných Larian Studios. Nepoznám moc hier takej rozsiahlosti a už z mierne unavujuceho zasadenia v klasickom fantasy svete, kde Vám je dovolené, nie len draka ovládať, ale rovno sa ním stať. Divinty 2 Vám tuto možnosť ponuka a navyše spracovanú velice vkusne a hlavne hratelnostne nadpriemerne zábavne. Lietať si v podobe draka nad úrovňami, po ktorých by ste inak museli po svojich a chrlit oheň na bezbranných protivníkov pod vami, je pocitom vážne skvelým. Pokračovanie povôdne izometrického Divinity však nespolieha len na tvrdosť dračích šupín,ale vie pevne stať aj vo zvyšku hry. Ak Zrovná mohutným revom nerobíte protivníkom vrásky na čele, tak sa o to snažíte obojručným mečom, či tetivou k prasknutiu natiahnutým lukom. Divinity 2 je výbornou hrou aj v tomto ohľade a dokonca si dovolím tvrdiť, že aj v prípade absencie dračieho prvku, by stále išlo o skvelú záležitosť, hoci drak z tejto hry robí svojim spôsobom unikát medzi fantasy rpg-čkami. Polootvorený dizajn úrovni, v ktorom je vaša voľnosť limitovaná neviditeľnými stenami mi tiež vyhovoval viac, ako kompletne otvorený svet s hluchými miestami. Samozrejme toto platí hlavne pre úvod hry. Neskôr úrovne kvôli dračej nespútanosťi rozlohou nabobtnaju, i keď pravdou zostava, že úvod vie byt pomerne rozťahaný a len tak sa k obávaným krídlam nedostanete. Čo je vlastne ďalšia z vlastnosti, pre ktoré mi druhé Divinity tak utkvelo v pamäti a dodnes naň rad spomínam. Tam kde väčšina akčných RPG už pomaly končí, tam sa dobrodružstvo ohnivého dychu ešte len poriadne rozbieha. Všetky tie klasické vlastnosti tohto typu hier, ako možnosť meniť svoju výstroj za lepšie kúsky, účinnejšie zbrane, manipulácia s inventárom atd. Je to rovnako samozrejmosťou.  Vyzdvihnúť by som chcel aj vývoj samotnej postavy a rozdeľovanie bodov do všemožných schopnosti. Tie mi prišli dobre navrhnuté a väčšinu z nich budete naozaj chcieť aj odomknúť, čo vás na druhej strane zase núti plniť každý vedľajší quest, na ktorý narazíte a vďaka nemegalomansky riešeným úrovniam aj poctivo prehľadávať každý kút, inak okúzľujúcej krajinky. Kvalita rozhovorov medzi postavami a možnosti voľby odpovedi, by rovnako nemali nikoho uraziť. Urazené by ste sa nemali cítiť ani pri pohľade na ešte stále veľmi slušný vizuál hry, ktorý v čase svojej najväčšej slávy dokázal potrápiť nejedno výkonné procesorové dvoj-jadro a vtedy aktuálnu radu grafických kariet. Pre mna je Divinity 2 dodnes zlatým kletomom vo fantasy ladených RPG hrách, na ktorý stále rad spomínam. Aj keď som tých takmer 80 hodín času odohral nie v tejto rozšírenej edícií, ale ešte v tej pôvodnej.			"

												A tl;dr to start--------------------Pros: Great lines, great lore, a solidly long campaign.Cons: Frustrating gameplay, unintuitive progression and a ridiculous waste of potentialOverall: If you took the 'game' out of this game, it would be stellar.--------------------Divinity has always been strong with story and the world really nets any player willing to immerse themselves. But I am time and again flung right back out when I find myself fighting the game itself instead of enemies, puzzles or the like. A myriad of problems ranging from punishingly steep character progression costs, many quests requiring an hour or more of searching for a button in a badly lit room or being forced to trudge through huge enemy level jumps.The game is meant to be difficult, but there is a difference between punishing a wrong choice and requiring the player to save every few seconds for fear of being trapped in an area twice their level. It is a roller coaster of geart narratives, hilarious and deep characters, and heaps of dissapointment. For every heartfelt chuckle or legitimate moment of curiousity I had there was a moment or three of a frustrated sigh, loading the last save and trying once again to complete some menial task or fight. There were a few moments where the narrative progression almost made it all worth it, but sadly the game's peaks do not outweigh its trenches. Worst of all, the second bit (Flames of Vengeance) greeted the player with a choice, end sequence and resolution that, to put it quite blunty, felt like it was pulled from the nearest rancid pile of trash, slapped on for the sake of completion.I am incredibly dissapointed to not recomend this game, as the world, characters and overall plot are some of the best I've seen in a fantasy RPG. But the fumbling in basic gameplay, design and simply the actual 'game' bits of this title ruin it as an overall experience.			"

The ""logic task"" with the statues is more than i can handle! I wish the creators die slowly and painfully and rot in a pit full of the most slow and painfull poisonous animal. I hate you guys! Die!

It plays basically like an MMO and i enjoyed the skill customization aspect, you basically can build a character the way you want so if you want to be a warrior with healing and necromancy spells you can be that.

												Divinty 2 managed to keep me interested in its gameplay for at least 10 hours, which can be rare in single player games.  During that 10 hours, I found my self very interested, however the only thing I felt was lacking was the Combat system.  It felt too simple for me; and while its been quite some time between writing this review and playing it; I still felt like it was overall a good game.  I did not stick through till the end of this game, mainly because it started feeling like an MMO.  I was just running around doing the same things over and over again, and that was all I could look forward to doing in the future of the game.  Still, I recommend this game, as I know that there are many gamers out there who enjoy this; and I did find some enjoyment within it.  It was certainly worth the low price I had paid for it, as it was on sale at the time.			"

												One of my fav traditional RPG games on the PC; supprisingly it has a ton of replay value at least for me which is not somthing I tend to say about linear RPGs though I do love them. The developers cut goes and adds a ton of replay value by letting you muck around with console comands spawning monsters and all sorts of stuff but even with out that the story is good the progression is solid the only thing to complain about is they havent released a sequal in the same style yet.

												Overall pretty solid game, picked it up on sale for about $4. A bit steep on the difficulty level, so probably best to start on the easiest setting to get used to it. Nice dialogues, and a good story as far as I've seen.Only bad thing about it I can say is the somewhat problematic character movement, you'll get sometimes stuck on terrain or bridges for no apparent reason, and doing precise tactical combat moves is pretty hard.Especially the getting stuck problem you'll encounter a lot early in the game, so as a ranger you'll have to save often there, or there's bound to be frustration.If you're into RPGs give it a spin, it does that part pretty well. Stay away though if you are short-fused when it comes to little glitches :-)			"

												Let me get a couple things out of the way. First, I don't consider this to be a ""bad"" game in spite of the glaring red mark, but I can't really see myself recommending it to anyone either. Second there are some pretty terrible graphics issues right out of the gate, and if you do decide to pick it up I strongly encourage you to check out the pcgaming wiki page for it, as well as updating all relevant software. I admit that I haven't finished the game at this point, but I've also lost any interest in continuing.The combat in Divinity 2 is pretty comparable to something like World of Warcraft, you get a skillbar and a number of passive(dull minor % buffs) and active skills. The skills you can learn are limited by only your character level, which is pretty cool as it allows you to be open and creative with how you build your character, avoid the various crap skills, etc. When actually putting them into practice though, I found that it was the usual tedious rinse repeat of skill rotations, and for the most part enemies were easily avoided, especially early on. After a few hours in the game you'll run into quite a large number of enemies whose attacks cannot be avoided though: spell casters with instant hit point blasts, archers whose normal attacks can usually be avoided but whose special skills curve through the air magically tracking you. In fact a couple of the more annoying boss battles I experienced were against archers who had an undodgable stun (something like four seconds!), that they followed up with an explosive shot and various other attacks. The first of these encounters I had to cheese by exploiting line of sight, the second one I eventually realized could be blinded, and I wound up reloading until I got a successful blind before being stunned and gibbed. Ugh, and enemy healers, just annoying. Or maybe I'm just a bit jealous because when I got out of tougher fights in the earlier portions of the game I had to prance about looking for something else to do while waiting for my Hitpoints and Mana to ever so slowly crawl back up. Thankfully they seem to recover when you're in dialogs and inventory screens.The autosave function is a joke. In my playthrough I could count on it triggering maybe once every 3 hours. It's a bit painful to discover that after coming from more modern titles, but then the quicksave instinct quickly returns...and allows for any imaginable amount of save scumming you are comfortable with. Spend XP to mindread someone then reload? Sure, why not? I actually made an effort not to do this, but it still feels like a design oversight.Ah, but you do get to turn into a dragon...after several hours carving through the first few areas of the game. It is great at first...buuuut it got old pretty quick for me. Dragon gameplay is completely segregated from human gameplay, which admittedly is kinda necessary to keep the human side relevant without putting in something like a ""dragon gauge"" or whatever. Still, it's kinda silly to not even be able to see enemies on the ground while you're in dragon mode. In one instance I was flying around inside a giant cavern disabling barriers to get at a necromancer, when I dropped the last one I was expecting to be able deliver a big ol' dragon ♥♥♥♥♥smack, but no one was there. I transform to human and land and the necromancer is there ready to take me on. Great. Transform back into dragon, he runs off and disappears into the aether. Very disappointing. At first playing as the dragon felt empowering and kind of awesome, but then it quickly felt very easy and also inconsequential, because nothing I did as a dragon was going to make my human life much better.The writing kinda reminds me of various bioware games as far as the overall plot goes, but without much of the binary  meter driven morality. Most of the dialog options didn't seem to matter all that much though, and seemed to amount to a binary I am or am not being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ here. NPCs are eh, believable if not charming, fully voiced except for the main character which is impressive. Their animations seem pretty spastic at times for my taste, but it's pretty good still. No NPC party members outside of some short quest related instances, at least for the duration of my playthrough. I feel like that would've made a large difference in my impression of the game too, so more's the pity.The game holds up fairly well visually and has some amusing if simple puzzles, and clever tricks here and there. There is definitely some respectable take away if you can stand the lackluster combat and mechanics, being trapped in a room after quicksaving, etc.			"

												This is a womderful game. The quests themselfs are the highlight, most are excellent, well above the norm, with witty writing and interesting choices. The open level design as well allows the player freedom to explore. Now only on level ground but elevated surfaces making the enviorments feel diffrent from other fantasy games. The main weak point is the combat: it's highly imbalanced. The start of th e game is difficult: with enemies able to one hit kill the player on higher difficulties, howver, as the game progresses, they begin to barely dent you. leveling up feels pointless, even on nightmare. It also includes the expansion pack ""Flames Of Vengence"" that is equally high in quility with excellent quests and hours of content. A solid RPG, recommended for those who like to think when it comes to quests and exploring enviroments. "

												I honestly have mixed feelings about this game, considering its age, its very secure in its own mythos. It is not obviously trying to be anyhting else but a modified divinity game, no longer top down but third person.  That beig said, it gave a sense of scale that just didn't live up to the hype. I found myself repeating tasks, combat became stale fast, no new tricks and it is a long game but I found myself using only 3 or 4 techniques and thats it. The game has no real LEGENDARY weapons and armor, stuff that takes more than a guanlet to complete. Buying weapons and armor is pointless beacuse what you find or loot is much better. Over all I will give it my recomendation but only a 5/10, get it cheap and keep an open mind.			"

												This game has some of the most hilarious writing I've seen in a video game since I played the original fallouts and nwn games.  While I feel the combat is very lacking (the game makes up for it by letting you turn INTO A DRAGON), the game more than makes up for it in the story telling.  Well, in most cases.  I've always felt that the background lore to the divinity series is largely nonsensical and at times moronic, but the quests, dialogue and character interaction have always been top notch.  This is probably their best game in that regard.The expansion really solidifies that, with the new person stuck in your head being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wizard instead of a certain mumble mumble spoilers.  Whoever did the voice acting for this guy nailed it, and whoever wrote the character deserves an award.  Alternatively the 'good' wizard is a raving lunatic whos irritating insanity meant I could never side with him.If you make the right choices, you get a certain bonus boss at the end of the game who chides the actual boss for being stupid and not getting you on their side.  It was possibly the funniest thing in the entire game.  Great writing, good graphics, meh combat, and satisfying soundtrack.   Worth a purchase.			"

												This game is awesome. I picked it up and Beyond Divinity and Divine Divinity for five dollars during a steam sale. Best five dollars I've ever spent (although honestly, I would pay the regular $20 price tag.) I keep expecting the game to end but after 31 hours (with 95% of the sidequests finished) I realize I have only now hit the half-way point. Which is awesome. Lots of games end by the time you're powerful enough. A lot of reviews complain that the levelling doesn't make sense or the controls are awkward. If you've played Divinity: Original Sin and enjoyed it, then you'll probably enjoy this game. The writing or story isn't as good as in Original Sin but its still decent. The levelling is complicated in that if you don't want to start over a few times until you find a good build you should just look up a character guide. I spent 20 hours in Original Sin finding a good character set up, so I just went straight to a character guide. As far as the combat, its not the most polished, but its functional, works well, and is enjoyable.The best part of the game is where you get to turn into a mother ♥♥♥♥ing dragon. I didn't even know you could do that when I bought the game. Its awesome. It makes travelling around really fast and if your human character is a little awkward when it comes to fighting, its the complete opposite for the dragon. Everything is smooth and fast and exciting.I'd give it an 8/10. Definitely worth the $20 price from a game length aspect but you can easily pick it up for a lot less since it goes on sale pretty frequently.			"

												Very good game, I don't know why it's not more famous:- The graphics (from 2009) are still very good in 2016- The story is interesting- There are lots of humour in dialogs- The game has a good lifetimeThe only things I can regrets are:- You are too powerfull if you well optimize your build/weapon/armor at the end game (yes, yes, it's not really annoying)- I want more dragon phases :-D (Making of video supplied explains a lack of budget)			"

												Being one of old Dragon Slayers, you will start as a recruit and search for one of the last Dragon Knights after your training is complete. But not everything is as it seems and not everyone is who (s)he pretends to be.Be careful and watch your steps!

												English isnt my Native Language so please Excuse my grammar/Spelling mistakesDivinity 2 beeing the 3rd game in the Divinity Series after Divine Divinity ( one of my favourite RPGs of all time) and Beyond Divinity ( cant really say too much about it although my memories about it dont say it was nearly as good as DIvine Divinty), Showing us that counting to 3 is obviously not amongst the talents of Larian Studios....But now for the Review:The Bad:The fist thing in the game you will notice is the Ridicoulus Animations, not really bad, but kinda stupid looking. it goes from really stupid jump animations for female Characters to Roundhouse kicks in Melee combat until you get the 2 handed Weapons.A sommersault for standart frontal moving atack with 2 handen weapons looks REALLLY Stupid and shows that either the creators had no ideas how someone uses a sword or just said "" we dont want anyone taking our melee fighters seriously anyways"" But that is just the tip of the Iceberg. The Combat can at times be really frustrating due to Enemies Stunlocking the player for large amounts of Time. And Some Balancing Issues that make the game really easy after a while due to a health regeneration that constantly heals more life per second than the best Health potion in the game, (at about 50 health per second at any time) Which i felt i needed to get after getting stunlocked constantly while fighting 10 + enemies at a time  and  thus not beeing able to even  use Health Potions due to stunlock.Ranged Combat got Boring really fast for me since you have next to no influence to your aiming, which does not mean you cannot hit the enemie you want, but skill in aiming doesnt really get rewarded (by extra critical hits on head or something like that), since it kinda auto aims, so i changed to melee heavy Character after about 3 hours of playtime.Another big Issue with the combat is that you cannot possibly know which class your enemie has based of his appearance. you meat enemy healers that charge at you with 2 handSwords as much as you meet them with bow and arrow, or Summoners that dual wield Sword/mace , or 2 hand weapon or bow and arrow. the worst thing happening to me in regardto this was in one of the Flying Fortresses where Enemies with the Skin of Deamons were shown to me as ""Wizards""- The sometimes Unclear Difference between Summoner , healer , Soccerer , Wizzard and Ranger Doesnt help Either  as it makes focusing dangerous enemies unecesaryly hard and makes the Combat sometimes Very Annoying, Confusing and Frustrating.Then there is the Story:The Games Story Suffers From some Really inconsistent Quality in Writing, event tough there are a lot of good written quests and characters in the game the overarching main-storyline suffers from many issues, plotholes and flaws. While some Characters From Previous Games return, most importantly the Wizard Zandalor that already Appeared in Divinie Divinity, zandalors main role is to breach the fourth wall, and spouting some things at the player as if it a 6th School Play , And A ""Villan"", a Term that i use rather loosely, that does appear as if he ist cut straight from a James Bond 007 movie, always appearing in front of the player, just to dump a few henchmen in the room and disappear leaving you to ""die"" in his Deathtrap, Which you of course escape rather easily, and after the third time he appears you just laugh at him for beeing so incompetent and it becomes impossible to take him seriously due to him beeing about as much of a threat as Team Rocket. the Load Screen advice to Run from him whenever you see him becomes a complete mockery once you finish the game and notice  there is not a single fight against him in the whole game instead they recycle almost all the previous boss mosters at the end of a game to make for a ""final boss fight"" Many other of my Complaints about Plotholes and mistakes in the Story i wont elaborate in this review to keep it spoiler free.The end comes a bit sudden and is a bit confusing, as the Add-on automatically started i didnt even notice the base-game ended at first.Aditonally:The Game feels really unfinished or rushed at many points, which gets really obvious when you reach Aleroth and Notice that the big City got demoted to a Linear ""run in, kill enemies, run out"" mission, only to be expanded to its ""orignial size"" to be explored in the ""flames of vengance"" addon. also a large part of the world map seems to have been planned out as accessable area, but was never included in the game. In a Developers Vidoe included in the ""developers cut"" they say that they were restriced by the xbox360s abilitys at the time of development.After so Much Bad i had s to say about the game you may aks: ""why does steam tell me you Recommend the game?""The Good : Exploring the World is A LOT of Fun. If it is on foot with a good freedom of movement due to high jumps and only few ""invisible walls"". Or Soaring through the Skies as a Dragon, Its A lot of Fun Gliding through the beautiful Landscapes in Dragon From or exploring theground on foot. Additonally the world is Filled with great written and funny Characters and encounters throughout the whole world. at every Cornor you find an intresting side quest that motivates you to immerse yourself into the gameworld.where the Main story suffers from many mistakes, the sidequest are made excellent and the real  core of this game. Especially a  travellign summoner named Bellegar always got a chuckle out of me and i really enjoyed the encounters with him or his deeds in the world. As well as the White Killer Rabbit (undoubtably a refernce to Monty Python and the Holy Grail)Also There are Bunch of Riddles mixed in the Gameplay that really enrich the dungeons and gameplayexperience.Also the game has a few neat nods to Divine Divinity that i really enjoyed. for example the talking skeleton that you could kill by making him think about what exaclty holds him together with nearly exactly the same words as a conversation between 2 skeltons in DivineDivinity.Or a magical whishing well that complaints about another magical well that got arrogant after it fulfilled a wish to the hero of Divine Divinity.All those things Made the world feel really alive and even tough the game was Annoing and frustrating at times i just couldnt stop Playing the game (which is a really good thing that not many games manage to do for me), beacause i was too much involved into the Game world. And all in all  i had a great time with the  Game and can really recommend it to others for playingConclusion:A Game with MANY issues, but Enough good Aspects and fun elements to make it Really worth your Time.i can  recommend the game to everyone who likes to dive into a fantastic world and explore every single part and sidequest of it and can turn a blind eye on the issues of the game.I Hope i could give you an insight to my experience of the game and i wish you as much fun with the game as i had :D			"

												One of the MOST underrated RPGs ever. The game has a very good “RGP” feel, progression/leveling is terrific and gives you a good feel of advancement of character and always keeps you interested in the “next level”.Combat is RPG like but has a slight feel of action-RPG, and this shouldn’t scare you off is you don’t like action RPGs, since it’s done very well, and still feels like you are playing an RPG like say (Dragon Age). To the same point if you like, more “action” in your RPG then you won’t be disappointed either.Different combat systems are fantastic, you can do some mix match as well to go from magic/combat/ranged, it’s done very well, and this gives good strength to the replaybility factor, since you want to experience.If you like real time RPGs and you don’t have this game, what are you waiting for, this is a hidden GEM of a game. •	Loot system is excellent, there is enchantment of weapons/gear as well•	You can morph into a dragon (and level up your dragon mode)•	Has a fully capable console, which allows you to “cheat” or do some other interesting things with the game.•	Story is 8.5/10•	Combat 10/10•	Visuals/Art style 9.5/10 (yes the game is older, but if you ask me it still stands up nicely)•	Replay ability 10/10•	Sound/Music 9/10•	Overall 9/10 "

												**WARNING SLIGHT/MODERATE SPOILERS**The combat is moderately simple but bland, yet the environments and the fun of the game is in the latter half of the adventure when you can explore the game via transforming into a dragon. The loot is fairly cool as well but the textures could use a lot of work. And finally, the dev kit that is included is HILARIOUS to use. I urge people, if they own this game already to just turn it on and fiddle with it  for awhile and have a decent laugh as you zoom across the screen or transform into Damian's Drake form and laugh as nobody can hit you while flying extremely derpy.

												A fully immersive game that will keep you out of trouble for a moderate amount of time while you learn out the game mechanics, find your groove and playstyle and enjoy the different ""modes"" as well. Definitely not a boring hack and slash.Asside from a few map glithes that meant saves were pretty much the only way to complete this game, it is a real keeper.			"

												I beat this game. That probably doesn't mean much to you, but I typically do not finish my games. I loved playing Divinity II. Yes you can turn into a dragon at times, and yes that is AMAZING. There's also a nice story, and fighting, and some minor puzzles hidden about. Make the game challenging if you're looking for a challenge, or turn down the difficulty and just enjoy it.  Cons: Can't always be a dragon.			"

												Tqake everything you think you know about RPG games,  YOU KNOW THE WAY THEY ARE DESIGNED AND PLAYED,  All the dungeon crawling, leveling up and game play and put them in a bag and toss them into the trash.   Because the way you see and play and invole yoursel with the game will be changed forever.     It starts out with you being a new dragon slayer and going to a place called Farglow to learn the basics of dragon slaying.   You will choose what class you want to be.  There are 3 here to choose from: MAGE,  FIGHTER,and RANGER.  SOME HAVE SAID THAT CHARACTER CHOICE AND CREATION RUN ALONG THE SIMPLE.   I think you will develop your character through the choice of over 30 skills which are devided into the three mentioned clases plus a priest class.   The basic development fall into two basic ways to develop your character.   You can develop a  character using skills from his class or you cat develop one using skill choices from several classes.This will let you develop a character that suits your style.  A single class character will be stronger and a character developed using skill from more than one class  will be more visital,    I started as a fighter but soon saw the advantageto being good with a bow.  Keep in mind that your class choice  will give you some skills to start the game depending on the class.     The skills are devided into 2 types active and passive.  You can have as many passive skills as yo wish,  The active skills and other items are placed in a 8 hotkey display at the bottom of the screen.  You can have more active skill and special abilities but only 8 will be in the hotkeys. The special ability's things you can do,     Each time you gain a level you get 6 stat points  that you can increase one of your 5 ststs.  You also get 1 skill points to purchase a new skill or improve an exsisting skill,   Each skill has 5 levels till later in the game.  Take note with just onepoint/turn you will have to learn the hard way that once you make a choice it can not be changed till later in the game.      Because of the way this game levelup and does not use the game levels are based on your level some interesting things happen.  If you get into a situation where your character is higher that the NPC monsters then you may have a battle where the NPC gets his lickls and you get a small number of xp points or eve 0,  Which  leads to the practice of witholding stat points and even skill points till you come acxross NPC's who give you more xp points.  This may sound strange but in playing the gqame it does work.  I like it because it limits the practice of ""Power Leveling"" The way the game levels is something you should take at face value like many of the game  mechcanics work in the game if you just usr them and in time it will let you see what a marvolus game this is...It is hard but ther is always a way.   Now the combat will really be frustrating at first.  You do not have nice turn based combat because it is real time.  When you get into the second part of the game in the begining section you will encounter large groups of hostile NPC'sand will have to develop ways to deal with them.   Once an area or a group of units is dead they stay that way.There is the run in ....kill a couple..aned try to get out into a safe place. save and repeat.     Different movement skills are used in the game to solve problems and quests.  Once again this is not the normal thing in many RPG's.   For example  there are many kinds of containers to open and a bright yellow light will occur if  something can be opened including  some empty containers.  Now depending on the angle of you mouse and how your character is this  yellow light may not always show up. Moving you character slowly in each direction will help.  Also a messahe will apear next to the hotkey area and tell you there is something to open or use or take.  One of the more difficult things you will have to learn is jumping.  Many quests have platforms to jump from one to the next and some platfors arte moving,  There is a learning curve if you are using a mouse and keyboard (controlers  are not enabled for the most part   There are many wepons, armor inchantments, charms, and pluses for stats that you will be able to use depending on you level.  There are some who do not like the armor methods used in the game because they can't  get matching sets.  I find no ewason to comment on this because the absurdity is plain to see. It is possible to taloy your character in many different way to reach a certain result.  If you find a situation that call for an archer, maage or whatever then you cause rifferent selections of eqyuipment, to get the job done. I think this is a great game with many vqarid and challanging  problems.   It never fails to have me shaking  my head.  The graphics are just right for the game theyare neither to strong or two week.   One thing that I have never seen in an RPG is the notebook tab.  Her yoyu wil;l find several very useful  features,   Thgere is one that has all of your conversionsso if you are a little confused about speaking to a NPC it is all there every blessed word.  There is one that has every combataction and the result and there is one that has all the NPC's that you have dispached.  The quests are handled in a list of completed quests and open quests you are workinmg on.  A nice feature is the quests that are open are in different colors so you can tell when one is compleated or  can't be compleated or is reasdy to complete.  There are things I may not like but I do not mention them unless they seem out of place.  I write this review to tell the reader how the game works.  There are games I do not like because I can see that they could have done better but did not due to such thingss as cost of development, or are just game put on the market to make money.  I do not play games in development or bata  games bedcause I have better things to do.   I do not comment on other reviews because I believe they are voicing ther opinion which I see has no place in a review.   Expressing you opinion is not the way I think a review should be done.  I could be wrong and people might take this review as being to high and mighty, but it is just the way I see it.    "

After being greatly disappointed in EVERY Divinity game there was, I wasn't expecting much of this.
But it turned out being the best one of the whole series!
Finally no overhead view or dialogue only game, this was the real RPG I was looking for.
Third person RPG as a dragon slayer with the feeling of Guild Wars and Skyrim.
Both this game and the expansion Flames of Vengeance (included in the Directors Cut) were spectacular!

												First of all the game has an issue that makes it ipossible to play unless you install some kind of specific driver for Nvidia PhysX. Not everyone can figure that out by themselves so it's a big minus for a large consuming product like a video game. The games must be ready to play on any machine no matter what. The second thing s that the game it's pretty dull and cliche for a 2012 game evn for a 2005. The Elder Scrolls Oblivion is far more better and it's from 2006.

												Well this is something I try not to do often. Usually when I review a game I like to have at least 5+ hours or if it has an end I'd prefer to have made it passed the games story, but I just can't play this anymore. So with my meager 3 hours I'm just goint to put my thoughts down. Also a warning that'll hopefully let you know to take my review with a grain of salt. I'm not a huge fan of most of these rpg games in general, in a broader sense I'm not a fan of games that make you do everything alone. So this game had a strike against it for me right off the bat, because no matter how important they make your quests/missions/whatever sound you're always 100% alone (aside from your temporary summons).Also, I know this is common in games with questing but I'm just saying. If you're trying to make someone feel a part of an epic story, the least epic feeling thing you can do is make them spend loads of time saving pigs from slaughter, or helping some farmers wife leave her husband. They feel more like chores than quests.Pros:Even though it's an older game it's graphics aren't terrible so it's not eye destroying if you're used to todays quality.The story sounded like it could be pretty interesting from what little I got of it.Cons:Animations are ♥♥♥♥♥. Jumps are awkward, attacks are clumsy, and people animate when they talk to you like they're having a siezure.Combat is boring, this was a big one for me. You have to fight your way passed everything and even if you have quite a few skills I couldn't see it being more fun.Difficulty is all over. I was killing things easily that were 1-2 levels under me, taking them on a few at a time, but as soon as I fight 2 things on level even though they were ranged and I dodged most of their attacks I was getting melted. When they did hit me it was dealing loads of damage and I don't know how I could've prevented it. I was done with the quests I could do before the area so leveling was out of the question, and the gear I could've bought was hardly any better than what I had on.Voice acting is mediocre at best, there's some decent dialog but it's mostly bland and the voices were giving me a headache.The undead I could summon were butchered in seconds, the skills I unlocked were apparently the worst I could get (I'm good at choosing like that) since they hardly made a difference and auto attacking was basically all I did.All in all I'd recommend looking for something else, I really wish I'd have played one less hour so I could request a refund for this. I'll never touch it again.			"

												A friend got me this game as a Steam gift, so I figured I'd try it out! Here're my thoughts on Divinity II:Pros- The dialogue is actually pretty humorous, and it doesn't come off as if it's trying too hard. The guards at the beginning are funny. :P- There's only a moderate level of customization options, BUT you can change your name, appearance, and even your gender and class at any time.- The ability to mindread in exchange for experience adds a cool layer of depth you don't normally see to character interaction.- Pretty good about not being entirely linear. You find yourself wandering around a lot, doing what you want to do, until you run into enemies that are too high for your level. That's really the main metric that makes you stop from venturing into certain areas.- I'M A FRIGGEN DRAGON GUYS DUUUDENeutral- There's a pretty even number of memorable and unmemorable characters you run into.Cons- The game isn't incredibly engaging. It feels like it's missing something, but I can't put my finger on what.- The music is very sub-par and almost unfitting. I find myself pretty much always listening to external music through Spotify or something while playing.- Melee is wayyy harder than being a ranger or mage. That's not too rare in RPGs, but it's pretty much by leagues and leagues here.- The lack of romances makes me sad, just because I love those. Also, everyone reacts to you the exact same, no matter your race or gender.- A lot of the guards' faces look exactly the same.- You frequently get trapped in areas where the level around you is way too high and you have little way of knowing until you're already engaged in a fight. Some say the game is just ""hard,"" but there's a pretty clear difference between needless reloads and a game being truly, properly challenging.So there you have it. Divinity II is fun in its own way, but I can't play for longer than an hour or two at a time, for whatever reason. The game isn't engaging for long periods, I suppose.Atmosphere: 7/10Fun: 6/10Frustration: LowReplay Value: LowControls: IntuitiveRating: 5/10			"

												I liked this game when it worked. There many lengthy processes for fixing it your self. But it's been in this state for to long. It may work the first time you play. Soon as you start a new game or try to play a second time forget it. Look into the forms and you see all the problums this game has. I would have to adivise you to just stay away from it at this point. If these issues are fixed then it's worth your time and money.			"

												A very underrated game, Divinity II captured my attention a few years ago when Dragon Knight's saga had been released. The combat is relatively simple, yet it feels very sweet, especially near the endgame when you're taking on literal hordes of enemies, cutting them all down with superior damage.While I found the experience very fun, I can't help but mention glaring problems I had with the game, for one, the skill system was clearly geared for only damage dealers, there was nothing that I felt, would've fit a support/tank build, (which is understandable, since this is a SP game), but it got worse as I went forward, realizing how stupidly powerful I was with Dual wielding vs. any other set (especially against Bows, Bows really fell short in the end game). More specifically, the life drain skill was incredibly powerful at later levels, to the point where my high damage, low defense character was clearing rooms and never having to pop a potion or use a heal.Another issue I had was that the game felt clearly rushed, as the environment and characters all felt very shallow, with little of anything that you could actually do, outside of reading everyone's mind or doing missions. With very little characterization of non main plot characters, (with exception to a few), I felt that completing side missions was really just an excuse to get more XP, and since monsters don't respawn (until the endgame) its really the only choice. Though that in itself is a good thing, I just wish the side-missions felt a little more fun and engaging.Despite all this, I would reccommend D2 to a friend, because the main storyline itself, is very engaging and quite good. I hope Larian (the developers) will make a D3 and get the backing of a larger publishing company so they can use the additional resources and time that they deserve for their works.			"

												A very underrated game, Divinity II captured my attention a few years ago when Dragon Knight's saga had been released. The combat is relatively simple, yet it feels very sweet, especially near the endgame when you're taking on literal hordes of enemies, cutting them all down with superior damage.While I found the experience very fun, I can't help but mention glaring problems I had with the game, for one, the skill system was clearly geared for only damage dealers, there was nothing that I felt, would've fit a support/tank build, (which is understandable, since this is a SP game), but it got worse as I went forward, realizing how stupidly powerful I was with Dual wielding vs. any other set (especially against Bows, Bows really fell short in the end game). More specifically, the life drain skill was incredibly powerful at later levels, to the point where my high damage, low defense character was clearing rooms and never having to pop a potion or use a heal.Another issue I had was that the game felt clearly rushed, as the environment and characters all felt very shallow, with little of anything that you could actually do, outside of reading everyone's mind or doing missions. With very little characterization of non main plot characters, (with exception to a few), I felt that completing side missions was really just an excuse to get more XP, and since monsters don't respawn (until the endgame) its really the only choice. Though that in itself is a good thing, I just wish the side-missions felt a little more fun and engaging.Despite all this, I would reccommend D2 to a friend, because the main storyline itself, is very engaging and quite good. I hope Larian (the developers) will make a D3 and get the backing of a larger publishing company so they can use the additional resources and time that they deserve for their works.			"

												Game has it's strong points, but I am reviewing this in the light of its combat. I only played the melee build and I personally think its terrible. Why? first off, well you can't really use the shield to block. You just use it only as a secondary weapon that adds armor which defeats the purpose of the thing. Second, it lacks any depth whatsover and just wants you to click click click to win. Sure dodging and jumping is there, but the usefulness of those mechanics only truly shine against ranged enemies. Also, if you have a low-end PC and expect to handle this game well because it's old, Don't. The game runs terribly with my laptop, and my laptop handled skyrim decently to say the least. Overall, if you want to play for the story, go do it. it's worth it. But me being a combat centered fella, I cannot recommend this. (You can turn into a dragon tho so thats cool)			"

												I know I didn't get far into the game, but what I did play was the most absolutely bland experience. Music, quests, skill system, battle system, world map. Nothing was one bit appealing; it just felt like a bunch of low-effort implementation of necessary mechanics. They weren't bad, really, but nothing seemed the least bit *good*. If this game were a meal, it would be plain rice and soggy vegetables, and a shapeless chunk of lean ground beef cooked medium-well. With water on the side. I have no troubles eating these food items, but without anything special being added to the plate, I would never wish to eat it as a meal.The one outlier was the animations. Absolute negative for me. From walking to jumping, spellcasting to talking, everything the characters did made me want to gauge out my eyeballs. Oh, and also the main menu felt like it was locked at 15-20fps. Increasing frame rate cap did nothing to help it, but the ingame was just fine.It's kind of sad because the story seemed like it would be pretty good if I could trudge through the painfully mundane game.

												Okay I played Divinity 2 Ego Draconis for the Xbox 360. It had so many game breaking bugs that there is no way it was tested, at all. I bought this game hoping the PC version would play better I mean you can patch a PC version alot more right? Apparently not. If my first few seconds in the PC version is any indicator to how less broken the game is (froze in place and crashed) I'm opting out and I would suggest you do too.Ignoring all the game breaking bugs I LOVED the idea of this game. However the execution outside of the bugs leaves a LOT to be desired. The dificulty curve is terrible early on. You'll be getting stomped on everywhere you go. The whole becoming a dragon thing won't happen till the halfway point of the game, and then it's rather underwhelming, and you start getting stomped on again at this point cause now you're a bigger target. that can't attack much more than before.Also the game felt very Stingy with Exp. I had to squeze out every quest I could find to level up later on and I can't remember if was because enemies don't respawn or cause they don't give exp. I don't know, if you REALLY want to buy this game be prepared for a LOT of bugs and looking for solutions to them online. Also SAVE very often and on a LOT of different slots because there are some bugs that can break your entire file and will keep happening unless you reload to a very specific point before that bug hits.

												I really wanted to and tried to like this game because it is part of the Divinity series but its just fails to be entertaining or worthwhile. It's an ARPG with bad and sloppy combat, and the majority of gameplay is endless tedious trudging through generic cartoonish uninteresting MMO themepark landscapes that suffer from invisible wall syndrome. The dragon flight mode is a painful chore. At times the quest system and narrative does a completely inadequate job at explaining things and not in a good way.Maybe the console version was more responsive, but there's no native controller support on PC. That might be acceptable for an action-oriented title of its age if it's mouse/keyboard control weren't so sloppy. It's just not responsive enough for an action RPG, and even using it with the Steam Controller cannot fix the underlying problems. It doesn't work as an action title and there's not enough meat on the bones for it to stand alone as an RPG.There is some good to be said about it which is why I tried to stick with it so long. It has really compelling and polished weapon, armor, magic and skill progression and loot systems. A game built around those alone could be really good. Too bad they feel completely wasted on the rest of this game. Voice acting and music is passable, and there are some really good ideas such as being able to build a companion creature out of parts, and the staff of various servants at your base.The generic writing and quests might have been adequate enough if the game held up as an action title with decent combat, but at least on PC it does not, leaving no real reason to keep playing.

												What a mess of a game. The quest system and map are completely broken. You often find yourself with no quests in the todo list and need to wander in the map until you stumble upon the quest giver. When you do have quests, they rarely are shown in the map, and you have to do some more wandering until you stumble upon the location.Sometimes you're given quests that you can't possibly complete because you don't have a required item or skill, which would be fine if the game would tell you what you need, but it doesn't, so you'll have to guess, backtrack and grind until you get it.Quest givers may move around, so good luck in finding them after doing the quest to get your reward.Summary:This might have been good enough in 2009, but all the wandering, backtracking and dumb character/enemy leveling just doesn't cut it nowadays. Stay away. "

												It could have been a good game, but:-sometimes it is too horrid.-annoying magic item system: 'magic' and 'charms' are unnecessary duplications of the same. It is OK if you have to calculate which item is the better to wear but after a while it becomes annoying if there is no reason of complication. It just wants to seem detailed but it is not.-schematic NPCs-ugly graphics of the flying fortresses-no dragon form option in the expansion except the last battlePro:-sometimes there are funny conversations but not too often.-when you can turn to dragon that it is good (but why can not you destroy normal mobs in dragon form?)Overall you can buy better RPGs for the price of this.

												After spending about 30 hrs in the game, i've give up playing it anymore. Thr majority of the reason is that i couldn't remember ANY memorable moments in the game. There was so many potential in this game, but the director eventually failed it all.When I was going to become a Dragon Slayer, I felt not excitment.When I was infected(smile::) by a dragon, and forced to become a Dragon Knight, the biggest turning point in the game!! I felt nothing.When I firstly transform myself into a dragon! What did i feel?...nothing!!The plot, the ingame cutscene doesn't deliver any immerse FEELING at all.Then the next worst thing is the combat. Game designers should have made the combat an enjoyable experience, because you'd spend almost 95% of gaming time in combat. But in reality, the combat is so lame and tiresome. I just keep luring enemies back and finish them off one by one, no strategy required.I'll give this game 7.5/10, the game is playable but not enjoyable.			"

												This is a pretty shallow game, not sure why it's getting such great reviews but Original Sin is vastly superior from what I played at a friend's. I selected to play as a Mage (after the game failed to really explain what I was supposed to do). So far I feel like it's a lot of pretty bland combat, dull quests and shabby voice acting. There's little world-building and you can barely interact with any of it save for some plants and the animals/monsters you kill. There's not much in the way of dialogue and not a lot to keep you interested in this generic high fantasy world with limited skills and almost zero explanation of how your skill tree/spells work. That's all without mentioning the complete lack of character customisation. I don't feel I'm really playing any role except for errand boy here.If you want some mindless grindy action and running back and forth there's this and that Reckoning game that people also liked, but if you want something a bit richer then try Divinity: Original Sin, which was rad.

												If you do buy this game 1.read every spoiler you can otherwise you will be running around for hours trying to figure out wtf to do. One of the devs on this game HATES the player. 2. stop playing after you take battle tower because the game is a mess after that. The map becomes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with no go zones for no good reason and turning into a dragon is mostly a drag. And you wont know what is going on anyway and the lore is sub par so...for the record - I love divine divinity and I enjoyed DOS for 50 hours worth (all larian games). Also I love and have played most of the great rpgs and this isn't one of them. If you follow 1 and 2 then you will get 20-25 good hours out of the game. It has 20 very fun hours in it.  Again, read all the spoilers because the hard part of the game is the bad game design not the puzzles. Dark souls this game is not. You will get no sense of accomplishment by grinding through the various FUs that the devs have given you.			"

												This is a terrible game that I can't recommend to anyone. It's clearly not finished. It has no story or plot whatsoever (I have no clue what the story and goal is, after playing for hours on end). It has cookie-cutter enemies throughout. Quests are boring and confusing at best. The dialogue is laughable, in a bad sense. There are strange and unexplained castles in the sky that contain only enemies and no quests and no relevant loot. Why are they at all in the game? Just for levelling up? That's not an RPG. That's a chore. As a dragon my avatar can't see and attack enemies on land, but when I convert it back to a human they suddenly pop up from nowhere. I could go on and on.It looked and behaved great early on, but it seems the developers got bored of it and threw it out the door as fast as they could.I played Arcania (and its expansion) just before, that was excellent in comparison. A true gem in the rough. Try that instead.For a game that handles human/dragon conversions the right way, check out Drakan. It's not an RPG (more a medieval shooter) and it's certainly not new, but it's brilliant in comparison to Divinity II, despite its dated graphics.Even at bargain bin price this game is awful.Update: I'm playing the expansion now and my avatar is at level 43. Despite this, and the fact that I have two companions and playing on Casual, I can't even put a dent on an arena full of monsters (20 or more) where all can heal themselves, and where I only have 90 seconds or so to finish. If I can't I have to watch a long sequence about my avatar being locked in (forever?), so after a while I just force-stopped the game and restarted. Again and again... Actually I did finish it once, but as the game locks up every time it changes scene, I had to replay anyway, which might happen again next time I possibly succeed.Again, a god awful game, suitable for masochists.

												Divinity 2 is a remastered version of Ego Draconis featuring new content with an enhanced engine packaged with an add-on Flames of Vengeance (FOV). The 2 games form a complete story when played together.Personally it took me 45 hours to finish the 2 games, and this is taking into account that i had skipped alot of side quests and even referred to a walkthrough for some of the puzzles. If you were to do everything and experience all the game had to offer, it will probably take you close to 80 to 90 hours or even more.The first starting village you entered had a surprisingly huge amount of sidequests. The problem is, most of them just aren't very interesting, and most of the time, instead enjoying the story in the sidequest, alot of them felt more like merely items in a checklist that has to be finished off just for the rewards.The main problem i feel though, the whole game just doesn't take itself very seriously. It tries to tell an epic story but the execution just feels amatuerish. (Was it really necessary to re-introduce the player character in FOV via a parody of the movie ""The Terminator""?)The character animations are very rough and almost all characters you talk to tend to like to flail their arms wildly in the air in a very exaggerated style. Its as if they were thinking if they make the NPCs move their arms more, they would look more alive lol. Its really funny to see an esteemed Knight Commander talking to you and flailing his arms wildly in the air like a mad loon. Alot of the NPC faces are also re-used and you will see quite alot of similar looking faces everywhere.Voice acting is noticeably bad, and alot of them either sound bored, over-enthusiastic, or just plain silly. Music is a mixed bag, with some tunes feeling suitably atmospheric, and some tunes that won't sound out of place in a James Bond movie lol.The main selling point of the game is to be able to turn into a dragon and fly anywhere. But this concept isn't as exciting as it sounds. For one thing, the world is not truly open-world and fully explorable. There are alot of invisible walls everywhere. And you will not have the pleasure of morphing into a dragon and burning down all the enemies on the ground. They just magically disappear when you morph into dragon mode which i suppose was to not imbalance the gameplay. Still it would have been nicer if they were able to combine the 2 into a seamless experience instead of the current system that they had.One particular feature that i enjoyed was Mindreading, which basically lets you listen to the thoughts of NPCs. Its a very nice idea, as you can sometimes get extra rewards or even new quests with it. But again, they had to put a silly penalty of requiring EXP to actually do mind reading. Personally i felt that it was really unnecessary to do this, to punish the player's level progress while he checks out something cool with an NPC.The ending of Ego Draconis is also very controversial and suffice to say, basically undermines everything you have done, and is one of the worst endings IMO in an RPG. The add-on Flames of Vengeance(FOV) corrects this however, and provides better closure. I am aware that FOV came 11 months after the Ego Draconis, and i have a gut feeling that it was crafted to pacify the players who have been crying foul of the original ending.It may look like i am bashing the game, but i really am not. There is an interesting game in there somewhere, but only if you are willing to endure the amatuerish style it is presented. Maybe thats the way this RPG is meant to be enjoyed, a funny little game with some movie parodies that doesn't take itself very seriously.Overall Rating: 6.0 / 10If you are willing to overlook its many faults, this is still a worthy purchase if on sale.

												I saw the trailers and the other reviews to this game. I was hyping myself to play this. It looked genuinely fun to be able to become a dragon and be an unstoppable force of death. Unfortunately my experience was less so.The game is excruciatingly difficult for beginners. Even more infuriating is the difficulty ramp itself and the fact that to my knowlege, enemies do not respawn. I thought i would do some sidequests to level up quicker but nearly all of them are in areas far above my level. and that added to the fact enemies dont respawn makes leveling a difficult task.Potions are also abnormaly rare, at least when i played. I would find myself in a horde of enemies and use up all of my potions before even reaching the boss to a dungeon or area.One boss named jagon was so infuriatingly impossible to defeat that i resorted to cheating to beat him. That may sound like it was unnecessary, but I was not allowed to leave the dungeon unless i beat jagon! I couldnt level up because the enemies would not respawn and the entrance was locked. I would have been stuck in that dungeon unless i reverted to a save that was well in the past. Me and Jagon were both level 11.I really wanted to like this game. I read that it becomes much funner and easier after you become a fully realized dragon slayer. But I was at a point of almost zero tolerance for the game. It does not help that the UI, combat, and level design are all angering and not very streamlined. I have spent almost 20 minutes walking up and down hallways to find levers or buttons to doors that are locked for seemingly no reason.tldr; This game made me furious while i tried to have fun.			"

												This game is sadly disappointing I started it up thinking it would be pretty impressing for how it looked but I knew it probably wouldnt be good.The customization is 3 options: Gender,Hair Options which is disappointing because it only has a few option and the last option is Voice which was disappointing because you can only choose between 3 voices that somewhat sound the same. The story is really something you would see in a better game and the combat is really disappointing. That is why I give this game a no.If you want a better game for the same price I recommend: Dishonored.			"

												I tried to like this game i really did but i just could not being myself to find anything i actually could like about this particular title except the voice acting. There are a great many reasons why i think this game falls short but one of the biggest is the set system.Now to begin the list in no real order.1) The textures are horribly done, they other do not fit in the environment they are in properly or just plain look terrible.2) The one that annoyed me most durring gameplay: the reflective surfaces being too high on metal armors (meaning armor shines too much when exposed to light such as the sun).3) The storyline starts out good but turns so generic it bored me.4) The skill tree is horribly unbalanced, which includes the 4 classes being unbalanced. being a melee class is pretty much useless, same with being a summoner. So your best bet is to major in being a mage or ranger as a main class and take knight as a subclass.5) The horribly written books in the game gives no encouragement for collectors like myself especially considering how late your personal storage is introduced, which means if you do want to collect the books you need to waste valuable skill points on weight capacity, however honestly whats the point? Most of the normal books are terribly boring to read.6) With the combination of xp level range system, monsters almost never dropping anything, absolutely no monster regen, and that includes boars. There is almost no incentive to visit previously missed areas unless you find out there is a set piece there.In closing i would like to say for the most part this game is mostly Gothic and Drakengaurd put together but a bad attempt at both, of course there are elements of other games as well. There are elements of Diablo as you have no doubt noticed. The dragon combat was one of the worst dragon combat systems i have ever seen honestly... it was slow and highly restricted on where you could go.			"

												I'm on Windows 10 and this game refuses to start. It will go the launch page and then when I click the play button, it closes. I searched online to see if mine was a unique case and surprise surprise, it's not. I saw tons of people that said the game wouldn't start and they had some fixes up. I tried them and they didn't work, the fixes were for up to Windows 8.1 so I guess this game is just unsupported now. Avoid this game like the plague and don't buy it. I don't care if it's on sale or what.			"

												I'm very split about how to review this game, but ultimately I would not recommend it for the time being. The story is very good, the environment is gorgeous, the world and lore feels a lot more developed than a lot of ARPGs, etc., but the game does suffer from a lot of bugs and other issues which seem to get progressively worse the longer you play. The gameplay is decent and has its own flaws and quirks. This game has a huge amount of potential but seems to become more and more unplayable. I really want to play this game more, but it's just too broken. I reached about 30 hours in before the game got to where I just can't progress any further. I've tried using previous save files, but some bugs still get triggered and it's not worth repeating hours of the game to see whether the bugs show up or not. I really want to recommend this game because of how much I enjoyed what I could play, but it's just way too buggy.I've encountered several bugs which range from annoying to completely game breaking. The longer I play, the worse the frame rate becomes, to the point I have to save and restart the game. The only issue is, the frame rate has gotten permanently slower no matter what settings I try. When I first started the game would be about 60FPS (at the cap) but has fallen to average somewhere between 20-30FPS (sometimes falling as low as 10FPS for no real reason) even in the same areas I got 60FPS before. It doesn't seem to be an issue with my computer, but a bug in the game itself since it only really happens with this game and several other buggy games. Certain cutscenes will also crash the game randomly.I've also had a bunch of random physics and control bugs which aren't too bad but are extremely annoying. I've managed to clip into things and come close to sequence breaking from issues with the physics. If you land on certain objects (things which you can very easily jump on), you can get stuck to the point of having to reload a save file. Sometimes the game will freak out and the controls lock up or get stuck performing the same action if you perform an action while moving or if you use a spell while attacking. If I use the dragon's flame attack and cast a spell, sometimes the dragon will get stuck attacking with flames, and be unable to move left or right, until I click several times. I've had several other issues during combat where my character gets left unable to move or attack and the camera stays locked until I cast a spell (it isn't a status effect), but I can't figure out exactly what triggers it. The dragon form targeting seems to have broken permanently in my game and will randomly jump between targets on the screen (literally all of them) even without moving (mouse or keyboard) and with stationary enemies being the only thing on screen.Certain quests have been rendered impossible because of bugs as well. The General Raze fight is impossibly bugged on my game. The first time I played I ended up dying as I opened the menu, then I reloaded from an earlier save and the Walking Armour spawns were broken. If I reload from any previous save and work back to that point, the spawns are still broken. The number of spawn points has doubled (the healing pods spawn them), each spawn point spawns about the same number of things that the whole room did before the bug (could be more, hard to tell since they spawn inside each other), and the delay time dropped to somewhere between 10 and 15 seconds or so per round of spawns. They spawn so fast and with so many that it is quite literally impossible to kill them all. They continue spawning in the same spot past the point the game AI stops trying to control new spawns. The dragon form seems to have broken on my game after resetting my skill points since it doesn't get any increase in health or other stats when my character levels up. I do get random dragon skill points every couple levels for some reason though... Certain battles which require dragon form have glitches with enemies spawning, like the Zagan fight, where the other things keep spawning even when the nest towers are all dead. There are other minor bugs like certain quests where you choose who to give something to or whatever are either both completable or both incompletable depending on the savefile (played through the first 2 hours like 3 times on different files, had the first savefile be completable for both options for an early quest, normal choice the second, and incompletable the third). I've also failed to find certain NPCs which are supposed to be in certain areas, I don't know if these have been because of any kind of bug or just not hitting the right trigger.The gameplay is overall very fluid and fun, albeit extremely unforgiving. If you level properly and fight very strategically, you can get extremely overleveled very early on. Of course, the game is unforgiving with your stat points so if you plan poorly, you can completely gimp your character until you get a lot more stat points. Combat is pretty easy to follow though it is easy to get overwhelmed depending on what kind of character you play. Certain parts of the combat system can get annoying, like enemies healing faster than you can kill them, no real blocking mechanic, and other minor glitches. The biggest drawback in the gameplay is the fact the difficulty ramps up pretty harshly with very little warning. It's usually possible to take on higher level foes if you're used to playing with Dark Souls style tactics and can lure enemies away. Certain areas are almost impossible without coming back later even if they should be the right level for you to beat. Tricking the enemy into falling off the map or knocking them off doesn't seem to net you experience though, which can ruin certain areas since enemies don't respawn.The story, lore and environment are what really shine in this game. The story itself is a pretty stereotypical bad guy turned hero type thing, but the way it's told is what makes it actually good and not just a complete cookie cutter type scenario. Lore seems to be mainly divided into books and interactions with people. People in towns don't always have something important to say but usually have something unique. You have NPCs who feel more alive than most RPG NPCs. Towns feel like they're filled with people rather than just reskinned NPCs from the town back. NPCs also feel like they have personalities; their motivation for their actions aren't just good or evil. You also have choices to make that aren't just black and white, good or evil, but hinge on personal judgement. You can try and glean more information from other NPCs but the choices are almost never obviously good or bad, but just different which is a nice change of pace. I don't know how it ends since my game broke too badly to really hope to complete, but it was definitely building up pretty awesomely.			"

												tl;dr  If you can get it for a few quid in a sale maybe worth it, if not, don't bother.Starts out well as a semi open-world combat orientated third person RPG, however quickly runs into problems outside the starting area. The combat quickly becomes a repetitve grind (think WoW but single player) interspaced with frustrating boss fights. Ranged builds will suffer from many fights taking place in mines or corridors with locked doors and no room to maneourve, while melee builds will get demolished by spell and arrow spamming packs of mobs. The vaunted dragon-form combat is a glorified fast travel system since while in dragon form you can't attack ""ground level"" enemies; forcing you to try and slug it out in human regardless of the situation. Likewise although the game has a relatively large number of skills most of them are either useless or don't work in important fights.			"

												A surprisingly solid 3D RPG that taps all the usual fantasy tropes (wizards, dragons, fighters/mages/rangers, bandits, goblins, backwards villagers with west country accents) that just about manages to keep the fetch/kill quests fresh by chucking in a bunch of new gameplay mechanics about half-way through the game.The Developer's Cut is an amalgamation of the original game (Ego Draconis), the expansion (Flames of Vengeance) and some random fluff (design docs, concept art and dev's console for 'cheating'). Pick it up if it's on sale.			"

												After 15 hours of game play and finally making it to the battle tower I have to stop playing this game. It's OK and has some good parts and bad parts to it. The items are Random, Skill point and abilities are intresting and I like the clunky combat thos very easy to exploit and somewhat easy. The bad parts of this game is the lack of character debth and plot development. The main bad guy is not intresting at all and I would go as far as to say he's ""lame""  to quote some 80's computer slang. Once you get to the battle tower the game opens put, for some games this a good thing, for Divinity 2 it's a bad thing as I have no motivation to continue on, I suspect there will be no amazing cut scenes I will miss, no new intresting characters and most importantly getting to this point of them game has been unfulfilling.  If you absoutly have nothing to play for whatever reason...if it was 1996 again, if you are trapped on an island and this is the only game on a computer... then I would say Divinity 2 would be a pretty good game. With games like D&D, Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Borderlands, batman, battlefeild, most jrpg's, Dragon age...diablo, dungeon defenders, anything intresting on your ipad, kingdom rush free on kongragate, board game nights with friends, munchkin! poker! and many many more activities.... their is no real reason to put your time here.

												Just some of my thoughts on the game, not very organized.Mechanically its pretty decent, I could see its mechanics being used to make a great game, with a few things changed, like how people say that enimies disapear when you play as a dragon, I never got to the point where I could change into one. Plus the combat could be a lot better, melee is much harder than archery or magic, but its still fun if you want a challenge. Try doing a playthrough only using your fists.I do enjoy playing it when I wan't mindless combat, but the story is pretty boring and feels like it doesn't take itself seriously, but its not done well enough where its actually amusing and fun. The aesthetics are generally pretty ok but some of the things are jarring, the spandex armor for the ladies is : \ and I find the wizard dudes clothes feel very generic.The story is, forgettable and generic.There is little facial customization, which is something I look for in my open world games where they aren't single character and story driven, I much prefer skyrims over divinities.Its fun to do backflips everywhere.The music is nice.Get it if you want a mindless romb through generic fantasy land with bonus changing into dragons.

												This game was good and bad the graphics are great. the story is interesting but the fights are few and far between and not remotely a challenge. by the time you get your armor set and enchant it the way you want it there isn't anything left to kill. the developers cut doesn't let you create your own levels or games it only lets you cheat and add the much needed monsters that are absent from the original. if you play ego draconis by the time you get to the second chapter of the game you are already a god and there isn't a challenge left. I say this is a good start of a game that really needed more dungeons with more monsters and larger maps to be any sort of challenge. this title really needs more than 2 chapters to make the game worth playing for the ammount of fighting you do.TL:DR great graphics, features, and concept. very little actually game play and fighting. 5/10			"

												Wow this is going to be a pain in the ♥♥♥ to review. If i just played The first half of the game i would have given this game a thumbs up, but after flames of vengence the problems are just way too big to ignore. For the review i am going to list off all of the good stuff and the bad stuff, then really get into the horrors that await to be explained.Pro's-humorous characters-decent music- about a hundered side quests-dragon mode (Really fun but needs more work-armor and weapon sets that boost stats-refrences to divine divinity and beyond divinity- Mindreading is innovative- necromancy is available for all classes and becomes a mechanic in the game-puzzles and jumping puzzles- some enemy designs are really bizarre and crazy-refrences to other mediaCons-combat is ♥♥♥-the story sucks so bad, that the sidequests stand out even more-Character creation sucks- starts out really slow and generic like any other rpg-crafting sucks- leveling up sucks (no in depth skill tree that can branch off other skills)- no lockpicking game like in the elder-scrolls-no memorable characters- YOU CANT BEAT THE FINAL BOSS WITHOUT CHEATS BECAUSE YOU GET INSTANTLY ♥♥♥♥♥ IN 2 SECONDS BY A STUN. AND A OVERKILL AMOUNT OF DAMAGE OFF OF 1 HIT, NOT TO MENTION THAT THIS HAPPENS TWICE.Time to go in depth about the problems. the game is split into two parts, eco draconis, and flames of vengence. They were sold as two seperate games in 2009-2010. But later on in 2012 they created the developers edition: both games packaged as one, with the addition of cheats, and console commands. Both games final boss stages are impossible to beat with any build, or any skill because you holster your weapon every time you go into diologue, the final boss's first attack is also a stagger or a polymorph (which makes you stand still for 1 second) then they hit you with an instakill.both final boss stages of ego draconis, and flames of vengeance are impossible to beat without god mode. That right there is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I would be fine if it was just a sidequest, but imagine if skyrim's main story or any dragon age game's story was impossible to beat without cheats. To be honest i would give this a neutral thumb if steam let me give it, but my final hours of both 2 games were spent trying to finish it as soon as possible, so that i could stop playing that horrible main story. If i could beat the final boss's without cheats the game would have recieved the thumbs up. As it stand now, It is a poor mans KOA ReckoningGo buy kingdoms of amalor reckoning if you want a third person rpg, or spend your money on larian studio's better games in the divinity franchise such as: divine divinity, divinity original sin 1 and 2.

												Unless you are getting this game dirt cheap i can NOT honestly recommend it. There is a bug that comes up while playing the game that makes it challenging to play. Every time you enter an area, be it a dungeon or new area the game crashes. The developers are aware of this and offer a plethora of fix it ideas which might or might not work for you depending on how old your computer is and what O.S. its running. Instead of fixing the issue they offer this slew of fixes. Its sad to because the game has so much potential and is fun to play as long as you save every few minutes or else you'll be staring at their version of the blue screen of death at the most worst possible time.

												Played quite a bit through it.At the time, years ago, when it came out I was incredibly hyped for this. Who doesn't want a good RPG? We still don't have many. However I was only able to get it like I dunno months ago whenever I played it. The world is good and creative. Also taking good spins on the typical things you see in other medieval/knights worlds.People bash the game for it's graphics, which to today's standards are incredibly poor, but at the time they weren't that bad. They were okay at best. The game has good promise, but it's such a shame the company was so small and lacked so many resources at the time. I'd like a reboot of this to be honest. It lacks a lot of polish. For example I mean you can only choose between brown or blonde hair at the character creation screen. I'm not serious. They cut a lot of corners just to bring out a fresh and original world and game concepts. Such as being a dragon etc. It lacks a lot but it's got such good heart. It's hard to recommend unless you are a diehard fan of RPGs, because then you judge purely on the story, characters and world etc.			"

The end is the nail in the coffin - an escort mission.  I can confidently say _many_ people _HATE_ escort missions, and I do.  I wish I had never bought the developers cut ($5 for the whole thing was too tempting).  This ""complete"" game served only to sour my high opinion on Draconis.It's worth noting - 97 hours total for the game.  Less than 15 of those hours were in FoV, and the remainder were in Draconis.

												I can't really recommend this game. There are things I like in the game, but it basically throws you into the fray with little to no instruction on the mechanics. It's also really difficult to tell where your loyalities lay you start out with one faction then through a (chance?) encounter you end up as an enemy of your first faction also one min you're doing quests for a faction then next quest you're killing those same guys pretty confusing.  The game also has a pretty annoying tendency to corrupt it's files, the only solution I've found if to clear local content and reinstall (I've done this like 4 or 5 times  in the last week or so, it's a 2 to 3 hr process each time). I tried using the backup feature from steam (thinking if I had a local copy the reinstall might go faster), which oddly doesn't seem to have a restore option (Why?).The game designers I think are certifiably Sadistic. Two interesting puzzles that seemed to have no point or solution.First is in a mine, where you find yourself playing jumpy jumpy games climbing a wall to reach a plaftorm that has a lever on it. Ok well I have no Idea why such ar room would be in a mine first of all, but then the fireballs started, what idiot would shoot flame in a mine? Don't the developers know that there are explosive gases below ground open flame is not recommended and these guys are throwing fireballs. Go figure. Oh and here is the best part you finally reach the level you pull it and 2 new platforms appear but they only stay visible (usable) for about 10 seconds 5 of which is burned up by a cutaway scene that leaves you rooted in place. Needless to say I never solved it.The other realls sadistic one also involves platforms you have to jump to, presumably to find the leaver that tuens off a Necromancer's force field. Great except it's all overtop of a pool of lava, I jumped ot like the second platform and it fell and gave me the interesting experience of dieing in a vat of lava. I finally decided I really didn't want to turn off that forcefield all that badly.So, the long and the short of it I payed like $6 for the trilogy (on sale). Thank goodness because if I'd paid any more than that I'd be pretty poed by now. Get this game only if you have a high tolerance for frustration.			"

												Do not buy.  Cons:  (SPOLIERS)Other then the Dragon form nothing innovative Not A complate story, in a larger world.  Thanks for making a really cool bad guy and never getting to fight him.  We'll take a almost nameless baddy as the final boss.  What to see more of the story, dont worry theu included it but it's not as good and you still dont fight the big baddie.Small world, it gives you 2 main areas and a few small ones to explore and gets rid of the 1st area (well almost) when you get to the 2nd one.  It just does not feel all that epic.Forgettable NPCsLittle you do matters in the world.  Do a bunch of side quests for the townfolk, then watch the town and 1/2 the world get destroyed in a story event.  You are given several choices to help or kill NCPs, does it matter which you chose, no!I didnt play Divinity 1 so maybe im missing something, but this is just not a good game if you like a good story.  Really I think I could remember the name off only one NPC after I got done playing.  "

												Another game with a lot of potential that falls flat on its face right out of the gate.  I can only assume that based on the reviews it is possible to enjoy the game if you get past the horrible issues up front.  The main problem is, you choose one of three ""classes"" by way of testing them out in an open area on some goblins.  Ok cool, I decided ranger is good, I like plinking with a bow, the mage has jack for spells and instead just clubs things up close.  Then after the into movie, a whole lot of chatting with folks, pick up a few side quests that seem awkwardly thrown in, and get sent into a crypt as the first main storyline quest.  And get jumped by 3 skeletons of higher level than I am and are no match for a bow.  Seems you can ONLY choose warrior to start the game, nothing else, and then use the other classes later.  Sorry, but blowing an hour to find out I have to start all over says I have no time for what is likely to be a seriously flawed game.  Toss in how awkward a lot of it feels, and then the voice acting... I mean half of it is really good, the other half is worse than a sci-fi original movie, it's painful to listen to.			"

												Good voice-acting. Female NPCs with pretty faces. Watch your player character in underwear, if you take off every piece of armor. The background music doesn't match the atmosphere always.I've enjoyed the initial exploration in a rather restricted area (aka ""Broken Valley"") that seemed interesting enough. And I've enjoyed the blind flight, because I was playing carefully and without following any guides or walkthroughs.Then I've struggled during the second half. Tedious, dull, repetitive drudgery to attempt a completionist playthrough in order to be able to reach high levels. And even then the experience points mechanics require a variety of special tricks to turn in quest XP at the right time and kill enemies in the right order for more XP. Nevertheless, eventually I almost felt over-powered due to the high level and access to tons of special equipment. The occasional balancing issues made a very few minor boss fights unexpectedly difficult, and I assure you, there are players, who ""rage quit"" the game in such a situation. You can always search for help or hints, but be prepared to find unhelpful comments from either braggarts, or from people, who only know the older release of this game.Haven't run into crashes or obvious bugs. Except in the heat of combat, sometimes either my mouse stopped accepting camera rotation input. Or music stopped playing. Quicksave and quickload fixed it directly during combat.And finally, I've run into a game-breaking bug that is known for years, unfortunately. It's been discussed before. I've mentioned it in the forum, too, before writing this review. An enemy four levels below me, who kills me either with the first magic attack I cannot avoid or with the next attack a second later. There are videos, where that doesn't happen. There are players, who play the game with half the health points and with many more wasted skill points. But there are reports that describe exactly the same problem that can cause real frustration.It seems, the players of this edition of the game are supposed to fire up the game in the separate developer mode and activate a cheat mode to work around that problem. Not sexy at all.Edit #1: A bit later, the same bug apparently also affected another important fight and made it almost impossible even with lots of cheat modes activated. Enemies moved too quickly and were much too resistant to damage to stop them as required during that fight where they approach from three directions and respawn, too. Again, when searching the web about it, I see the same reports by other players and also videos where the enemies move much slower and can be eliminated with ease. Here it seemed impossible even with godlike cheats, multiple summons and holding down the key to launch magical area attacks all the time. Whatever it is that messed up my game on ""Normal"" difficulty so late, it's the opposite of fun.Edit #2: In the end, I've decided not to turn off the cheat modes anymore for the final fight. The frustrating experience has been too much of a motivation killer, and I've also decided against continueing into the add-on due to this.			"

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME you will waste your money on a game you can even play the Normal nor the Developer game parts of the launcher work and after looking around there arent many solutions unless you are a whiz at computers and/or know computer programming as some solutions required such skills... leave this game to the 360 Larian clearly didnt care enough to put the work into making it playable before giving it to steam to sell			"

												It's not a /bad/ game per se. But it's not worth its price, unless you're buying it on a Steam sale, like I did. The general concept of the storyline is rather decent, yes, and the graphics and general gameplay are, to quote one cartoon character, ""pretty pretty shiny shiny"" but the game falls flat on its face when you get to the last 10% of the Ego Draconis campaign and Flames of Vengeance does very little to fix it. The... *cough* twist at the end effectively murders the plot, reducing it to ""just barely not terrible"" in one fell swoop. It's difficult to put it without spoilers, but let's just say that the plot as a general whole until that point becomes entirely irrelevant and your decisions, it suddenly turns out, make no difference to the ending.What's worse, Flames of Vengeance, the expansion that should have reputedly saved us all, actually makes it worse by having that /plot twist/ at the end of Ego Draconis have no real effect on the world, aside from you feeling mildly uncomfortable. If it was supposed to fix the disappointing ending of Ego Draconis, it only made the situation worse. Larian somehow managed, in one grandiloquent failure, to ruin the entire game just as it was ending. More painfully than Bioware in Mass Effect 3, I'd say.			"

												This game has difficulty spikes that were supposed to have been fixed in the Dragon Knight Saga patch. It is unbearably painful to play in these difficulty spike areas, given how generic the combat is no matter how dumb the AI acts. This game starts off painfully to the point that I wouldn't recommend it, no matter what happens later on in the game, simply because it is too frustrating to get past the initial hurdle. If you want to play this game, know full well that it is easy to break a character build that will be unable to progress past future enemies, a flaw that they attempted to fix by cutting down enemy health and damage. Larian studios, although making improvements to their combat in their newer titles, completely failed here and left a mediocre combat system in this game. If you want to make a game functional, don't start off a player's stats at 1, this is not an mmo, though they certainly designed it to feel like one for the basic human character. At these stat levels, it was bound to happen that they would encounter problems balancing enemy levels and stats early on. On a plus, you at least have cool combat animations.The jumping mechanic is glitchy at best, don't blame yourself if you jump in a stream and cannot get out easily. The ending is garbage and cliche, you spend the entire game listening to cutscenes of the villain making grandiose speeches in front of you. The expansion also has a mediocre ending, although it at least makes you happier than the base game with its conclusion. The engine is on par with TES Morrowind, but many times less enjoyable or memorable. The dragon mechanic is a cheap gimmick halfway through the game, with completely uninspired flight mechanics and nominal mmo interfacing. I can guarantee that half of the positive reviews are waxing nostalgia for the franchise, which is deserved given how much better its previous titles merit. Absolutely the worst of the franchise, skip it if you don't want to be screwed over by the story and forced through repetitive and pointless gameplay. The only upside is that the side quests are at least original and interesting in the choices you can make, never painting a black and white picture.I honestly do not know how people tolerate this game to play it through. The core game is entirely flawed, such that there is a limited pool of XP, nothing respawns, you literally have to beat every side quest to have the XP to make a good character build. There is nothing enjoyable about the combat, it even takes away from the enjoyment of playing the game. It is a torture to try and beat the game when you are instantly dying because you didn't pick the boilerplate max stat character build. This game had so much potential, the combat engine ruined it entirely for me. I'm glad I got this on sale for less than three dollars, it is not worth anything more. I don't hate games often, but this has caused me serious grief and I regret every minute I spent playing it.Before the Dragon Knight Saga, this game got between a 6 and a 7 on many review sites. Even with the Dragon Knight Saga, it still deserves the mediocre score, and nothing can redeem this game besides a complete re-make.			"

												Passable game, nothing really remarkable or new about it, just like so many other rather unknown RPGs out there.In Divinity 2 you play, at least initially, as a Dragon Slayer novice. You hunt dragons for a living. The game starts with you and your crew picking up the trail of the very last Dragon Knight known to mankind. As you start to track the beast down, Damian, the game's antagonist, is closing the siege on some of the last bastions of human civilization. His goal is to enslave or eradicate every living person and control the world with his power. All pretty standard so far.The amazing part of the game is that, spoiler alert, you get to become a Dragon Knight, transform into a dragon and fly your way around. That takes a while, though. Like, fifteen to twenty hours of gameplay. No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.The rest of the game is all about looking for the fabled Hall of Echoes, where you'll adquire knowledge on how to defeat Damian and stop his ultimate goal: The revival of some old-♥♥♥ dragon mother.Gameplay is actually pretty fun, action oriented and all that. Most of you will be quite familiar with the type. My grudge with this game is that it adds absolutely nothing new to the table and has a colossally mediocre story, which for a RPG is something quite important. The game may be worth buying and playing if you got nothing else to play. Other than that, it's not worth it.Gameplay - 6/10Soundtrack - 5/10Graphics - 7/10Content - 7/10Challenge Level - 7/10Replayability - 2/10			"

												The first half of the game is very enjoyable.  Then you move on to having to kill a bunch of bosses in their lair, surrounded by a crapton of guys, none of whom are particularly difficult.  It can take several hours to reach one of these bosses in their ""flying fortresses"", and what do you get after beating one?  Almost nothing.Right up to the Battle Tower, the game plays great.

												Do not get this game if you are expecting to be able to turn into a dragon and rain fireballs down on your enemies. Once you turn into a dragon, all the land-based enemies literally disappear. The dragon form is really *only* for moving to out-of-reach locations. While flying you have to destory towers, ballistas, nests, and flying enemies, which I found lacking. It was an awesome idea, but it did not deliver.The story is pretty good, the gameplay is decent (I found the jump a little annoying to control at times since you jump so high), and levelling up is fun. It has a stat-based system.I found the skill tree lacking. I only played as a mage, which was fun; however, there is only one spammable spell - magic missile. Other attack spells have cool-downs, which is alright, but some more variety would have been nice. One good thing about the skills are that you can mix and match to make your character however you want and you can respec at a relatively low cost about half-way through the game.I'm probably not going to play the expansion. I've read that it is pretty good, but I think I'm ready to finish the last area and uninstall.			"

												Divinity II: Director's Cut. Right out of the gate, I was pretty unimpressed. The cut scenes were glorious, but then, cut scenes often are, and this, unlike DragoneAge 2, doesn't really live in the cut scenes. I had been excited about character creation though, so ... moving on to that. Pick a gender. Pick one of 4 heads. One of four hair colors. One of four voices. You're done. Really? They might as well have just handed me a pregen. VERY disappointing. Well, maybe the mechanics will be amazing. Moving on to the obligatory turt-orial. Annnd- the game locked up just as I was attempting to stroll through the gates into TutorialTown (Farglow.) Looked for info online, found very little bug-fix/tech help available at all, but finally tracked down the advice to crank my gfx to min, which worked, but the reason I bought it was because it promised to be glorious and graphical so... as soon as I got past the hiccup, I cranked them up again, and it seemed to be fine after that. Well. Fine- ISH, anyway. Again- I bought it to take pretty pictures. It has no way to turn off the UI hud, and a locked cam. So screenshots are an immediate disappoint. Ah well. And still, I rest my hopes on the game mechanics, so again, moving on. Tutorial town- They hand me glowing eyes, tell me I can read minds now, (but it costs xp to do so,) offer me merchants with a lot of gear I can't come close to affording, and tell me I can pick one of 3 classes. If I';m a ranger, I can use a bow, a warrior can use a sword and leap around impressively, and a mage can throw colorful sparks. Uhm... This is feeling more and more like a glorified platformer by the minute. Ran around, talked to some folks, discovered that the dialog is at least moderately adult- they toss in colorful epithets like ""♥♥♥"" and ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s"" so it's for grown-ups I guess. And the soundtrack is just... BIZARRE. Again, reminiscent of 8-bit techno. It was... different, I'll give it that! Fought some goblins. Died. Didn't feel inspired to waste more of my day on it. 4 out of ten, if you want thumbs or stars or something. Not hugely impressed with Dinvinity II. Glad I only paid 6 bucks for it.			"

												Where to start. I got this game when it first came out on the Xbox: 360. I was kind of disapointed. I mean the game was quite buggy, laggy and just had it problems. Needless to say, I returned it and got something else. Not I see it on sale and decide, why not give it another try. Well I did and I can say its not so laggy, or course I have a gaming machine now that can handle it. Anyways, the storyline isnt that bad, I'm not super far into it, but it's rather interesting. However, this game can be brutally hard. I recommend to save often. And when I say often, I mean before a battle, after a battle, and every other step. If you don't become a ranger/mage, and save up your money for a really powerful bow, your gonna have a hard time. The difficulty spikes in this game can be ridiculous.I've always been a warrior type. Love to go in and battle my enemies toe-to-toe. But in this game, It's so hard to do that, especially when you get ganged up by 5+ people at once. Even with good armor, they can shread through your health like butter. But in this game, I had to do ranged just to get by. And some quests require you to go into some difficult areas, usually above your level.However, this game does have its interesting bits. The story is interesting to say the least with your choices having an effect on the world around you and even what price people sell their goods for. Having the choice to decide peoples fates, or to have my actions matter is something I love about a game. The NPCs in the game are also quite welll done. Every NPC has it's own name, characteristics, and converstions. Each thinking something different that may help you in a quest, or with getting lower proces at shops.The skill system I can say however is nicely done. You don't have to dwell in just your calss based stats. You can be a battle ready warrior shooting fireballs and summoning creatures, to an unarmed mage beating his enimies to a pulp.All in all, with the crazy difficulty spikes, the somewhat ""ok"" story, and the just barely getting around, I can't recommend this game. The skill system was great, and the NPC's are wonderful, but the combat difficulty is what ruins it. It's an ok game, but not great. You can give it a try, and you may love it.			"

												I kept playing this game hoping for it to get better... It didn't.- You don't get to be a dragon until you've played a looong time.- If you chose to play a pure melee fighter, fights rely on the IA being stupid (ie allowing you to pull one monster away from his group)- The water is bugged (your character tries to run while looking at the sky instead of swimming)- The running / jumping actions are quite clunky (and yet necessary to complete some quests)- You don't really want to use mind-reading since it uses your xp points...+ Some quests are well-written.My opinion: a lot of good ideas, poorly executed.

												Divinity II is a mess of broken quests and a storyline thats so unteresting that you forget what your supposed to do the same second you finished listening to that the quest giver tells you. There is ALOT of lore but its just so bland and dull that you just try and click past it to get to the fighing, and even that's boring and repetative. Wanna play a ranged character? Be prepared that every monster in the game can hit you with ranged attackes if they cant get to you in melee which make the game design broken.

												This game is just bad. I wanted to wait until I had more hours into the game, or had completed it, but I find it so unenjoyable that I don't think that I can. Other reviewers have compared it to Risen, and they're not really incorrect. From the screenshots, I originally decided not to buy this game, but eventually the positive reviews and cover art convinced me. One of the best words I can use to describe this game is clumsy.To list some of it's problems; It has grossly exaggerated animations, the audio is really imbalanced, for example, the player character's voice is very loud, and certain effects such as fireball sounds are very loud, yet npc dialogue is very quiet, and the music alternates in different tracks between too loud and too quiet, combat is really awkward, it reminds me of mmos, yet not as balanced, it acutally has platforming sections despite the controls and especially the player's ridiculous jump being, again, clumsy, it constantly jumps to cutscenes, for which it sheaths the player's weapons and then jumps immediatly to combat, forcing you to draw your weapons again while being attacked, when it didn't make any sense to sheath them in the first place, the enemy AI is braindead, the story and characters feel generic and predictable, moments of significance are handled carelessly with little to no regard for attempting to impress the player or make transitions feel significant, and I feel like it demands too much attention from the player when the game isn't enjoyable or rewarding in the first place.Some positives are that the game is visually pleasant, and most of the voice acting is well done.But ultimately I don't understand why this game has so many positive reviews, I just can't recommend that anyone buy it, there are so many other more worthy games to spend your time and money on.

												So I briefly played this when it first launched on the 360 and never got more than 10 or so hours into it.  I decided to pick it back up and man was I plesantly suprised.  This is far from a perfect game but I've really enjoyed my time playing.  My biggest issue is just the combat system.  Its very clunky and just doesn't feel satisfying.  It's not unplayable, but it does hold the game back a bit.  What makes this game great is the writing.  I was constantly suprised by the dialogue both in the main quests and side quests.  Larian Studios are the kings of gaming comedy and if you have ever played the Original Sins series you will immediately recognize the humor.  Apart from the writing, being able to trasform into a dragon makes your character feel very powerful and cool.  There is a good bit of custimization you can do with your gear stat wise to make your character perform the way you want.  I would definately recommend picking this game up if you are looking for a fun RPG.  I probably wouldn't play through more than once but the game is fairly cheap now so I feel its well worth the money.			"

												A gentleman's game for gentlemen. Possibly the most criminally unapreciated game to come out in recent years.Soundtrack's still great, writing's still extraordinary, humor and self-awareness are still fully-intact, combat still ends with either you or the rude dudes dying within five seconds, and it still runs Gamebryo. Sorry about the last point, but it's still better than most of the things Bethesda's done with that engine in spite of having giant piles of money.So far as I can tell, the Developer's Cut adds some pretty neat design documents and artwork, along with a copy of aforementioned kickin' rad soundtrack and a mode that lets you mess around with the dev console. Not quite a full remaster (which would have been GOTY material) but a bit of extra gravy never hurt.			"

												I feel like this is an underappreciated gem.  It's something medieval RPG-lovers can really get into.  Swords!  Shields!  Armor!  Wenches!  Yippie!  Larian are some crazy awesome, Belgian developers.  To compare this to Skryim may be easy, but it's almost a disservice.  Divinity is unique and deserves to be viewed as a great title on its own.  It's everything I think Dark Souls should've been.  It's Skyrim, only you ARE the dragon.  Four-dimensional, fire-breathing air battles are in your future, my friend.  When you get sick of air combat, you can morph back to your human character and go questing.  This game is ridiculously awesome.  Made with the Gamebryo Engine, Bethesda fans will feel right at home (only without the bugs).  There's lots of dialog, consequence, loot, bartering, leveling your character, and did I mention you can morph into a m0t#3rfu({!n& dragon?!?  WHY DON'T YOU OWN THIS YET???			"

												If you get this game, be sure to get the ""developer's cut"", as it contains the expansion, which you WILL want to play.Good combat - as an archer (which was my primary playthrough) you certainly can feel ""overwhelmed"" when facing hordes of nasty foes;  as you should.Storyline is good, voice acting is good.  Lots of humor hidden in there if you know where to look (and even if you don't)... Brave Sir Robin.  The quests and dungeons are fun to go through, and the puzzles.... can puzzle you.  There minimal (and at times none at all) as far as hand-holding goes for the quests and puzzles - which is a GOOD thing.  You won't be mindlessly following an arrow or looking for the magical sparkly button.  No.  You'll be in a dungeon, actually trying to figure out the puzzle, as it should be.  On rare occasions when you do get stuck, there's always walkthroughs...  Although racking your brain a little longer is much more rewarding when you finally DO figure it out.Also, there's no set classes.  You can play your character any way you want to (though I would suggest specializing in 3-5 skills).  It may not seem like much, but I'd much rather have a single poison arrrow that does nearly 400 damage over 20 seconds, than a bunch of arrows (stun, split arrow, fire arrow, pinning arrow, whatever) that does much less...  That is to say, it is true:  If you are a jack of all trades, you are a master of none.  And masters tend to pack a punch!Swing swords, shoot bows, blast 'em with fireballs, summon undead, summon demons, punch people with your bare fists...  fight however you want.   The only dis-advantage to this is... questing, story, and fighting is all there is to it.  No mini-games, no ""romance"", no craftng system so to speak...  But as an adventure story, it's top notch!Also?  You can play as a dragon.  (and own your own tower).It's true - you will be playing the game a while before you are a dragon.  The game is not rushed!  Many play-hours for you to enjoy, so enjoy it!I honestly wasn't expecting ""that much"" when I bought this game, and I was pleasantly surprised!  I would recommend this game to anybody who likes fantasy games - it caught me, that's for sure - hook line and sinker.  I can't wait to try the next game by these folks!			"

												This seems to be an above-average RPG. It is somewhat crude (the graphics look definitely somewhat dated, and there's not enough polish here and there), which is to be expected for an indie title, but overall it seems to be well made. The quests are not just fetch and kill, but the authors tried to make them more interesting, some of them even in a witcher-style a bit. The story is maybe too much epic, but engaging nevertheless.

												I have tried again and again to play, and like, this game - but I really just can't. The skills and stats are kinda wonky at best, but first the good stuff: It is largely voiced, it looks decent, there's a pretty decent story. But the combat is just wonky as all hell. It's awkward and unpleasant, things have tons of health, your skills have long cooldowns, cost lots of mana and are largely not very powerful or worthwhile. You can't block, and moving is too lagged by attacking that you will be hit constantly unless you roll around from side to side endlessly, and even then it's unresponsive. I feel it coulda been good, but the combat's awkwardness makes it nearly unbearable.			"

												You play as a dragon knight. That's all that needs to be said.Jokes aside, it's a rather well built game that if anything sometimes expects too much from the players. Don't expect to take less than 30 hours to complete it IF you skip all the sidequests. Actually, I don't know if you can even complete the game without completing all of the sidequests, because the difficulty curve is more like a difficulty LADDER, and if you're not strong enough to move up the big steps, you won't be getting anywhere anytime soon. Overall solid game, requires some dedication. It's not just ""The dragon knight game"", it's ""The pretty challenging game where you can play a dragon knight if you're patient enough for it"".			"

												It's a thumbs up from me. Barely. Not a great game, but a decent one. The good outweighs the bad, but not by much. A flawed gem that should be purchased on sale (which given it's age now that's easy to do).THE GOOD? It's got loads of great humour in it for starters. Including lots of little side shows like rescuing a woman from undead, and then hearing her berate her husband later for sending someone out to rescue her and nagging at him about his marriage vows. Seriously plenty of funny moments. It's nice it doesn't take itself too seriously as a game.The other big plus is the quests are a little better than your average find this, go here, get this quests. There are lots of optional quests, you can ignore them (but you won't level enough if you do, so make sure you do a few). Fortunately many are interesting and entertaining enough to be reasonably worth the time. The skill system also is decent I guess - you can build any way you want. Just don't go shoving 1 point in everything - you'll suck.THE BAD? Well, there's a few issues. The first one is one of those annoyances that makes you want to punch stuff - whenever you are in a dialogue screen and then come out of it into combat, even if you had your weapons drawn, they are now sheathed. And it takes ages to pull them out. While you are fumbling aimlessly (even though you had them out before the chat), you are getting wailed on. In some fights that can matter. It's dumb. It's unnecessary, and bloody frustrating.RPG games are often made or broken on the use of quest logs, maping markers etc. This game falls WELL short in that dept. It's HARD remembering where you did something to get back there once you've got the thing you were after...  - you can't make a quest active with a marker to help you out, and unless you are truly anal, you won't bother with writing notes to help yourself. This bit really does suck. It makes the game frustrating at times. You run around trying to remember which place to go back to to close out parts of the story. Poor. Annoying. A bad oversight.Like I said at the start - it's ok. I've played worse RPGs. I've played better though - quite a few better ones...			"

Overall: 8/10(Lengthy bit where I ♥♥♥♥♥ about Ultima) The Divinity series is interesting. It's a series that clearly and openly takes cues from the old Ultima series; a series that has the distinction of having some of the best RPG's of all time AND some of the worst. If I were to describe the first Divinity game, Divine Divinity, in a nutshell, it would be ""Ultima 8: Pagan, but good."" Divinity 2 gets a similar description with regards to the disaster that was Ultima 9: Accension. It's a large, open world third person action RPG. The game will expect you to do a lot of exploration, talk to a lot of people, face some pretty damn challenging enemies and solve some pretty interesting puzles, like playing a game of riddles with a talking treasure box. The game also does something very well that Ultima 9 failed at miserably; making you feel powerful. In Ultima 9 your character was the Titan of Ether, a god in a sense, and both the story and the game itself didn't even seem to notice. At an early point in Divinity 2 your character becomes a Dragon Knight, which is a really big deal for the setting, and the changes that it inflicts upon your character over the course of the game are pretty substantial, and most importantly, they're actually FELT. Not just within the contet of the game, but the series as a whole. The distinction between your character in Divinity 2 and the other characters you play as over the course of the series, even taking engine differences and personal customization into account, is literally night and day, and it does an excellent job of making you feel like a budding top-tier entity in the world of Rivellon.

												If you get this game, be sure to get the ""developer's cut"", as it contains the expansion, which you WILL want to play.Good combat - as an archer (which was my primary playthrough) you certainly can feel ""overwhelmed"" when facing hordes of nasty foes;  as you should.Storyline is good, voice acting is good.  Lots of humor hidden in there if you know where to look (and even if you don't)... Brave Sir Robin.  The quests and dungeons are fun to go through, and the puzzles.... can puzzle you.  There minimal (and at times none at all) as far as hand-holding goes for the quests and puzzles - which is a GOOD thing.  You won't be mindlessly following an arrow or looking for the magical sparkly button.  No.  You'll be in a dungeon, actually trying to figure out the puzzle, as it should be.  On rare occasions when you do get stuck, there's always walkthroughs...  Although racking your brain a little longer is much more rewarding when you finally DO figure it out.Also, there's no set classes.  You can play your character any way you want to (though I would suggest specializing in 3-5 skills).  It may not seem like much, but I'd much rather have a single poison arrrow that does nearly 400 damage over 20 seconds, than a bunch of arrows (stun, split arrow, fire arrow, pinning arrow, whatever) that does much less...  That is to say, it is true:  If you are a jack of all trades, you are a master of none.  And masters tend to pack a punch!Swing swords, shoot bows, blast 'em with fireballs, summon undead, summon demons, punch people with your bare fists...  fight however you want.   The only dis-advantage to this is... questing, story, and fighting is all there is to it.  No mini-games, no ""romance"", no craftng system so to speak...  But as an adventure story, it's top notch!Also?  You can play as a dragon.  (and own your own tower).It's true - you will be playing the game a while before you are a dragon.  The game is not rushed!  Many play-hours for you to enjoy, so enjoy it!I honestly wasn't expecting ""that much"" when I bought this game, and I was pleasantly surprised!  I would recommend this game to anybody who likes fantasy games - it caught me, that's for sure - hook line and sinker.  I can't wait to try the next game by these folks!			"

If I had to state two things that are severely lacking, they would be: the game ending sold as DLC (Flames of Vengeance) - rectified in the Director's Cut integrating the two, and the ending which is so terribly un-epic that it's downright criminal.

												I totally LOVE playing this and the other games in the Divinity Anthology.   This one is my favorite one for so many reasons.  This is total FUN!!!  Just the right amount of mob grinds and interesting and interactive questing.  I never hungered for either nor opportunities to advanced my character.  I have been able to play this at the level/levels that I desired...full on or slower and more focused.  I never felt limited and that is a very fun way to play.  Not to mention...getting to fly and be a powerful dragon is the ultimate in enjoyment!  I love the flying over the beautiful and intense areas.

												I'll start by saying that I don't know a damn thing about this series. I got it just because I thought it looked cool. That being said, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect other than, well, an RPG.The atmosphere is okay. The music is great. I liked the art style, but the actual implementation of the environmental textures and models feels a bit sloppily done, like an MMO. For example, in Aleroth City, the paved areas extend well beyond the buildings and climb up the terrain; Pavers look pretty stupid when they're painted all over the hills. I'm fairly certain these areas were intended to be hidden from view, but often can be seen by just rotating the camera.The scale of the game is quite impressive, excellent for facilitating the dragon mechanics. The transition between the human and dragon forms is pretty smooth, but considering the enemies for each of these forms will only attack, and only be able to be attacked, when the player is in the proper form, it sometimes seems a bit pointless to restrict the ability to transform.The quests are pretty fun. There's a good mix of variety and routine. They don't really lead the player around too much, but the difficulty of the enemies in the main story quests often make it difficult to progress without sucking all of the experience possible out of the side quests.The combat also feels a bit weird. The majority of the difficulty comes from having to face multiple opponents at once. The game provides several options to even the odds, in the form of summons, necromancy, and charm spells, but the primary purpose of these always seems to be giving the enemies more targets, rather than providing oneself with a direct offensive output. Even tank builds feel very limited in their damage output. No matter what weapons the player has, everything is DPS, and when the enemy starts cranking out overpowered healing spells, fights drag out longer. It's all a matter of whether the player can mash the attack button until the enemy dies. There is very little real strategy.Overall, it's okay. It's not perfect, but provides a decent amount of immersive gameplay for your buck.			"

												I played this game first time in 2011-2012 and I replayed it in 2017.What can I tell you about this game? I love it!The RPGs from Larian Studio are always have some unique features and interesting characters.In this game:1.	You can explore a vast open world. It is not as big as worlds from Bethesda (like Skyrim / Fallout) but it is pretty big. There are many places to go and things to see.2.	You can read other people minds. Sometimes it can be fun, sometimes it can provide you with some lore about world, experience points or skill points.3.	You have your own undead pet – a pretty useful companion. You can find different body parts for your pet and customize it with the help of a necromancer.4.	You have your own Battle tower with several subordinates who can help you with necromancy, blacksmithing or alchemy.5.	You have plenty skills for use – from conjuring spirits to rush attacks with your swords.6.	You will find dozens (if not hundreds) of puzzles and secrets. Even in the training area a sharp-sighted player can find something interesting! And most of the times the game will not give you any direct hints (like flags on the map), so you actually need to carefully read texts and look for hints. Do yourself a favor – don’t use any online guides unless you completely stuck.7.	You can transform into a dragon!8.	There are dozens and dozens of quests, especially in the second part.9.	There are plenty interesting NPC, I bet you won’t forget Bellegar )10.	And many other things …Of course, it is not an ideal game.There are some flaws in combat system and using the dragon form can be boring sometimes, but all these little things weren’t able to spoil my fun.As I said before – I love this game. It is very distinctive from other RPGs and for me it is one of the most important feature in games.			"

												I have always enjoyed Larian Studios' sense of Humour and the great lengths they go to to fill their world with as much to see as possible. This game is no exception and while there are certainly area's that could be improved upon (namely the clunky combat, wonky AI, bad pathing and just moving around was a hassle sometimes) there are more positives to commend it. If you enjoy 3d action rpgs that don't take themselves too seriously but still offer an engaging story, loads of content and memorable characters, this game is for you.Overall certainly a great buy for the price, thoroughly enjoyed it :)			"

												Divinity II: Developer's Cut is a highly under appreciated game that does not receive the attention it deserves. This is basically the Collector's Edition of the Game of the Year version of the original game. Simply put, the original game was very buggy and re-released with DLC, a new game engine, and many bug fixes. This improves on that re-release.To compare it to more well known games, it features combat similar to the Elder Scrolls series, loot and upgrades similar to Diablo series, and (less influential) dialogue chooses from the Mass Effect Series. There is also a tremendous skill tree from which you can mix and match all play styles without restriction (other than your level). Two unique features in the game are mind reading, which usually allows you to find additional loot, and turning into a dragon, which has very smooth controls but less expansive combat.The story is kind of all over the place, but it needs to be mentioned that the ending of the main game is terrible. I will not spoil it, but the game ends without any kind of big moment. There are, however, some twists and a tone that isn'y present in many games. The included DLC is great in terms of flushing out an entire city with numerous type of unique people, personalities, and quests. However, once again the main story is not consistent with the ending again feeling pretty cheap.Overall, Divinity II: Developer's Cut is a really good game. There are some bugs with it (I really only experienced 1 bug that didn't let me finish a side quest, but it was corrected in Developer's Mode). It may not blow you away, but it is still a very fun experience that allows a large amount of freedom. The game is a must buy on sale, but still worth the full price if not on sale.I posted an entire playthrough on my YouTube channel for anyone interest in checking out aspects of gameplay.  Base game  and  DLC  "

												It's a thumbs up from me. Barely. Not a great game, but a decent one. The good outweighs the bad, but not by much. A flawed gem that should be purchased on sale (which given it's age now that's easy to do).THE GOOD? It's got loads of great humour in it for starters. Including lots of little side shows like rescuing a woman from undead, and then hearing her berate her husband later for sending someone out to rescue her and nagging at him about his marriage vows. Seriously plenty of funny moments. It's nice it doesn't take itself too seriously as a game.The other big plus is the quests are a little better than your average find this, go here, get this quests.

												Divinity is an adventure RPG where you, the gamer are put into a world of mystical creatures and are a ""Dragon Slayer"". If you've played the first Divinity and bought the 2nd game before this version, then you'll most likely know the story. Since this is the ""Developer's Cut"" there is plenty of added content to this game, such as new transformations, weapons and so much more. The game is wonderfully atmospheric, and is also unique. You'd think this would be like a Skyrim clone, but it's not. I won't give anything away, because the story is worth it. However, it allows you to design your character, but what brings it down is that you're limited to how you can make it, VERY limited. And sometimes, if you're PC doesn't work properly, the game can freeze or shut down. So be mindful. Otherwise, this game is fantastic, and I'd play this game any day (Even though I don't play it cause I'm not on all the time XD)			"

												I really enjoyed this game for what it is, but I found the gameplay in dragon form to be lacking. There are some charming flaws, such as any time any character speaks with arm and head movements it looks like they're going into a full seizure. I think what disappointed me most about this game is that it felt like it was over too quickly. It's really only two areas to explore through. Content wise it can't even pretend to compare to a game like Skyrim.There's still a fun 50+ or 100+ hour game here, depending on how much you enjoy destroying towers as a dragon. And I did enjoy the plot more than I thought I would. I'd recommend it, since even the non sale price tag is reasonable.			"

												An RPG where you play as a character that can turn into a giant dragon, take to the sky and rain fire on enemies! Has very good character development mechanics for an RPG and offering a very flexible skill tree system where you can pick skills and upgrades from any branch (example: make a warrior with a fireball spell from the sorcery branch). The game is open world and has a strong storyline to encourage gamers to continue developing their characters and find out what will happen next. I haven't played either of the earlier games, but I think this game is set 1000 years after them and I think the NPCs refer to the events of the previous games as well as the hero characters from said games.Only bad thing I can say about this game is it is a difficult game, even on normal difficulty. The game gives you very steep difficulty curves and (because I picked to make a Warrior class) the Warrior class has a very hard time because many of the enemies are ranged with poison spells and this makes me have to resort to using a bow which is supposed to be for a thief or ranger class in my opinion. I would advise making a ranged character if you dislike challenges.PS: You can choose to play the original version of the game instead of the director's cut.			"

												A pretty fun action/RPG, but combat can get a little repetitive. The game can also get unusually laggy at times if your graphics settings are turned up... I can play games like Skyrim with no problems, but I had to turn down a lot of the little graphical tweaks in this game.You get to turn into a dragon at various parts of the game, which is a definite plus, although this feature isn't as well integrated into the game as in, say, Drakengard 2 for the PS2.Aside from a slightly-above-average storyline, the game has a really good sense of humour, sort of like a wittier Two Worlds II.Anyway, this is an entertaining game if you are a fan of the genre.

												Divinity II is an action-RPG game set in a fantasy world, with the most apt description I can come up with being like Dragon Age with a single character and the ability to turn into a dragon. You can tactically pause, but it hasn't seemed to be of any use yet. Anyways, I've played 12+ hours so far and it's completely engrossing. No, the graphics aren't perfect, and sometimes it may seem like the game isn't polished as much as it should be, but I was itching for an action RPG game and you can't go wrong wiht this one. The Divinity series as a whole is a great RPG series filled with humor and just plain fun. I fully reccomend it to anyone looking for a fun RPG game.			"

												An RPG where you play as a character that can turn into a giant dragon, take to the sky and rain fire on enemies! Has very good character development mechanics for an RPG and offering a very flexible skill tree system where you can pick skills and upgrades from any branch (example: make a warrior with a fireball spell from the sorcery branch). The game is open world and has a strong storyline to encourage gamers to continue developing their characters and find out what will happen next. I haven't played either of the earlier games, but I think this game is set 1000 years after them and I think the NPCs refer to the events of the previous games as well as the hero characters from said games.Only bad thing I can say about this game is it is a difficult game, even on normal difficulty. The game gives you very steep difficulty curves and (because I picked to make a Warrior class) the Warrior class has a very hard time because many of the enemies are ranged with poison spells and this makes me have to resort to using a bow which is supposed to be for a thief or ranger class in my opinion. I would advise making a ranged character if you dislike challenges.PS: You can choose to play the original version of the game instead of the director's cut.			"

												If you get this game, be sure to get the ""developer's cut"", as it contains the expansion, which you WILL want to play.Good combat - as an archer (which was my primary playthrough) you certainly can feel ""overwhelmed"" when facing hordes of nasty foes;  as you should.Storyline is good, voice acting is good.  Lots of humor hidden in there if you know where to look (and even if you don't)... Brave Sir Robin.  The quests and dungeons are fun to go through, and the puzzles.... can puzzle you.  There minimal (and at times none at all) as far as hand-holding goes for the quests and puzzles - which is a GOOD thing.  You won't be mindlessly following an arrow or looking for the magical sparkly button.  No.  You'll be in a dungeon, actually trying to figure out the puzzle, as it should be.  On rare occasions when you do get stuck, there's always walkthroughs...  Although racking your brain a little longer is much more rewarding when you finally DO figure it out.Also, there's no set classes.  You can play your character any way you want to (though I would suggest specializing in 3-5 skills).  It may not seem like much, but I'd much rather have a single poison arrrow that does nearly 400 damage over 20 seconds, than a bunch of arrows (stun, split arrow, fire arrow, pinning arrow, whatever) that does much less...  That is to say, it is true:  If you are a jack of all trades, you are a master of none.  And masters tend to pack a punch!Swing swords, shoot bows, blast 'em with fireballs, summon undead, summon demons, punch people with your bare fists...  fight however you want.   The only dis-advantage to this is... questing, story, and fighting is all there is to it.  No mini-games, no ""romance"", no craftng system so to speak...  But as an adventure story, it's top notch!Also?  You can play as a dragon.  (and own your own tower).It's true - you will be playing the game a while before you are a dragon.  The game is not rushed!  Many play-hours for you to enjoy, so enjoy it!I honestly wasn't expecting ""that much"" when I bought this game, and I was pleasantly surprised!  I would recommend this game to anybody who likes fantasy games - it caught me, that's for sure - hook line and sinker.  I can't wait to try the next game by these folks!			"

												It's a thumbs up from me. Barely. Not a great game, but a decent one. The good outweighs the bad, but not by much. A flawed gem that should be purchased on sale (which given it's age now that's easy to do).THE GOOD? It's got loads of great humour in it for starters. Including lots of little side shows like rescuing a woman from undead, and then hearing her berate her husband later for sending someone out to rescue her and nagging at him about his marriage vows. Seriously plenty of funny moments. It's nice it doesn't take itself too seriously as a game.The other big plus is the quests are a little better than your average find this, go here, get this quests. There are lots of optional quests, you can ignore them (but you won't level enough if you do, so make sure you do a few). Fortunately many are interesting and entertaining enough to be reasonably worth the time. The skill system also is decent I guess - you can build any way you want. Just don't go shoving 1 point in everything - you'll suck.THE BAD? Well, there's a few issues. The first one is one of those annoyances that makes you want to punch stuff - whenever you are in a dialogue screen and then come out of it into combat, even if you had your weapons drawn, they are now sheathed. And it takes ages to pull them out. While you are fumbling aimlessly (even though you had them out before the chat), you are getting wailed on. In some fights that can matter. It's dumb. It's unnecessary, and bloody frustrating.RPG games are often made or broken on the use of quest logs, maping markers etc. This game falls WELL short in that dept. It's HARD remembering where you did something to get back there once you've got the thing you were after...  - you can't make a quest active with a marker to help you out, and unless you are truly anal, you won't bother with writing notes to help yourself. This bit really does suck. It makes the game frustrating at times. You run around trying to remember which place to go back to to close out parts of the story. Poor. Annoying. A bad oversight.Like I said at the start - it's ok. I've played worse RPGs. I've played better though - quite a few better ones...			"

												This seems to be an above-average RPG. It is somewhat crude (the graphics look definitely somewhat dated, and there's not enough polish here and there), which is to be expected for an indie title, but overall it seems to be well made. The quests are not just fetch and kill, but the authors tried to make them more interesting, some of them even in a witcher-style a bit. The story is maybe too much epic, but engaging nevertheless. Some of the fights are quite difficult even on normal difficulty setting.			"

												You play as a dragon knight. That's all that needs to be said.Jokes aside, it's a rather well built game that if anything sometimes expects too much from the players. Don't expect to take less than 30 hours to complete it IF you skip all the sidequests. Actually, I don't know if you can even complete the game without completing all of the sidequests, because the difficulty curve is more like a difficulty LADDER, and if you're not strong enough to move up the big steps, you won't be getting anywhere anytime soon. Overall solid game, requires some dedication. It's not just ""The dragon knight game"", it's ""The pretty challenging game where you can play a dragon knight if you're patient enough for it"".			"

												This will be my first game I've ever review on steam, and for a good reason. This game is a gem. Its a little rough round the edges, but a gem nonetheless. Multiple ending side quests, an engaging combat system, some great script writing, and consistantly good voice acting, these features really stand out after having played so much skyrim and oblivion. Moreover, the universe manages to avoid feeling generic, something that cannot be said for many other RPGs, cough Kingdoms of Amalur, cough. The lack of hand holding removes quest tedium, forcing the player to pay attentions to what is going on. The stand out problems so far, a few jerky animations, a little grindy to unlock new skills, a lack of character customisation. Lets be fair though, its a 2009 game. Anyone interested in RPGS should take a look.			"

												I have tried again and again to play, and like, this game - but I really just can't. The skills and stats are kinda wonky at best, but first the good stuff: It is largely voiced, it looks decent, there's a pretty decent story. But the combat is just wonky as all hell. It's awkward and unpleasant, things have tons of health, your skills have long cooldowns, cost lots of mana and are largely not very powerful or worthwhile. You can't block, and moving is too lagged by attacking that you will be hit constantly unless you roll around from side to side endlessly, and even then it's unresponsive. I feel it coulda been good, but the combat's awkwardness makes it nearly unbearable.			"

												A solid RPG. I played the entire game -- 67 hours (the Director's Cut includes both the original and the expansion pack, Flames of Vengeance.) I liked the streamlined skill tree -- it made it easy to try new skills. Plus, you don't have to pick a class. I used explosive arrows from the Ranger tree, and a couple skills from the Meele tree (whilrwind, thousand strikes) -- when I wasn't tossing fireballs.The early game is pretty basic, but after awhile, you get to become a dragon, and that made the game uniquely fun (the dragon never felt as powerful as my human form, however, which seems really counter-intuitive. You also can't wipe out humans on the ground with your flame breath -- that would no doubt be too easy.)My biggest issue was the vague quest system. There are no markers for the subsequent steps in quests, and what exactly you need to do is not spelled out. A lot of the quests left me scratching my head, wondering where the game wanted me to go next. I have limited play time, and while I like to explore, I don't really enjoy retracing the same steps over and over as I run around the countryside or in town, trying to remember where Bernard or Benedict or Brutus was when I picked up his quest days earlier.  Keeping track of 20+ quests and each one's next steps required more devotion to detail than I was willing to spend. If you find that to be the case, you might do what I did, and print out quest guides from Game Banshee or the various Divinity wikis (or have them in a browser and Alt+TAB, of course). I'm a completist, and didn't want to miss any side quests. BTW, I played Divinity: Original Sin before this one, and that game's questing system was perfect!My only other complaint was it takes far too long to get your home base -- so managing your inventory is a real pain, unless you spend skill points to be able to lug more stuff, or sell off stuff you're not even sure you need yet.Other than that , I had a good time and would recommend the game to anyone who likes fantasy RPGs.

												Overall this game is good, it's somewhat different from other RPG's especially the Ego Draconis, never actually played a game an rpg game that has this element, you, the player being actually a leader and actually owning a base (battle tower) and people working for you and helping you in your quest. The player battles are quite fun, and there is somewhat a challenge when playing melee rather than magic / ranged just because you can't really avoid most of the projectiles coming for you. The dragon combat on the other part isn't quite as challenging as it seems like, you just fly around and destroy towers and nests and that's pretty much all, altouh the end of the FoV is rather good, and brings a little more challenge.The quests are fun to say the least, some are annoying, some are funny, but they fit the game rather good. There is a lot of rewards for doing the sidequests. The total playtime though is not even close to the one advertised 60hrs+. I for instance finished the game in 33hrs, and explored almost all, and done almost all quests.Overall, good game, had fun playing it, especially as human, and will be looking forward for the next installment.

												I'll start by saying that I don't know a damn thing about this series. I got it just because I thought it looked cool. That being said, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect other than, well, an RPG.The atmosphere is okay. The music is great. I liked the art style, but the actual implementation of the environmental textures and models feels a bit sloppily done, like an MMO. For example, in Aleroth City, the paved areas extend well beyond the buildings and climb up the terrain; Pavers look pretty stupid when they're painted all over the hills. I'm fairly certain these areas were intended to be hidden from view, but often can be seen by just rotating the camera.The scale of the game is quite impressive, excellent for facilitating the dragon mechanics. The transition between the human and dragon forms is pretty smooth, but considering the enemies for each of these forms will only attack, and only be able to be attacked, when the player is in the proper form, it sometimes seems a bit pointless to restrict the ability to transform.The quests are pretty fun. There's a good mix of variety and routine. They don't really lead the player around too much, but the difficulty of the enemies in the main story quests often make it difficult to progress without sucking all of the experience possible out of the side quests.The combat also feels a bit weird. The majority of the difficulty comes from having to face multiple opponents at once. The game provides several options to even the odds, in the form of summons, necromancy, and charm spells, but the primary purpose of these always seems to be giving the enemies more targets, rather than providing oneself with a direct offensive output. Even tank builds feel very limited in their damage output. No matter what weapons the player has, everything is DPS, and when the enemy starts cranking out overpowered healing spells, fights drag out longer. It's all a matter of whether the player can mash the attack button until the enemy dies. There is very little real strategy.Overall, it's okay. It's not perfect, but provides a decent amount of immersive gameplay for your buck.			"

												When I first bought the game at retail it was a mess. Horrible controls and laggy as hell. After a while I found a huge patch that fixed almost everything that had previously stopped me from playing. I had great fun with the humour, although I'm afraid of crossing bridges now. The balance was something I had to get used to, but everything worked out well enough to finish this game... And here was the biggest problem. The ending of Ego Draconis was the least satisfying I`d ever encountered. Yet some time later, Larian released the addon Flames of Vengeance. Finally, the game got the ending it deserved, so I thought. But paying full price again, only to have the satisfaction of giving my character a real victory? No way.Now, Steam sells the Developer's Cut for 4€ and I ask myself, why did I ever even buy any game at a store?I could already recommend Ego Draconis for what it was, even with the unsatisfactory ending. But after finishing FoV, I go from saying 'it's worth a try' to 'an action rpg you HAVE to try!'			"

There are some charming flaws, such as any time any character speaks with arm and head movements it looks like they're going into a full seizure. I think what disappointed me most about this game is that it felt like it was over too quickly. It's really only two areas to explore through. Content wise it can't even pretend to compare to a game like Skyrim.There's still a fun 50+ or 100+ hour game here, depending on how much you enjoy destroying towers as a dragon. And I did enjoy the plot more than I thought I would. I'd recommend it, since even the non sale price tag is reasonable.			"

												Divinity II: Developer's Cut is a highly under appreciated game that does not receive the attention it deserves. This is basically the Collector's Edition of the Game of the Year version of the original game. Simply put, the original game was very buggy and re-released with DLC, a new game engine, and many bug fixes. This improves on that re-release.To compare it to more well known games, it features combat similar to the Elder Scrolls series, loot and upgrades similar to Diablo series, and (less influential) dialogue chooses from the Mass Effect Series. There is also a tremendous skill tree from which you can mix and match all play styles without restriction (other than your level). Two unique features in the game are mind reading, which usually allows you to find additional loot, and turning into a dragon, which has very smooth controls but less expansive combat.The story is kind of all over the place, but it needs to be mentioned that the ending of the main game is terrible. I will not spoil it, but the game ends without any kind of big moment. There are, however, some twists and a tone that isn'y present in many games. The included DLC is great in terms of flushing out an entire city with numerous type of unique people, personalities, and quests. However, once again the main story is not consistent with the ending again feeling pretty cheap.Overall, Divinity II: Developer's Cut is a really good game. There are some bugs with it (I really only experienced 1 bug that didn't let me finish a side quest, but it was corrected in Developer's Mode). It may not blow you away, but it is still a very fun experience that allows a large amount of freedom. The game is a must buy on sale, but still worth the full price if not on sale.I posted an entire playthrough on my YouTube channel for anyone interest in checking out aspects of gameplay.

												(Summary)Pros: Fun quests, excellent combat, funny dialogue, wonderful sense of progression, lots of interesting ideas and innovations rarely seen in RPG's (like mind-reading at the cost of xp) and yet another excellent soundtrack by Kirill Pokrovsky, who is sadly no longer with us. Cons: Hasen't really aged well in terms of graphics and has some pretty stiff and awkward animations. Also, the main story is just okay, and won't really mean a whole lot to you if you aren't familiar with the series. Overall: 8/10(Lengthy bit where I ♥♥♥♥♥ about Ultima) The Divinity series is interesting. It's a series that clearly and openly takes cues from the old Ultima series; a series that has the distinction of having some of the best RPG's of all time AND some of the worst. If I were to describe the first Divinity game, Divine Divinity, in a nutshell, it would be ""Ultima 8: Pagan, but good."" Divinity 2 gets a similar description with regards to the disaster that was Ultima 9: Accension. It's a large, open world third person action RPG. The game will expect you to do a lot of exploration, talk to a lot of people, face some pretty damn challenging enemies and solve some pretty interesting puzles, like playing a game of riddles with a talking treasure box. The game also does something very well that Ultima 9 failed at miserably; making you feel powerful. In Ultima 9 your character was the Titan of Ether, a god in a sense, and both the story and the game itself didn't even seem to notice. At an early point in Divinity 2 your character becomes a Dragon Knight, which is a really big deal for the setting, and the changes that it inflicts upon your character over the course of the game are pretty substantial, and most importantly, they're actually FELT. Not just within the contet of the game, but the series as a whole. The distinction between your character in Divinity 2 and the other characters you play as over the course of the series, even taking engine differences and personal customization into account, is literally night and day, and it does an excellent job of making you feel like a budding top-tier entity in the world of Rivellon.

												This review contains SPOILERS.Please bear in mind, the following is my opinion alone. You may disagree with my opinion.This review is for Part One, Ego Draconis.Divinity II: Developer's Cut is a brilliant game, possibly (with the exception of Skyrim) the best.Firstly, you have all the classic RPG elements - goblins, evil necromancers, legends and prophecies and stuff, and of course female armour which seems to protect you more the less of it there is. That makes perfect sense, right...?There's a plot twist early on in the game in which you become a Dragon Knight - a Dragon Slayer blessed with increased power who can turn into a dragon by using the Dragon Stone.A fecking DRAGON. That fact alone makes the game amazing.You select a class at the beginning, but you can eventually sort of make your own as the game progresses - you're not entirely stuck into one class like Mage or Necromancer or Warrior or Archer, you can morph them into something new. I call mine a Battle Mage - A Mage/Necromancer who has some Warrior skills.Of course, as with every game, there are cons. The level design for Sentinel Island is simply appalling - it takes twenty million years to get anywhere and once you get there you have to engage in a short conversation and then travel for another twenty million years to go and have another short conversation and then you travel for another twenty million years to get to the bloody totem to choose the person you want for a specific role.You have to do that four times.The switching between Dragon and Human could also be a bit smoother, and so could the movement when you are a Dragon.There's also the problem with the female armour.RATINGSGraphics - 6/10Gameplay - 8/10Story Originality - 3/10The Actual Story - 6/10Value for Money - 5/10 - Should be more like £10.99 not £12.99Replayability - 5/10 - You can re-play the game with different classes but eventually it will get boringLength - 6/10 - I haven't yet finished my current game and I have spent about 6 hours on itExtra Special Feature - You can become a dragon.

												Reminiscent game. Nothing spectacular but full of lore and dialogue. If you can catch the developers cut on special, play the DLC where you start from mid-game level, and pound a few hours into it. Skill tree's and general mechanics are incredibly well balanced - allowing for many different play styles. Interactive storyline which is somewhat genius for it's time.			"

												The game, for the most part, is great. Dynamic, ability-focused, with tons of loot, nice animations and a great sense of humour. If I had to state two things that are severely lacking, they would be: the game ending sold as DLC (Flames of Vengeance) - rectified in the Director's Cut integrating the two, and the ending which is so terribly un-epic that it's downright criminal.

												I totally LOVE playing this and the other games in the Divinity Anthology.   This one is my favorite one for so many reasons.  This is total FUN!!!  Just the right amount of mob grinds and interesting and interactive questing.  I never hungered for either nor opportunities to advanced my character.  I have been able to play this at the level/levels that I desired...full on or slower and more focused.  I never felt limited and that is a very fun way to play.  Not to mention...getting to fly and be a powerful dragon is the ultimate in enjoyment!  I love the flying over the beautiful and intense areas.  My family has seen me enjoy this game so much that they cannot wait to play it, too.			"

Never thought I would complete this one, finally did it and it was a nice experience. Especially the continuation of story from Divine Divinity and Beyond Divinity. I read somewhere that the Divinity games are not linked and can be played separately. I disagree with that after playing the game. But that’s my opinion.  I tried completing this one in 2010 two or three time but always quit in between. But finally got interested again in the divinity series and yes it’s a definitely recommended is you like Divinity Series. Story is good and also Sides quests are interesting. This game has a learning curve, once you past that, you will enjoy it really.Games runs like a charm without any glitches or technical issues, unlike Beyond Divinity. "

												I have always enjoyed Larian Studios' sense of Humour and the great lengths they go to to fill their world with as much to see as possible. This game is no exception and while there are certainly area's that could be improved upon (namely the clunky combat, wonky AI, bad pathing and just moving around was a hassle sometimes) there are more positives to commend it. If you enjoy 3d action rpgs that don't take themselves too seriously but still offer an engaging story, loads of content and memorable characters, this game is for you.Overall certainly a great buy for the price, thoroughly enjoyed it :)			"

												I greatly enjoyed the game, but it has the nasty habbit of making things harder to find. This isn't bad in itself, but there are certain things you might need to consult a walkthrough about if you're truly stumped, and without patching it has an issue where at random points a random boss might drain all your health.

												A very overlooked game, due to problems and a messy release (thanks to the publisher). It also couldn´t hide its obviously intention for a console release, which lead to clunky controls and the typical ""port"" feeling on the pc (despite the game being released on pc first). However, Larian is a great Dev-studio and seems very dedicated to iron out its mistakes and thanks to the Directors Cut we get a very good open-ish RPG experience.*Graphics and Sound*They still look very pretty and while it can´t keep up with time, the art style and overall love for detail creates an environment that holds up, combine this with the fantastic soundtrack and immersion is given in this game. Sometimes bad textures stick out and not much variation in animation, however the game is several years old and its nothing to really sniff at. The soundtrack is really fantastic, i would go so far as saying that it is one of Larians biggest strength in all of their games. Keep the sound up and you won´t be disappointed. The atmosphere created is spot on!*Technical side*I have not seen one bug, whatsover. I also had zero crashes on Win7 64x. Obviously thats just my experience and others my vary.*Gameplay*I´m pretty sure controler wouldn´t be in issue, this of course can be helped with free 3th pary software, however i choose keyboard+mouse and it worked fine. The combat is action-hotkey oriented, however movement makes a difference (like jumping and then smashing down on enemies). Most of the enemy fire can also be dodged. Still, it does become a bit repetitive after some time, this might be because i choose a melee character to play, but it certainly has also to do with the very odd power curve in the game. While at the beginning one could sometimes struggle in fights and go thru some health potions, you later become a monster and just hack thru enemies. The game also rewards exploration and riddle solving giving you (in my opinion) sometimes overpowerd items as a reward, this making you to powerful early on. Neverless, combat is sufficiently and the dragon form mixes it up enough. Riddles and hidden treasure were a big surprise, sometimes very hard to catch/see and some required actual thinking. Thats rare. Respecing is always possible when the player gets his strongehold. There is also crafting in the game, which except from enchanting, i never needed though. An important thing i need to mention that others pointed out wrongly. Yes it is openworld-ish, but more in the theme of Baldurs Gate (actualy less): you get your main story and you can explore the current zone(s). But not progress further until you finished your main quest in these. So its not like Skyrim and the world is also not that big. Also it is true that you can´t import your save from the first one...but i think there is an autosave generated because the directors cut treats the game as a whole with the expansion AND you have your gear/money and everything still when you enter the x-pac section of the game.*Story*Story is important in a RPG and Divinity 2 does deliver but also lacks depth. The story isn´t bad and there are some twists and turns, especially at the end. Any RPG player however won´t find a lot of surprises, its pretty generic. However, the big strength in Larian games are the side quests, filled with hints, riddles, very funny dialouge and options. They are the main drive force of the game, and to me, are the interesting part. There are also enough of them to keep you playing. *Overall opinion*For 20.- its definitely worth the purchase, even better with a deal. Its a good RPG that rewards exploration and thinking, with a not so great combat system but lots of humor and interesting quests in it. Overall i think the ambition behind it was just bigger than the budget (this reminded me a LOT of Kingdoms of Amalur). Still, i expected much less and was really surprised.			"

												If you get this game, be sure to get the ""developer's cut"", as it contains the expansion, which you WILL want to play.Good combat - as an archer (which was my primary playthrough) you certainly can feel ""overwhelmed"" when facing hordes of nasty foes;  as you should.Storyline is good, voice acting is good.  Lots of humor hidden in there if you know where to look (and even if you don't)... Brave Sir Robin.  The quests and dungeons are fun to go through, and the puzzles.... can puzzle you.  There minimal (and at times none at all) as far as hand-holding goes for the quests and puzzles - which is a GOOD thing.  You won't be mindlessly following an arrow or looking for the magical sparkly button.  No.  You'll be in a dungeon, actually trying to figure out the puzzle, as it should be.  On rare occasions when you do get stuck, there's always walkthroughs...  Although racking your brain a little longer is much more rewarding when you finally DO figure it out.Also, there's no set classes.  You can play your character any way you want to (though I would suggest specializing in 3-5 skills).  It may not seem like much, but I'd much rather have a single poison arrrow that does nearly 400 damage over 20 seconds, than a bunch of arrows (stun, split arrow, fire arrow, pinning arrow, whatever) that does much less...  That is to say, it is true:  If you are a jack of all trades, you are a master of none.  And masters tend to pack a punch!Swing swords, shoot bows, blast 'em with fireballs, summon undead, summon demons, punch people with your bare fists...  fight however you want.   The only dis-advantage to this is... questing, story, and fighting is all there is to it.  No mini-games, no ""romance"", no craftng system so to speak...  But as an adventure story, it's top notch!Also?  You can play as a dragon.  (and own your own tower).It's true - you will be playing the game a while before you are a dragon.  The game is not rushed!  Many play-hours for you to enjoy, so enjoy it!I honestly wasn't expecting ""that much"" when I bought this game, and I was pleasantly surprised!  I would recommend this game to anybody who likes fantasy games - it caught me, that's for sure - hook line and sinker.  I can't wait to try the next game by these folks!			"

												A solid RPG. I played the entire game -- 67 hours (the Director's Cut includes both the original and the expansion pack, Flames of Vengeance.) I liked the streamlined skill tree -- it made it easy to try new skills. Plus, you don't have to pick a class. I used explosive arrows from the Ranger tree, and a couple skills from the Meele tree (whilrwind, thousand strikes) -- when I wasn't tossing fireballs.The early game is pretty basic, but after awhile, you get to become a dragon, and that made the game uniquely fun (the dragon never felt as powerful as my human form, however, which seems really counter-intuitive. You also can't wipe out humans on the ground with your flame breath -- that would no doubt be too easy.)My biggest issue was the vague quest system. There are no markers for the subsequent steps in quests, and what exactly you need to do is not spelled out. A lot of the quests left me scratching my head, wondering where the game wanted me to go next. I have limited play time, and while I like to explore, I don't really enjoy retracing the same steps over and over as I run around the countryside or in town, trying to remember where Bernard or Benedict or Brutus was when I picked up his quest days earlier.  Keeping track of 20+ quests and each one's next steps required more devotion to detail than I was willing to spend. If you find that to be the case, you might do what I did, and print out quest guides from Game Banshee or the various Divinity wikis (or have them in a browser and Alt+TAB, of course). I'm a completist, and didn't want to miss any side quests. BTW, I played Divinity: Original Sin before this one, and that game's questing system was perfect!My only other complaint was it takes far too long to get your home base -- so managing your inventory is a real pain, unless you spend skill points to be able to lug more stuff, or sell off stuff you're not even sure you need yet.Other than that , I had a good time and would recommend the game to anyone who likes fantasy RPGs.

												Divinity is an adventure RPG where you, the gamer are put into a world of mystical creatures and are a ""Dragon Slayer"". If you've played the first Divinity and bought the 2nd game before this version, then you'll most likely know the story. Since this is the ""Developer's Cut"" there is plenty of added content to this game, such as new transformations, weapons and so much more. The game is wonderfully atmospheric, and is also unique. You'd think this would be like a Skyrim clone, but it's not. I won't give anything away, because the story is worth it. However, it allows you to design your character, but what brings it down is that you're limited to how you can make it, VERY limited. And sometimes, if you're PC doesn't work properly, the game can freeze or shut down. So be mindful. Otherwise, this game is fantastic, and I'd play this game any day (Even though I don't play it cause I'm not on all the time XD)			"

												This Games has some sense of real spooks in it... Larien Artists realy have the ability to spook it up good. The Game play is Solid. Actions are all complete and work correctly... Remember this is actually two full games, and if you need a manual, go to youtube, as there are some guides there. The puzzles to solve on getting into the deap areas are not so play when your wits are working well. Even though graphics are a little dated, the magical color uses are just astounding. I so wish Larian would continue this part of the story, and even make all the things they planned into DIVINITY II... If you look at the making of parts of this special edition, you will see they planned some really epic content, that maybe got canned because of space and ability of single core PC's... Not sure, but Larian really is a creative bunch, and if you are a persevering person, this game will not dissapoint I promise. However, if you are lazy, and want everything handed to you, you will not likely even be able to finish this game half way. Not a game for dumb dumbs sorry Common Core Crowd.... This one is not for the Dumbed Down Generation... Just Go text your friends while driving, and play dodge the innocent human beings like you usually do... Yes... I do have your number and it's up on this game...			"

												i played this game back on xbox 360, and as buggy as it kind of was, i still like it more then original sin or that other one i forgot what it was called. after this one they started switching from 3rd person rpg to other stuff, which im not against, but i like getting hands on and in the middle of the action alot more. this game had some broken elements to it and some bugs to work around, but it is an awesome world with a very underrated element: you get to turn into a friggin dragon, and it is actually pulled off really well. there may be better rpgs out there but for the price this is incredible. i actually never beat the game myself but i plan to this time through, though i read the ending is bad in both the original and expansion, but im mentally prepared for that and i hope anyone reading this willl be to. i really hope one day this company takes the money there making from the original sin games and makes a true 3rd person rpg sequal and really focuses on improving combat, balance, and story. however as it is i totally give it a thumbs up. just get ready for some things that will kind of stab at your rpg experience, but not really ruin it unless your super picky.

I especially like the music. The story is also above average for sure and being a dragon is pretty sick.The drawbacks are all in the level design. Often they will trap you in a room and you must just search for the tiny book (in an entire ♥♥♥♥ing library) or key to click on in an entire area of interactables. Often these interactables will chunk you for 55% of your max hp if you pick the wrong thing. This leads to just reloading and searching for WAY too long in many places. So I strongly recommend just googling every time you are stuck so you can focus on the great parts of the game which is combat, story, exploring, and your characters development. It even has some platforming elements which are fun too.Plus there is no fall damage so you can skydive off of towers. Later in the game you can skydive, then halfway through your fall, turn into a dragon and fly away. But in the best interests for your sanity, google through the ""puzzles"" which are basically click on stuff which kills you until you find the hidden thing to click on which doesn't			"

												Underrated gem.Lots of options for your build, lot of quests with differents outcomes, really good gameplay mechanics, and you can turn into a dragon at will. AT WILL.			"

												So far the game runs smoothly on Windows 10 64bit , controls feel pretty good like an MMORPG very similar to dragon age. I really like the ability to create your own custom class with any ability combimation. The graphics are not bad but they aren't great either (running GTX 960) but the voice work is had effort put into it.I will keep updating the review as I play more of this game! One problem I have found is that it crashes if you alt tab to desktop!			"

												It's a little funky, but a great game overall.Okay graphics, good controls, great plot and humour.Fantastic skill and item systems, good pacing. The engine is a bit derpy, but it won't matter these days.If you can tough it out the first hour or so, it's good, and there's a good 70hr+ of gameplay here.It's a VERY creative game.(Dragon combat is a bit disappointing though.)

												One of the best RPG's I have ever played! - Completely free character development.- Great and detailed fantasy universe.- Lots of content.- Unique humor and memorable characters.- Skill based fighting system.Played it for many many hours before its steam release.			"
