												(EDIT: I sat down a few weeks ago and pretty much 100%ed the game. Additional thoughts below the original 2013 review)I just can't do it. I just can't recommend MIght & Magic X.I played this during the beta, and played through the game twice. I decided to wait to try it again until after the beta was finished. When it was released, I was onto other games and hadn't gotten around to it.Then, the Legend of Grimrock 2 came out, and I played all of the way through that, which got me nostalgic to play this one again.But it's so bad. Particularly compared to Grimrock 2, but moreso even against it's predecessors. Even Might and Magic III, made in 1991 (23 years ago), is a better game in nearly every way. I've loved every Might & Magic game and have played through them all multiple times. This game is a shadow of those games. They decided to move back to a tile-based system. Unlike most people, I was fine with that. It didn't bother me.What does bother me are the boring mechanics, limited and uninteresting character creation and development, a boring story, *cartoony* graphics, poor gameplay, bugs, typos (I counted 2 just in the narrated intro), hostile controls, lousy mapping.. I really want to like this. But I can't. Just.... I'm just sad about it.(EDIT: I spent about 50 hours and pretty much 100%ed the game. Did all the side quests, the post-game content, the main story.. and yeah, it's still bad. The equipment is uninteresting, the spells are boring, the combat is cake-walk easy after about 30-35% of the way through the game. Uninspired boss battles (the last boss was a joke), the dungeons are short and boring, the world map is tiny... most of the game duration came from having to backtrack across the world 100+ times.  Definitely not worth it.)			"

												Greets.To anyone who have doubts about purchasing or not Early Access version at this point, i would strongly recommend to wait until final release, and getting some reviews by approved and trusted sources. At this point of Early Access devs are not going to implement any serious changes in the gameplay process, basically limiting your feedback to bug reporting, not to mention that Ubisoft has its own team of testers assigned to this task.The game is controversial at best, so for many RPG fans it can become a serious dissapointment and a crash of expectations. My advice is: be patient and wait until it is released and reviewed by RPG gaming community. For some reason, many have been misguided, considering the game is still at alpha stage, and yet to pass through long development process. While LE studio considers otherwise, and here i will quote Thomas, LE technical lead:<LE-Thomas>	Question: will we get christmas update with more content? xD like lets say, new areas and quests? <LE-Thomas>	Answer: Sorry, the team is currently working on finalizing the game. There will be no more content updates to the game until the release. Until early 2014 is not a long time left anymore. ;)This was stated during the third developers chat session. Obviously they will release the game in its current state. This simply adds more reason not to purchase Early Access version. Also a HUGE WARNING NOTE.CAUTION:This adressed to all M&M VI, VII and VIII fans. In case you're one of them, check all the information about the game twice or even thrice as meticulosly, before making a decision. This game is based on M&M IV: Clouds of Xeen & M&M V: Darkside of Xeen. It has very illusive resemblance, if any at all, with M&M games staring from Mandate of Heaven.This been added at the 29th of november:Ok, now i will give some general info to familiarize you with some aspects of this project, i find rather questionable and controversial. Starting with:1) Size of the game world.M&MX is told to be consisted of 4 Acts, with Act 1 available during the Early Access. Act 1 location (including both Sorpigal by the sea and Peninsula maps) feels to be half the size of, for ex., Castle Ironfist location (from M&MVI). Act 1 offers us five dungeons, those being: Spider cave in Sorpigal; Lighthouse, Bandit Hideout, Catle Portmeyor and Cursed Ruins (which is not available in the Early Access phase) scattered all over peninsula map. Also we have two caves, each holding a single Cyclop monster inside and an empty puzzle cave. The size of these dungeons are medium, and it won't be much of an exaggeration to say that Castle Darkmoor (MMVI) would be able to contain all of them within itself.Now, to make an approximate estimation of the overall world size, you can take a look at the ""World Map"" picture, where i marked the borders of the area Act 1 occupies.http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/24/8j6k.png2) Character creation and development2.1 Races.M&MX creators offer us 4 races to depict our party members from. Those being: human, elf, dwarf and orc. The difference between them lies in starting stats, certain level of mastery they can advance to in different skills, names of the classes for each race to choose from, appearences, and minor starting race-dependant bonus, like elf having +5 evade, +10 earth resistance from the beggining.http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/34/c2om.png2.2 Classes.Only three classes are at our disposal to choose from for each race. Basically we are given three same classes for each race, being: warrior, archer, mage (so it goes like: Human Warrior, Human Mage, Human Archer/Elf Warrior, Elf Mage, Elf Archer, etc.). The difference between them is: how they are named, ex: Mercenary (HW) against Barbarian (OW); their promotions; level of mastery they can achieve in a certain skill and appearences.http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/7/tily.pnghttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/89/wzi5.pnghttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/46/5g0q.pnghttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/15/nkwx.png2.3 Class promotions.Each class has a promotion to be achieved through the game. There will be only one, against two in the later M&M games. It will give one additional ability to the character, no other bonuses are know about at the current moment.http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/543/81ab.png2.4 Character customization.After choosing a race and class it is time to customize character appearences. You have a wide variety of two drawn pictures for each gender (one male body/one female body), each in turn having two faces you can switch between (giving us four different portraits to sum it up).http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/844/vi97.png2.5 Skills.Developers have cropped all non-combat related skills like: trap find/disarm, repair, trade, identify (there will be a spell), diplomacy, perception...any other player-world interraction skill you can think of. Leaving three groups: weapon mastery skills, magic mastery skills and misc combat related skills like dual-wielding, dodge, evade, skill adding crit chance to a spell based attack, etc.http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/837/y8jg.png2.6 Magic.Developers decided not to implement magic system from the later M&M games, where you were able to learn every spell at basic level, and advancing in magic mastery upgraded effects of each spell differently, based on the spell itself. Now it is more standard ""magic mastery of certain level requirement for each spell"". You can learn certain spells at basic level, certain at expert and so on. Spell effect doesn't change while you advance in magic mastery. The following picture will show you all Air magic school spells (basic to GM), that will be available in the game. http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/199/yo0c.pngSpell description:http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/163/x8j6.pngThere will be no Item Enchant spell, in case anybody is wondering.2.7 Inventory.We will have combined inventory now, each item occupying one slot. Also no paper-dolls (items won't be shown on player's picture being dressed) Equiping this or that item won't alter character picture in any way.http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600q90/593/n50l.png3) Character/world interaction.Due to absence of non-combat related skills, player gaming experience is limited mostly to combat, opening objects (chests, barrels), getting buffs (one buff statue in Sorpigal, one in Peninsula). There is one quest in the first act, which implies on giving the freedom of choice to a player (you can kill or let go bandit leader), other than this, there are no player-choise driven situations.4) Combat.This is what it is all about. Judging from absence of non-combat related skills, lack of player-world interaction besides engaging your enemies, and answers from developers themselves, LE are trying to create combat oriented game (tile- and turnbased gameplay fits this concept idealy). Unfortunately they are not succeeding here either. Combat is rather standard and despite the looks of it, doesn't provide you with enough tactical depth you would anticipate. Poor variety of character classes, lack of significant race dependant perks/abilities, standard skill set, absence of really valuable effects of tactical (not damage dealing) spells, ect. make the game unable to offer reach and thrilling combat experience. Not to go deep: you cann't aim anything in case it is not standing in the adjacent tile.This meaning: if you have two or more opponents approaching you, apart in two or three tiles, you won't be able to target specific one to use a spell on or attack from distance (with an arrow, for ex.). Those attacks will be delivered randomly (or you may use area damage spell) to any enemy standing in the same tile. This was mentioned a hundred times to de			"

												As someone who bought MM-1 off the shelf way back in the day, and have played every game in the series other than 9, the mixed reviews made me hesitant to jump in.  But picking up the deluxe version (includes MM6) on sale I jumped in, and have been pleasantly surprised.Reading other reviews, I can relate to a lot of the pros/cons cited, but for me things other people found as cons (combat, grid movement) were very much pros for me.  I think what this game does well, it does very well, but it may not be to everyone's taste.MMX strips out a number of features that existed in 6-8 in particular, but ultimately that makes MMX much more of a tactical game than its predecessors. In those games in most environments you could easily exploit the strength of ranged combat and the opportunity to toggle in/out of turn-based combat to kite. I may have, at times, even exploited running out of dungeons to avoid a fight or having to reload in those earlier MM games - that doesn't work here.Kiting in this game is only at all possible with certain class combinations, and the 'ambush' nature of many encounters and the inability to move with an enemy already in melee range make that impossible. MMX will require you to rest, and use potions, and buff/debuff. If you open a door in a dungeon without saving or resting first,  you'll probably regret it.  And AFAIK you can't leave an area while in combat to exploit out of the fight.As for character creation, I'd agree that the options for any individual character are not deep (which may hamper your RP enjoyment), but party selection itself is imo a moderately complex tactical game. The variety of options for party composition are deep.  12 classes and 4 races to choose from, and you're almost certain to have to forgo something you really want in your party (whether a race, or a buff, or dps combos).Puzzles are pretty good on the whole, story is meh (but personally I don't think plot has ever been high on the list of reasons to play MM), and the skill system is true to its predecessors while offering a variety of small tweaks/improvements.  As for being one-shot, that can happen, and generally for 2 reasons: 1) you wandered into an area too high for your party level, or 2) you really needed to get your buffs on. If you aren't completely turned off by the notion of a turn-based, tactical RPG where there's more focus on the complexity of party creation and skill progress, for me that has been a real steal, and makes me very willing to consider paying full price if they release a follow up.  Will you have to save/reload a lot even on normal difficulty? Yes, but for me that's been part of the charm - progression in this game feels like an actual achievement.Edit - wrote the initial review at the end of Act 2, roughly lvl 20. On ""normal"" difficulty, this is around the point where the difficulty level swings quite a bit, since you start to GM in skills and have access to the gold and trainers needed to do it.  But all in all, I definitely enjoyed it, and after moving through some other games in my backed-up library, will consider playing again on heroic difficulty.			"

												EDIT: NEW REVIEW AFTER 25 HOURS OF PLAYING FULL RELEASE...LOVED IT, even better than I thought it would be. I never meant to compare this title to the old series coz I didnt care to do so to begin with!For me it's old school rpg coz its a 4 party, turn-based, 1st-person game.Totally different from what EA gave us and REALLY fun to play...for me its the opposite of Skyrim and I think the devs did excellent job to bring something that goes the opposite direction from today's mainstream rpgs.In my opinion: Well-balanced, tough fights on warrior-mode, open world-meaning that there are some enemies that you have to comeback even in Act 1 in order to fight 'em after you beefed up in levels, better AI and monster behavior, better skill/magic/buff system, smooth heroes/enemy movement and so on.Yes, they could have added some extras to make it really great game, but I think it's an awesome start. I understand that there are ppl who are disappointed coz they expected something else along the lines of an exact copy of an older MM game with modern engine/graphics...BUT I'M EXTREMELLY HAPPY the way this game is AS IT IS!!!Hope next one in line is a monster...good battles to all the brothers who are enjoying MMX. OLD REVIEW: Loved it even with its early access faults...when they balance enough aspects of the game, it will be really great fun to play.Not for people who expect a game like Skyrim, its for old school rpg fans with the benefit of auto-mapping...just wish they'd put more riddles along the way and maybe more quests affecting the outcome of the main story or the characters.Sure the devs wont follow on all the great suggestions from the community but still it will be worth playing and enjoy yourself if the content of the final release is big enough.To expect the perfect game on all aspects/parts of a game and on top of that to have the devs please all different kind of rpg fans is useless...READ the reviews and then DECIDE if that's the game you want to play or not...the game is a tile-based/turn-based and they should improve the parts of the game based on that idea...dont mind if they had the option for free movement but it shouldnt be a pre-requirement to play an rpg-game like this...there are tons of other rpg games for that.

												Soulless, chopped-down knock-off of the original Might and Magic games. Hilariously few options, outdated and unnecessary control scheme, few skills, autoloot and the screen constantly shouting at you ""THIS IS A DOOR, DO YOU WANT TO OPEN IT?! [PRESS SPACE]"", because clicking doors and containers to open and enemies to attack was too straight-forward and sensible. Were it intended as an Android game, it'd be ok; for a full-blown PC game, it's laughable.And, of course, it requires a UPlay account to play, because Games For Windows Live was such a good idea, Ubisoft just had to make their own version of it.I definitely do not recommend this cheap attempt at milking a dead franchise.Plus, Might and Magic 6, 7 and 8 are quite cheap on GoG and the likes. Why waste your time and money on this? I know I wish I hadn't.			"

												I purchased this item because I played through all the MM titles and liked it a lot. When I saw this title here on Steam I was positively suprised and immediately bought it in rememberance of the good old times.Unfortunately I'm quite dissaspointed with it though. Graphics is ok, but gameplay is horrible. The characters frequently issue warning shouts, even though there is nothing to see. What is really annyoing though is, that you can easily get locked into a fight where you don't even want to, because the party has to rest. But you can't walk away, so the only thing left to do is to reload. This also includes getting into a dungeon where you realize that the enemy is to tough, but you can't back out anymore, because you are not allowed to leave the dungeon and flee until the fight is over.I don't know if I missremeber MM in the wrong way, but I don't recall having such issues in the original series.Another total annoying thing is that you have to register with UPlay. I can't even play offline when I don't have internet. WHY????? I specifically purchase such games to take them with me on my laptop to summer vacation, where I often don't have internet, and this is really annoying for no apparent reason! "

												Might & Magic X is one of the most underestimated game. It deserves to get more positive reviews. The combat of this game is considerably tactical, as compared to recent RPG games including recent old school type ones.  Depending on enemy's attributes, you need to carefully choose which skill you gonna use to attack it or to make your characters survive. Sometimes your magic does not work for enemies. So it is important to check the magic resistance of your enemy in a journal.The game asks careful character progression. You can not increase all of your skills up to grandmaster. Also, your game play would be very easy depending on which skill you learn or increase. So you need to make a plan for your character. This is a pleasure in a RPG game, not a pain.The game gives you chances to solve many puzzles and riddles. Most of them are easy, but some are difficult. However, when you solve them by yourself, it will give you a great fun.Based on the points above, I highly recommend this game to someone who likes turn-based, party-based, or old school RPG. Have a fun~			"

												There are 2 really good reasons to stay away from this game:First, if you have the 'misfortune' of playing in a 32bit system, the developer deemed you unworthy of voice overs and any texture setting above medium, making the game look like it belongs in the early 2000's.Second, if you actually manage to play to the end of Act One, and you have the 'misfortune' of being in Uplay offline mode, like I was during my vacations, you'll find yourself unable to continue. Yes, you read that right, without having 'Cloud sync savegames' enabled and being online in Uplay, you can't select the option to fly to the Elemental Forge from Lev.Third (bonus reason): you can restore the voice over editing a .txt file and enable flight to the Elemental Forge editing a XML file, so there is no technical reason for these choices. It's plain idiocy.Very unhappy.Edits: Typos.			"

												Before reading any further, please note! The game has been reported ""dead"" by the publisher. No more DLCs or bugfixes will be provided.While the game runs okay for most players, it unfortunately has been left with some serious unfixed problems on some system configurations that range from overheating on laptops, freezes on Macs, and annoying stuttering on some NVIDIA cards that may render the game almost unplayable, to (in rare cases) crashes to desktop. Be warned that customer service will probably not provide you with much more than ""have you tried turning it off and on again"" in case you are affected by any of the above mentioned bugs. Purchase at your own risk!If you loved the M&M 1-5 games (and have a graphic card that can handle it), you may actually enjoy the game just for the fan-factor. It may not be the expected ""big sequel"" but it is solid and entertaining.If you are new to M&M however, or you have just played ""Heroes of Might and Magic"" so far, this game may disappoint you.Also if you are looking for a ""Legend of Grimrock""-like RPG, be warned that this game has a very different feel to it. While the game-mechanics are similar, the gameplay actually feels a lot more static and not as action-oriented.1. The game itselfM&M 10 is playing after the story of Heroes of Might and Magic 6. The gameplay and ""feel"" of the game however is mostly based on Might and Magic 3-5.The game is grid-based with turn-based combat. This means you move through the world 1 step at a time and there is no free movement. If you encounter an opponent the game stops and switches to a turn-based combat mode. You then give your party members commands to attack, defend or use magical powers. Once you have done that the round switches to your enemies who will do the same until either you or your opponent drops dead, whatever comes first.Since the gameplay is based on M&M 3-5 fans of the series will find some nostalgic elements, like barrels containing liquid that buffs your attributes, riddle chests and the like.The story is solid but unfortunately also pretty generic. (I won't spoil it here though, so that you can still experience the fun yourself)The map is unfortunately -again- rather generic. Where M&M 1-5 featured treetop houses, cities in the sky and even space-ships, all you got in M&M10 is pretty standard villages. Not even your run-off-the-mill castle. A little more fantasy wouldn't have hurt the game here.The size of the map is not large but ""medium"". So where the description says ""3 towns, 1 city, 20 dungeons"" it literally means just that. Except that they don't mention that some of the ""dungeons"" literally have just 1 room.Graphics quality is ... not good. The game looks like it was more or less pieced together by using whatever texture or model was laying around at that time. Thus some objects are very nice and detailed, but the majority unfortunately looks blurry and washed out even on ""ultra"" settings.The sound quality is acceptable. However the soundtrack is quite generic and not very memorable.In total the game is fun with enough solid gameplay to keep you occupied for like a week.2. The downsidesThe game was produced on a tight budget by Limbic Entertainment. A small studio that has no experience whatsoever with AAA-class games. They clearly state on their website that their field of expertise are ""social and flash games"". The name as their greatest success so far: ""Mein Ponyhof 2"", a horse-barn simulation for little girls.They also stated in their blog that M&M10 was a ""test"" for Ubisoft to see wether or not people would still spend money on the series.I'm actually very sorry to say that but all of the above and especially the tight budget actually shines through. And unfortunately not just in the fact that all horses in the game have beautiful textures.Also it has to be mentioned that the game requires a UPlay account and installation of the UPlay client on top of Steam. If having to create yet another account with yet another company just to play the game is a big ""no-no"" to you: I recommend you stay away.3. Not included in the game:Despite what the store page tells you this game does NOT include a free modding editor.The ""modding kit"" is/was actually just a resource pack for a long gone version of Unity Pro, that is no longer sold, and had an original price tag of 1500 USD when the game came out.4. For ""digital deluxe"" purchaseThis version contains an additional dungeon and a mini-campaign. The dungeon is just standard.The reactions on the DLC have been mixed. Most people rate it ""solid"" at best. I would suggest you expect to get some ""solid"" extra hours of ""acceptable"" gameplay that may be quite enjoyable but will be nothing to tell you grandchildren about.Note however, that the DLC has been reported to break the option to run the UPlay client in offline mode, so that you need to be always online in order to play it. If you can't be ""always on"" for whatever reason, I recommend to stay away from the ""digital deluxe"" version.The ""digital soundtrack"" is 30 minutes of unmodified in-game music encoded as 128KBit joint-stereo MP3. Despite what the store-page tells you, you are NOT getting the ""official soundtrack on audio CD"".The files don't show up in your Steam library. You find them in your installation folder. The music quality is okay, but nothing really memorable.Note that there is another dungeon and some minor extras as well, that can be unlocked by earning virtual currency through getting achievements. However, I experienced that the achievements don't unlock properly and thus I have been unable to access any of that.4. Limitations- The 32-Bit version of the game is limited to medium texture quality and voice-over is deactivated.			"

												Since I did not touch the game until its full release, this review is based entirely on my first-hand experience with the game, written by someone who is unaware of what may or may not have been changed, addressed or promised during the early access.GAME CHOICES & MECHANICS:- The game offers four traditional fantasy races to choose from when making characters; humans, dwarves, elves and orcs, each race offering three specific starting classes to choose from, as well as a varying setup of skills.- The skills are fairly familiar to M&M players, with a few new additions in X, like for example Primordial Magic, Arcane Discipline, and Warfare. Some notable skills have disappeared as well; as there is no Alchemy, Identify Item, Learning, Merchant or Repair Item skill, as well as a few other examples.- Gameplay-wise it has some important changes from previous M&Ms. You follow a tile-style map when moving around! For those familiar with pen and paper Role Playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons, think of it as the 5x5 hex-grid system (which the M&M X map looks like).- Combat is more strictly turn-based. This means a monster will have to wait for its turn before attacking you (or you it), as each of your characters in turn takes their actions. Explained more thoroughly in my personal opinion.- The Night/Day cycle is much quicker, especially outside of towns.- Levelling up skills and attributes and what improvements it will grant you is 'tooltiped' by mouse-over, and the different character panels are somewhat easier to use.MY PERSONAL OPINIONThe game looks good. It has that M&M feeling to it, in a modern sense where lighting effects and shades are more modern than in older versions, yet it's not meant to look ""outright realistic"", and both NPCs and world objects look the way they 'always have' in the series.The new and more strict turn-based system of combat also has its advances, in that you can take your time to plan your next and most optimal move with each character. It also means you can plan ahead of the monster's next attack, and since you can rearrange the order of your character's easily, you can put your heavy cannons to go first, after which, depending on whether they dealt enough damage or finished something off, your supporters can cast the appropriate buffs before the next turn begins. Then again, nothing prevented you from pausing the game to think ahead in previous versions, just saying.. Yes, the stricter turn-based system can sometimes slow the gameplay down. You can still hold down a button to have all your characters repeatedly fire their arrows at whatever you're fighting, but you cannot move while doing so. Even if you didn't have to move, if three of your characters are just firing arrows away with their mana emptied, but the fourth being the one doing something different, you will have to stop and click a different number (taskbar being the traditional 1-9) for that particular character.Personally, I like the old style where you manually set a spell and a non-spell attack and just blasted away, even if that is a less cost-efficient approach. Back then everything happened simultaneously as well, both your attacks and the monsters', each with their own cooldowns. I have yet to notice my characters using anything powerful enough to make them ""lose their next turn due to recharging"", or anything similar.Because of the tile-style movement, you are less likely of getting lost, you wont get stuck in the environment, and it's easier to figure out where to go in some cases. It does limit your movement somewhat, though, and calling this ""an exciting open world"" is a stretch. Yes, you can SEE the world, but the tiles will tell you where you can and cannot go. In other words, forget scaling up those hills in an angle to skip some travelling, or nudging your way down a tall mountain to get to the bottom quicker. No tile = not an option! (I wonder if a Fly spell exists in this game)The plus side of the tile system is that travelling between key points takes (much) less time than before, and it certainly is a game focused around combat and action, rather than sightseeing and flower-picking (..fond memories of my alchemist scaling the M&M7 mountains to pick those rare flowers for potions.. anyway.)  When in combat, the tile-system to me is less enjoyable than the good old free movement. You are LOCKED in combat. I.e. if you want to move somewhere, you have to wait for your turn. You can move one tile, then whatever you are fighting will either attack, or move after you, and then you can move again. This means no party kiting and killing that tough giant with their crude bows.CONCLUSIONOverall the game to me falls into the pitfall of so many other games these days. It's a good and tried-and-true model that instead of being kept that way is slimmed down to make for faster, easier (to me in most cases less enjoyable) gameplay. Instead of feeling like a mighty hero who comes up with clever schemes to defeat your mighty adversaries, I feel like I'm being stripped of some of my powers and choices by the game simply telling me ""sorry, we can not let you do that"".  No crafting potions? No repairing my own items? Finding your way because of the tile-system is nice at times, but it also strips me of going exactly where I want to go. Yes, you can most times choose option a, b or c to do first, but even if you choose c, you usually have to come back and do a and b in any order after before moving on to d. 	For example, in M&M 7 you could pretty much walk to the tougher zones in the game as soon as you got off the starting island, and although you pretty much couldn't kill anything there (crude bows kiting comes to mind along with a heartful chuckle, though), you could still try to roam around for chests, pick those before mentioned flowers, followed by running for your life to leave the place as you just noticed one of the giants had gotten on your trail.I want to like M&M X more than I do (that said I do enjoy it, albeit mostly for nostalgic reasons). On the plus-side the nostalgia from playing an M&M game made me want to revisit M&M 7 again, a game which I can also play while I'm offline, or while the rest of the world is offline too, for that matter. As long as my computer has power at least.If you're a hardcore M&M fan, I would still recommend picking it up for the nostalgia. It's not a ""bad game"", despite giving it some harsh critique, it's just a well-made game that doesn't appeal to me in the old-fashioned M&M way, with a few too many things changed or altered (the combat + tile-style being my main drawbacks here. Adding that I am well-aware this was never meant to be a ""typical M&M clone""!) The fact M&M is one of my all-time favourite series also means I set the bar quite high, if it sounds like most of the review is negatively charged.So..  Would I recommend this game? The short answer is, it depends who is asking. To a seasoned M&M player; yes, but to someone not familiar with the M&M series; probably not, as the gameplay is rather outdated.If you know very little about the M&M series, but like old-style type of games, I'd recommend passing on this one, and instead picking up Might&Magic VII: For Blood and Honor from GOG (for only 6$!), and, baring in mind old graphics are what they are, you will have a more fleshed out game with a lot more depth to it than this one.However, if you're only in it for the turn-based combat that M&M X focuses on, pass - there are better and more modern turn-based games out there today. :)..Then again, it could be I'm just a masochistic hero who enjoys the pain and suffering of spending twice as much time on travelling from point a to point b, only to realise I went into the wrong cave and suddenly faced monsters ten times my level...- Xeni			"

												If you are into games in the vein of old school, turn-based RPG, Might and Magic X - Legacy may be a game for you.   It is fairly lengthy, taking me around 60 hours to complete the game almost entirely, and you are sure to get your money worth unless you try to blitz through the main storyline as quickly as possible.  Be warned that the game is entirely based on the combat, so if you are not in love with it I there is a good chance you won't have the patience to finish it.  would generally recommend this game, provided you are willing to overlook some fairly rough edges.Pros: - Combat is fun (most of the time) - Good value for your money - Large world to explore, lots of loot to collectCons:- If the combat isn't your thing, there isn't much else to the game to enjoy- The main story is nonsensical and not very interesting- Performance issues when moving into new areas- Combat balance issues (too easy at times, getting one-shotted at other times)			"

												Got several hours into the game - was actually enjoying it - and then it asked me to redeem a code to keep playing. Ok. So I went to the STEAM KEY and got the key code. I relaunched the game and then it updated Uplay and told me I have to do a 2 step verfication process to prove I own my own damn game that I bought through STEAM. It told me I had to download an app on my mobile phone and do some kind of two step verification process using my phone. Well - since I don't currently have a cell phone to do this -  my game is unplayable. Thanks Ubisoft. I will NEVER - EVER buy another Ubisoft product. Draconian DRM and asinine verification codes are not the way to treat your paying customers. Go to hell Ubisoft. I uninstalled the game immediately thereafter and DO NOT RECOMMEND IT.			"

												What a let down this game was.  Buggy as all hell.  I love all the M&M games in the past, but Ubi massacred this franchise with this one.  I get so far into Act 1 and I can not travel any further forward.  The option to get to the next area is greyed out.  The only fix listed online is to either start over or change something in the config file.  By changing the config, it will break end game.  And now Ubi has pulled all patching and support for this game.  Save your money and look for adventure somewhere else!			"

												First off, i would like to start this review by stating that I am a huge fan of the Might and Magic series, although i was introduced to them a bit late, I received a copy of Might & Magic VII: For Blood and Honor as a gift in the late 90's, and from then on, I was hooked. After a long PC gaming hiatus, I heard that Might & Magic X was out, so I had to give it a try.Sure, it was a bit different than i was expecting, taking a trip back to the classics with the tile based movement system, but this didn't bother me. What bothered me the most about this game, was the unforgiving difficulty. I personally didn't have too much trouble, considering i was able to finish it, but after every boss and every extremely close call i had, I couldn't help but think ""Man... If I had picked a different team, or misdistributed some of my stats/skills, I would never be able to get this far..."" and I'm not saying that because I was having so much trouble, I was saying that because enemies don't respawn. That's right, if you are stuck and feel there is absolutely no way to advance from where you are at in the game, that might be true, because you are unable to grind out levels due to the limited amount of experience available in the game. Although, experience becomes quite abundant towards the very end (act III and beyond). I just feel that the game could have been tweaked slightly to increase the appeal to those other than the most hardcore might & magic fans. Also, I have heard of quite a few bugs that other players have encountered in the game, and although i personally didn't encounter any of these bugs, I wanted to mention them because some can be game-breaking.So here are a few of what i feel are Pros and Cons of the game:Pros:+Sound Effects (Recycled from previous M&M games, gave me a nostalgic feeling :3)+World Map (For a modern, tile based rpg with an open world, i appreciated the layout)Cons:-Unforgiving Difficulty (Only for hardcore gamers, not for casual players)-Poorly Optimized (I have a decent PC, but this game was giving me framerate issues, even on lower settings)-Game Breaking Bugs (You can google them to find out more)-No Enemy Respawn (Cannot grind experience if you feel you're having trouble)-Loading (felt it was a tad too long a tad too often, plus, i liked the art, but just that 1 photo as the only loading screen?)-Audio Glitches (Too often there would be glitches with the audio, like a wolf howling repeatedly, or stuck in the battle theme while outside of battle)-No Arcomage (I love arcomage ;w;)Although I was able to play through the entire game, at a certain point it felt like a chore and a testament to my will to see if i could. I definitely won't be playing through this game again, I would rather play Might & Magic 6, 7, or 8 again instead if i need a Might & Magic fix.Final Verdict: 5/10 (Trust me when i say i really wanted to like this game, because i really did, but i can't justify giving it a score higher than a 5)			"

												I'm assuming most of the reviews here are from early access, here's one from someone who did not play early access and has also not played any previous games in the series.This game is very good.  It's expansive, challenging but not unfair, and there's a good amount of character and party customization.  It's the most RPG-y RPG I've played in a long time.  You'll travel the open world, come across riddles, puzzles, enemies and dungeons - some of which will be too high level for you.   There is no level scaling and the world is crafted in a way that you're going to want to backtrack often to try and kill that boss you found who one shot you 10 hours earlier.  And that's awesome.  You're going to be battling your way through dungeons, barely surviving by the skin of your teeth and have to make runs back to town (actual runs, no instant click travel here) to restock on supplies so that you can continue.  And that's awesome.It's not going to be for everyone but this is a really solid, lengthy and replayable RPG with lots of substance that's built on its RPG systems and its gameplay rather than a story or dialogue choices or any of the usual modern stuff.  The only con is performance.  Performance is poor in some places, and loading times especially are poor.  This is exacerbated by the fact that the game freezes in the background, meaning you have to sit through the 30 second-1 minute load screens.  This can get very annoying because you will often be making trips back and forth to town and there's a loading screen each time.  The game also doesn't exactly look amazing and the dialogue and story are generic and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  But from what I understand this is a game made by a small team mostly as a proof of concept to get this series back up and running, and it did what it set out to achieve and then some.

												If what you crave is oldschool grid-based 3D movement combined with turn-based combat, don't look any further - it won't get any better than this. But if you do not like these two basic features of the game (or even just one of them), you really should keep away. You've been warned.    ""Legacy"" harkens back to the Might & Magic games of old - and with this I don't mean Might & Magic 6/7, but rather M&M 3 ""Isles of Terra"" and M&M 4/5 ""World of Xeen"". You can still buy those from GoG, but the once stunning VGA graphics are real hard to endure nowadays, so it's a blessing that Might & Magic X exists. While the graphics here aren't exactly top notch, they are still very beautiful and atmospheric. (Almost) everything else is like it was in those old games: A deep turnbased combat system at its core, a big upper world to roam freely with your party of four (plus two hirelings), towns, dungeons, inns, merchants, quests, riddles - the whole shebang. In this, ""Legacy"" has much much more to offer than, say, ""Legends of Grimrock II"".  Given all the above, there are only two real downsides to the game: The first is that it is unfortunately technically unoptimized. This becomes noticeable to the user in the wide upper world, where there's sometimes hitching while you move your party a tile - even with the most advanced GPUs in town. This is strange as the game really shouldn't be very demanding at all (the only reason that could explain this is that the engine seems to rely more on your CPU power than on your GPU). This does detract from the oldschool RPG fun only slightly, however. Well, and the second downside is of course Uplay. I once swore I would never buy another Ubisoft game from steam again until they got rid of this utterly useless and annoying additional DRM-scheme, but when I broke my vow and reinstalled it  (just for this game), I noticed that it at least became much more unobtrusive compared to how I rember it from a few years ago (when I played ""Farcry 3"" for a while). Also retrieval of the long forgotten password for my account was no problem.If I had to give ""Might & Magic X - Legacy""  a score, it would be 8/10 for fans of grid-based RPGs with turn-based combat. I would have given 9/10 if the game were optimized. The last missing point is because I really miss some features from the old games, namely: sorcerer guilds and banks that give interest on deposited money. Also, while the story always played second fiddle in M&M games and the narrative we are presented here is ok, I liked some of the storylines of earlier installments better. A nice touch, though, is that (if you are perceptive) the great ""sci-fi setting"" twist of ""Might & Magic 3, Isles of Terra"" is at least alluded to in ""Legacy"" too.			"

YouTube™ Video: Steam Review E24 Might and Magic X: Legacy 

			Views: 1,033		

			The latest entry in the Might and Magic series, is it any good? Not really. Might and Magic X: Legacy: There's something to be said for a game to exist solely based on its legacy (pun intended).		

Might and Magic X: Legacy: There's something to be said for a game to exist solely based on its legacy (pun intended). Unfortunately, Might and Magic X does not feel like a good entry in the series nor a good role-playing game. Personally I’ve never played a might and magic game (I am a huge fan of the Heroes of Might and Magic series however) so I'm coming into the series as a relatively new player. I have played one other game similar to Might and Magic X; Grimrock, which I loved and play completely through. I bought this game with similar expectations and was sorely disappointed. First I was expecting clever puzzles and riddles, there are none to be found in this game. Puzzles are mostly switch puzzles and riddles don't require any sort of abstract thinking, or really much brain power at all to figure it out. Okay, lame puzzles, is combat any good? Nope, in Grimrock you had four characters, two in front for tanking and two in the back as range or support, in this game they stand side by side, allowing your squishy magic characters to be hit alongside your heavy characters, it makes switching character places pointless and overall it’s annoying. Range characters are also pointless, most of the games engagements take place within melee range and range characters will get a penalty when in melee range and their shots hit random enemies so if there is more than one better hope the shot hits the enemy you want; they don't have strong enough magic or melee combat skill to be worth devoting a character to range, just use melee and caster characters. All classes can use a ranged weapon in any case, a much more preferable option to having a useless character. Combat itself lack strategy and excitement, it’s much quicker to just mash the attack button through fodder enemies; bosses are the only enemies requiring more strategy, but it’s not much more and overall combat is a bore and a chore, sadly the game relies on it heavily. Side rant, the final boss fight is bogus. Visuals and audio are both pretty good, the game takes you to a great variety of locations and there is plenty of color in this game, it’s pretty. Music is standard fantasy fair, but it’s well done. Voice work is...ok, not sure why elves and dwarfs sound similar, I shake my head and chuckle anytime I hear my Scottish elf girl speak, it doesn't really fit in with the setting. So the other bits aren't too great, how about the story? Well...that also is a letdown, actually the opening cinematic to the game spoils everything, the who, what, where and why. I can't compare it to other Might and Magic games, but as far as storytelling goes it’s pretty weak and not engaging at all and it’s extremely linear. The game offers you a very lengthy experience, so that’s something. Honestly, I was really excited for Might and Magic X and wanted to love it after playing the disappointment that was Heroes of Might and Magic 6. It sapped my strength and will to go on by how boring it was. There's a lot of content for the asking price, maybe if you get nostalgic for these games it will win you over, but for $24.99 USD I'd recommend something else, like Grimrock. TL/DR; Might and Magic X: Legacy is a long but, boring role-playing experience. None of its qualities are strong enough to make the long trek worthwhile. I’d recommend using the $24.99USD on something else or buy Grimrock. Also Ubisoft making me use U-play ticks me off.-Thumbs down from RoyialVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork "

												Might & Magic X returns to the good old days of Might & Magic series (think World of Xeen) while retaining a relatively modern touch to it (think M&M6+). Possibly for the first time ever in the series even the inventory is (mostly) likeable! Power-up barrels scattered around the world, statues that buff the party, puzzles that have you scratching your head, quest lines without big yellow markers telling you where to go, and last but not least, completely unfair fights if you stick your nose where it doesn't belong. Welcome to the Might & Magic! I've missed being in the M&M world!First and foremost, don't be put off by the rather mediocre ratings -- if you are a fan of the series since the early days, you will love this one too. For the most part I can't but praise the game, but I do have a handful of complaints: * some of the (teleporter) puzzles are a pain (too much of trial & error);* armor wear (i.e. items breaking) is completely useless and should either be redesigned or removed completely; * the Falcon and the Unicorn DLC could use some tuning (it's incredibly challenging/frustrating for melee-oriented parties for example). Some people have been concerned with the PC requirements. I ran the game on highest settings (i7-3770K + Ati Radeon 290) and 90% of the time it runs completely fine. The other 10% of the time there are significant slowdowns, spikes, possibly related to traveling to another section or perhaps from daylight to nighttime switching. Be what it may, the engine could use a little polish in that respect. Also, loading times when entering dungeons or cities are fairly long, up to the point where I would rather run around the city on map than enter to travel through it.So much for complaints, because in nearly every other aspect Might & Magic X is a very fun and engaging game. I clocked 50 hours on my playthrough, and for the first time in years I was disappointed a game ended so ""soon"". More of this, please!On a scale from 1-10, I will happily award M&M X a solid 9/10. For all oldschool M&M (and Dungeon Master / Eye of the Beholder) fans.			"

												In all honesty, I wasn't too keen on M&M X at first due to the square tile movement system. Bought it, left for about 8 months, then recently fired it up again. Glad I did too! Upon taking the time to enjoy it as opposed to rushing straight into it, I found it far more enjoyable and immersive. I took the time to understand the story and patiently walk my way through.Big fan of the M&M series, with my favorite being M&M VII: Blood and Honor. Thoroughly enjoyed this addition to the M&M universe. I also noticed they've incorporated lore and creatures from the more recent M&M titles, which I found quite awesome as it kind of gels the M&M universe lore together.My main highlight of this, as with all M&M titles, was mostly the aspect of adventure, discovery and character progression. Your team of four adventurers are thrown into a region packed with monsters to slay and treasure waiting to be found in every crevice. Has two difficulties to play through; medium and hard. For those looking for a decent adventure and don't mind 'classic style' game mechanics, this is for you. If playing through first time, my advice is to choose a Druid, Freemage Bladedancer and Paladin.			"

												 This was a very pleasant surprise. Who knew that in 2014 there was going to be a release of an old-school RPG blobber. It’s a great homage to the series, even going as far as to recycle many sounds from the VI-VIII trilogy. Even so it was mostly good, I was a bit burned out by the end, but that’s because I’m not really into long, 50 hour, epics nowadays. On the other hand the game had a combat dynamic that was more similar to Wizardry than Might & Magic, since the challenge was into each fight instead of the attrition of many weaker fights. In the end I hope this one sold enough to justify another game in this great series.			"

												I'm a huge fan of the Might and Magic franchise, Heroes included, and that's the only reason I played through this. Unless you are REALLY desperate for your M&M fix, I can't suggest this as a viable purchase. For the same money, you can get much better titles, new and old.As for the actual problems with the game:-Graphics are laughable. Expect low res environs throughout the game-Optimization is bad. I can run Skyrim on ultimate with no issues on my rig, but the turn based M&M is apparently too much, as even on middle of the road settings, there is going to be heavy lag in certain areas with dense foliage. According to the forums, this is a fairly common problem.-No customization. There are 4 races with 4 hero type each (caster, ranger, tank, melee) and once you pick one of those, you get to decide on male or female. Oh, and also a name. Joy... There's no way to change the appearance of your characters and you never even get to see a model of them beyond a picture during character creation.-Poor class balance. Rangers used to be completely useless, but after the patch they were upgraded all the way to just ""meh"". The game LOVES to spring ambushes on you (about 30% of the fights, along with most bosses), by dumping a ton of enemies at melee range, making bows and crossbows useless for the fight (once you engage in melee, you can't retreat till you kill everything in melee range). There goes a quarter of the hero pool. Tanks are also useless, since almost all bosses (and all undead, which are VERY frequent) are immune to taunt - your primary tanking mechanic. This means that 50% of the classes in the game have no purpose, except for flavor, at the cost of your party's strenght. That's just bad design.-Turn based gameplay on a 2-dimensional plane. You can call this a throwback to the old M&M series, but it just doesn't work. Even the worst of Might and Magic games had a smoother transition between turns, than Legacy. The last ones even managed to mix real-time movement with turn-based combat. Also, turn based movement is not fun when on long treks between towns and quest points. This game has a lot of that, if you're looking for all the hidden little nooks and crannies.-No voice work for quests. While it's not a necessity for every game, it would have been nice if M&M X managed to show off with something, at least. -Lackluster story. Everything in M&M X screams ""minimal effort"" and the story is no different. It's painfully generic and set in a very boring world where every character is just a cookie cutter fantasy stereotype. There's just nothing new, even in the story: elves are elves, dwarves are dwarves and orcs wear fezzes (god damn it, Ubisoft...) You can't even augment your party with new and interesting companions. Once you get out of the hero creation screen, that's it - it's set in stone. You DO have the option of getting two followers, but with no voice work and characterization, all they offer is a boost to one (mostly unimportant) aspect of gameplay. Relative to what else is out on the market, even at this price, Might and Magic X - Legacy is just a bad game. It has nothing to offer, save for the faint nostalgia of the franchise.			"

												Might and Magic is a cult Dungeon Crawler series, which got its up and down. The down mostly came after the 7th episode (which was already seriously less good than the 6th).Unlike Dungeon Master (DM) and Legend of Grimrock (LoG), it’s not real-time but turn based. The good point is that it lets you play at your own pace. The down point is that it creates less tension than real time fight and it feels less dynamic. Both can also be seen as advantageous when you just want to relax (although even in turn based game you still can feel pressurized from time to time ! ;-) ).But there’s also another major difference : M&MX, just like its ancestors, doesn’t feature an unique deep dungeon ; instead, it offers you an open world with numerous small dungeons and a few medium ones.From these 2 characteristics, it means there’s no dungeon offering any memorable nor challenging exploration. Once in a dungeon, you’ll never feel lost, and except for a very few exceptions, you won’t even feel confused about what to do or where to go, especially as there’s no puzzle (with a couple of exceptions) and the secrets appear depending of your party abilities and not of your own observation skills. And all that without taking account of the automap.On another hand, exploring the outside world is more engaging. And the where-to-go challenge comes up when you have to decide what is the next dungeon you want to go. As there’s no level indicator, it means you can end up in a too hard dungeon. This raises another issue:  you can’t play without quick save & load, as it’s impossible to escape a started combat, which is for me a mood killer.But it’s not that bad, because of another bad point : the game is quickly too easy, which means you’ll rarely have to worry about getting in a too hard fight (if you play in the normal difficulty).This brings us to the combat system. So it’s turn based. You need 1 or 1 and half healers (because often 1 healer can be paralyzed/asleep/stoned/etc…), and although there’s tank build, there’s no tanking in the way of World of Warcraft (and Dungeon Guardians ;-) ) : there’s no aggro building. You still have a few “attack me during this turn” spells, but most bosses are immune to them, so actually the tank doesn’t need to have much more HP and armor than other party members.The combats themselves, once you have digested & understood the numerous abilities, are actually simple, easy and mostly straightforward. No, in M&MX, the difficulty comes from the resource management. This means that the difficulty comes from the choice of using or not HP & Mana potions during the fights. Almost no fight can be fatal as long as you have enough potions to go through it. This is even more true as it’s a turn based game, so you have all the time in the world to analyse the current situation and choose the most pertinent ability correctly. So to sail through the game, you just have to understand how much potions you can use in each fight. The number of potions is limited ; you can buy some from shops, but it seems they don’t reappear afterward. But you can also buy limitless rations, that allows you to sleep after the fights to recover all your HP & Mana.As 1st, you’re short on gold, but after a while, you’ll get a ton of it. So the difficulty comes from resource management, but you get more or less limitless of them after a while ? So yup, there’s not much difficulty anymore after 25% of the game done.There’s an hard mode, but this one is just too hard to newcomers ; you’re expected to already know the game to pick it (although you aren’t told so in the selection screen), but once you know the game, it is also too easy as you just know how much potions & rations you need to go through the dungeons & world. Plus, still, after a while you just get a ton of money again.The combats aren’t really boring nor too repetitive, though. There are enough abilities, effect variations, kind of mobs, and special events to keep things interesting. It’s just that without time pressure, there’s not much doubt about what to do, nor doing it quickly enough.So that’s a bit a pity as the game itself is pretty nice. Discovering & exploring the world and its dungeons is captivating. The character leveling is nicely done (but not great). There’s a ton to do and see, even though the story holds very little interest, which is a bit annoying in a game with such a big world : it builds very little implication in the player, roaming all around, jumping from dungeon to dungeon without caring much about the goals. Ending is nice enough though, as the background of the story is well exploited.There also are a bunch of riddles in the world, and a few dungeons made of only 1 puzzle to solve and nothing else, plus 1 dungeon made of several puzzles but without any mobs nor real exploration. Puzzles were mostly annoying for me, and I guess riddles are decent if you’re into that kind of thing.Visually, it’s shockingly ugly at 1st ; the 1st city is painfully horrible and technically it feels like we’re back in the early 2000’s. Following cities aren’t much better, but the world and the dungeons are usually well done with a good artistic direction.So in short it gives :Interesting combat system plagued by its easiness after a while, simplistic dungeon exploration partly compensated by open world exploration, average puzzles, unequal visuals & atmosphere.So all in all, this is a game that is bigger than the sums of its parts and offers a nice adventure, despite all its shortcomings.

												Great game that's been hours of fun for me. I bought and played the game post patch 1, and can honestly say that I've not experienced a single bug, glitch or crash during the entire experience which, after reading some earlier reviews, I half expected I might have! I'd get my one criticism out of the way now though... I played on a fairly powerful gaming laptop and can run most games on high settings with ease. This game is very pretty (some of the screenshots don't do it full justice) but nevertheless, some of the low framerates I get in the outside areas, especially the forests, can be puzzling and I can only imagine could be fixed with better programming, although I'm no expert on that matter :) Aside from this the game is just as I wanted it to be and was a great 'blast from the past' experience in a new suit. Too many modern games hold your hand and take the excitement of exploration away from you, because you know you're never in any real danger. In Might and Magic X it's nothing like that... take a wrong turn and you may get rinsed into oblivion by some elite water elementals you had no right to be near... but that's all part of the games charm. Some people won't get it, and you may hate that sudden, seeimingly unavoidable deaths can occur from nowhere, or you may not enjoy an epic 20 minute struggle to overcome 3 goblins and a big dog that leaves you mentally exhausted (and your characters bereft of potions)... but if you're one of the people who does get it, then get this game... it's ace :)			"

												Fantastic.  If you're at ALL a fan of early coputer grid based RPG's (Wizardry, The Bard's Tale, Might and Magic) this game is for you.  It's party based, with mutli classes, and spell/skill based level progression.  Group battles with turn based, class type attacks?  Check.Dungeons with traps, chests and bosses? Check.Cities with quests, vendors and stories? Check.Varied monsters with resists-based attacks, ranged tactical warfare, spells and violent melee?  Check.Familiar, fun class type characters with (at times) witty chat?  Check.I could go on and on, but why?  Honestly, I waited a long time on buying this, due to bad reviews on here.  This game is fantastic (so far) and I highly. VERY highly recommend it for fans of Apple ii, Commodore and the like RPG's.  I haven't gotten to any bugs like so many say exist, but if I DO hit one, I'll edit this review. For now - BRAVO, coders.  Good, good fun.			"

												Here is a quick review for you from a M&M veteran.Pros:-Nice story.-Nice graphics although not too good but who gives a toss about graphics anyways.-Feels like Might and Magic.-Is indeed fun.-Has a nice hotkey bar that you can place your spells on so you don't need to open your spellbook 24/7. Makes things easier in my opinion.-They finally upped the magic damage so you can sometimes 1 shot entire crowds when you crit with your spells.-Decent sound effects.-The undead look super cool.-All wizard party is a wonder to behold. With crits added, your magic attacks can do a lot of damage and the game becomes even more enjoyable and easier. It is so good that I ACCIDENTALLY KILLED EREBOS INSTEAD OF USING THE SHARDS TO SUMMON THE LIGHT FROM THE VESSEL. ♥♥♥♥ER JUST DIED BECAUSE MY CHAIN LIGHTNING HIT FOR 2 K DAMAGE AND CREDITS JUST STARTED ROLLING.- Nice dungeon design. Although since it's tile based, it's mostly visuals, not too much variety, very few secrets, traps etc. compared to the other games. It could have been a gray labyrinth and from ""gameplay"" point of view, the dungeons would have basically been the same. But still they mostly look nice in my opinion.- I like Ashan better than Enroth. Has a more interesting lore in my opinion.- Crag Hack is back my dudes.Cons. Oh boy.- Not even half of the content of mm6 mm7 or mm8. Probably inferior even to mm9. This bothered me the most. You cannot even do the promotion quests of other classes for example. Oh and there is only one promotion for each class instead of the usual two.- 4 races. 3 classes for each and class design isnt very intricate.- Obligatory tile based movement and buffs. Didnt bother me that much but still, only turn based is a bit off putting.- TONS of sound effects and textures (mostly monsters) are recycled from Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, Heroes of Might and Magic 5 and some others.- Basically one map. Really. One. Map.- Since it is so small no flying whatsoever. Very limited freedom.- WHEN YOU ARE OUT OF A BLOODY CITY, IN OPEN FIELDS, THE CITIES ARE BASICALLY AT YOUR HEIGHT. IMAGINE THJORGARD, NOW MINIMIZE IT TO YOUR HEIGHT. YES. THAT IS IT.- Unless you have like at least 2 casters, the DLC is impossible to do.- Level cap is 40. Yes. The content is that limited.- Obligatory Uplay login. Did not bother me but might be a bit off putting for other players.- Nearly all status effects last forever. I am not even gonna elaborate like this happens when you get that and such because nearly all of them are broken. Even ♥♥♥♥ing sleep doesn't get dispelled when you get damaged if I am not mistaken. You need to have casters or an endless supply of scrolls to negate status effects (which trigger roughly half of the time when creatures attack) or you literally cannot progress.- Feeblemind --> Death.Overall this isn't as good as mm6, mm7, mm8 or even mm9. But it is nonetheless enjoyable in my opinion. Perhaps a lot more enjoyable than the other games if you go full mage. Seriously, try it. You won't be disappointed. If you like Might and Magic get this. Just don't have super high expectations and you will enjoy it.			"

												At first I enjoyed the game, holding my nose at the silly dual drm situation. It is mostly a fun game. It's far better then Might and magic 9, and feels more like the older games. Might and Magic Legacy contains considerable array of fun game play. I enjoy its quests, puzzles, artwork and music. the class structure and progression is pleasing as is most of the game play. Over time, the game clearly has great re-playability and solid involvement from the community at large. However its likely too unfinished, too unforgiving  and too poorly balanced to recommend to most folks. Prior to the end game (and often during the end game) I had to use cheat tools to transport my characters out of various places to sell goods, level up, stock up on porions and goods, etc breaking up the game play. This is really strange since in the prior games, you could just back track or teleport out when you needed to exit a dungeon.  Had there not been cheat tools I would have found the game unplayable.I found I had to extensively use community generated hint guides since many  of the game goals are so arbitrary and poorly expressed I got lost easily. This is at odds with the other Might and Magic games and many modern games where I usually do not need to cheat and rarely need hints. Generally the only need I had of community tools in prior versions were for better maps, locations for alchemy ingredients  and trainer locations.However as the end game approached the game has grown more and more tedious. The developer chose to lock you in a dungeon without escape on several occasions the worst of which is the end game. if you don’t plan especially well the game will grow tired and tedious or simply unplayably  difficult. Add to that that some quests can not be completed until you finish the game, and the general uneven game play, I simply cant suggest you buy the game in 2014 until the price comes down. I bought the game at 25% off and feel a bit cheated.If you like the turn based style, consider the game only if its on sale (or has come down in price) and after you have exhausted other games in the series and general genre. As time marches on, the community will generate patch fixes , the developers may rebalanced the end game, and mods and such that will greatly improve the game , as it did for mm6-8. However as  the game exists now in mid-2014, it feels poorly balanced, arbitrary and a bit tedious now. Its not a bad game but its hardly excellent either. Its just not worth the high price the developer is asking.All that said you will enjoy the game if you like the genre and buy it on sale. You’ll also enjoy the game if you buy it now and wait 6 months or a year for P.s. the time in game is wildly inaccurate as the game is stable enough to alt-tab away from it and do other things. So my time in game shows the game is quite stable if you have enough memory.			"

												Not as good as World of Xeen but a damn fine blobber. The world also isn't as open as I'd like but it's interconnected which makes it more tolerable. Really hope Limbic gets to make another M&M RPG in this style.Protip for planning out your party, build around skills you can grandmaster, and give everyone a single point in a ranged weapon. Grandmastered skills become pretty important later on, and everyone having a point in a ranged weapon lets you take potshots at enemies at range.			"

												I played this game for 75 hours and enjoyed every minute of it. I would have preferred something more like M&M 6, my favorite of the series, but there's a lot to like about this one. The only real negatives I have with it are terrible framerates whenever I'm out exploring the wilderness (water seems to be bring my Geforce GTX 600 to its knees!) and long loading times. Otherwise, I'm really pleased with this game and really hope they'll make another one.			"

												Bought early access, and on the early access forums on ubisoft might and magic X are full of great development suggestions by enthusiastic people to help the game the best as it can be. Unfortunatley the development team recently posted saying that in a nutshell they have nearly finished the game and none of the our suggestion to make this game better are going to be implemented!Yes the screenshots looks good and if your like me you have been waiting for this type of game for an age and a half I would suggest holding fire on it and read the negative reviews that are going to be plasted everywhere in gaming sites upon release because unfortunatley a rush job on a game is still a rush jon no matter how pretty it looks.There is a whole list of basic improvements that the community have been screaming out for things like.Improved monster movement: (some monsters take ages to take their turn and get nto combat range)Useless spells: Even one of the Devs in hes post said that some spell may feel useless...err becasue they are!Ranger class useless: No use of bows in melee range (until late in the game) make the ranger one of the favourite useless classes.Speed of movement: Comminity have been asking for a speed buff to movent for a long time.No paper dolls: When viewing you charcter in the character sheet screenDifficulty issues where a higher difficulty doesn't improve enemy A.I or combat tatics just adds more Health and attack points to the mobs, the community wanted smarted tatics and improved abilities for enemys on higher difficulties.I could go on but really havent got the energy to list all the great suggestions by the community that are basically getting ingnored.Could have been awsome if only they would have taken more time on it.

Posted: February 2, 2014
												First off, a rant from a seasoned Might & Magic player.Might & Magic - Massive Frustration would be a better title for this game. The amount of saves and reloads you will need to do to progress by an inch is absolutely insane. I am playing at Adventurer difficulty which in classic M&M is supposed to be ""Normal""... well I have played every single MM from 1 to 9 and I have _NEVER_ had to die and wipe and reload SO many times like in this one. Spellcasters are so useless they become a liability, since for some reason every single mob in the game will always and systematically target them first (oh, your ""tank"" class got the Challenge skill to distract mobs? Well sucks to be you, because a lot of mobs are either immune to it, or the skill gets resisted or misses).Okay, enough complaining for now.So. I'm looking at this game in the eyes of someone who loved MM3-4-5 (I am actually quite amused by all the people that complain about the tile movement, it's what was games were all about :)), so I was expecting a game somewhat ""in tribute"" to that.First off, graphics. It's a modern ""tile movement"" title, actually they quite cleverly built a world that looks smooth but where movement is tile based. On the other hand, sometimes it's a bit tricky to understand where do you need to go, so you will often end up checking the minimap. This is not too bad to be honest, since in the old games you ended up having Wizard Eye cast most of the time and that's what you would be looking at.Side note on this, there is a bug that prevents you from changing your texture quality if you open the menu from inside the menu. You need to do it from the main menu of the game!On the Storyline I'm not commenting. We all know that it's no longer the original M&M world from NWC. I don't like most of the changes they made, nor I like the fact that it looks like Heroes of M&M is suddendly the ""story-driver"" of the game. All Sci-fi elements from the classics removed (they were the core of the story, so how can you remove them? Mah.), now it's just a bread and butter fantasy game. This specific title is decorated with a cartload of references to the old games (like Maximus the Knight, Crag Hack the Pirate - yeah no comment on this one -,  the Forbidden Saga quest, just to name a few) but that's not enough to build a story you might care about. There is not going to be Sheltem at the end or anything anyway.The Game System is where the entire game is played and that's where things become frustrating, annoying, confusing and misterious. There are four playable races, each with a variety of defensive melee, offensive melee and spellcaster. Each class can further specialize in a prestige class later on. Most of the traditional class names from M&M are completely gone. The base attributes of the characters are no longer the classics either and now we have things like Destiny and Perception (which increases ""all attack values by x"") and this is where the prime confusing quality of the game shines: it's really hard to understand what each value does. You get 4 attribute points to distribute at each level up, but if you knew better what was the impact of everything, choices would be easier.From the beginning of the game, melee classes will shine outright, while you will be left very much puzzled over the effectiveness of spells which get resisted systematically. As you move onward, your mages will become a total liability and die repeatedly (making them lose XP in the process, apparently even if you are unconscious you don't get XP, what kind of bizarre design is that?), causing you to enter a tragicly boring loop of eternal save and reload. Gone is the whole hatred system from the old M&M days where mobs would prioritize attacks based on race/class hatred, simply accept the fact that all mobs will always automatically attack and kill your weakest character all the time and you will not be able to do anything about it most of the time. If you add to this the incredibly lazy design choice of making mobs appear out of nowhere all the time (pretty much any meaningful encounter is like that), making strategic placement impossible (since you will always be flanked), you are in an incredibly rough, frustrating ride.And that's the main issue. Making a tribute game to the old days does not mean ""make a game stupidly hard"". This game is not hard, it's just extremely badly balanced. You need to cross zones with incredibly tough mobs to access areas defended by extremely easy mobs. You need to clear dungeons inhabited on one level by very easy minions and on the next by nigh-impossible elites. It's this constant schizofrenic design that leads to a completely unfun experience, for the mere fact that the immense amount of trial and error required to get anything done will bore you to death. It's a shame really, but unless they release some kind of magical patch that fixes all this, MMX becomes quickly a chore you do not want to play.Avoid it.			"

												Addendum to the Might & Magic (World of )X(een) Legacy. It's not a bad game, but it's pretty average and a bit too much on the clunky side with a lot less freedom than previous games.This game is somehow like a watered down spin-off from the Might & Magic 3-5 World of Xeen. It uses the same base mechanics for Map layout, Movement and Combat, which was fine twenty years ago, but feels pretty clunky today. There is also a few inclusions from Might & Magic 6 like the use of Hirelings and a few categories for Spells and Skills and the use of a Skill and Promotion system. Character creation is more streamlined, but also more boxed in, because everything each Class can learn and to what extent is laid out bare and square with progress bars and totally locked in. You can't add more Points to a Spell or Skill than the Limit of your Rank. There are four Races, each with three distinct Classes that each represents the Might, Hybrid and Magic Class of that Race. There are no limits in regards to which Race and Class you make for your Party, but since the game has no alternative Light Source other than what Magic provides you are going to have a really hard time dealing with Dungeons and underground Areas without a Dwarf (with Fire Magic) or a Class with Light or Dark Magic. If you decide to take a Shot at the Might Achievement you would be really darksided without a Dwarf in the Party, just saying. There are also no requirements for Grandmastery of Light and Dark Magic as there is no kind of Alignment or Reputation system at all. Combat is quite clunky. You can only attack Enemies that are on the same Line as the one you are standing on and only within a limited Range, which makes Enemy movements look really silly as they slide sideways into Combat and the only Tactic that you can really apply to Combat is to make sure to stand in a Corner, Tunnel or Doorway where the Enemies can't attack you from more than one Side and there is also a limit to how many Enemies can stand on the same Square, which means they will just wait and queue up for the Slaughter. You can only Escape as long as you don't have direct Enemy Contact, but once an Enemy stands next to you you can't move at all. I can understand why there is no water-walking (no flight, swimming and climbing neither), because that part have been tied into the Story and added as a Roadblock, but I don't understand why there are no Town Portals or Loyds Beacons. Alternatively, you can move around from Obelisk to Obelisk once you have unlocked them and you can add Markers to the Map to remember where they are and what they are called which is visible on the World Map, but they are all quite remote. There is a Spirit Beacon referred to in the description of Primordial Magic as a Spirit Gate, but you can only have ONE one-way ticket for the whole Party despite having several Characters with the same Spell. I really hate all this pointless walking, which it becomes once you have explored it all, because there are never any interruptions or encounters on the Path. The Area Map which is the only Map that shows all the paths can't be zoomed in or out and since there are a lot of Deadends you'll be wasting a lot of time moving from Place to Place, especially when you need to buy a Rank or Spells. There is no free movement at all, but a lot of Maze like Tunnels across the Landscape, through Forests and rocky Terrain. Once you acquire the ability to walk on water you realize that there is remarkably little water that you can actually walk on. The only really nice thing the Game offers is that you can add your own Markers to the Map, which is visible on the World Map and Area Map and helps a lot to find Trainers again and to keep track of Obelisk and remember where you've been and so on, but unfortunately the Markers you add to a disconnected Area or City is only visible within that Place. There is also no kind of permanent Item Enchantment in the game. You can't make your own Items or Enchant them with Magical Properties. No point in lugging around anything else than Magic Items, that you intend to use. Each character has an action bar with ten Slots, but only one. There is no switching between them or making more, which is really too limited. There is quite a lot of Puzzles and Riddles in the game, which is a bit of a testamony to the old games, but the ones that require you to move around a lot and step on plates in different order or keep track of teleportation Paths are really quite boring and tedious and the clunky Interface is not helpful at all in this regard. There are a few funny references to Army of Darkness and other Race specific comments to nature and actions, but unfortunately they are just barely chuckleworthy. Your Characters really bark a lot in Combat. The Story, Sound and Dialogue is pretty decent, but the Graphics are really low-res and it doesn't really support any Resolution at all. The game looks exactly the same in 1280x800 as it does in 1920x1200. It really looks at least ten years older than it is, but due to a tremendous lacks of optimization in the Unity Engine, which is powering the Game, it's actually pretty taxing on your GPU for no reason at all. The game looks nice from a Distance with Shadows and different Light Effects, but it's really blurry up close. I bought the game on Steam, but I also needed to install Ubisofts UPlay and create an Account in order to play the Game, but UPlay is really half-baked. It tracks my Achievements and seriously slow down loading on Area transistions, but it neither record nor unlock Actions and Rewards and thus I can't unlock any new 'free' Areas. I can't unlock any of the Game Content with Upoints. The DLC The Falcon & The Unicorn is really short. It's like an End Chapter, which isn't available until you've finished the main Game, and it's actually quite hard. It begins with a Blast of the most cumbersome tediousness of Puzzle solving as the worst parts of the game with a massive moving around. Once you get the hang of it it's quite simple, but incredible boring, because there is really no challenge at all. Until you get it right, until you understand the mechanics it's a massive waste of time.			"

												I'm surprised that this game received so many negative reviews.  It is really an amazing game and it feels very much like the old school games but with very good graphics.  You can tell by the hours I have in this game that is was worth every penny and there is a ton to do.  The story is excellent, the characters a great, and you really get hooked after the first few hours.  The developers hyped the ""Legacy"" feel of the game and I believe they were spot on.  I'd LOVE it if they made a sequal or even a few DLC's.  I highly recommend this game if you enjoyed the older M&M games of yesterday.			"

												Lowbrow, soulless and cheap want-to-be Might and Magic game. M&M 1-8 are good, great and amazing. 9 is horrible and then this one happened. Good Old Games (GoG) has the other ones for a great price. Get Worlds of Xeen and then understand why this one is such a pile of....now I understand I am being very negative. I mean to be because I had so many high hopes for this one. I would have looked past the required Uplay if it was what it should have been, but it is not what it could have been. Day of the Destroyer, Mandate of Heaven, Worlds of Xeen, Isles of Terra. Those four Might and Magic games are great and much cheaper, get those. Thank you Ubisoft for making another flub of a game.

												This is way, way worse than the old Might and Magic games. Less customization (only two portraits and voices per gender per race. Don't like a portrait? Too bad. They're hard-coded and there's no way to get more; also the voices are annoying as hell). It's uglier than the old M&M games too. The graphics are technically better (though about ten years outdated by modern standards), but the art design is far worse. Towns just look barren and boring. The gameplay is eh. Not as good as the old M&M. It's much, much, much simpler. They've dumbed it way down.so why do I have so many hours? I love Might and Magic. I have thousands of hours on 6, 7, and 8 throughout my childhood. I wanted to like this. I realized, eventually, that I hated every moment of it. This game is just bad.			"

												I really enjoyed this game, it reminded me so much of the original Might & Magic. Back before the graphics were any good and 3D rendering wasn't even a reality for desktop games. The game play is a perfect balance of old and new. Turn based takes me back, and also enhances the strategic part of this type of gaming. There are certainly some difficult sections in this game, where you can encounter monsters that are outright impossible to kill at the level you are in the game, so be careful. Monsters do not re-spawn, so it is not the kind of game where you can ""farm"" for gold and/or items. You have to be careful with your resources to make sure you don't miss any opportunities to upgrade when needed to progress. Overall, I would give this game a 9/10.			"

												Classic Might + Magic FPS turn-based grid gameplay, and a love letter to Clouds / Darkside of Xeen.  Teaching-by-slaughter, riddle chests, epic gear that levels with you, wide skill trees, tons of random crap to discover when you just run off into the woods.			"

												This is basically Xeen (MM4) with a party of 4 and more customization/options.  Turn based tile map party RPG.  I'm about halfway through and definitely enjoying the game. I will probably wish there was more overall content when I'm done, but I will get over it by firing up WoX (MM4+MM5).			"

												What I like:- It has a nice difficulty level.- Nostalgia successfully evoked for people who played classics such as Lands of Lore or Eye of the Beholder.- Fights and character builds require some strategy.- You can make notes on the ingame map. For example, you can write there ""spells"" next to a shop where you can do that, or ""axe"" at a spot where you can level up a characters axe skill.- Some replayability possible. The puzzles and enemies will be the same, but you can build a different party of different classes and thus attempt to beat the game with a different setup, using the higher of the two available difficulty modes.- Some of the puzzles and riddles are fun.What I dislike:- Ubisoft. That means you have to deal with Ubisofts Uplay nonsense, bad support, DRM and whatnot.- The game is sometimes a bit sparse in matters of telling you where to do what. Without researching sometimes on the internet where to do what, you might get frustrated.- I had one annoying bug so far.- Sometimes, every couple of hours, it crashes. Since it saves automatically ever now and then and has a quicksave option, this is bearable though.- The graphics are mixed. They're not good, but some models and parts of the dungeons look nice. Other parts, especially outdoor textures, look very bad if you get closed.Neutral:- Some of the game mechanics make sense gameplaywise but are highly illogical. For example, the buffs on your party (like one that protects you from damage) last a certain number of turns (during combat) or moves. But you can, for example, rest for 8 hours to regenerate your party, and those buffs are all still up. Sometimes you can also rest for 8 hours before a boss fight, and the boss will just wait until you're done.- In some of those old RPGs I liked that the positioning of the party mattered (melee fighters in the front, ranged fighters and spell casters in the back). In this game, the positioning is irrelevant. - The difficulty is not increasing in an entirely linear way. You will encounter enemies you can't beat at that point. On the other hand, the game saves automatically all the time, so you just reload and ignore that part for the time being.So, all in all, if you like those retro-RPGs, this one is ok. It's not great, but is entertaining enough. 25 Euro is a bit expensive in my opinion, but for 15 Euro or less, like during a Steam Sale, I can easily recommend it, as far as you don't buy it randomly but realized that you get a retro style RPG instead of a new Witcher or Elder Scrolls. Well, and you have to be aware that there are still a couple of bugs in the game.			"

Play hours not accurate, I have 100+ hours on UplayThis game has plenty of flaws and you'll need hardware way above the listed requirements to enjoy it at decent framerates, but man, is exploring its wide, grid-based world and fighting using its turn-based combat system enjoyable!This is an old-school RPG where you create a party from scratch or using pre-made characters and go adventuring. While initially linear, the game opens up more and more to exploration as you progress. Not everything is at your level either, which is a breath of fresh air if you're used to Skyrim and the like: make sure to save often, because taking the wrong turn or entering the wrong cave can put you in a lot of trouble!Flaws:- Uplay- Sometimes bland graphics with high system requirements (some dungeons do look great though)- Long intro cutscene and a story you won't care about- If you're like me you'll find the beginning town and first combat encounters boring- Repetitive voice acting of your characters (fixable by digging in the game files)- RPG system is not the deepest or most interesting I've seenYou also need to be aware that this is not really like the old World of Xeen games, and it is not like M&M 7-8-9 either. It's pretty much its own beast, mixing elements from both and adding or modernizing others.I'm still recommending the game despite all its flaws, which goes to show how good it is. And it's pretty much the only recent game available for this particular blend of turn-based, grid-based exploration.Some players including me had trouble progressing beyond the first chapter of the game because of a leftover mechanism that was used to give players early access to a part of the game. I've put up a guide on how to work around that problem:

												The game is not without flaws and bugs. However, despite all the problems, the game is a lot of good fun. It has no problem squashing you like a bug with difficulty and it still manages to capture that Might and Magic feel despite the low budget.I get the feeling that if the same development studio was given more money to produce another game, it'd be quite good once they ironed out the kinks. Sadly, that likely won't happen.Don't expect much with the story/dialogue though. Only get it for the gameplay. "

												A solid first person dungeon crawler with some flaws. It may not be the best in the series, but it's pretty damn good. The game had some technical and balance issues at launch and some of them are fixed by now. If it's your first dungeon crawler it can be a bit hard because you can easily be outnumbered and outclassed. It's fun and addicting. The exploration aspect of this game is fantastic. Actually going out of my way for the grandmaster quests was great. The end overstays it welcome just a bit. Overall, it was a good surprise that I didn't expect to be good.			"

												BUYERS BEWARE! THIS IS A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT!!!Its a Gem riddled with Bugs, Glitches, Graphics problem, performance problem (dipping below 30 and 20 fps), sometimes you cant even save, there have been reports that you cant get pass ACT II because of its faulty In-Game DRM check, typos, useless Classes (Archery is just useless) and some dungeons feels like a Serious Sam quantity of enemies that overstay their welcome. Im dead ""serious"", as soon as ACT II Starts, its pretty normal to be facing over 6-10 enemies in 1 room of a dungeon that has over 3 floors... do the math.This game needed at least 6 more months in the oven before selling it. Jesus! Feels like a crime putting this game on STEAM!If you can tolerate that and get it at least 5 bucks(or whatever price you think is worth), you can enjoy this turn based rpg. 4 races and each one having 3 classes to choose from. Over 40+ hrs of gameplay.			"

												New fans may not enjoy this game. I've had the pleasure of growing up with the Xeen, Eye of the beholder and other turn based games. Here you will find updated graphics but this game does miss out on modern boss mechanics. A few of these moments exists in the game but this was a missed opportunity by the developers. Everything else in this game is true to the previous series. You will need to save often and build a balanced party (Tank, DPS, Healer and Mage). I finished 1 play through with Paladin (Tank), Barbarian (DPS), Ranger (DPS/Heal with Regen) and Freemage (Heal/AOE/ Damage mitigation spells).8/10 if scoring for older fans			"

												Might and Magic X doesn't try to reinvent the fantasy RPG, it sticks pretty close to the roots and the tried and true tropes of the genre.  And that's precisely why it's fun.You will create a party of heroes, and you've got a decent variety of options to choose from, enough that I wanted to play again after finishing to try out some different party makeups with different skills.The game plays out on a grid, viewed from a first person perspective, which gives it a classic dungeon crawler feel, but you've also got some convenient modern concessions such as the ability to look around freely, and an automap.  This gives you just enough of those old-school tingles to warm your aging nerd heart, without the frustration of trying to map the entire world yourself on graph paper or figure out which direction you are facing. (I know there are those who prefer that level of masochism in their gaming, I'm not among them, these are dealbreakers for me these days.)You'll get a decent level of challenge on the default setting -- you will have to think about your own party's skills and spells, and how they will work against different monsters attacks and defenses.  It's not coddling you but it's not so ""hardcore"" as to be unfun.   There is no level scaling here, so you will need to explore around the world a bit at times looking for encounters that are appropriate to your squad's level.  Personally i enjoy this part of the game, but if you're looking for an open-world experience where you can go anywhere you wish and always find beasties who aren't quite good enough to kill you, this isn't it.This game scratches some of my chronic itches that big budget games just won't touch anymore, much as I love them.  Namely:It's turn-basedIt's party-basedthere's no level-scalingit lets itself have fun with charming little gimmicks like riddle chests and open-ended questions.It's not driven by a cinematic narrativeIt doesn't try to reinvent the genre.  These last two points are the key to why I have enjoyed playing the game so much.  There's something mentally taxing about playing a game that tries to introduce a lot of new elements, especially when it's a heavily story driven experience.  I have to invest time and energy learning a whole new world, yes sometimes that's great.  But sometimes the story or gameplay doesn't hold up and I end up abandoning the game.  Sometimes I just want to kill monsters and loot treasure in a world that goes back to the familiar well of orcs, elves and dragons.So, give me simple, give me palatable, give me something that feels old-fashioned, but looks nice and bows reasonably to modern game conventions like automaps and quest journals.  Give me something that fits like an old shoe, without the stink.  give me more games like M&MX.			"

												Might and Magic X I can only some up as a OK, there is enjoyment to be found in this game but there are many stretches where the game comes across as repetative and grindy. There is a nostelgic feel for old school western RPGs and if you are a fan of this niche genre then you will get your monies worth for the game. However, there is a reason why this style of RPG went out of date and I believe this game falls incredably short of reviving it. The combat system was fairly basic although not in a bad way, the depth for leveling up however was somewhat lacking and the different abilites only a few seemed playable, which hearts the replayability of the game. The positivies I found out of the game was the atmosphere, it did feel like I was inside the Might and Magic world and the lore was present in the form of the collectables in the game. The main narrative however had its high and lows but for the most part I feel like it continued on from Heroes VI well enough. In the end I really, really wanted this game to be amazing as I loved the story of Heroes VI and am a fan of this style of RPG however the game fell flat and I was simply left wanting more. I am hopeing one day the studio retries to make another RPG M&M  game but puts in as much effort as they have done with there past games.Rating: 5.5/10			"

												Ok, I am a big Might & Magic fan and have played MIght & Magic since the beginning back on a Commodore 64 with Might & Magic 1 & 2.  I can say that prior to this game Might & Magic VI was the best version that I had come across and when this game came out in that style and for the Mac I was absolutely estatic and had to get the game.  Pro's:  Has the same feel as the MIght & Magic VI style of play.  Pretty badass game to that extent.Con's:  This is a major con.  The game as far as I can see does not respawn.  So when you finish a map, you literally finish a map.  Yes, you can travel through the map itself to get to another part but have no way to develop a more powerful character.  You are basically limited to the level that the game is setup for.  This gives control to the gameplay to keep it complicated for the customers, but it takes out the randomness of the game, which once you realize that, the game seriously loses its appeal.  I literally went back to Might & Magic VI by downloading Crossover and the PC version on my Mac to play the game.  It plays flawlessly but Might & Magic X just does not compare to VI.  They were so close yet unless they change that part of the game, I would have to give this a thumbs down :(			"

												Might and Magic X is a real treat for fans of open-world exploration and dungeon crawling. The game delivers an old-school first-person RPG experience complete with cities, landscales, dungeons, side-quests, vast character/party builds, and some choices to make along the way. The turn-based combat is as fast-paced as you want it to be, and it serves to curb double-step exploits found in similar, older RPGs. Deciding how to level-up your characters is involving, and you can really make the characters you set out to. The default (lower) difficulty feels perfect, if not a tiny bit too easy for series veterans; by no means is it a pushover, nor is it as punishing to newcomes as some mainstream reviews may suggest. The game feels balanced and polished, at least for the 20+ hours I've played it. I have encountered a couple small bugs, but nothing game-breaking, and the developers have made it clear they will continue to support the game into the future.Overall, if you are a fan of old-school RPGs with modern advancements, or are to new Might and Magic, this is a game worth getting.

												Though imbalance and often times frustrating, this true-to-form throwback CRPG is the kind of game we played growing up in our late 80s / early 90s DOS-fueled youth. If the idea of slogging your way through baddie-infested grid movement dungeons and min/max'ing your party appeals to you, then MMX is the best way to spend your next 50 or so hours. Keep in mind though, this game is horrendously unfair at times, and victory comes through equal amounts of skill and luck.			"

												This game captures a certain era and type of first-person party-based dungeon crawler that Legends of Grimrock couldn't hope to cover, and it does a good job. The world isn't as interesting or charming as older Might & Magic games but the core gameplay is both tactical and engaging, and if you have fond memories of turn-based first-person dungeon crawls, this game will bring them all flooding back.It seems to follow a Dark Souls-esque difficulty curve: It's tough, but if you think about what you're doing you can make it through.

												FOR 64 BIT OS-Much better in 64 bit. I had to buy a new copy of Windows, since my old one was OEM and I had changed out the motherboard.Unity still sucks and it is still an insane resource hog, but the game itself is kinda fun.PS- I haven't spent that many hours playing it. If I'm alt tabbed out of it for a day or two, or even if uplay is just still running, and SOMETIMES even steam, then Steam thinks I'm playing.FOR 32 BIT OS-Unity? Really? Either it is the game engine itself, or this game has been so poorly coded that it has zero optimization and demands more memory usage than, well, any other game out there.This, despite it being a small game that has nothing close to cutting edge technology. It is a retro style game with grid movement. As a result of the poor coding or poor game engine, while 32 bit software is listed as supported, it really isn't, as the game only partially works with it.Using a 32 bit OS (even Windows 7) you only get some sounds. No player barks, no ambient sounds, no monster sounds. Just some music and button clicking sounds.Also, you only get ""medium"" textures, but this is a deceptive turm, since the texture quality is low- medium- high- very high- ultra. With medium level textures, this game looks like it was made by two indie game developers in a basement during their time off from work. In the year 2003. This is a shame, as a lot of love and hard work has clearly been poured into the game, and it's artwork.Pretty sad for me, too, as I've been waiting so very, very long for a new Might and Magic game! Might and Magic III was my frst game in the series. I played that little RPG to death!If you have a 64 bit OS, I'm sure it's great.If you have a 32 bit OS, and, like me, cannot afford to upgrade/lost your original CD and key, don't bother. I know it's listed in the steam store as being supported, and it's listed by ubisoft as being supported, but that's a lie. If you complain, they'll cut and paste a blurb about how it isn't recommended and you should just upgrade to a 64 bit OS. Thanks, guys.A lot of people were decived by what they heard about the early release, too, since 32 bit OS players could, pre-release, play with all the sound and max texture quality, instead of the butt-ugly silent thing they got at release.Speaking of, I bought the digital deluxe version.  Where's my soundtrack? I was supposed to get a soundtrack for paying the $5 extra for my butt-ugly game. And really? I used Steam because I hate uPlay and how flaky it is. But no. Nope! You have to go through TWO DRM software systems. You have to go through Steam, and then what loads up? uPlay! Awesome! So you have to be running Steam and uPlay to run this game. AND use an activation key. A key which Steam seems to think it needs you to copy and paste and apply EVERY TIME YOU START THE GAME. You also get to sit and watch it try to install dirextX and .net framework and something else every time you start it up. Come on now, son. Come on. Do you really think everyone's going to want to pirate this game so badly? Oh, and thanks for adding in the paper doll int he inventory that everyone wanted. Except... y'all missed the whole point of it. We liked the paper doll in 6-8 because you could put them in the armor you found, and see it. Instead, it's just an illustration of the class and gender, and one of two (way too small for some reason, in a number of cases) heads that just gets pasted on the body interchangeably, per race and gender. Zzzz. Pointless...The good? You want the good? Okay. Well, I like that they brought back the characters showing their state of health in their main portraits. Somebody gets poisoned? They turn green and look sick. That's neat. The 2D UI looks nice. I wish the game world didn't look like orc poop, but the UI looks nice.The action bar is a good thing. Having access to more than one spell at the click of a button is a great idea.That's... that's all I can think of. I keep trying to play it. I keep trying to get into it and I just can't. It's so broken in a 32 bit OS. :(Sorry. it sucks.			"

If you are looking for a huge focus on story, NPC interaction or a powerful atmosphere then this is not going to be it. On the other hand, if you are looking for a heavy combat focus with a great sense of progression then you are going to have a blast with this game. Certainly not perfect, it's a highly enjoyable combat-oriented dungeon crawler with plenty of combat. Full review:

												World of Xeen remains one of my favorite games of all time and the Might and Magic series has been a staple of mine from M&M II to M&M VIII.  So of course I jumped on the chance to play M&M X.What it gets right:Turn-based party-based RPG mechanics.Familiar Might and Magic loot.Familiar Might and Magic skill and expertise system.Character banter.No game breaking bugs or deal breakers so far.Doesn't come on a dozen 3.5"" floppy disks.What's missing:Some basic elements, the character portraits, the interface, could be tightened up a bit.The font of the in-game text doesn't seem to fit.It's subjective but the holistic package is just lacking to a small degree.What's wrong:I'm not a fan of the fixed race/class character creation.I want my old school Xeen class system with fighter, mage, cleric, thief and multi-class combinations assigned to any race/character portrait.Needs a larger party and more races/classes/skills in general.Might and Magic X - Legacy is not a perfect game.  If you are not familiar with the series and play only top tier perfect games, you will be disappointed in it.  If you are a fan of Isles of Terra or World of Xeen, you will probably find a lot to love.  My hope is this is a resurrection and the first of many Might and Magic titles.  If so, I will be playing the hell out of them.			"

												I was concerned this wouldn't be a recommendation after participating in the Early Release, which was incredibly disappointing. However, I was pleasantly surprised when the final release came out that a large number of the issues I had with the game had been addressed. Overall, M&MX does a good job of capturing the old school vibe of earlier entries in the system, while taking advantage of some of their later design improvements first seen in their Heroes series of games. That said, the game misses the mark in several ways. First, the graphic performance is very disappointing. It looks like a game optimized for 5+ years ago. The creation and skill system does a poor job of helping new players understand pros and cons of the abilities and how they impact gameplay. The amount of running through previously cleared areas is frustrating. The limited voice acting is grating and repetitive.Despite those disappointments, this does scratch the itch for a classic, party-based, first person roleplaying experience. The exploration, discovery, hidden bits, and character classes do feel like previous entries in the system. For a truly authentic experience, and to help off-set the disappointing graphics, I strongly recommend selecting the ""classic pixelated"" display found in the gameplay settings menu. Other pros - once you're familiar with the game, the classes are diverse and offer a lot of variety in how you want to build your party. Combat is tactical enough to be satisfying without slowing the game down too much. Boss fights are brutal but winnable with careful play. The cool epic items that level up with your character are awesome. It's casual enough to be approachable by a wide audience. It's a fairly good value for its pricepoint. It has a strong nostalgia element. I think people familiar with other games in the series will be most likely to enjoy this version, but it shouldn't stop new players from giving it a shot!			"

												I tried to like it. The game play is too restrictive. The game content is too boring and limited for replay or experimentation. I liked the bonus M&M6 free game better than this game.			"

												This is a real trip of nostagia. I've been part of the beta testing and also used my voice in the open dev and I feel like I've been heard. It's great to feel like you've been a part of developing a game. It's great, a nice mix of TB battles, riddles/puzzles, Rpg and great lore. I have been a fan of this series since MM4, and this game does great and fits much better in the series then frontrunner MM9.Give it a chance, it takes a little getting into, and you might wanna try some different parties, to find the right mix of classes and the skills they offer. However, I wish the game could offer a little less linear-questing, and a option to respawn monsters in certain areas to help the leveling for those who wish.			"

												Dang, this game has some problems!  ONE action bar for spells?  Like, World of Warcraft figured out how to put little arrows providing access to multiple bars back in 2004!  How do you forget to do this?  And having trainers be spread far and wide across various cities is tedious.  I don't see the point of that!  The writing is lifeless, but at least it isn't overly wordy.However, tile-based movement through dangerous dungeons featuring turn based combat.  THAT is what I want from a game like this, and that's what I got, so I'm happy.  I also like that there are frequent level ups with various stat points to allocate.  That's fun too.			"

												The game mechanics are a bit old school.  Depending on what you are into, this is either a good or bad thing.  I definitly like this game although the only thing I dislike about it (and old-school thing) is that there are a fair amount of riddles and puzzles.  While not particularly hard, I do not have the patience for these and find them quite tiresome.  The loot is also uninspiring.  Pretty much I found the best weapons when I got to the 2nd town (very early in the game) and by the end of the game I only found replacements that were *slightly* better and these were supposid 'relics' of power.My final complaint is the events leading up to the final battle.  You go through several long levels of fighting the same enemies over and over.  It is quite tedious and boring.  I mean, if you have destroyed 10 sets of the same enemies under various ""ambush"" scenerios, I think you have proven your point that you can handle these guys.  Why then, make you go on and fight another 40 sets of these guys?  It is lazy game deisgn.Other than that, this game is well worth the asking price since it is so cheap.			"

												Might and Magic X - LegacyPositives:+ Successfully emulates the old-school Might and Magic series, with a party creation system which feels very familiar. There's also other classic additions, such as portraits of your characters in-game. Many of the distinct Might and Magic sounds from the games 7-9 have been re-used, which brings back memories.+ Graphically, the game looks modern and interesting, which is great.+ A fairly large game world to explore with relative freedom, quite a few quests to engage in as well, along with class promotions. + Story is intriguing and lengthy, took me about 55 hours to complete all main quests, with side quests included.+ Lots of different monsters to fight - naga samurai, air, earth, fire and water elementals, brigands, harpies, griffins, cyclopses, goblins, minotaurs...and many more.- Turn based combat which is different from Might and Magic 7-9, but actually works really well, giving you a chance to tactically assess what spells you'll cast and how you'll attack.Negatives:- Throughout the game a lot of audio is constantly repeated (such as locals talking), and for some people this might get irritating.- Decent amount of puzzles with varying difficulties, although I found some of these to be tedious, boring and annoying, resorting to simply googling the solutions.- Grid based movement, which is a step down from conventional games where you can freely turn and walk in any direction. While this isn't ideal it doesn't drastically impact on the fun of the game, it just means it's not as fluid as it could have been.Overall Score: 8/10Might and Magic X - Legacy is an excellent RPG which mirrors the old series from the 1990s. Even if you're a Might and Magic 7-9 fan, you should still grab this game because it's awesome fun.			"

												I first should say I liked this game, but I liked it for all the wrong reasons, the gameplay is subpar at best and you can end up glitched into a situation where you have to reload from a previous save or a situation where you might have to reload from so long ago that it might as well be restarting. Additionally if you uninstall for whatever reason and re-install if you didn’t personally back up your saves they may just disappear. In the game the general forced turn-based style (which while in heroes has been optional in regular Might and magic since 1995) not only slows the game down to a crawl but makes it incredibly easy to defeat enemies, in actuality the only time you will ever have any difficulty in this game is when they force you onto a ledge before spawning the enemies or in hallways where you magically get surrounded. But the worst offense this game commits is making it impossible to fix any mistake you made. Now I know I said enemies were easy so this shouldn’t be a problem but it is since no enemy ever respawns there is a limited amount of gold and exp in the world and dead characters don’t get exp. So in those rare fights where you get surrounded and one of your party members falls it misses out on everything, and this can be especially troubling if you are under-leveled for a boss (bosses tend to be either right next to you or force you onto a ledge and then over) because you think “oh I only need a little bit more exp then I can do this” but there’s nothing left you have to reload from a save usually a few hours (minimum due to the slow pace of the game) and do everything again hoping that this time you will only to find out that you needed to load further back in your files.Personally this game I did say I liked and I’ll tell you exactly why, because Might and Magic 6 was the first great game I ever was able to play being able to play another “updated” version of the game made me excited about the future prospects, but since its release there has been no hit at another in the franchise that I am aware of so the hopes of playing another good might and magic game have been dashed.Also in the older games the voices and sound effects though primitive were clever and original, whereas here in this game everything sounds like a b-reel fantasy sound clip there The best analogy I can give to this game is imagine someone saw a beloved franchise like say Half-life, now imagine Ubisoft bought Half-life, sure we’d get a Half-life 3 and maybe more, but the game would be completely different with nearly no regard (except for names and maybe general models) for the source materials…In conclusion, Don’t waste your money go find a copy of Might and Magic 6, 7, and 8 (12$ probably total) and enjoy a good 50+ hours of classic fantasy games that are actually good.

												Screw this game. I was excited to play a new might and magic title but this is nothing but frustrating and poorly put together. Game has a throwback feel and is certainly fun at times, but quickly turns to an overwhelming amount of trial and error in the face of constant death. I enjoy open world games with exploration and a variety of monsters. This game tries to appear open but is really extremely linear as any time you go the wrong way at all you die. I am sick of looking at that loading screen. Other problems include: U play account needed, extremely sub par graphics, low and inconsistant framerates, long load times, repetitve obnoxious sounds, Journal doesnt include trainer locations, default party is garbage, lack of any fast travel, no retreat from combat, poor map systemThese are all things that could be forgiven if the gameplay was great, but its not. Even if you are a fan of previous M&M titles, AVOID.			"

												I've played a fair amount of this now. I bought it way back in early access but I waited because I knew it would only get better and I didn't want to ruin my final experience with the game. It seems some people's experiences in early access weren't that great.I am having quite a bit of fun with it. There's a fair amount of character customization that you can do at the beginning of the game though not quite as much as  the M&M6-8 games. Mainly because you pick 1 of 4 races and each race has 3 class option. Those classes are a little bit limited in their further skill customization but there's still a fair amount of diversity to be had in terms of skill choices. You're also limited to 2 voice choices and 2 male potraits as well as 2 female portraits. At first I thought that it was a bit weak but I figured it didn't really matter what they looked or sounded like.As far as the gameplay goes I found a lot of things nostalgic. The sounds they used, the way you interact with buildings, and a few other things reminded me a lot of M&M6-8. The big difference being it's not free roam and it's on a grid but you know what, I'm fine with that. If it was free movement people would compare it to other open world games and that's not fair. It works fine that it's grid based and I didn't find it to hurt the experience at all. When you level up there's lots of customization to be had in terms of skill lines to put skill points into and stat points to distribute. There's also plenty of loot to plunder and equip even though it's kind of annoying how much +resistance gear there is. It feels like a cheap cop out way to avoid giving you a useful stat on the item. Every single green item has +resistance and you have to find a blue item to even get an item worth caring about as green items don't roll anything but +resistance which is all but pointless.Overall I would recommend this game to fans of the series and you should realize this game is a bit different than the M&M6-8 games. That doesn't mean you should avoid it though as there's a lot of fun to be had. Even people who are new to the series. If you enjoy tactical RPG type games then you should enjoy this.			"

												This ia a turn based RPG in the classic sense. I have not played a M&M game in a while and like all the others I have played I enjoied it. Despite some glairing short commings this is a good turn based RPG. Over all a good game in its class but lacking in software and graphics departments. The game platform is very heavy weight considering what you get. I would not pay too high a price for this game unless you are a fan boy (I purchased on sale). I find it anoying that I must run Steam and Uplay both just to play this game, got to love DRM's.Pros: -Nostalgic of prior M&M and turn based 1st person party games so there is a level of fermailrlty. -Good amount of content. -D&D style turn based RPG play.-Puzzles and story lines along with the grind.Cons:-System hungry base game platform. I don't understand why a game like this with out top notch graphics or overly complacated would be so system hungry.-Too much travel. Many RPG's have less travel and offer more fast travel of this size. A return to last town would be nice since there are no patrols and everything in the area is already dead.-Graphics have few setting for this system hungry game and seem dated.-Have to run Steam and Uplay both. #@%& I hate having to run one DRM let alone two!

												Decent Might & Magic game, nothing special, but fans of the series should enjoy it.Game is rather short & doesn't have whole lot of content, but it delivers good immersion and satisfying feeling of nostalgia :)I liked combats & skills system, and those two things are probably most important ones not to screw up in an RPG. I have low demands for graphics & music, so it's hard to dissapoint me there.All downsides for me were already summarized under ""not whole lot of content"". Not too many classes to select from, story plot is short, not too many cities to visit, not too many monsters to fight, not too many spells to learn, skills to train and quests to complete ... some cherished parts from earlier games are missing entirely (card game, killing traps, potion making). But what content provided, is of good quality.To summarize, game is worth playing, but probably has zero replay value, and that tells you something.			"

												This game pays homage to Might and Magic 1-5 and persoanlly, I like it very much. The good:* Unlike a lot of RPGs today, the combat mechanics are deep and srategic. Should you spend a turn healing and defending or should you take a chance and forgo healing this round to dish out damage with the hope of quickly ending the encounter? Decisions like these make combat satisfying. * Pretty graphics - Bright vibrant colours and nice character models. * Party based RPG that allows for a ton of customization options and increases re-play value. The bad:* Not enough content - The game is a lot of fun, but very short. The DLC addresses this nicely, but even so, the original should have been longer.* The storyline is not very memorable. I still vividly remember the story of Might and Magic 7, but despite having 244 play hours on MMX, I still can't recall the story.			"

												A brief summary of the below: I actually enjoy this game, and I plan to keep playing it. However, it's hard to get into, has a number of flaws, uses outdated soundbytes, and generally feels very unfinished. It doesn't feel like a betrayal to the series or anything like that, but this game is built from a lot of unrealized potential. I would not suggest this game to others unless they like the world of Ashan or want another dungeon crawler in game library. It's a solid turn-based dungeon delving game, but I wouldn't call the story I've seen impressive or the gameplay innovative.Might and Magic X is a strange beast to me. It's an enjoyable game once you get past the ghastly introduction and a fairly deadly tutorial; however, it has a rather unpolished quality about it in general. As others have mentioned, the game has more in common with the original Might and Magic games (1-5) than it does the latter end of the series (6-9), at least so far as gameplay goes. It's based on the world of Ashan, which you will know if you've played Heroes of Might and Magic 5 or 6, on a peninsula consisting of a few towns and cities in an era of rebellion and religious turmoil.First, since combat is so integral to any dungeon delving series, let's take a gander at the good side of that. Combat in Legacy is turn-based and square-based. As said above, if you're familiar with how old Might and Magic games played, or if you like Legend of Grimrock, then this will feel like familiar territory to you. The game uses this to its advantage as much as you do at times: enemies will sometimes move to flank you, doubly so if they ""spawn"" in a position from which it is perfect for them to do so, and opponents in dungeons typically attack from places that put your party at a severe disadvantage. This makes fights challenging, and forces you to make plans around the terrain you're fighting in if you can. Tossing enemies away from you with a gust of wind or immobilizing them before they can reach you so you can reach limit the number of melee attackers on you, or ducking around a corner so the enemy mage will have to walk into smacking distance to chuck a spell at you... This game encourages tactical thinking, and that's what turn-based gameplay is all about.Now, let's discuss the bad part of combat. First, there's the fact that a lot of enemies do seemingly appear out of thin air. Ubisoft seems to be a fan of having your opponents, even when visible, be unable to be struck until  You will encounter this problem in the very first dungeon you ever touch, in the tutorial: spiders will drop from the ceiling and initiate melee combat with you immediately, before you can react. This would not be a problem except for the fact that entering in any melee combat prevents you from moving away from your current square. Let me repeat that: melee combat stops you from going anywhere. That means if you have even a single opponent on your face, you can't pull your part back a single tile into a defensible corridor to fight your opponents a few at a time. No, you're stuck standing in the middle of a terrible position where nine enemies can surround you, listening to your idiot adventurers screaming ""Sorry, I'm a little busy right now!"" when you're trying to get them to move somewhere they won't die. Apparently, the heroes of Ashan were never taught the intricacies of the tactical withdrawl. It's rather aggravating, and even after you've learned to deal with this limitation, you won't learn to like it.There are a lot of other little problems I have with the combat system, such as poison lasting forever until cured (and you'll encounter a LOT of poison at level 1). They don't ruin the game, but combined these flaws make combat feel... well, flawed. A small aside: ranged combat can be fun, but in my experience you'll rarely get the chance to enjoy it due to being locked in melee combat most of the time. Your ranged damage will be negligible once your party is fighting in close quarters.As I mentioned previously, the game lacks polish. I could talk about the graphics (though I'm not really a graphics-oriented person), which are lackluster, but I'm more inclined to talk about the various, small details of the game that could use changing. For one, Ubisoft has lazily taken sound bytes from previous games in the series - very outdated soundbytes, mind you - and slapped them into Might and Magic X. Perhaps they were trying to elicit some feelings of nostalgia from those who played Might and Magic 6, 7 and 8, but all the sound bytes taken from those games just sound so very out of place and old.There are very limited voice options for your playable characters (a 'heroic' or 'cynical' voice for each race/gender combo), and several of them reuse the exact same lines. That is, the humans and dwarves say almost the exact same thing, everyone sounds like they came from the British Isles, and the characters' lines get very repetitive very quickly. (I left the first town in Act 1 as quickly as I could just to get my dwarves to stop talking about how darned boring the place was.) Non-player characters with a voice actor in the open world don't even move their mouths when speaking to you; games as old as Wizardry 8 have at least gotten THAT down.The tutorial doesn't really cover leveling up well (if at all; I can't remember if it mentions it), which is annoying because players new to the series won't know to look for the 'skills' tab and place points there, and the skills tab being a subsection of the spells tab is very obnoxious, and... Well, whoa. Like I said earlier, there's a lot of polishing up and balancing that needs to be done to the game. The user interface and the tutorial just aren't built properly.Despite this, I found the game fun; very fun. I'm going to keep playing it as I have been. However, if Ubisoft doesn't make improvements by the time the next game in the series rolls about, I'll be very disappointed, because the game could be so much better than it is right now. I like the variety in classes in the game; I like the ideas Ubisoft had in making race actually matter a little bit (as far as conversations with NPCs go at least). If you are willing to overlook this game's flaws, it will be great fun, and there's a rather rewarding experience awaiting you once you get past the nasty shell that is the game's introduction. If not, well, don't buy the game.			"

YouTube™ Video: Might & Magic X Legacy Review 

			Views: 4,136		

			Cosmic takes a look at Might & Magic X legacy, developed by Limbic Entertainment and published by Ubisoft. Available on Steam now.		

welcome to the most recent addition to the Might & Magic series, Might & Magic X Legacy. Developed by Limbic Entertainment and published by Ubisoft, Might & Magic X legacy was released on January 23, 2014. The game is a throw back to the RPG's of old, adopting very traditional PC RPG mechanics. You start the game with the option of customizable character creation or the choice of choosing a default party of characters. Character creation is limited in terms of real personalization, you have the option of basically choosing a heroic voice or a cynical voice and that is about the depth of their personalties. My advice is to choose heroic every time as the cynical characters tend to repeat the same god damn four lines of speech every five minutes and it becomes tiresome. Other parts of character creations are good, there’s four races to choose from which span your clique elves, orcs, dwarfs and men. Each race has three unique classes to choose from, one might class, one magic class and a hybrid class.Legacy injects a lovely sense of nostalgia and really does bring you back to the series of ten plus years ago. However once that nostalgia ends what are you left with? Well a combination of good mechanics, dated mechanics and strange design choices.Lets start with movement outside of combat, I have no idea why the developers and ubisoft went for grid based movement outside of combat. Wanting a grid based combat system is one thing, out of combat grid based movement is quite another. While going for the retro feel is one thing, using dated movement that becomes boorish and frustrating is quite another. I really do feel that grid based world movement is a relic of a bygone era that does not need to resurface. The developers of the old might and magic games did not have grid based moment because they wanted too, it was a technological limitation of the time period, that limitation no longer exists so the lack of free world movement feels very contrived.The over world design itself doesn't really make sense you have a little lighthouse that nearly spans a 5 by 5 area and then a supposed huge castle that takes up the same amount of space. Places and objects in the world are not in proportion and it actually becomes immersion breaking to the point of silliness. Someone should also speak to the builders of the island as they need to be introduced to the concept of roads, how any of the citizens travel in that place is beyond me.The games graphics are confused too, you'll go from a really nice looking area, to areas riddled with poor textures, draw distance problems and outright texture load issues. I feel that Ubisoft really didn't give the game the budget it deserved and while the games graphics are in no way bad they are comparable to that of older games like elder scrolls oblivion even on its highest settings.Combat is where the game shines, the combat system is very traditional Might & Magic combat which is by no means a bad thing. I am certainly a fan of turn based combat and always have been, it is a solid mechanic that remains fun to this day. Fights are challenging and fun making you really consider each action you take to ensure your teams survival. The problem with the combat lies in smaller design choices I don't understand. Without any warning the game seems to regularly bump up the difficulty for no logical reason, for example you can clear the first two levels of a dungeon with no fuss then suddenly on the third the enemies are a lot tougher sometimes to the point of killing your entire party in one fell swoop. You can regularly run into much higher level opponents in the world that will just kill your characters in one move, which is fine in one sense but not in other. I like the fact there are enemies you cannot defeat yet, however having one of these enemies in a cave right outside of the first starting town is annoying. You cannot choose to escape from battle, so once you accidentally stumble into an area to high level for you and engage in combat, you might as well load your last save right there. Barring the few minor annoyances combat does remain fun, engaging and challenging.Levelling up again while simple suffers from strange design choices. When you level you receive attribute points to improve your base stats and skill points to improve your proficient with skills. Now any logical person would think to place tab these two menus right next too each other but no. instead you have to press the absurdly small level up button to place attribute points then close that menu to press the other small button to open the skills menu. The is a good amount of depth once in game to tailor the characters to the way you want them, there’s plenty of stats and skills to customize as is always the case in Might & Magic. The game doesn't do well in explaining skill related mechanics to players unfamiliar with the series, in fact the game has no tutorial at all and while I am a fan on games not holding your hand. It would be easy to miss that to improve skills you need to find a trainer, which by the way a spread out in an unhelpful way.The reason I love RPG's so much is due to their rich, well told characters and story. Might & Magic X Legacy's story is about as deep as a puddle in the middle of the desert, on the sun. There is no reason what so ever to care about the characters in the game, they are all as generic as any clique uninteresting fantasy characters. The back story of your characters goes as far as, your mercenaries looking for adventure, quaint. The games main story itself, is little more than a pointless excuse to visit the various dungeons with even the governor of the island basically stating that you hold no ties to the empire and thus have no reason what so ever to help them basically by saying (office space style) 'uhhh, if you could go ahead and restore all the elemental altars... that would be great.' it makes even less sense considering the empire has an army, paladins, griffon riders and a myriad of resources available to combat the threat, the reason they don't? Who knows.In all the game provides a good nostalgic feel but past that I feel disappointed. Those looking for a old school RPG will find it here. I feel that instead of trying to push the franchise forward Ubisoft have created a dated RPG experience and cashed in on the franchises name. I have to ask why this game needed to be made, yes make more Might & Magic games but don't replicate the mechanics over and over. Push forward, make better experiences, I'm not saying take out what makes Might & Magic, Might & Magic but at least bring the franchise into the modern era. Also Uplay is awful, stop putting that♥♥♥♥♥♥in your damn games Ubisoft. "

												As someone who has not played any other M&M titles, I can recommend this game.I would recommend playing this on the harder difficulty. This forces you to explore everywhere in order to level up, and will greatly reward you for searching every nook and cranny.This game has one interesting niche that sets it apart from other games, everything is finite. There are no respawning monsters, no respawning loot etc. This creates a sense of meaningfulness to every choice you make, when you spend your gold or sell equipment. Because of the way the game is set up you'll often run into enemies that are far too hard for you, or bosses you can't handle yet. I consider this a positive, as it encourages you to explore the world more in order to gear up / level up.If you read other reviews pros and cons, I would agree with most of them. However , this game stands out from other turn based RPG's so much, that I can't help but recommend it. I would love to see a M&M X-2 style game, improving upon it's strengths, and adding more customizability. Pick it up on sale. I'd value it around 15-20$.			"

												For anyone who is a fan of the older Might and Magic games, Especially the really older ones (1-5), This game is a treat - and a blast from the past - IF you can set aside a few differences. Namely, The size/scale of the game. Don't expect a huge MM6-8 style world with hundreds of side quests - The world is much smaller and the plot is quite simple. Despite that, The loading times might annoy you and it's still a bit buggy. The skill system works a bit differently as well. But other than that..It has the spirit and feel of an MM game. I'd say it's well worth the price and Limbic should be commended for capturing NWC's spirit in this game as well. Hopefully, Next time, Ubisoft will consider a more large-scale MM game.And even if you aren't an MM fan.. This is a pretty nice RPG in today's standards, Giving well over 40-50 hours of entertaining gameplay.			"

												I didn't know how badly I wanted to play a game like this until I actually started playing. I realize this doesn't make much sense but it sums up my feelings on this title perfectly.. I heard some positive reviews of this game from some VG podcasters I trust (Gamers With Jobs specifically) and decided to take a chance on it. I wasn't expecting to love it but I am absolutely addicted. I am still on my first playthrough with the default party and the balance is fantastic. I always feel like I might die in any given big encounter, but I usually manage to scrape through. Lots of fun exploring, turn based combat is leisurely and exciting at the same time, and the progression is nice and smooth. The game is not afraid to kill you outright if you stumble into the wrong place, but it quietly autosaved before you took the fatal step. It's not afraid to make you trek back to town to get more supplies but you might find another cave or set of enemies while you do so.Full disclosure, I enjoyed Might and Magic 2 and 3 though I was a bit too young at the time to really grind through them all the way. I think finally, 20 years later, I am in the perfect mindset to take this on. A wonderful game, absolutely worth the price of admission, but be sure to know exactly how this game plays before diving in, and trust that instinct that says ""I might like this game"".			"

												Damn, this game gave me a headache. Should I recommend it or not? Is it, in the end, a good or a bad game?Well it is both. You're welcome. ;)In fact, MMX is a great old-school RPG, and some might hate it. If you don't like turn-based games, forget about it right away. It will appeal mostly to people who started playing computer games in the 80's and 90's. This said, this category of gamers will regret going back to another feature that was typical of the era: infinite loading times. This is, by far, the most annoying thing in this great game. You'll have to suffer long loadings every two minutes, because it makes you travel a lot, and reload saved games a lot. It is, apparently, very badly programed and suffers from huge stuttering issues on any machine. It runs ""smoother"" on 64-bit systems but doesn't really take advantage of huge amounts of memory as it could. Maybe it emulates floppy disks, I don't know. Let's call it a feature. Oh, and the world looks more like a maze than like an open world, making it difficult to find your way, even if you've discovered every square inch of land (or sea). If you were used to rushing from west to east in a matter of seconds in the old MM series (by tapping arrow keys madly, like Stakanov), you'll be disappointed by how long it takes to travel. It expands the world size artificially, but it works eventually.Now that's all for the bad stuff.Good things about this game? Mainly all the rest. First thing first, it is DIFFICULT. You'll spend hours trying to find the few roads/places where you're safe enough to gain some experience while avoiding dying every minute. Then you'll come back to places that were previously unaccessible to your party and kick some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Or not, and die again. And again. More often than in the old games, except maybe MM6 which was very open and very difficult too.You'll soon discover that you have to make careful choices in your skills, for every character in the party. At first, you'll also be poor as hell, which means that you'll have a hard time training your party while in the meantime healing it, buying new stuff and potions, identifying loot, etc. And then, half way from the end, you'll have not to care about money anymore since you'll have a good 100 k that will never be spent.But don't be fooled: money is one of your problems at first, but not the only one. Money will not buy you extraordinary items that can save your♥♥♥♥♥♥ It will help, but it is not the solution to all your problems. Exploration is much more rewarding than shopping, and as soon as two of your party members will be equiped with fine stuff, things will get easier. A few relics later and you'll be able to deal enough damage to cyclops. Yeeha!Then, there's magic. Remember the title, Might & Magic? Right, you'll need both. All the time. You'll need healing all the time, and above all, good warding spells. With good loot and a good spellcasting timing, you can take on almost any mob - if you're lucky. Yes, luck counts a lot. On the good side, it allows you to do critical damage. On the bad side, so it does for monsters. So you might litteraly obliterate a monster to 10% of its health, then it will do a beautiful critical strike and kill two party members in one blow. And they will not benefit from the experience gained from the fight...Now, should you reload or deal with it and visit a temple ASAP? It's all up to you. You can try again until only your party makes huge amounts of damage, or play fair. You can think hard about a specific puzzle's logic and finally understand how it works, or you can try any combination until the damn chest opens. You can take notes (real notes, on paper) or look for answers on the internet. Play fair and suffer a lot or play safe and... suffer a lot, but a bit less.This game rewards people who like exploring, and who are willing to come back to the same place they died a dozen times before just to see if now, it might be ok. And yes! It opens a new area. Now I can die again! Oh God, now I remember how loud I yelled at my computer in 1994, and why. And I also remember why I kept on playing. Damn, it's good.BUT PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE LOADING TIMES.			"

												This game is a monument to shoddy, half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game design.  It's badly programmed, horribly optimized, and it runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥on even the best computers.  The voice acting is lousy, the plot is erratic and, frankly, uninteresting.  The pacing is completely uncontrolled and the game does a terrible job of telling you where to go so you will likely frequently wander into enemies far too strong for you.  This is complemented by a battle system that makes it impossible to flee if you come into contact with an enemy you cannot defeat.  Oh, and there are a ton of annoying little bugs that Ubisoft has no solutions for, beyond ""Try restarting the game.""  Top it off with Uplay DRM as the cherry on the♥♥♥♥♥♥sundae.So with all of that said, why in the world am I recommending it?  Well, because despite all that garbage, I still had fun with it, and still played it to completion.  I consider myself a pretty harsh critic, so the fact that the game somehow kept me playing in spite of its innumerable faults is pretty commendable.  If you like grid-based, turn-based dungeon crawler RPGs (E.G. Legend of Grimrock, more recently, or the older Might and Magic or Eye of the Beholder games), AND you're very bored, AND the game is on sale, you may consider giving this one a try.In the absence of that perfect trifecta you may want to let this one slide, because you have to really love dungeon crawlers to stick with this one.

The only somewhat decent thing I can say is that the game is fairly large for its price... but that really just means the pain lasts longer.If you want an old school-style grid-based dungeon crawler that was properly brought into the modern age, go play Legend of Grimrock.

												Might & Magic X - Legacy, is a undeniable example of how a company can get a franchise wrong when rebooting it. MMX is a first person grid turn based dungeon crawler, unlike the free roaming open ended  gameplay of the previous 4 entries (that where created about a decade ago). As the 10th entry into the series, you will find the developer, and publisher Ubisoft, has decided to ignore why the games series previous and fantastic improvements (9 is the exception) by making this a turn based mess. Essentially, the game series went from what I considered the best of the FPS/RPGs (if love casting and shooting while keeping distance and strafing) to a slow paced stratedy game that is relitivly unplayable. I will state this, I can beat MM 6, 7, & 8 by using ANY team that was pre-built for me. If someone wanted to make me a team with 4 clerics, I will figure it out. The previous games where not only slightly forgiving, but the level of satisfaction when you take down massively powerful enemies with fast thinking, running and gunning, and guiding monsters made the previous games some of the greatest power trips a game has ever made me feel. Turning God mode on and cheating is boring, becoming godlike and DECIMATING MASSES OF THOSE WHO HAVE WRONGED YOU EARLIER ON IS FANTASTIC! I loved mowing down fields of enemies in the previous games while keeping a steady radius of death just steps away from me. There is nothing even close to that level of enjoyment with Might and Magic X - Legacy. Its just a slow grid grind of posturing.To put it blunt, with MMX, if you do not build a ""perfect team"" you won't get past the first dungeon. There feels like no character growth, because the game postures you to always be the weakling, until you hit the threshold of level/area and then it becomes stupid easy, and ultimately boring. I am fine with grid based games... for smaller devolpers. Legend of Grimrock is a great game that is cheap, about 1 gig of space, and is fast paced for a grid dungeon game. MMX is a slow paced, combat heavy, character dependent mess. With the team that Ubisoft has, I would hope for better; and rather than deliver what fans of the game series want ( I am sorry, but citing the people that only like the enteries from 1995 and back is just BS, as GOG clearly pushes 6-8 on their website because IT SELLS MORE AND HAS A BIGGER FANBASE) they just flippantly push out this game and tell us that it is how the series will be going. Someone should be fired for the decision. It takes what could have been the next entry into a fantastic series, spaghetti codes it, and makes it a boring, buggy, unplayble mess.I want to like this game, and I have tried to like this game. With the previous ones, as I said before, you do not really need a guide to do anything, you kinda just figure it out. With this entry to the series, it breaks gameplay to have to look up optimal character builds so you can beat a spider. It kills gameplay when the game is so combat driven that any choices for character creation that are whimsicle are rebuked with a re-roll. It breaks gameplay when you have to look up strategies to beat normal characters, or optimize for each dungeon. I like strategy, to a point; but there is a point where dying without learning how to overcome a scenario, unless I consult other material, takes me out of the game outright. And thats what this game feels like, is something that was overburdened with a developer who kept saying ""make it more old school"" well I am sorry but when they did that in the 90's we had to either figure it out or buy a guide, since then the internet has made it so that making games like this is not fun when you know that the solution is a search away. It lacks gameplay, it exhausts my graphics card for some reason (and graphically, this shouldn't be that intense of a game) and overall it just makes me want to play the previous and far supirior games. Even if you like this style of gameplay, there are better and much more satisfying games like this (Legend of Grimrock is a perfect example) that won't hurt your budget, and won't give money to a developer that obviously disregards its fanbase.

												I was set on not recommending this during my first few hours of gameplay. It didn't feel like a bad game, but also didn't feel like a good one either. After Legend of Grimrock it just felt so much more shallow and silly and ... just.. not as good.I still don't think it can compare to Legend of Grimrock, but after having put many more hours into it - it grew on me enough to give it a good review.Why is it not as good? Well, the story is not as enticing, the puzzles are less interesting, the upgrades are less exciting, too much clutter loot, and overall not as well-designed. It's designed well enough, but there are plenty of large areas that are there just to waste your time moving through them, while they actually bring no benefit to the game (no monsters to fight, no secrets to find).But despite all that the game still offers plenty of enjoyment. Combat system is turn based, so you have time to control every character without rushing.Leveling up is rewarding, it is possible to make a badass character who can take regular-enemy life bars out in 3-4 hits.There are plenty of spells to cast, weapons to use, armors to put on. There are rings, amulets, potions, buffs, debuffs.Level up system is decent, with both attribute and skill increases.Not every class/race has access to the same tiers of skills, but a lot of them have access to most skills in general, which is nice. For example a mage may not start with a dodge or crossbow skill or be able to advance to a grandmaster level of those, but he can still get to an Expert level.Towns are pretty large with many NPCs, (if you're into that. I'm not, but i appreciate the effort developers put into this.)All in all it's not an amazing game, but it still deserves a positive review because it is well made, and it is actually kind of fun (the battles anyway. i'm all about the battles.) And after you've played through Legend of Grimrock three times and unlocked all the achievements and just don't want to play it anymore but still want something like it - Might and Magic X one is an acceptable substitute.

												If you love Migth and Magic games, this is right in line for you.  What I really enjoy about Might and Magic X is that you need to really pay attention to play it well.  That might not sound good, but I was tired of games that give you a marker for every quest and tell you where exactly you ned to be.  You won't get that here.  You can shape and mold your characters into whatever you want.  The graphics are much better than the previous Might and Magic games as well, so that's a bonus.  This isn't meant to be a crazy free roam game, it's turn based for the most part with a mix of free roam.			"

												I love it, a bit like Legend of Grimrock.While I love it however, I agree with pretty much everything said on the Zero Punctuation video about it, I suggest you watch that. Also. Look up a tutorial or something. Maybe I should make one. This game doesn't really tell you what to do... in any way shape or form... at all.Also, I've played this for near to 200 hours. But only about 30 of those was with the sound on. Music is nice, but at character creation you will notice a choice between Heroic and Cynical... Your characters make comments very bloody often.""Someone forgot to take a bath."" ""Hope some brigands attack, crushing skulls helps orcs to sleep!"" ""Wait... what's that... aaaah it's nothing, hah!"" I do recommend this game though. I do warn that it does however require UPlay. I have no ill will toward UPlay. But I do know that a lot of people have issues with it. You have been warned... unless you didn't read this far, then it's your own damn fault, sorry.Anyway, some starting tips.Buy a cure poison spell as soon as you save enough coins. (Shop is North West of the first town. Near the exit, past the well.)Have a designated healer. Bit of a no brainer, it does help a lot.Level high fire magic early. A dwarven Rune Priest is highly recommended, they do pretty awesome damage! There's a pretty tough earth elemental boss that's quite difficult if you aren't prepared, and Fire magic is the best way to do that.Destiny = Dexterity.When you level up, there'll be a little button next to your character portrait. Click on that to spend attributes / Skill Points. Don't be afraid to explore, but dangerous caves are what they tell you, dangerous. Come back to them later!TL:DR. I was bored, Figured I'd review a game... wait, this is too honest for a TLDR. Hope you buy it, and if you do, I hope you enjoy it!			"

												I think the mixed reviews status are a bit unfair to MMX, since it is getting bad reviews mostly because of Ubisoft♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥games by idiotic DRM and weird useless stuff.I am a fan of the old Might and Magic (especially 6,7,8)  and Hereoes of Might and Magic 2 and 3 games.This is a good game. Not an awesome game, not average, it is just a good game you will enjoy playing. It is not a might and magic sequel, so if you expect the same thing as MM 6,7,8 was, you might get surprised. I was and it was a pleasant surprise.The game is long enough and has decent replayability. Graphics are nice, sounds and music okay. Story is just perfect for such grid dungeon (or forest?) crawler.So, I recommend this game. Maybe not for the full price, but when discounted, I absolutely recommend it.Oh yeah, one more thing - I had to use pen and paper for some puzzless and riddles while playing this game. After 20 years.Edit: I bought it with Might and Magic 6. Of course, not working on W10. Ubisoft, of course, does not give a damn about players, just milking and milking. Lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, I am surprised, they did not update MM6 to use DRM and Ucrap registration. Also, Ucrap does stops giving you points for achievemnts on MMX, so you cant buy bonus stuff.So, MM X is a great game, Ubisoft is still a band of incompetent greedy and lazy jerks.			"

So my party needs ~20 rounds to kill whatever comes along. And I am playing on the ""easy"" level. You cannot even ""farm"" up your characters with easier enemies as the monster do not respawn.

												Best CRPG released in a long time.  Has everything* I could ask for in a fantasy role playing game, namely: good character creation, party-based, interesting skills/spells to choose from, challenging combat that requires strategy, intuitive inventory system, shops that sell powerful items to save up for, a wide world to explore, lots of leveling up, and most importantly, with meaningful choices at level up regarding how to invest your skill points.  As with any good RPG, there's always more one could ask for.  There are some spells from previous M&M's that I miss (Water Walk, Fly), and I always the horseshoes.  Also, playing on Warrior mode, I'm finding my gold resources seems severely diminished since the EA.  I can't afford hardly any spells/potions/weapons.  All my gold goes towards the most crucial spells and Expert trainings.  Would rather the difficulty just relate to combat, and not less gold/higher prices (if that is the case).  And at charcter creation, I would LOVE to have a few more choices of portraits - that way you could make a party of 4 female elves that all look different, just for example. =)But all-in-all, a very fun, addictive game with great replay value.

												Great old school dungeon crawler RPG. Character progression feels good, gameplay is a bit simple but I found it very satisfying. Creating a team with synergy is very satisfying. I rarely actually finnish RPGs if they take too long, but MMX had satisfying character progression up to the end.Pros:-Character progression & choices are meaningful.-Simple but satisfying combat.-Most classes feel very uinique (casters can feel samey until you get your promotion).-Good throwback to the older days.-RIDDLESCons:-Occasional bug that makes you have to load, quicksaving made that problem minor.-Building your character can be frustrating if a skill trainer is hidden or not available until late in the game.-Some encounters feel much harder than others & can be quite frustrating.Hopefully this genre of RPG will start making a comeback.

But let's take a small look at the title. Might & Magic X. This is supposed to be a SEQUEL to VI, VII, VIII and IX. In other words, I expect something better that keeps innovating the genre. Why the *#$&* they went back to IV, V is beyond me. As if VI (1998) is not retro enough to duplicate. Me? I started playing the series because of VI. I loved it. I could never get myself to play I - V because it's not what I was used to. VI - IX had open worlds to explore and do quests at your own pace. Going from one side of town to the other did not take take 10 freaking minutes like it does with this game. So, the game is grid-based and I started to accept that. But even if I did, the system here is done horribly. Everything, from the controls to the animations is very ackward. You can only cast damaging spells or shoot arrows when you're enemies are in a straight line! My D&D board game allows me to shoot monsters diagonally, and that game does not even have a game engine! It's a board with some plastic figures on it and it functions better than the almighty M&MX. Graphics are terrible. Every single human being and monsters look like plastic. I can make better animations shooting Stop Motion with my Lego-sets using a iPhone 1. The levels, towns and dungeons are poorly designed. And to add insult to injury, the graphics suggest that there are things to click on. Which is impossible, because most of the objects that seem clickable are out of range. Grid-based. Great Idea. I can write an entire book about why I am disappointed with this game. It's pretty ironic that if you purchase this, you get the best Might & Magic game; Might & Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven. I would recommend buying the older games on gog.com and leave this game alone. Wait, I forgot to say something positive about the game. The music is nice.			"

												It looks nice and has a kind of a classic M&M feel to it, but I got lost mid game walking around finding nothing to do and noone to kill even. This non intuitive gameplay sucks, now I have to resort to walkthroughs which I haven't done in about 15 years.The map needs to have names of the regions on it cuz that blank map got me confused. The markers could use several colors for them and many more improvements this game could certainly use.Still I recommend it, but preferably at a discount cuz this game is pretty much abandoned by the developer: no dlc beyond the first one and no more patching.

												Ehhh the game is really fun first 10 hours. Next 5 it's okay, then it just gets so dull that it becomes unplayable. Story is very slow and pretty much dull, gameplay gets very repetitive, and general game, level design etc. seem alright at first, but then you see it's just lazy as hell. It's close to being as good as the best installments, but it merely a mediocre one. Although if you are a fan of both the series and the world you will still have a fair amount of fun with it. Sadly it's ubisoft, so after a while you will see that there is not enough game in gameplay. I mark it as positive but it barely meets the requirements. About 6/10 if I would have to express this on a scale even though I don't normally do this. Just to point out how slightly is meets the ""do you recommend this game"" Yes tag.			"

												Pros: If you're an old-timer longing for the good old days of min-maxing stats/skills for a party (and you don't play JRPGs for various reasons), this will be the game for you. Your gameplay rewards will mostly come from seeing your carefully-planned party composition hit its stride around the mid-levels, when your bladesinger has enough stats to chunk mobs for big satisfying criticals. This game will mostly appeal to RPG fans born in the very early 80s or older, since it's a throwback to the Xeen/Terra style of gameplay. It includes all the quirks of those previous games such as tile movement, turn-based combat, random stat-increasing barrels and high-level party-oneshotting dragons in the midst of a lowly bandits and wolves. Full shameless nostalgia. Cons: It's still buggy. Your party can get stuck around teleporters, music and ambient sounds can loop forever, and some events don't trigger. Also many parts are under-developed. Armor system is underbaked (you can finish the game with your warrior wearing cloth), a couple spells are placeholders (eg liquid membrane), some classes are more fleshed out than others, tanking is near-useless, there is an overdependence on specific spells (eg Celestial Armor, Burning Determination and Whispering Secrets) which make or break your game.

												Old school dungeon crawler. Turn based combat. Good for a relaxing game of nostaligic party based monster bashing, leveling, and loot collecting if you are into that kind of thing. I finally made it to act 2 on my 7th try playing hardcore mode (meaning I start over on a total party kill.). It is a difficult, unforgiving game (at least on warrior mode). It won't hold your hand or give you quest arrows to follow. That is a quite refreshing change, having to explore and find things rather than mindlessly being spoon fed content.After investing several hours, I began to realize that this game is VERY hard to beat, especially if you like to play hardcore mode, and blind without knowledge of the game. It's not possible to retreat unless you use a very specific obscure party build. So to play this hardcore you almost need to be spoiled in advance. So for the record I still think it's a great game, but it can't scratch that Dead is Dead game itch without some serious tweaking for me.			"

												There was a time when most games did not hold your hand. They told you to put your hand on the table, then they smashed it with a hammer and laughed because you kept it out there while they raised the hammer back. MMX put you  out in a world, and expects you to find your way around it. Role playing games do not get too much better than this one. Great character progrssion, quest design and a world that really is something to explore.			"

												Ok, being a fan of the Might and Magic games, I felt completelly abandoned... MM9 was a disaster... so rushed, so bugged that sold poorly. So poorly that it was the main responsible for 3DO's demise.Then, 10 years later, they announce a new Might and Magic. Its not made by Jon Van Caneghem, and its OBVIOUSLY not made by 3DO. Still... is this the  game I've waited 10 years for? Short answer is NO. Where's our open wold? All MMs featured fully open worlds, where the only barrier iour courage to tackle stronger enemies. In MMX, you have to clear one area to be able to go to the next!Then there's my second issue with this game: where's the enemy respawn? All MMs have some form of enemy respawn, which enables you to develop your characters as much as you want! Remember the enemy lairs in Might and Magic 3-5, that if you don't destroy, the area will repopulate within a few mounths? Its GONE in here.  No respawn means that there's a cap to how much you can level in each area, and considering how linear this game is, this means that if a boss is too tough for you, you can't just go to another areas to level up some more!The developers PPROMISSED respawning enemies, and thats one of the reasons I bought the early access. Then again Ubisoft also promissed a real modular game, yet never said that we need to BUY a 1,500 dollars software to be able to create MODs for it! They also never said that 32-bit users would get a capped experience. Heck, the early access worked perfectly on 32-bit OSs. Why they changed it?On the other hand, not everything in this game is bad. The graphics (if you have a 64-bit OS) are actually decent, with some beautifull landscapes and amazingly animated enemies. The sounds are great: sound effects are realistic, the voices are actually good, and each place has some very realistic ambient sounds (birds when you are near a forest, loud people when you are in a town, etc).The gamepay is surprinsingly good. They decided to make this game very old-scool, so they opted to use tile-based movement and turn-based battles. I like this in RPGs, it gives the game a more strategic feel. Most boss battles actually requires you to THINK before acting, and if you just randomly attack, you'll die in VERY few turns. The interface, on the other hand, isn't as limited as most games of our youth. While you can still use your spellbook to select spells and abilities, now you can use a very handy numbered action bar, and activate each action with the numeric keys. Believe-me it helps. There's even the ability to set map notes, something that we would LOVE back in the day. The game isn't very long though. Its one of the shortest MMs (only MM8 feels shorter than this one), but don't expect to beat it in a few hours. We are looking at a 40+ hours journey here, more if you select the hardest mode (yeah, you have a difficulty selector in here).Anyway, this isn't as good as I was expecting. The lack of enemy respawns makes mea bit angry, and the fact that they decided to break the game into acts is ridiculous! Still, this is a 7/10 game. Really, I'm a bit disappointed at this game, and i'm a HUGE fan of World of Xeen and Isles of Terra... Still, its a worthy game to carry the Might and Magic name.Now, lets just hope the modding community can fix this game, right?The good:+Graphics are actually good, and the sounds are amazing;+The turn-based and tile-based gameplay is back, and its great!!+Gameplay is great;+The classes are varied and nice to use;+The enemy models are very detailed, and have a very smooth movement;+Great dungeons, some are actually quite big;+The enemies actually look nice.The bad:-Graphics aren't as good if you use a 32-bit OS, and the voices are GONE.-The classes are not well balanced;-The game starts out too linear, and has been divided into ACTs;-There's NO enemy respawn, not even optional like the older MMs.			"

												The mixed reviews put me off this game for a long while, but I finally picked it up and was pleasantly suprised. I'm a die-hard fan of Might and Magic VI, which I've gone back and played several times over the years. This installment lacks the scope of VI, but captures the spirit of it.Planning and developing your party is the main highlight, despite a few minor issues with how skills are distributed across classes. Although there are party combinations that are clearly ""better"" if you are optimizing, there are lots of possibilities that are doable and fun, even by just using different skill distributions amongst the same classes. You have to accept that you can't get everything you want on every character or every party, since there is an effective limit on the experience you can gain in the game. This can be frustrating, but forces you build more intelligently and make sacrifices to get the skills you want. The game itself is somewhat linear and lacking in the open-world feel of other Might and Magic games. The story isn't very deep or compelling, similar to Heroes VI. The grid movement and turn-based combat are off-putting at first, but they ultimately created interesting opportunities for tactical gameplay. Combats are often repetitive although there are some variations in tactics based on the specific enemies. After beating it on the normal difficulty, I immediately played through again with a new party on the ""Warrior"" difficulty, which provided a fun challenge that felt like a different game, at least in the early going. Even after beating it again, I still find myself brainstorming different party combinations I want to try.Overall, not an ""amazing"" game, but quite enjoyable, with good replayability. Certainly better than the average review indicates. Now I'm primed to go back and play VI again. "

No smooth movement mode (grid movement only). No running from battles. No tactical movement during battles. No rogue or rogue-like skills. The list goes on and on.

												I effing love turn-based RPGs. I also love any game where I can create my own party and try to make their unique skills work together into a harmonious vision. Also I love exploration. Also dungeon-crawling, especially the type that rewards searching walls and floors for traps and other dangerous things.Might and Magic X - Legacy contains all those things.Don't buy it.It's like everything I like about the genre has been taken, then subverted to make it ♥♥♥♥♥♥.There is a turn-based system, but the turn-based movement ceases to work when in combat. There is no maneuvering once enemies are in melee range. You can never take a tactical withdrawl or move to bottleneck your foes. There is no party formation, so your characters stand in a line up front. This is not Grimrock, where the people at the back of your party are mostly vulnerable to attacks from foes that have specifically flanked you. This is Might and Magic, where your unarmored mages hurl themselves in front of every stray arrow or blade they can find, as though their torso posessed by the ghost of a weapon collector.You can, however, make your own party. I meticulously used all four available races (Orc, Human, Dwarf and Elf) to make what I thought was a balanced party that would have unique skills that complemented each other. A true adventuring party, if you will. It turns out what I wanted basically didn't matter, because the level of party customization in the game is basically like paint over a piece of cardboard. There are 'classes', but they just determine how far your skills can advance, which has no bearing on the early game. They have 'advanced classes' that are unlocked at some point, but just one per class, so really it's just the inevitable progression of your class' skills. No class starts with a special ability that makes it unique. Only advanced classes get those. So your Mercenary (a might-based fighter) that's dabbling in Air Magic is -just as good at it- as the fully-specialized Freemage. Wait, you say that the Freemage is more heavily invested in the Magic attribute and is better with magic? Yeah, 8% better at the start. Hot stuff. That might increase by a whole 8% per level, too! All the while you're completely neglecting your mage's ability to stay alive by investing in Vitality or Perception, so really it's closer to 2% per level.Basically your meticulously planned party is going to be ineffective, because the game doesn't really want you to experiment with the parts of the skill system that you like. Want to invest in Warfare (a fighter's equivalent to casting spells) and have a battlefield commander? ♥♥♥♥ you. Now your fighter can't hit anything to save his life, and you need to land your Challenge attacks to draw the attention of enemies, who will then proceed to mangle your fighter that didn't invest heavily in their armor skills.Basically there are no good decisions, and that seems to be how the game likes it.Monster fighting is tiresome. The earliest quests have you dealing with spiders that poison you with their basic attacks. Poison never goes away without a (fairly expensive) antidote or specific spell that nobody can start with. So any of your characters that get poisoned by this frequent attack will inevitably go 'unconscious' without immediate medical attention. Being unconscious doesn't clear the poison. The poison is eternal. My Dwarf Defender didn't recover from poison after resting for twenty-four hours. Or ever. Not without help. So 'camping' to tend to your wounds just refills your health bars and then you watch them rapidly deteriorate from the poison that never disappeared. It takes about six 'steps' in game for people to keel over dead after getting up from their nap.What.Monsters don't get any better. Naga in the second dungeon (the first after the 'tutorial' with the spiders) dual-wield and attack twice per turn, gaining more damage if they hit with the first swing. They regularly one-hit your spellcasters and cannot be provoked into attacking anyone wearing armor without spamming 'challenge' attempts, which costs mana and rarely lands. Naga priestesses spam ice spells just as strong as the party's, but don't suffer from mana conservation. Everything crits. You guzzle mana and health potions every three rounds. I don't want to say 'unrealistic' when talking about my fantasy dungeon crawlers, but my god...I don't even...I hate to compare this game to Grimrock (which was brilliant), because it doesn't feel fair. Grimrock was a labor of love for people that love this genre. Legacy was a kick in the nuts trying to cash in on nostalgia with a low price tag and promises it doesn't deliver on. Exploring dungeons doesn't have player attentiveness rewarded by secret passages and vast loot. Instead, your characters bark out their discovery of things, waiting for you to mash your face against every nearby wall until something glows and you open a new passage with the spacebar.Riveting.Traps are mandatory. Often they just sit on a required pathway, and almost always just spawn more monsters. Usually in flanking positions. Even if you detect a trap your only choice is to mash your face into it, or, in rare circumstances, walk around the otherwise empty room.Loot is a mess of +2 to damage and +5 to some nebulous resistence stats. It's also completely random and there's no such thing as farming, so if the wrong loot drops for your party...♥♥♥♥ you. I guess you can reload, save-scumming for better loot, but is that something we really want to encourage?I've been told the game opens up, both in terms of exploration and tactics, but after my first party (which I was a fool to put on the harder of the two difficulties, which made it nearly unplayable) couldn't pass the second dungeon, I don't think I'm going to make it there. My second party has the exact same problem in the exact same dungeon, you see. On the 'much easier' difficulty.Developers and veterans will probably giggle because someone can't handle their hardcore game. Their perogative. I'm still not going to reccomend this steaming mess to anyone.Slow, unsatisfying, tiresome. Avoid it.			"

												I had been a massive fan of the Might & Magic franchise when I was younger, and had been disappointed by the Might & Magic 9. After hearing that they were going to try and create M&M 10 with a retro feel I was hoping that they would rekindle some of the spark that M&M 1 – M&M 8 had.Unfortunately, this had been another disappointment due to poor and confusing combat/spell systems, character development that is quite unforgiving and leaves me feeling that choice is an illusion and to get anywhere in the game you need a specific build of character.I felt the limiting of classes to race and the extremely limited choice in character appearance was unnecessary and made the options you had to build a unique character even more obvious. The story telling had been weak and had not been focused on delivering short, clear and easy to follow story line.I struggle to find any saving graces for the series, except the desire to continue the series. In conclusion I wouldn’t recommend this game to any fan of the original Might & Magic series. "

												I've been a Might and Magic fan since the golden days. My personal favorite being Might and Magic 6: The Mandate of Heaven. This game is more of a take of the earlier Might and Magic games (Clouds / Darkside of Xeen). Although it pays homage to Might and Magic through gameplay, most of the familiarity ends there. That's not to say, however, that I didn't really enjoy this game.Combat is turn-based. Character customization leaves something to be desired. The classes are unbalanced and vaguely described, you won't really know what the classes are capable of until much later in the game; and by then it's too late and you'll be stuck with a couple of characters that are far less capable/effective as others, so I recommend doing some google-research on the class-combos before going all in.If you have never tried the Legend of Grimrock series, I would buy those first, as I think they offer a better tribute to the genre.It's a fun throwback to the grid-system, dungeon crawler RPG. If you can get it on sale and you're an oldschool PCRPG'er, then I would recommend this game to you.			"

												I have played Might & Magics since 6. and I must say that this game takes a REALLY long step back. they revamped graphics but cut out LOTS of content. Also this game feels very segmented and liniar. in a lot of cases you have to kill all enemy creatures in the area so just so you can level enough to defeat the creature thats blocking your way to the next area. M&M used to be a lot more tactical and skill driven. Now, I am not so sure. Story like is a Meh as well7/10			"

												Great classic RPG, perfect sense of continuity and progression. The puzzles and quests are laid out in a very organized fashion. Combat is tense and hair raising. This stands as my very favorite of the noted Might and Magic series, and I have played them all. Very highly recommended, a must buy if you have any interest in RPG's at all!!!!     15/10!!!			"

												I played the heck out of this game. If you're looking for something to scratch that old school first person Wizardry Style RPG itch this game will do nicely. It's not the most polished experience but it's very addictive if you're a fan of the genre and the truth is, there just aren't that many games that fit this niche these days, then this is a must have, so go for it!

												I didn't play the other MM games so I can't compare it to previous MM titles. Only 22 hrs in but I sat down at midnight Friday and now I HAVE to quit playing because of work tomorrow (Mon). I slept a little somewhere in there but ate my meals at the computer and only got up to pee. My point is....I was gone... totaly engrosed in this world. I guess you can say I like it. :)  To be honest, I did try it many, many moons ago, but this time I gave it a REAL fair shot and now I'm hooked.Will others like it? Dunno. I see some reviews which are bad, but all of those reviews are from peeps with little time in the game. That was me the first time. But now, ... I LOVE THIS GAME!!....and here's why:Animations         superiorTactics                great if you prepare correctly, bothersome if you try to spend valuable gold for an additional +2.....World                  interesting ... readings in lore are short ...which can be a good thing in a crpg.Fun                      it's got that ""feeling"" I don't know. theres a French term for it but my French is limited to Fries and toast.Atmosphere        Really fantastic...banging sounds in dungeons, many diff. birds, wind, sea.......Music                   Pretty good....its no Hans Zimmer, Thomas Bergensen, or Jeremy Soule thats for sure......Player Character Dialogs.....Sucks balls!! Irritatingly repetetive, poorly acted, and poorly scripted. I mean this part of the game is laughably bad. This part of the development team should not have gotten paid AT ALL! The good news is after somrtime in gamee you just stop listening to it.As you read these thoughts, remember despite the repetitive dialogs there is a really fun game in there.8.5/10 "

												DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME FROM STEAM!!!  There is zero customer support and from what I have experienced and read from others attempting to play this game, there is a huge issue with the game getting to the second act.  When you cannot get any further and request a refund, you are denied based on the amount of time you spent attempting to resolve the issue to continue play.  Uplay is no better and tells you there is nothing they can do and you have to contact steam for assistance.  Both companies give you the run around and you are left out the money you already put in to it.  WHAT A RIP OFF!!!  WHAT A JOKE!!!			"

												If you can get past the roughness of the visuals (texture resolutions seem to be aimed for sub 1080p monitors, gui doesn't scale so you have massive texts and buttons on big monitors, some cheap particle spell effects) you can find one enjoyable Dungeon Master -like game. Nice locations, interesting foes, pretty decent combat and character mechanics.One thing they seriously need to adjust / change is how poison works. There are way too many dungeons with poison attack enemies and getting poisoned without potions means death because resting doesn't really heal you from it and you don't have cure spells in the beginning. Antidote potions were easy to come by in the first dungeon as the enemies occasionally dropped them, but in later dungeon you have ranged poison enemies (that also cause poison with melee) and no source of anything to cure it with. A bit frustrating.edit: Apparently you can get cure poison spell with novice level earth magic, but point still stands that poison is really annoying and way too frequent effect in the beginning.I do recommend this game though! Slow first hour, but gets really nice afterwards.			"

												Might and magic 6 and beyond were always my favorite games in the series, never really like the turn-based system of earlier games. However Might and Magic X Legacy is so much fun, that small stuff like that tend to be forgotten. A big thank you to the developers that revived my favorite game series.			"

												I've had a good few hours with game.  No bugs so far.  Running smooth enough. I had a bit of lag at a bridge outside but no where else. Few thingts are different from the older games .  You level on the spot instead of training for exampleCombat is faster then early access from what I can tell from posts on the forum(was deemed to slow). I am playing in warrior mode; not finding it too hard so far, playing with default party..  Button mashing will just get you killed.   You have to put some thought into combat.  you can blow enemy back with one char then root it with other for example witch I found cool.You get out into open world pretty fast and no restrictions as where you can go apart from places were you need water walking etc.  Similar to earlier games.Some items have exact same name but different stats wich can be annoying slightly.Can see enemies but can't just attack em, got to get close enough to trigger battle.  I presume this is intentional.Map could be a bit better so don't have to hover over everything to see whats there; adding note didn't help still had to hover over icons.I see these as minor gripes and don't really take away from my enjoyment.I am glad I purchased game so far and would recommend if you're into the older titles and games like legend of Grimlock, Realms of Arkania remake (it is in a very playable state after many patches)I got a good feeling that I am going to enjoy this and was money well spent so far.Update:Had to strart again because enemies don't respawn and you can run out of money quite easily.In the first act I found that you can't just do quests in any order because you get wasted.  I had done all outside mobs except for w*****  and got to boss in tower.  I just can't survive long enough because I used me potions up and no way to get gold.  So I can't last it out using hp regen.  Thats the only mob left in act one plus 2 wraiths.  Can't do them either cause need something that can't afford.I still recommend game but you can quite easily make wrong choices that can basically make it game over.  Respawning enemies would give the option to grind a bit if you did not chose the skills, spells to succeed.  I get were people are coming from when they say it feels like its a bit on rails.  Hope act 2 dosen't give me same feeling.  This is in warrior mode default party.  Don't wanrt to play adventurer mode because people say too easy; can just button mash.Update: With better planning I managed to finish act 1 with no problems at all; with default party on warrior mode.  I've managed to cross the bridge.  Enjoying myself a lot more second time round.  Now I have a better idea of howto make sure I don't end up getting stuffed because I didn't get some must have spells.  I rest now instead of drinking potions during fights.			"

												Review written : 28. January 2014 (5 days after release -expect some bugs to get fixed later on)will add to the review after the release of the first dlcAllrighty, first things first, for those that are curious : this game is not worth the money, it was a massive disappointment for me after spending years waiting for a new might and magic and overall it just feels like a downgraded version of legend of grimrock - the only upgrade being the price of the game - i will go into details below.Also note that you have to use Uplay to start MMX---General Stuff---Settings used : 1600x900 windowed, everything set to high- Game crashes a lot, for me it averaged around 1 crash per hour, sometimes crashing more frequently, sometimes less, depending on where you are in the game. (crashes more frequently at night)- Huge FPS drops, even bigger at nighttime or when using teleporters. MMX goes down to like 1-5 FPS and apparently tries to reload all the trees and other objects in front of you, there are tons of people with that problem in the Ubisoft forums, so it is related to the game, not computer specs (my computer can handle all new games anyways)- Annoying loading times, when loading savegames or quickloading. Can take up to 30 seconds when transitioning in and out of dungeons. (this is most fun when you are trying to navigate the optional dungeon with instant kill traps, leading to a quickload if you make a wrong move)These three points alone ruined the game for me, because it feels like trying to play skyrim on a pentium 3.But let's also take a look at some of the games ""Key Features"" from the store page.Open world Travel through stunning environments, choose which region you want to explore first but be careful, danger is never far off. - This is pretty misleading. Most areas are sealed off at the start and have to be opened with quest items from main quests. for example you can only access around 20% of the world before completing Act 1, around half of the areas can't be accessed before you have the swimming and teleporting abilities.Also, most of the areas accessible are ""sealed off"" by monsters, so if your level is too low, you can not get past them (example : cursed ruin spectres, blackguard mages before karthal), which leads to the area also being inaccessible until you made some level progress via main quest. This makes the game feel rather linear, you can only explore freely if you are nearly done with Act 3 (aka 75% of the game) but at that point you have been to most areas anyways thanks to the main quest.Various quests Discover the sinister plot happening in the Agyn Peninsula, shape its inhabitants' stories, and evolve your party thanks to fun and original quests full of Easter Eggs! - The game has a variety of quests, sure. But are they ""fun and original""? Not really. About 80% of the quests are your basic stuff, ""get item xy"", ""bring item xy to person xy"", ""escort person xy to location xy"", ""visit dungeon xy"". The rest of the quests is pretty fun though, especially the more puzzle related, for example getting asked questions about various locations in the game by a guard (you have to input the answers on your own, no multiple choice) was a neat quest.20+ dungeons Experience fear and claustrophobia in the dark heart of classic dungeons, and feel vulnerable to attack from all sides while crossing open landscapes. - While this is true, they forgot to add the fact that around half of those dungeons only consist of a single room with a single monster guarding a single chest. Most of the other dungeons are pretty generic, however there are also some exceptions, like the Enigma Tower or the Tomb of Terrors that are really well made and fun.More than 60 creatures and 6 unique bosses Face cunning foes in turn-based combat and adapt your fighting skills to the mightiest creatures.- The ingame Beastiary shows that there are around 140 enemies in total in the game (i only found 130 by visiting every location in the game, so the rest is probably for the upcoming dlc) which sounds like a good amount of enemies. However, the developers counted every single variation of those enemies as a new creature. Lets take an example to make it more clear. Throughout the game you will fight a variety of Humans, of which there are also some swordsman. In the beginning you fight against Militia(1) and Elite Militia(2), afterwards against Militia Captain(3), Elite Militia Captain(4), and even later against Black Guard(5), Elite Black Guard(6), Black Guard Captain(7) and Elite Black Guard Captain(8). They all look the same and have the same abilities, only difference are the health, attack and defense stats, but the game counts them as 8 different creatures, so you can imagine how many ""different"" enemies you will have to face. Bosses are no exception, most of them just look like random normal enemies with a red name (Luke for example looks exactly like a Militia)MODDING KIT Create your own map and mods to express yourself, design the game you want to play and share your creative vision with the Might & Magic X – Legacy community!- Here they just forgot the most important information : to use the ModKit you have to buy Unity3D which comes at the small price of 1500$---Gameplay---The Difficulty Level of the game is extremely broken.The beginning of the game is challenging and somewhat luck based, with crits being able to oneshot mages and rangers, with you not being able to cure crowd controls reliably and with enemies dodging and blocking like there is no tomorrow.Ofcourse this also depends a lot on your party composition, but it gets easier after some level ups. In fact, if you have a healer - especially the druid - and just max out his heal (earth magic) everything becomes a piece of cake.With both of the druids healing spells healing you for absurd amounts every turn, for 4 turns, you can take on as many enemies as you want, even the final boss can't do♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is just one of the balance flaws that the game offers.Don't have a fire mage? Well ♥♥♥♥ you, this boss will paralyse you and only fire magic can cure it in the early stages of the game. Don't have a dark magician? Well ♥♥♥♥ you again, you are not gonna find secrets because only dark magic can detect those. (you can buy scrolls for that, but they only last 50 turns and are rather expensive early on) Have an archer? Well ♥♥♥♥ you as much as you want, but the bow is absolutely useless in this game, since enemies will just spawn in melee range every time. Good thing you can also skill daggers on an archer. Oh, daggers are the most broken weapon in the game, being able to dual wield them and getting 3 attacks per turn per dagger will 2 or 3 shot every boss later in the game when you have elemental daggers.tl;dr = Difficulty level and class balancing is terribleAlso Side Note : You can sometimes even accept quests a second time after doing them, yup nice bug. example : get a doctor from village a to village b, afterwards get him some reagents to fix someone up. quest done. go to his house in village a, woops suddenly he is here again, giving you the same escort mission again.---Story---The Story could not be more casual (spoiler ahead) A guy helps you when you arrive at the peninsula and later on it will go like ermahgerd, plot twist, he is a demon and the final boss of the gameThere is basically no character development, they all feel like puppets saying the same♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over again,so you will probably stop caring about the story after the first act.---Rest of the Review---Character limit has been reached, so if you want to read the rest of the review, going into detail about Atmosphere, Sound, Graphics and Gamesize follow this link to pastebin : http://pastebin.com/CL4DnM35 "

Posted: April 24, 2014
												Review of Might and Magic X: LegacyWhat must first be said is that this is not going to be your average run of the mill rpg, the designers of this game has made it a somewhat old-school type game, and what that means is that the game will not hold your hand and lead you through it. This can be surprising and frustrating as you sometimes wander around aimlessly, having possibly missed some small detail that means that you are now on the wrong path. Since the name of the game is indeed 'Legacy', maybe we should have come to expect this and be completely ok with it, but I think it still needs to be said that the lack of descriptions of where to go in this game can be a problem. This problem can be more or less immediately rectified however, as long as you are willing to alt tab from the game to google, which is something that I personally ended up doing multiple times, even though I would consider myself somewhat of a veteran gamer.The main plot of the game is convoluted, as it should be (follows the traditions of the older games), and there is a relatively little emphasis on story, as it should be. Most of what you do in the game is exploring, and fighting. Many npc's however have the option to spill some minor 'gossip' to the player, which is most of the time just random bits of lore of the gameworld. Scattered throughout the world is also many books, which holds a lot of lore of the world, if this is your thing.The characters your party is comprised of are created manually by the player (unless you insist on letting the computer do it for you), and they all have lots of attribute points and skills that needs to be allocated. There is a nice range of depth to the character building in this game, as the 12 classes available all have different levels of potential with different skills. The mage characters can usually level up certain magic skills to the highest level (grandmaster), but also has the potential of leveling up certain weapon skills, armor skills, and passive defense skills. This well functioning skill system works together with your attribute system to give the player quite a lot of customization options for his party. It essentially *succeeds* in making the player feel like they are the one who created this team, as opposed to having few options and feeling like you are playing a non-rpg. The games skill and attribute system is sufficient, and well expected as it follows the traditions of the older Might and Magic titles. But that doesn't mean that it is fresh, or innovative. It also isn't balanced very well. The armor skills are shown to be very lackluster once you understand the games mechanics for example.The game is entirely grid based. This is a design choice that has huge implications for gameplay, but it is an intrinsic part of the experience, and there is nothing to be done about it now. The entire game is built around this, and as such the environments of the game has the probability of looking quite odd and unrealistic, if you compare it to Skyrim for example. The world is also quite small, it would only take about 3 minutes to run through the length of the entire overworld map (once you have killed all the enemies, and opened everything). This is not because the game is small or short, but because of how compressed everything is, but this is a good thing most of the time, as otherwise there would have been an enormous amount of walking for you - that's a promise. The way the dungeons are built in this game screams 'gameplay' over 'realism', and thankfully so. Maybe it doesn't make any sense that the governor of a peninsula is living in a castle that effectively looks like a labyrinth? But it makes for fun adventuring, so I am pleased.The main focus of the game could be said to be fighting, and fighting is done in a turn based tactical manner. You get to make one action with each of your characters during your turn, such as casting spells or attacking with weapons, (but this hardly has to be said I hope). You will encounter many enemies that will give you a run for your money, and I hope you will welcome the challenge. There has been a couple of posts both on Steam and on Ubisofts forum of players complaining about not being able to progress because their party is too weak. There is the hypothetical possibility that you might gimp your characters to the point of not being able to continue. But one must understand that this is a necessity in a game if you want freedom for the player to design their own party in meaningful ways, and still pose a challenge.Finally, the game is produced by Ubisoft and requires Uplay to play, which can be a detriment, as most people don't want Uplay to clog up their computer as the millionth ""gamehub service"" program. Having popups that try to direct you to Youtube every time you exit the game is hardly a plus either, but that's something that Ubisoft thinks is a cool thing.Score is a whopping 85/100 for me personally. It's the perfect blend between rpg and strategy, and will probably leave you with a feeling of satisfaction if you are a min-maxing geek like myself. But you have to look past some of the things mentioned earlier in my text to get the most out of it.			"

												So, now that the game is in full, lets get down to the♥♥♥♥♥♥and grits of the game.  What is wrong with it? And what is right with it?  Well.. currently, I am engaging in a full playthrough.  In my first 30 minutes, I discovered that the game seems to require MUCH more system resources than it should for the type of game you are playing.  The game also seems to take several steps BACKWARDS!! in regards to the progress that has been made in the dungeon Crawler genre of games.  It makes a sort of Dated, modern take on a familiar genre that has had leaps and bounds of progress made, 10 years ago.It may get better later... but currently, it clearely shows dated mechanics that I would have expected a company like Ubisoft to invest in improving (IE full voice overs, a fully explorable world) if they actually believed in the project.Currently, SOME of the main quest givers actually speak, and the game moves in a old school (and I mean super old school) grid method which is dated even for the 90s.  The game runs poorly which is honestly unforgiveable.  And last but not least, it just seems limiting in regards to the way you make your party.  That last one is a minor gripe, but I am in a nit picky mood at the time of this review.So what does the game do right?  Well, currently it seems very balanced, and the game is full of lore if you do not mind reading.  The story ties in with a familiar world (thus far) if you have been paying attention to the previous games in the series, and even comes with several nods to those games.  It isn't a terrible game, it could have been much worse, and the game is most certainly playable.  It seems balanced (at the time of the review) and I have yet to encounter a real problem space that I simply could not finish.  I will complain though, that I have yet to discover a way to flee a combat.  Which I find to be in poor taste... there is simply no way I have found to disengage from a fight once something closes the distance etoo you.  So I would suggest to be VERY careful.  Makes you think actually, which is a good thing in a manner of speaking.  Unfortunately, some fights you will not know you can't deal with until you start the fight, so save often.is the game worth getting?  Currently, I am totally torn.  The super fan of this genre is willing to accept even a mediocre title, and invest.  The game itself is not above 30 dollars in charge, but at the same time I am torn to say that you should wait till it goes on sale before picking it up.  Why get a game from a big company, when you can get a great game from a smaller indie company... (go get legend of Grimmrock)  If you are a true blue fan of might and magic, and you want another dungeon crawl to add to your list, then by all means, the game is not unplayably bad.  But just understand, that you are supporting what seems to me, like a cash cow attempt to milk the might and magic license from your friends at Ubi-soft.If the late game is terrible, then I will add to the review, if it is good, I will also add to the review later.  Till then, I will, sort of recommend this game to folks.  Just watch my vids and see if you like what you get.			"

												Spotty textures, limited descriptions, annoying glitches... and yet something about Might and Magic X: Legacy is so very, very Awesome.Thanks to Legend of Grimrock (a game I also recommend and IMHO better than this), there has been a resurgance of grid-based dungeon crawlers. Legacy follows suit and provides hours of singleplayer entertainment that many RPG fans will likely enjoy. While anyone trying out grid-based rpgs first time should try the cheaper and more polished Grimrock first, Legacy will scratch that RPG itch whenever it comes up. If its too much for you now, save it to your wishlist for a future sale.Legacy's combat and character management is where the game really shines. Many of the toughest boss fights are challenging, unique and provide a great sense of accomplishment after bringing them down. You might find yourself reloading a save once or twice as you figure out a bosses mechanics. Even the common enemies can't be taken down with just basic attacks and rightfully punishes players who underestimate their foe. Large variety in classes and skills makes every character level up feel meaningful and potent as you mold your party into your own. You'll find yourself using nearly every skill you acquire, from minor spells like Light Orb or Fire Ward to the warfare skills of your melee classes to powerful grandmaster spells like Thunderstorm. The default party offers a great balance to different playstyles, but there are so many different class/racial combinations its worth building your own unique party, especially if you plan to only make one playthrough.Different scenery and enemies throughout the game offers much needed variety, which the Legend of Grimrock lacks. Dungeons are engaging, fun and filled with secrets; which are found with a perception check rather than the players own cunning and discovery. That said, the developers have wisely taken many of the games puzzles and placed them in ""mysterious crypts"" dotted around the map, rather than amongst the major quests which could serve to only slow the pacing. Even than, the crypts offer excellent items worth trying to get, but by no means necessary to complete the game. Storyline is your typical fanasty affair with an unseen villian who needs stopping, but interesting enough to provide some entertainment.Fantastic RPG specific qualities aside, you will find some pretty horrid textures within the game. Even after changing the options from the main menu (a MUST), the game was filled with some objects and characters that are something you'd expect from 2003. Most of these seem to come from the unit models brought in from Might and Magic Heroes VI, which were likely not optimized or polished for upclose inspection. On the other hand, some charecters are quite detailed. It seems that Ubisoft has tried to spend as little as possible on this title and the wide margin in texture quality shows as a result. I myself have run into a graphic glitch where most of the world area's cities and castles disappeared from view, resulting in me wasting a good 15 minutes trying to find a particular castle, until I figured out what had happened. Thankfully a simple game restart solved the problem. Judging by the forums there are other graphics glitches and some quest breaking bugs, though I haven't run into them myself.Many of the quests also lack enough description which might leave you trying to figure out what exactly your looking for. World map is also painfully simple, providing markers for only the most important cities and main dungeons, yet neglecting to identify individual sections of the map which are often given as your only clue about where to go for a certain quest. You'll also need a pen or pencil once or twice as your party seems to have none of their own for a couple critical details.Might and Magic: Legacy X is a fun addition to grid-based RPGs and I felt was worth the $25, which I luckly didn't have to spend due to the recent Ubisoft sale, though others might consider it too much at its current price. However, it is definitely worth keeping on your wishlist for an appropriate sale or price drop. Those who haven't picked up cheaper RPGs (especially Grimrock) should get those first before putting money in this new title.			"

												With Might & Magic 5 being the first game I ever played on an PC and with being a great fan of the series ever since, I saw the release of this title with a smile and a tear.A smile because I had hopes of a good series to be revived, a tear, because I was afraid of how it might turn out.The latest installment of the Heroes of M&M Franchise kind of depressed me, because it was ""over-optimized"" from my point of view. Reduction of Ressources, Conversion of towns, lack of map dwellings, obvious map patterns and the free skilltree gave me the impression of a very monotonous game, where good improvements like the bosses, an interesting story or the big maps couldn't completly save it for me.But what about Might & Magic X now?I have to admit, when I first saw the screenshots, I was scared off. Partly because of the bad impressions of HoMM mentioned earlier, partly because I saw the reused Models. It made me worry about a cheaply produced game with repitative ressources.However. I was wrong!Right now Im halfway through the game, and it really manages to bring back that positive Dungeon-Crawler-Feeling the past series excelled at. The reused models dont annoy me as much, as I like to watch the fine details on the animations up close, whereas in the far away top-down perspective of HoMM one might have missed a lot. I realize how being able to reuse so much, the developers could focus more on the other aspects of the game, like the gameworld, dungeons and such.(Besides reused ressources actualy being a very sustainable way of game development)The Difficulty ""Warrior"" gives me, a very well challenged game, with a precisly adjusted curve of improving enemy stacks, as well as the obligatory ""come back when you feel ready"" challenges on the way.The skills and abilities are well thought through, and invite you to change your tactics accordingly when fighting different constellations of enemies.Of course, it is less story/decision-driven as The Witcher or Dragon Age and more focused on battles group VS group, but thats just the good old Might&Magic Series for you. And from my point of view, it is a nice addition to the current array of RPGs.One last thing: I do not know about the stability on other systems, but it tends to crash for me. A lot. It started when I entered Act II and since then I crashed ~7 Times with one ""freeze of death"".Luckily a thing you can avoid if you just Quicksave often, and also many crashes seem to happen right after changing a map, after the Autosave is done. Still you gotta have the nerves for it. ;)This is a definite recommendation from me. Buy it, and experience the well done newest installment of a series, which I daresay influenced the path of many a RPG gamer.			"

												I really enjoyed this game.  It has improved substantially since first release.  When I tried the early access, it was very slow and almost unplayable.  But now the graphics look great and performance is very smooth.I hope there will be more of these games.  The best part is character development - there are so many ways to advance.  You have 4 characters, each with skills, attributes, items, artifacts, etc.  The story is not amazing, but it's still fun.  The game world is large and very interesting to explore.			"

												As someone who only played one other game in the series, Might and Magic 8, Legacy feels to me as both a nostalgia trip and a game which tries a bit too much to be similar to previous games in the series to be its own game, but too little to be a remake.The most obvious differences between 8 and Legacy are that the former is semi-turn-based with free movement and the ability to swap out any party member except the leader, while the latter is completely turn-based with grid-based movement and your party is fixed from the start which, as far as I know, is what the series was like up to around the 6th game.The biggest disappointments in Legacy are that the game is significantly more linear than 8, and the world is significantly smaller. A large part of the enjoyment of Might and Magic, to me, was exploring new locations, seeing how quickly enemies can annihilate me, then finding ways to sneak or fly past the enemies and try to acquire the loot they are protecting. However now most enemies you encounter will be roughly as powerful as you are because new towns are unlocked only as you progress through the main quest, as opposed to them all being available from the start, the starter island notwithstanding. And if you do encounter enemies that are more powerful than you, which is either in mini-dungeons that simply have 1 very powerful monster, or, more rarely, on the world map, you may as well simply reload your most recent save, because once combat begins it is impossible to escape, save for perhaps some spell I have not yet discovered.There are also a couple of mechanics which are nearly pointless given how the game is structured, namely the fact that trainers for skills are scattered around the world and buying a ride to another city. In 8 trainers for skills could be in any of the several towns or out in the wilderness, particularly if they're the highest rank trainer, and if you looked and asked around you could generally get to the trainer no matter where he was, because even if he was in the highest-level town, you could simply get a ride there and find the trainer, despite the fact that a single step outside would spell your doom. But since you cannot move on to the next town without completing a number of quests, for balance reasons the trainers are much more cluttered. Nearly every rank 1 trainer is in the starting town, most of the rank 2 trainers are in the second town, and after exploring for about an hour I've found 3 rank 3 trainers pretty close to each other in the wilderness. As a result all that's left of a mechanic that encouraged exploration is the requirement to walk all around town until you find the right house, as well as limiting your skill progression if you haven't gotten far enough through the storyline. In a similar vein, buying a ride to another town is essentially pointless as it only takes a minute or two of walking to cover the distance on foot.I also have a few more minor complaints. There is no tavern card game, which was a great time-waster as well as an interesting way to get some artifacts, and there are barely any traps in any of the dungeons, whereas in 8 nearly half of all chests were booby-trapped and taking one wrong step could lead to ambushes, fireballs or even falling into a pit of snakes.Despite these complaints, I've enjoyed my time with the game so far. While not as much as in the game I played all those years ago, exploring is fun as is slaughtering weaker monsters and barely defeating monsters that are more powerful than you. The grid-based movement, while more restricting, also means that you can't defeat monsters that are significantly more powerful than you simply by kiting them or by flying above them while they gather underneath, vainly trying to reach you. Similarly, while the fact that your party cannot be changed after you start means you can't be as versatile with your group of adventurers, it also means you can't simply cast an invisibility spell at level 10, sneak through a cave full of high-level dragons and recruit a level 50 dragon into your party. It's a different experience to Might and Magic 8, but a fun one nonetheless.			"

												Might and Magic Legacy goes back to the days of RPG youth putting you into a first person perspective, grid and turn based combat with puzzles, riddles, exploration, sidequests, lore and combat all aplenty.The game lasts in the ballpark of 40-50 hours and I enjoyed it the whole way through. You create your party from 4 races with 3 class options for each race, any combination is probably viable on the normal difficulty (Adventurer) however if you play on the warrior difficulty you will want to look into optimizing your party a bit. I completed the game on the warrior difficulty but started over about 10 hours in and remade the party.Combat can be difficult the whole way through the game depending on how much side quest stuff you do, I did virtually everything the game had to offer and the final fight was still a bit of a challenge. If fighting against the random number generator is not your thing this game may not be to your liking - I could have a party member go from full health and shielded to dead in 1 combat round from bad dice rolls.There are some bugs still in the game as of the time of writing this (Graphical slowdown issues at points, Had the last boss bug out during the fight on me to name a few) but they are minor and didn't detract from my opinon of the game much.All in all this is a fantastic RPG and anyone itching to explore a new world, loves turn based combat and wants to actually have to use your brain on occasion I highly recommend the game to.

												Great game if you enjoy the appeal of Ye Olde' dungeon RPGs from the windows 95 era. All the fun without the hassle of floppy disks and mapping everything with a notepad and pencil. The story is great but you really have to pay attention as it can get quite confusing because there is so much to take in. Plays great and looks great, the sounds can get a bit trying at times especially the character emotes. Fairly challenging and can take quite a bit of strategy or if necessary grinding out a few levels. All in all I found it very enjoyable, but I'm a huge fan of this style of game, to the point where I still play Lands of Lore and other such titles on a DOS emulator. For me or other dungeon RPG fans I'd give it an 9/10, for the average player (especially one new to this genre) 7/10			"

												A relaxing and enjoyable game.  Similar in gameplay to some of the previous Might and Magic games as well as Legend of Grimrock.  Unlike Grimrock, you may be locked to a grid, but it isn't a click-fest.  Character skills are are turn-based, and it allows more of a relaxed progression on the game.  I have a toddler and a five year old, and I appreciate a game that doesn't punish me for having to split my attention.The challenge level is good.  Some fights are easy while others are epic slug-fests you feel like you have to pull out all the stops to complete.  If you like turn-based games and/or RPGs, this one is worth a go.			"

												Surprise, surprise, a new Might & Magic in 2014. And it's turn based. And has grid based movement. And is in first person. I had to do a double take, too, after that announcement. Although we had some Japanese games carry on the torch of such RPGs (Etrian Odyssey, Wizardry: Labyrinth of Lost Souls etc.) in recent years, they were fairly combat focused and simple.This here is the real deal. It has (light) puzzles, lore in the form of books, an expansive overworld and multiple cities with shops, NPCs and quests. Character generation and development has a lot of options and you have to make hard choices because there are a lot more skills to develop than there are skill points.The game has two difficulty modes and I played on the easier setting. I think I made the right choice as I felt the challenge was always so that I had to pay attention to enemy weaknesses and positioning but was never totally outmatched besides a few badly balanced battles. Oftentimes, in these ""new old school"" games, you have to go straight to a higher difficulty to get a decent challenge but this just felt right. The game loves to ambush your party from all sides with no escape possible so I think this could get frustrating in a higher difficulty quickly.The main satisfaction in these kind of games comes from getting loot, killing monsters, developing your characters and exploring new areas. I think the game absolutely delivers in these aspects, I almost never was bored in my 40 hours which it took me to beat the game with most sidequests done.The graphics are nice and adequate for the budget they probably had but the performance could be better. Loading times are fairly long, too, for 2013 mid-range game computer hardware with an SSD. I would welcome a Might & Magic XI after this successful revival of an old franchise.			"

If you enjoyed Legends of Grimrock, than you will most probably like this game. Do I recommend this game? Yea, its a good combat tactics game with a few puzzles added in. Did I play it to the end? Yes.			"

Total dissapointment.Graphics: dated, low-resolution textures.Combat: most primitive from the whole serie of Might&Magic, it's turn-based chess game now, you have to win fight before your resources (mana/hp/potions) runs out, resting after each fight, very limited strategic options (compared to others TBS).UI: while it's safficient, there is a feeling of ""lets make it fast"", no quest target, old paper-pen system - explore everything and make notices, ""walking"" around is terrible, running from one part of city to another and then back - long and pretty unenjoyable process, lack of action buttons (only 10, while mage can learn like 50+ spells), melee/ranged attack/defend/mana pot/hp pot - are used by any class, though they are provided as usual skills, taking unnecessary space on bars.After exiting starting tower I feels bored with urge to exit this game and play something. There are too many good games (or simply better games than this one) around, spending time in Might&Magic Legacy is not worth it at all.Add to it requirement to install stupid Uplay and lack of standard Steam features.

Product received for free
												I have never seen the appeal in Tile Based RPG's, I tried a few of the wizardry games, but never made it passed maybe a dozen mobs in game. I got this game as part of a bundle, or promotion. I fired it up, thinking I'd get a good laugh out it, but fell completely in love.The turn based pacing is a perfect antidote to run and slash of most modern RPG's, and the difficulty of the fights had me using actual tactics. Blocking at the right time, using resistance spells, setting up crits. The story is passable enough to give you a somewhat engaging reason to complete the game outside of leveling up your party, and I had blast seeking out and finding secrets, and filling out the map.

												One of the best things i can say about this game is that it is an old school game that does not require an old school computer ro run.I was a fan of the might and magic series adn this game is supposed to pay hommage to it. This is a tile based game meaning you make a move and the game makes a move. There are some complaints about the graphics being low quality except for the monsters. and i admit the enviroments are nothing like what you will find in BioShock or Theif 4 or any other multi million dollar game but they are decent fits with the ""old school"" theme going on.I have not seen all of the story yet but it is a bit confusing to start.All in all i would recomend this game if you are a fan of both old and new games. If you are a graphics junkie then you should take a pass on this title			"

												Very good game - In the old school style of M&M. Takes a few minutes to get into the ""good old groove"" of what made the old games fun. Tough. Unforgiving. And no simple shortcuts - But also incredibly gratifying and a ton of options on how to go about combat. A few bugs still in, but nothing serious. Absolutly worth the money if you like looting! P.s - Play it on hard mode from the start. It's tough as nails but also very rewarding! :D			"

												So amazingly happy that this is coming out. Having played practically all M&M games, Wizardry, Ultima since they came out, this is the game I've been waiting for.[Added]Having spent some time with the game, it lives up to my expectations. The game retains the classic feel (although feeling a bit easy so far) of exploration and danger around every corner. The graphics aren't top quality, but that only lends itself to the retro feel that I've missed for a long time.Well worth buying.			"

												A couple of things to remind you how M&M works. #1 Everyone in your party MUST have ranged AND melee weapons. Unlike other RPG's where you usually have only one or the other. It took me a bit to remember that this was the way M&M worked and you will fail if you don't have both. #2 I was really frustrated with the controls, then I remembered that Q and E turn you around. You can change what buttons do that as well if you want something else.If you do these two things and if you liked M&M before you will love this game.			"

I find this game shares greater similarity to Legend of Grimrock than the Might and Magic series, although it would be considered a superior version of LoG. If you enjoyed Legends of Grimrock, than you will most probably like this game. Do I recommend this game? Yea, its a good combat tactics game with a few puzzles added in. Did I play it to the end? Yes.			"

												Wow, what a game.  Haven't seen an old school RPG like this in years, and they really hit the nail on the head.  Game uses a first person grid based system similar to Legend Of Grimrock, but it is much more complex.  You choose a party of 4 adventurers, and are free to mix and match as you please.  The leveling system is well thought out and there is definitely lots of room for strategy in skill choice and combat mechanics.  Game appears to be quite long, and the difficulty on ""Warrior"" mode is quite challenging.  If you are a fan of classic RPG's, this game is not to be missed!  Only downside is the Ubisoft launcher, but once you are in game you will forget all about it.			"

												Well when I did the ""early access"" I was thinking it was okay, but noting to get excited about. In fact I think for this game ""early access"" was more of a gimick then anything else. I kind of feel that the final release was going to be pretty much what they had in mind from the start, and that's not really a bad thing. It's a pretty enjoyable game over all.While it does have a vintage Might and Magic look, only updated, I wouldn't call it a faithful recreation of the old classic M&M games. I think the thing I've noticed most is that your ability to roam the game world is constricted compared to M&M games. You could pretty much go anywhere, but you'd get your @ss handed to you real quick if you strayed into too high a level area. So far with this game I've found that higher level areas are locked untill you've done the required quest/s. I think this is a developer design choice so I don't see it changing all that much as I progress.Other then that it's a pretty faithfull reproduction of the old grid and turn based combat RPG. It seems that the developers added a dash of Wizardy and AD&D to their formula and it makes for a pretty good and engrossing game. Battles can be pretty intense, but it's not a action game by any means, so If you love the more modern action RPGs you might be dissapointed. But if you've been wishing for a return to the PC RPGs of the golden age this will be right up your alley. Or if you've never played this style of RPG and wonder what the fuss about the ""golden age of RPGs"" is give it a spin. It's priced right for what it is and what you get, which can't always be said about a lot of the releases on the market.			"

												After putting 80+ hours into this game with two ongoing playthroughs I definitely recommend Might and Magic X: Legacy.  At first I was slow to succumb to its charms.  I felt the controls and immersion were a little clumsy, the voices and sound effects cheesy at best, and the visuals less than stellar.  When I got to the heart of the game, however, all of those things faded to the background and I found a lot to enjoy in the party building, monster smashing, and exploration.  I encourage newcomers to begin with an open mind and to be prepared to invest some solid time with a trial party to get acquainted with the mechanics and to learn what works well and what doesn't. Then once you have a vision and some goals it makes the challenges in front of you - and your progress - much more rewarding and motivating.I'm enjoying mysecond playthrough even more, this time using my knowledge of trainer and gear availability, what works best in combat and what doesn't, and an understanding of the pacing of the game to make a challenging party that beats the odds.  What's more, the game is deliberately set up to prevent you from trying all of the skills and classes in one go.  At first this frustrated me; now I appreciate the built-in replay.  A tip on that note: Don't try to do it all, do just a few things really well, and then try a different mix in another playthrough.			"

												As a standalone game it's certainly okay.Problem is... It's not.It is the latest installment in a renowned RPG-franchise and so it has to be compared to the earlier games.The graphics and style is nice and much better than its predecessors, but that's all. Gameplay is too different from the earlier games to still be seriously considered part of the franchise. Number 9 in the series was a bit different from 6-8, but the difference wasn't really a bad one but instead a refreshing one. The changes made to gameplay with number 10 are just horrendous and terrible. I still occasionally pop out the 'ol MM6 7 8 and 9 and play through em but this one is just pure♥♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to the others. It's clunky, hard and tedious  to simply travel around.There's much I would like to say about this game but I really don't wanna waste time on it anymore, I've given it about 5 tries so far with an  open mind... but you can't polish♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Remember the days when RPGs didn't lead you by the nose from setpiece to setpiece? Remember when dungeons were actually dangerous and needed careful planning and tactics? And remember when skill growth actually meant something?Might & Magic X - Legacy is made in the mold of the classics. There are some modern amenities, like in-game mapping and quest notes that remind you of quest details. The graphics, while not jaw-dropping, are quite well-done. Plus there is a ""retro"" filter for that true 1994 experience.If you remember and loved the way CRPGs used to be, you won't be disappointed with this game.			"

												This classic type RPG can be described like revive of the 90's Western RPG based on turn system. There are many positive clues to prove this game is fine.If I say one of them, I strongly want to focus to say the play of this game pull the player up.The duty to meet the ending when u play RPG is you must develop ur character.So, the player have to do many things like hunting, farming and seeking until they get enough level and items to go front.I am sure the most important point which RPG player abandon or keep playing is this time.But the Might & Magic X - Legacy has quitly defended itself from the problems.Might & Magic X - Legacy is based for old-type RPG but it also show u fine quility of adventure.The game show the route which player have to follow but the player do not need to do it first.You can find many interesting secrets, items, and bonuses that's used for ur journey before u are on the board of the main quest.What I need to say is this charm is quite variety and fun. and the reward of ur action is clear, fair, and very helpful.Of course, still there are several flaw to disturb player like bugs, transporting system, and puzzles.But, the experiences of all of them is unique and u can feel fresh in everytime that u travel new map and dungeons.

												As of now, i like the game itself .. only the trouble of buying the digital deluxe edition via steam seems not to be working: the bonus content so far is not yet linked to my steam account, neither on the Uplay one (oh, yes, btw you need that one to play the game, another thing not mentioned in the specs for the game ... AND it seems DD-buyers got the 4gb sized download, so there seems some problem at all, for it clearly says you need 10gb hdd .. )Once that is solved, i can recommend the game to all who like tile-walking oldschool rpg's .. before this: no, definetly not.

												ConsHorribly long load times, easily 15-30 seconds for an area.  There are cases where if you want to run back to town, you will need to run through 4+ areas.  With movement and load times this can take easily five minutes.  Too make it even more annoying the loading of an area STOPS if the screen loses focus, so no alt-tabbing during a load time.This is simply too immersion breaking.   There is a good chance you will hit a point where you have to run back to town realize this could easily involve five minutes to get there and then ANOTHER five minutes to get back.  If you’re the type of person who will drop this game and forget it with the above scenario don’t buy it.ProsProbably the best combat system for a turn based RPG I’ve seen in a long time.  Melee for example you have the three styles, duel-wield, shield and two-hander each one has situations where one is better.  A monster has the ability vindictive, for every miss on him he gets one more hit, which might damages your whole party.  Duel wielding dagger wielders with 4 attacks might get you killed if they miss too often one round, while a two handers one swing mass damage won’t cause a wipe.   Conversely a monster might be able to block the first swing against him 75% of the time, making the duel wielder at worst lose one attack and the two-hander do none. The spells are just as varied and important as well with their effects frequently being more important than their damage.   Pushing a monster square away, putting a monster to sleep, reducing the number of attacks a monster gets, buffing the party, removing block attempts or armour from monsters, AoE spells, and many more effects.Although some fights do break down into a simple damage race, knowing what type of melee and spell to use and the correct order actually matters in this game.

												Highly recommended!  Fans of old-school first person RPGs really shouldn't miss out on this gem.  It's very true to the feel of Might and Magic 3, 4, and 5 (some of the most fun RPGs ever!).  It's really obvious that a lot of passion went into it, thanks Limbic!  Thanks too to Ubisoft for being a AAA publisher that is actually taking a chance of a retro-indie game!Oh, and a quick note for anybody who is having the issues with blurry, really low-res textures: make sure you go to the MAIN MENU and change the textures to a higher quality, there is a small bug right now where changing some of the settings from the in-game menu doesn't work.   Happy adventuring everybody!			"

												After putting 80+ hours into this game with two ongoing playthroughs I definitely recommend Might and Magic X: Legacy.  At first I was slow to succumb to its charms.  I felt the controls and immersion were a little clumsy, the voices and sound effects cheesy at best, and the visuals less than stellar.  When I got to the heart of the game, however, all of those things faded to the background and I found a lot to enjoy in the party building, monster smashing, and exploration.  I encourage newcomers to begin with an open mind and to be prepared to invest some solid time with a trial party to get acquainted with the mechanics and to learn what works well and what doesn't. Then once you have a vision and some goals it makes the challenges in front of you - and your progress - much more rewarding and motivating.I'm enjoying mysecond playthrough even more, this time using my knowledge of trainer and gear availability, what works best in combat and what doesn't, and an understanding of the pacing of the game to make a challenging party that beats the odds.  What's more, the game is deliberately set up to prevent you from trying all of the skills and classes in one go.  At first this frustrated me; now I appreciate the built-in replay.  A tip on that note: Don't try to do it all, do just a few things really well, and then try a different mix in another playthrough.			"

												As a standalone game it's certainly okay.Problem is... It's not.It is the latest installment in a renowned RPG-franchise and so it has to be compared to the earlier games.The graphics and style is nice and much better than its predecessors, but that's all. Gameplay is too different from the earlier games to still be seriously considered part of the franchise. Number 9 in the series was a bit different from 6-8, but the difference wasn't really a bad one but instead a refreshing one. The changes made to gameplay with number 10 are just horrendous and terrible. I still occasionally pop out the 'ol MM6 7 8 and 9 and play through em but this one is just pure♥♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to the others. It's clunky, hard and tedious  to simply travel around.There's much I would like to say about this game but I really don't wanna waste time on it anymore, I've given it about 5 tries so far with an  open mind... but you can't polish♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												This is a great old-school RPG.  I have always loved the M&M series and this stays true to its origins.  If you like old-school, turn-based RPGs, this is a must have.  One other thing I really like is that it doesn't use pixelated graphics.  I like pixels every now and then, but it seems that anymore that's all anyone is putting out.  This game has full graphics and fantastic artwork.  The old thing that I am a bit disappointed in so far is the music.  It is very sporadic.			"

												Well when I did the ""early access"" I was thinking it was okay, but noting to get excited about. In fact I think for this game ""early access"" was more of a gimick then anything else. I kind of feel that the final release was going to be pretty much what they had in mind from the start, and that's not really a bad thing. It's a pretty enjoyable game over all.While it does have a vintage Might and Magic look, only updated, I wouldn't call it a faithful recreation of the old classic M&M games. I think the thing I've noticed most is that your ability to roam the game world is constricted compared to M&M games. You could pretty much go anywhere, but you'd get your @ss handed to you real quick if you strayed into too high a level area. So far with this game I've found that higher level areas are locked untill you've done the required quest/s. I think this is a developer design choice so I don't see it changing all that much as I progress.Other then that it's a pretty faithfull reproduction of the old grid and turn based combat RPG. It seems that the developers added a dash of Wizardy and AD&D to their formula and it makes for a pretty good and engrossing game. Battles can be pretty intense, but it's not a action game by any means, so If you love the more modern action RPGs you might be dissapointed. But if you've been wishing for a return to the PC RPGs of the golden age this will be right up your alley. Or if you've never played this style of RPG and wonder what the fuss about the ""golden age of RPGs"" is give it a spin. It's priced right for what it is and what you get, which can't always be said about a lot of the releases on the market.			"

												Now that it's finished I've logged in about 50 hours so far.  It's great, fully exploreable world with death around every corner.  Warrior mode is really challenging and fun.  It took a few tries to get my party right.  The world is very much like the old M&M's with a modern style. Graphics - Suprisingly good for a turn based game.  Lots of interesting terain.  Modern style with old M&M feel.  I had to do some graphics tweaking because the performance wasn't great at first.Sound - Great track and good background audio.  Lots of attention to detail.  I have a bug where sound gets weird and I have to restart the game.Gameplay - Very replayable.  Big world, lots of secrets, cool classes, tons of lore. I give it a huge thumbs up.  But I know this style game isn't for everyone, it takes patience and curiosity.  It's most fun when you take your time exploring and having late night coffee.  If you like Legend of Grimrock or old school games like M&M's, Wizardry, Anvil of Dawn, Dungeon Master you'll love this game.  They got the nastalgic feel with the modern style.  I hope this creates a rebirth of this style for the M&M series.			"

												I've been reading some reviews on this game and they just seem silly to me, so I thought I might post one of my own.  First off, if you can't get past the Uplay don't even bother reading further.  I guess there is some issues if you have  32-bit OS as well...  I have a 64-bit OS so it isn't as issue for me.  You might want to check into that if do.  Ok, so I fell in love with Might and Magic since I played M&M II: Gates to another world on the Sega Genesis.  I've played III, IV, V and VI all through completion.  I love the series!  I've also played Heroes of M&M I-VI.  THEY ARE DIFFERENT GAMES!  I saw reviews of people complaning this is nothing like Heroes...well...yeah!  It is nothing like Duel of Champions either!  The only thing this game has in common with Heroes is story background and creatures.  Game style is completely different!  I also saw a number of people comparing this to Grimlock.  Sounds like they were expecting this to be Grimlock but with an outside world.  I wonder if this is because all the Diablo Clones out there...Anyways...  Well, this games is completely different again.  Only thing in common with Grimlock is a party of 4 and a grid movement system.  Party make up and battles are different.  There is a lot more stratagy and party balance needed here.  You can't just take for rogues and expect to shoot/kite everything.  There is no kiting.  Mobs will catch you and eat you if you're not prepared.  You will learn what kind of attacks they have and will have to plan on what you need to do to counter them to keep your team alive.   It is turn based, so you know when to expect the attack.  Your four go, then the monsters go, repeat...  You will have time to think, because you'll need it.  This game does have a lot of do and explore.  I did play the early access and am a ways into act 1 of the full release.  Things have gotten much better than early access!  So don't read too much into reviews before 01/21/2014....  The music...I don't really care about music...I play games to play them not listen to music...  The game play is fun, complex and challenging so far.    If played other M&M games (again not Heroes) then you should like this.  If you like Grimlock and are open to more strategy in fighting and with less puzzles and kiting, then you'll probably like this...    It this is a great game if you're not expecting it to be a clone of other games you've played....			"

												A fine grid-based RPG with a reasonably open overworld, quests and even a few basic choices (spare/kill) and a lot of dungeon crawling. The turn-based combat prevents ""dancing"" known from realtime based blobber combat and the classes are very varied and allow many spell/skill combinations. The level progression is very satisfying, there was never a moment I felt overleveled (and a few where I had to reload and try a different path).All in all a satisfying RPG.			"

												Best part: It still have the ""feel"" of the old MM series... specifically 6-8. So I guess that's what matters the most.The battle system has been fixed to turn-based. On the negative side it become less fluid, but on the plus side it has become somewhat strategic.Graphics-wise it's somewhat disappointing for a PC game, with today's standards. But the world is still mostly vibrant and colorful. As a downside there's only limited people you can interact with and NPC feel like backgrounds. But heck, this game has been known to be a low-cost production ever since it's been announced, so it makes no sense arguing over those now right?Overall it's not bad but not amazingly good either. But at the very least, it's still the long awaited sequel to the Might and Magic series!			"

													So many things about Might and Magic – Legacy are just needlessly stupid. If you get poisoned  then there seems to be only two things that will cure it, the antidote potion or death. And guess what? The first portion of the game is filled with spiders that poison you repeatedly in every single fight. So, a level one spider, can poison you and do what is effectively an endless amount of damage. You can use every single health potion that you have and the poison effect never wears off. If you run out of antidote potions in the first mission then you are are just screwed as far as I can tell. 	Do you want to make a unique character? How about a tough spear wielding druid? Well, if there is no spear in the shop then you  can't attack. You can cast your one staring spell two or three times and then your mana has run out and you stand there. 	Mechanics are completely unexplained, as is leveling so are basic explanations of pretty much everything. This should be a great game that is completely ruined through sheer boneheaded decisions.

												This game is pretty good. Kind of sentimental, old school. But seems to be short or shorter, than older games from series (not quite sure about that, just feeling). One strong disappointing is graphics. Looks kind of 5-10 years old graphic engine, but had to set medium details to make game smooth (Geforce GTX 660M, skyrim works on my machine on High details with 60+ fps). So thats only one negative aspect i found on this game.			"

												Having participated in the early-access program and completing the early stages of the game several times, and helping the developers out as they progress through the game's developerment, I can say I am so far pleased with the final product. While the game is completly tile based, it does make you think about every step you end up taking, as it uses a turn. If you have a buff, do you want to move this direction or this direction, either way it uses up a point in the spell's duration. The graphics are pretty, although it can be a little laggy even on high end machines it isn't anything to start ranting about. If you are a fan of the older type of RPG's like this, you can even set the game to ""retro mode"" in the options and force the older feel pixels for the game. The game is filled with all sorts of journals giving insight to the world the game is set in. I personally sat down (breaks included of going to make a sandwich or something else more important at the moment) for a little over 3 hours to find the perfect type of class combination I wanted for my party. It is very important that you choose wisely. The game encourages you to explore the areas you are in and do not strictly require you to go from point A to point B. The way I see it is, take a shot at getting it. If you get the amout of hours in gameplay that you paid for it, then its worth the purchase. Try to avoid the ones that pick at the minor flaws and give it a bad rating.			"

												For anyone who thought that MM6 and MM7 were the best games in the series, this game is a huge let down. The developers took the best part of the game series, the sandbox element, and replaced it with a linear piece of junk. There were three aspects of the game that I enjoyed, the riddles and/or puzzles, being able to gather most quest objects without having the quest active yet (it saved me a lot of running around and back-tracking), and the fallout-style epilogue for some of the completed quests, that I got after beating the game. It could have given me a little extra time to read them, but whatever.That said, those are the only three elements of the game that I enjoyed and if I had to rate the game on a scale of one to ten, I'd say it'd rate a three with their inclusion. The rest is just full of dross, I beat the game and started today on the Falcon and the Unicorn DLC. Got fed up when it just transported me to the dungeon and dumped all the stuff I had. Even if I would have gotten my things back by getting to the second level of said dungeon, the approach and how it handled the interaction does not make sense to me.Having said all of this, I can forgive a lot if there is a good story included in a game. The story given is a piece of crap. The more I think about diffent elements in it, the less it makes sense to me.It is presented in such a way as to celebrate how humans can do anything, while slandering the names of two real-life angels according to the bible, and presenting the policy of the separation of church and state as something that is needed because the angels are the corrupt element in the government. This just doesn't make sense to me in a fictional world, where as far as I know every other supernatural being is given a made up name. Why go to the trouble of offending people who believe the two named angels are real beings in the real world, and one of which is described in the book of Daniel as the Great Prince who protects the Jews? The writer could have just as easily made up another name for these mortal non-angels as they are presented in the world.There are other issues I have with the game, lots of them, but you don't need to hear general griping from me. Just suffice to say that my personal tastes find this game to be extremely lacking on several levels, despite looking forward to playing it since I heard that it was being made.Some may claim that I'm setting the bar too high, but I think it's high enough for an expectation of what to expect from a game calling itself 'Might+Magic x:Legacy' when the Wizardry series ended on an awesome note with Wizardry 8. I can play Wizardry 8 to this day and have an awesome time, but I can tell you all that I'm never touching this piece of crap again. Later! Time to play Wizardry 7, I want to see what I can do with a party starting W8 as allies of the other races...			"

												I wanted to believe in this game. But ubisoft did it again. MM10 is an unplayable garbage, using salvaged models from hom&m6. Now the plot i dont much remember by now which speaks about how deep it was. Shallow, unimaginative, bad. The weather changing was so sudden it was giving me eye pain out of the blue. Combat was boring and bland aswell. No more fun spells like before, we get the boring status effects and a few direct and aoe spells. Great. Developed by a ubisoft one would expect it to be of higher quality but it is not. 4.5/10 for the game as it is if you are just starting. 3 or even 2/10 if you are a M&M fan who hates seeing the franchise you like get this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t treatment. First the abysmal 9. Now almost even worse 10. Do not buy it unless its on sale for like 2-4$			"

												While the concept is excellent, the implementation leaves a lot to be desired.Main issue:Buggy to the point of unplayable, REQUIRING hex-editing save games in order to progress due to bugs getting you stuck in combat with something that isn't there.Extremely unintuitive on where to go, possible to win one fight, take three steps, and get 1 shot by something you have no business being near. Unnecessarily long load times due to save game bloat, again needing a hex editor to fixSupply limit can be extremely frustrating, gearing your characters can be extremely frustrating, walking all the way back to the very first town for training can be extremely frustrating, especially since every time you zone you get a 60 second load screen that may or may not result in your characters being stuck and unable to move when it finishes.  Can't simply reload the autosave, you'll still be stuck.  Must boot up the hex editor again.After 6 or 7 times of this, I was done and regret spending the money until this is fixed. "

												How do I even begin...... this game is awesome!!!!For those of us old school gamers of the 90's who love he old Might and Magic would love this game straight away.For those new to this game, just have fun..... it does not matter how your party is created and which mix you use, it's the fun level that will suck you up into the game with it's rich and diverse story lines. Graphics wise it's a lot better than the old school yet have that similar tile movement feeling.Sound wise, it's really great hearing those indications that monsters are nearby.Difficulty wise, this game sets itself to cater for all, if you find some monsters are too tough for you to kill, then maybe your party is just not at the right level to face it yet, so go explore someother place and come back when you are stronger.

												The game is great, very enjoyable... when you can actually play it without having to restart your PC each and every time. Probably has to do with UPlay Im sure. I can not stand UPlay. Worse thing ever. No idea what the hell the devs were thinking using it to launch this game. Once you ""close"" out of the game and go do something elsse (another game or whatever) and try to come back and open it, it says it is already open and you can not just use control, alt, and delete and find the game... its not there. The only way to fix it is to fully reboot your whole PC. F**k UPlay. Ruins every game that uses it. If you can deal with this issue, then by all means, the game is well worth it. Otherrwise, steer clear of this one.			"

But it's a cell-divided RPG from 90th like M&M 1-5, only with kinda modern graphics and much more simpler story.I'm cursing a day when Ubisoft bought M&M and HoM&M franchise, because I don't like their way of development and their ""100% fantasy"" thing.Old games had a nice Sci-fi accent and were unique, new games just another Warcraft-like strategies and RPG.

												Now that the game is in full release I feel it is appropriate to write a review for this.You probably won't like the style of game if you're impatient or expecting Might and Magic 6 or newer tyle fantasy RPG games, or a fan of when ubisoft bought out the series in 2003 and started changing it. The game is still set in a part of Ashan, iirc about 10 years after Heroes 6. That being said though, there is very little story overlap that I've seen thus far (about 30-35% in) wich was a very common thing. They do make jabs at references to the older games in the series, like when you meet the governor's daughter, she wants to see the circus (M&M 6.)The entire game is grid-based movement. Each square out of town is roughly 20-25 feet let's say. And you choose to move forward, backward, or left or right. Turning is a ""Free action."" After you move, any monsters in the vicinity will move. Then you move. Then they move. Combat is turn based as it was back in M&M1-5, as there's no option like there was in M&M6-9.Character development is better than in M&M1-5, worse than 6-9. You pick a race, has two benefits particular to that race. Then you pick the ""might"", ""magic"", or ""hybrid"" path for that race. 4 races, 12 classes. 3 classes per race. Each class has one promotion quest, i.e. crusader turns into a paladin, a blade dancer turns into a war dancer.While there is almost no relation to the previous games, as was the case with Might and Magic 9, there is a storyline in the game that I've enjoyed so far. Premise is, you're raiders. Adventurers. Call them what you will. At the end of your training, your mentor dies but tells you to bring his ashes home to Karthal. You get to the peninsula, and your adventure starts, as you free the area from all the baddies and monsters and ghosts. Pretty stereotypical of both the fantasy RPG genre as a whole, and of M&M series games. Just lacking (thus far) the sci-fi element that was throughout Might and Magic 1-8.Graphics may seem old to some people, some Pre-release folks were complaining about it. Truthfully? I'm okay with less-intensive graphics. It doesn't detract from the gameplay at all, and they were on par with the graphics present in Heroes 5 in my opinion. My rig isn't exactly new, just gave it a new video card about two years ago, (Radeon HD 6350 iirc), and everything on ultimate and the game looks wonderful. Not Crysis wonderful, but wonderful nonetheless.My recommendation? Try it out! It's a step back from the modern fantasy games out there. Something happened when 3D0 went under and this iconic series and style just about vanished overnight in 2003. This series has been going on now for 28 years and it's still good.			"

												The first major problem with this game is the U-Play requirement.  Always on DRM for the sake of DRM in addition to Steam's DRM is excessive.  Given the issues Ubisoft has had with U-Play's functionality creating points of vulnerability for Ubisofts's servers or any of thier customer's PC's, installing U-Play is the ""this is secure"" equivalent of downloading game DRM cracks off of random internet websites. The second major issue with this game is the complete lack of random monsters, at least in the first several hours of play.  This puts what initially looks like an open world game on rails.   The is a major issue because of the XP and leveling system.  Your heroes need to hit certain benchmarks by certain points in the game  or you will be unable to progress beyind those points.  Having a hero dead or unconcious at the end of a battle means they do not get XP and you have to reload as you do not have an opportunity to recover that lost experience.  The second major issue can be overcome with multiple playthroughs to perfect your strategies, but with the inevitable issues and crashes that U-Play will cause, this game isn't worth the extra effort necessary to deal with the DRM.

												This game is old school.  Grid based movement; turn based combat; we go/you go combat mechanics and other classic game systems like from M&M 1-5.  If your looking for top notch graphics,  a free move mode like in Skyrim, twitch based fights, and hand holding quests/fights,  you'll be sorely disapointed.But if your looking for a modernish remake of an old classic CRPG, that brings back so many memories of classic M&M/Xeen games of the past, this game will certainly give you plenty of enjoyment.But, it also has horrible, terrible optimization problems, with lag and low FPS even on the best systems, and lock-ups on 32bit systems are being reported.  So sad they released such a classic remake in such terrible shape.			"

												I have always been a M&M loyal friend.  Even though I considered IX one of the worst of the main series, once I saw X:Legacy, I jumped on it like a kid on cake.  When I found out they went back to the original mechanics of grid-based movement, I was intrigued.  I grew up with I-V, and although I really enjoyed VI-VIII, there's something special about keeping true to the game that started it all.Now that I've covered my background story, here's my main review points for X:Legacy.  First, it's raw... as in ""Early Access Beta  Test"" raw.  I discovered early on that if a conversation with an NPC is a bit long in narration, it's cut off early.  I really wanted to hear more of what the Guard Captain of Sorpigal-by-the-Sea after his Quest was completed.Second, when I toured the city and found the ""Training Grounds""... I expected that to be the place I would level my characters.  This has been the case for 9 games, but when I found out I can level... for FREE... on the SPOT!  I was shocked...   I really don't know if that's a good or bad thing.Third, I don't know if I am missing something, but there are certain things that seem lacking right off the bat.  The ability to ID or Repair via Skill or Spell was something I found necessary.  Yes, I do remember having to rely on a shopkeeper early on.  However, in the past, there was ONE shop. It did everything.  X:Legacy seems to bring together the worst of VI and the worst of I-V by having THREE different shops, each with their own repair and only one with the ability to ID my loot.  You mean to tell me that a Armorsmith can't ID ""Armor""?  I also remember there were Robbers/Theives who ID'd traps/treasures/etc. and Sorcerers who could manage the same via spells.  Having to walk 500 blocks just for an ID isn't friendly.  Yes, this was probably my harshest of the criticisms... but as I stated before, this game is 'raw'.Next, Character Manual Creation... I liked its implementation in VI, but this new skill tree led to some ... odd circumstances.  I wound up with a 'Healer' without the ability to fight... even with his/her fists.  There used to be a standard set of things that came with a character.  Light armor/Small Weapons... A sling! of all things.  But to be completely unarmed and unable to fight except through spells? Unheard of, at least as far back as I can remember.  To top it off, for early weapons, I was not pleased to see that a simple staff REQUIRED EXPERT skill.  Since when?  No weapon in all of Cron or Terra or wherever required a minimum skill...  Class/Alignment restricted sure, but not skill.  Skills improved the basic ability of a weapon, that's how it should be.  This is my other harsh criticism thus far.Finally, everything else.  Graphically, it's ok... M&M has never been known to have particularly 'state of the art' scenery.  But what it lacked visually, it made up for in huge worlds labyrinthine worlds.  Now here's X:Legacy!  Nine sequels since the original. I'm going to use Sorpigal-by-the-Sea as my example.  It's not even a tenth of what Middlegate was (MM2) It's barely the size of Sorpigal (MM6). And it's grid based with borders that load a whole other area.  I'd almost expect the place to be Crap-My-Pants BEAUTIFUL!  Especially with the very minimal interactions with the enviroment, minimal movement options, and extraneous people/obstacles that are only there for visual goodies and serve NO purpose but to be in my way.  I haven't made it far into the so-called ""Open World"" but so far, it's a bit lackluster for what I'm able to see in such limited space.  Take a look at even older games as EQII or WoW or even new games like FFXIV.  Those worlds were free-roam with powerful imagery.  I'm in a grid-based static world and the imagery is just above mediocre.The Combat system is ok... a bit clunky feeling but for a turn-based set up, it's ok.  Again, graphically, it lacks quite a bit, in my opinion.  Ambushes are fun, that's for sure.  Do like them ambushes. LOL.  The auto-loot mechanic is ok.  Too subtle for my opinion though.  I miss the searching and the booby traps (MM1-2) or just the searching (MM 1-9).Sadly, I haven't fully explored the game so far... and finally earned enough gold to buy some new spells... that find traps and hidden areas.  I'm hoping those are useful.  However, since I haven't found a way to respawn monsters yet... there's a bit of a limitation in gold and thus... food/rest/mana potion options.Overall, I'd rate the game RAW out of 10!   I'll come back when the Full Game is launched and patched a few times and give an honest score. :)			"

Many many bugs, much is unbalanced, not open world, Ubisoft announced that they would do no more with this game, no more DLC's, no major fixing, etc. it's all in the forums, I wish that I read them prior. I was playing the game and enjoyed the first few hours, then started hitting some bugs and tried to look something up on the forums and I learned much more. waste of money with no future.			"

												If you enjoyed playing might and magic 6 (the mandate of heaven) and might and magic 7 (for blood and honor) I think that you will enjoy the new game released by Ubi. Might and Magic 10 takes the old food and makes it fresh with a new game mode making the game incredibly more difficult (for veteran players of the series only). If you would like any further information as always let me know.			"

												MM6 was my favorite game from years back.  This brought back a lot of memories.  If you're a fan of the genre you should pick it up, but only after grabbing both Grimrocks.  A little bit of the MM soul was lost in the company transition, but it's mostly there.  Worth it on sale.			"

												The voice acting in this game can be a bit irritating sometimes and the graphics could definately use some work but if you give it a chance there is a real gem hidden in behind the slighty crusty exterior. Two levels of difficulty alow you to pick from a bit of a challenge (Adventurer Mode) to totally unfair (Warrior Mode). I wouldn't say that it has the greatest replay value, the story is linear and fairly basic, but it holds your attention well enough to keep you going as your party wipes for the hundreth time. Going on 100 hours worth of gameplay if you do everything and definately worth playing if you can live with the random difficulty curve.			"

												I really enjoyed playing this game, just now finishing my first playthrough.  It actually did feel a lot like Might and Magic 6 or maybe the older Xeen ones but with more modern graphics.  I was in the beta and was a bit disappointed with the early builds, but the final game really seemed to nail the whole feel of the classics in the series.  Granted, there were a few bugs, a couple crashes, and one place where I had to re-load an older save to avoid a place where my actions caused a quest to be unable to finish.  But if they do a good large patch some time after the initial release (EDIT: they have) then it'll probably be fine.  This is a no-brainer purchase for those of us of a certain age and RPG experience.  About to start my second run with a different character mix.  Wish me luck.			"

												I cannot give this enough of a thumbs up after all the crap that has been spewed in the name of Might and Magic since the close of the 90's.  If you're a fan of the series you will love what they brought back, and the inside jokes from past games.  If you're not a fan, I suggest you look for something more modern.  This is a turn based RPG.  Time moves as you do.  Certain classes can only use certain things.  This is not like skyrim where you can have mastered every form of magic and go running around in platemale that you have grandmastered and made yourself at home with your kids watching.  You can't have everything and there are restraints.  Believe it or not challenges can be fun in a game.  I have yet to experience a bug in the game, though I have not finished it yet so time will tell, and when it does I will post on here.			"

												Being an old school Might and Magic fan, I didn't know what to expect out of this game. I played through and got to the end but it took a while. Save and save often. Your party make-up in the beginning makes a BIG difference in your survivability rate. Don't make any archers, bring someone that can take a lot of dmg, bring someone that can deal lots of dmg, make sure you have a good healer and have someone that can cast pretty much all the spells. You might have to try out a few combinations before you figure out what's best. If you like the Might and Magic series, you will dig this game. The only gripe is the class customization. I was hoping for a bit more than what was offered. Pretty much have to take it or leave it kinda classes. Make a good combination of classes and you can't go wrong. This game kinda reminds me of playing the older ones with the turn-based movement. The game looks great, but be prepared for a bit of a challenge until you get some levels.			"

												If you played and enjoyed the old Might and Magic games this is a great piece of nostalgia-ware with better graphics and an updated interface. I also enjoyed the expanded class and skill system. If you explore all the content it will consume many hours of your time - you definitely get your money's worth. I restarted the early part of the game a few times to change parties, but once I found a group I liked, I played it all the way through and really enjoyed it. Recommended for old school CRPG gamers who like turn-based combat like I do or who liked the original Might and Magic games like I did.			"

												IT'S MIGHT AND MAGIC ♥♥♥♥♥EEEEESS!Post-completion review:Ok so, I've been playing Might and Magic games since 1997 and finished every campaign for any and all games with M&M title that came out since then. I've completed M&M6 about 10 times and rest of the games in the series at least 3 times each.Keeping that in mind, I didn't hesitate to buy a game from the franchise, which was though to be dead, and frankly is not appealing to the younger generation of players. It is a great gamble to publish a game like this and I thank Limbic and Ubisoft (which I actually don't like very much).However, accepting the reality of this game's probability of success for modern player base and the monetary resources devoted to the game are no doubt limited, the game feels very ""incomplete"" in every way.As much as i can see on the internet, people ♥♥♥♥♥ about the grid based/turn based mechanics of the game. My personal problem however is not about it's mechanics but about it's setup. Game is considerably short (finished in 45 hours or so. In M&M 6 you can't even clear 3 cities and related regions/quests in that time) and game world is extremely small. Entirety of M&M X sums up to 2-3 regions in M&M 6, 7 or 8. Considering that M&M 6 had 12 regions and MASSIVE dungeons, M&M X is a huge disappointment in that regard.My second problem with the game is the linearity story. M&M games always had that freedom feeling (not like the sandbox games like TES series of course) which allowed the player to go to Dragonsand at level 1 and instantly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by 200 dragons in range.The story itself in previous games also had a classic purpose of gathering up different factions against a common enemy, then going in solo to crash it. M&M X lacks this quest line too, as we are getting railroaded into a single minded purpose. In M&M 7 the light vs dark choice had a game changing effect, and less so in 8. M&M X doesn't have this story feature as it lacks any type of choice over the story.There are also issues with the game mechanics themselves. The class promotions are almost useless to get (which were CRITICAL to have in previous games), and the lack of honorary promotion quests breaks some of the dungeons (like if you don't have a paladin in your party, you can't complete the quest about shantiri disc). Skills are restructured and the removal of most miscelenaous skills (like lockpick, merchant, armsmaster, disarm, repair, identify item, etc.) makes the game more combat oriented than before.On the positive side of things, the setting of the game was done quite well with the ""new"" world of Ashan. After the failure of M&M 9 and it's poorly thought setting, M&M X used the story began with Heroes 6 quite well. Race specific classes were also a great idea and made the game replayable (for me at least)My evaluation of the game in general comes down to these:- Very short story- VERY small game world- Too linear storyline and the lack of choice- Bugs (less than I expected actually)- Poor game engine performance+ Franchise connected backstory+ Large number of classes for replayability+ 4 player party system and turn based combat+ BEING A MIGHT AND MAGIC GAME7/10PS: If the game gets a few DLCs to make it longer (like twice longer or something) and add regions like a city from Irollan, a single location from Seven Cities and a city from neighbouring Unicorn Duchy my rating would go up to 7,5-8/10			"

A shame, I would love to see multiple storylines and multiple branches of the game, making it interesting even on the umpteenth playthrough.If you want an action packed adrenalin surge this is not your game.

												Might and Magic 6 and 7 were some of my favorite games when they came out. The combination of an intricate skill system and open world gameplay was addictive as hell. Fortunately this new installment in the series captures the same feeling that made those games great. In fact it even improves on many aspects. The first major difference is combat. Instead of being realtime/pausable, the combat is completely turn based. This makes battles much more about tactics then the previous might and magics. The skill system with masters and grandmasters makes a return along with class promotion quests. In fact, this game retains a lot of might and magic staples. Yes there is obelisks. Yes there are relics. Dungeons are very well done. There are secrets and hidden passages that you must find. You cant just kill all the enemies to finish the dungeons/quests. Dungeons are large and there is even one that has multiple entries and exits that span a large part of the game world. You will find yourself returning to the different dungeons just to see if you missed anything. You will solve puzzles, find clues, and even discover elemental shards. There are about 7 shards in total and each time you find one, you embark on a quest and gain a new blessing. The blessing's allow you to cross water or cut through a forest or take portals. Might and Magic X can be difficult and even frustrating at times. The magic system is such that you gain new spells when you become an expert, master, or grandmaster. You will find yourself to weak to fight certain creatures until you get these new spells. Speaking of the spell system, there are 12 different classes spanning 4 different races. Each class has its own flavor and can specialize in certain skills. Once your class gets promoted, they even get special abilities. This was a great addition to the traditional Might and Magic class system. The one downside to this game is that its not quite big enough. You can tell the developers didnt have the time or budget they needed to truly make an epic game. I believe this release was a sort of test to see how well itd do and if it does well, we can look foward to a epic Might and Magic XI. Although the game world is small, its still a fantastic game.

												How do I even begin...... this game is awesome!!!!For those of us old school gamers of the 90's who love he old Might and Magic would love this game straight away.For those new to this game, just have fun..... it does not matter how your party is created and which mix you use, it's the fun level that will suck you up into the game with it's rich and diverse story lines. Graphics wise it's a lot better than the old school yet have that similar tile movement feeling.Sound wise, it's really great hearing those indications that monsters are nearby.Difficulty wise, this game sets itself to cater for all, if you find some monsters are too tough for you to kill, then maybe your party is just not at the right level to face it yet, so go explore someother place and come back when you are stronger.

												It have to be fun. It adopted grid-based movements, turn based combats, skills, races, and nearly everything from glorious MM6. However, managers performed a dull work in a hope nostalgic players would buy anything claimed to be MM6 successor. Open world degenerated to set of tunnels drawn on the world map. Turn-based combats become face-to-face punch exchanges. Archers are of no use now and fight basically degenerated to ""find a nice corner and wait them come to you"". A bunch of bugs are here, too. For example at some point in the game flying monsters starts to ... fly in the air while they were unable to do it through the whole game. More on this, as far as your party is unable to fly, you are literally dead as bug happens. The monster are far away staying on the tiny air 4 blocks away from you. 4 blocks means you have no way to kill it.Quests are a pale shadow of the former glory. Some places are closed at the beginning of the game just because. You are not prepared or whatever. Good night young ignoramus, you are not welcome here.			"

												Over all, for the price and type of game, I'd recommend it. You just don't see a lot of games of this style being made anymore, so it's almost a matter of ""beggars can't be choosers,"" unfortunately. That said, the game does come with a caveat emptor or two - when I played it, well after release and the first patch or two, I didn't really experience any huge problems. That said, some people do experience some game-breaking bugs, so your mileage may well vary!Tha said, it's a spot-on solid homage to the older style of party-based first-person turn-based grid-based adventury games! There's secrets, spells, NPCs and quests, puzzles aplenty, riddles to answer, quests to do, etc. etc. At this point the game seems to be pretty playable and most bugs are work-aroundable at worst, though again it may just be that I got lucky, it's hard to say!Each race has its own set of classes with their own unique promotion/promotion skill, skillsets, and so forth. The game starts out pretty smoothly and progresses nicely in terms of difficulty and character strength - I did feel my melee characters ended up a bit too strong by the end, but my magey fellow caught up right at the end-game, finally. It's really a pretty solid RPG of the style, and the only thing around since Grimrock (which isn't quite the same, anyways, though solid in its own right.)			"

												Most fun i've had in a game since the likes of Baldur's gate 2 and Fallout. The game is not for everyone but if you enjoyed Legend of Grimrock this one is in my opinion a lot better due to free roaming and no ""tile dancing"". You are left with a main quest to follow but after 1 hour in to the game your pretty much free to do whatever you like, go die to a high level monster or try to sneak past them to get to that powerful loot!  I recommend this to everyone who enjoy old school dungeon crawlers!			"

												I bought this game on a Steam sale and thourghly enjoyed it.  The hardest part for me was deciding on my party because I wanted one of each class.   The developers did an awesome job on the graphices and animation for this game.  YOu will spend alot of time trying to figure out the best way to build your characters.  Finding relics was very rewarding too.   Keep in mind that some places are harder and you will have to come back later to do it.  My only complaint is the map is not scrollable, so maybe in the next one they will fix that.  I grew up with games like Might & Magic and Eye of the Beholder.  This game is like them but much better looking.			"

												This is an excellent rebirth to a sorely missed franchise. Movement, fighting and exploration all hark back to the golden age of RPGs, graphics and UI are a welcome improvement on previous editions and although the length is short in comparison to the likes of Worlds of Xeen, regular DLC addition will help to keep you returning for more in this compelling and satisfying journey for magical adventurers!

I'm only halfway through the game but I've found it very challening and fun. The combat can feel repetitive but the constant appearance of new enemies means your strategies often have to change.			"

												I really enjoyed playing this game, just now finishing my first playthrough.  It actually did feel a lot like Might and Magic 6 or maybe the older Xeen ones but with more modern graphics.  I was in the beta and was a bit disappointed with the early builds, but the final game really seemed to nail the whole feel of the classics in the series.  Granted, there were a few bugs, a couple crashes, and one place where I had to re-load an older save to avoid a place where my actions caused a quest to be unable to finish.  But if they do a good large patch some time after the initial release (EDIT: they have) then it'll probably be fine.  This is a no-brainer purchase for those of us of a certain age and RPG experience.  About to start my second run with a different character mix.  Wish me luck.			"

												I cannot give this enough of a thumbs up after all the crap that has been spewed in the name of Might and Magic since the close of the 90's.  If you're a fan of the series you will love what they brought back, and the inside jokes from past games.  If you're not a fan, I suggest you look for something more modern.  This is a turn based RPG.  Time moves as you do.  Certain classes can only use certain things.  This is not like skyrim where you can have mastered every form of magic and go running around in platemale that you have grandmastered and made yourself at home with your kids watching.  You can't have everything and there are restraints.  Believe it or not challenges can be fun in a game.  I have yet to experience a bug in the game, though I have not finished it yet so time will tell, and when it does I will post on here.			"

But it's a cell-divided RPG from 90th like M&M 1-5, only with kinda modern graphics and much more simpler story.I'm cursing a day when Ubisoft bought M&M and HoM&M franchise, because I don't like their way of development and their ""100% fantasy"" thing.Old games had a nice Sci-fi accent and were unique, new games just another Warcraft-like strategies and RPG.

I'm a middle aged guy who can care less about developing my gaming skills and cares more about the story line.  I'f prefer to be entertained have less gaming skills but be able to play this game with relative ease as I get engrossed in the story line.  This isn't the case.  Even on easy mode the battles are excruciatingly hard.  I'm so disappointed in this game.  Make sure you buy thousands upon thousands of healing and mana potions because you will need them.  So disappointing that on easy mode I have to spend so much time dying.  What a waste.  Who is the demographic that this game is catering to, my age or console gamers????			"

												Now I'll be completely honest here.I've only played through the game once and I haven't touched the DLCs by any means.Now I've played in the alpha/beta and I really enjoyed it, and when I first played the launched game, I really enjoyed it still, and even more.I couldn't stop playing this game and I managed to finish almost all the quests in the game before finishing it.And that's where the sour part comes.This has to be the lamest, most disgustingly bad end boss ever made in history.SPOILER START, for those who doesn't want their ending spoiled:The final boss fight is basically:1. Attack the boss.2. Go to four rooms and kill the monsters there, and pick up a thing.3. Go back to the center of the boss room and then plonk the thing into the thing.4. Random flashlight of doom turns on and the boss dies.5. You sit there thinking: Is that it?SPOILER END.But would I recommend this game?Of course I would, it's a lovely and a great game, except for the final boss.Now as I mentioned previously, I only played the game WITHOUT the DLCs.I'd say fetch it if you like this kind of game, especially on discout sales.

												First, if you like Legend of Grimlock, play Legend of Grimlock.  This game is only like Grimlock in that it's tile-based.  Where Grimlock was the perfect balance of RPG, action, strategy, and items, this game gives you shops with eleventy billion swords and no way to tell which one is better than the other.  Where Grimlock subtley revealed the plot through very brief flashes and in-game items, this game has what one must assume is an attempt at humor revealed through 400 pages of text dialog.  Where Grimlock was fun, this game isn't.  I simply do not understand the reviews.  M&MX is a complete waste of money.			"

Posted: January 28, 2014
												Hello,here is my review of Might & Magic X - Legacy:first off there is no free modding kit like advertised in the shop. To use the mod kit you have to download UnityPro, after 30 days unityPro costs 1500$ once or 75$ per month to use. 32 bit users are getting screwed because they have no sound effects and are reduced to middle grafic settings. So false advertising at work in the shop. It uses Ubisoft launcher as second layer of drm, isnt it fun? Problems with your internet connection? Bad luck you will not be able to play it.The technical aspect of the game is horrible. On 32 bit system the game is incomplete, you get only middle textures, no party sounds, no monster sounds and other features are missing. The overall performance is bad. On 64 bit you get hight textures, animations and all but it does not look too good at all. That would be tolerable, roleplaying games are mostly about gameplay and not super grafic quality. But the performance is supbar compared to the grafic quality delivered. It runs really choppy and many systems. Even on the latest 780 gforce power rigs it does not run smooth so that is that. Performancewise it is a catastrophe.Gameplay: 12 classes Defender, Bladedancer, Ranger, Mecenary , Freemage, Shaman, Druid, Runepriest, Barbarian, Scout, Crusader. Unfortunately ranged classes like the ranger and scout are useless farther into the game. You have very little opportunity to fight monsters at range, in melee they do next to no damage, because the main ranged stat perception does not improve the damageoutput of melee much. The Ranger gets a point blank shot, this does not really help to improve his damage output. Magic classes are strong until the monsters get rediculous high resistance against their magic school. Most monster are resistent against a magic school or general resistent against all magic, so tough luck if your chosen magic school like fire or wind does nothing against that special pack of monsters or the boss. Magic user tend to burn your mana potion resources like mana addicts.Defender, Bladedance and Crusader perform very good, the blade dancer with daggers buffed up by crusader spells is the best damage dealer in the game by a wide margin. He is so op that it brakes the whole class system. You will struggle without a bladedancer or barbarian as damage dealer in your party. The whole class system is borked and unbalancedThe combat relies very much on luck and potion chucking, It does not feel very might and magic like in the later stages of the game. With a suboptimal(no bladedancer or two)  party you get one tough as nails fight after the other, in m&m series the game would throw many easy monsters at you to test your resource managementskills and use of aid spells, but not one hard battle after the other. The pacing is frustrating and not fun even on the easier adventurer mode. The encounterdesign is not good, it is one overly hard battle after the other, even for trash monsters. There is no respawn, the monster count is too low to succed by grinding. M&m x is the only rpg i know where i can't win through overleveling, so for me it is no rpg at all. Leveling your character through grinding, getting better equipment, farming gold, leveling skills is what makes a good rpg for me. the skill system is more might and magic like. It is very rudimental and easy. You have 4 skillpoints per level to invest in your skills, after 7 15 20 skillpoints you can upgrade to a new skilltier, expert, master, grandmaster, you will get boni for each upgrade. Some skills are more powerfull then others. So magic skills get 5% 10% 15% spell penetration and more resistance against that magic school while the infamous dagger skill gets expert 1 extra attack and plus hitrate, and on grand master 2 extra attacks and plus hitrate. Combined with dual whield skill you can get a staggering amount of 6 attacks per round, your bladedancer becomes a weapon of mass destruction. Compared to this all other skills and magic school are just a joke in terms of damageoutput. You will need some skills/spells to progress like protection against status ailments, healing spells but for raw damage dagger and dual whield is greater then none.Per levelup you get 4 attribute points you can allocate where you wish. For a seasoned rpg player it should be easy to get a deasant build. Melee 2 strength 1 perc, 1 vit, magic 1 magic, 1 vit 2 spirit in the beginning and 2 magic 1 vit 1 spirit later when you have enough manapoints (never).I think the game release was rushed, the gameplay is boring and frustrating, the encounters are onesided against the player to the extreme, you cannot grind in a rpg!, the performance is bad even for the grafics and on excellent gaming rigs, the skills, classes, monster encounters are not balanced at all. I do not recommend this game.Have a nice day			"

												I have always been a M&M loyal friend.  Even though I considered IX one of the worst of the main series, once I saw X:Legacy, I jumped on it like a kid on cake.  When I found out they went back to the original mechanics of grid-based movement, I was intrigued.  I grew up with I-V, and although I really enjoyed VI-VIII, there's something special about keeping true to the game that started it all.Now that I've covered my background story, here's my main review points for X:Legacy.  First, it's raw... as in ""Early Access Beta  Test"" raw.  I discovered early on that if a conversation with an NPC is a bit long in narration, it's cut off early.  I really wanted to hear more of what the Guard Captain of Sorpigal-by-the-Sea after his Quest was completed.Second, when I toured the city and found the ""Training Grounds""... I expected that to be the place I would level my characters.  This has been the case for 9 games, but when I found out I can level... for FREE... on the SPOT!  I was shocked...   I really don't know if that's a good or bad thing.Third, I don't know if I am missing something, but there are certain things that seem lacking right off the bat.  The ability to ID or Repair via Skill or Spell was something I found necessary.  Yes, I do remember having to rely on a shopkeeper early on.  However, in the past, there was ONE shop. It did everything.  X:Legacy seems to bring together the worst of VI and the worst of I-V by having THREE different shops, each with their own repair and only one with the ability to ID my loot.  You mean to tell me that a Armorsmith can't ID ""Armor""?  I also remember there were Robbers/Theives who ID'd traps/treasures/etc. and Sorcerers who could manage the same via spells.  Having to walk 500 blocks just for an ID isn't friendly.  Yes, this was probably my harshest of the criticisms... but as I stated before, this game is 'raw'.Next, Character Manual Creation... I liked its implementation in VI, but this new skill tree led to some ... odd circumstances.  I wound up with a 'Healer' without the ability to fight... even with his/her fists.  There used to be a standard set of things that came with a character.  Light armor/Small Weapons... A sling! of all things.  But to be completely unarmed and unable to fight except through spells? Unheard of, at least as far back as I can remember.  To top it off, for early weapons, I was not pleased to see that a simple staff REQUIRED EXPERT skill.  Since when?  No weapon in all of Cron or Terra or wherever required a minimum skill...  Class/Alignment restricted sure, but not skill.  Skills improved the basic ability of a weapon, that's how it should be.  This is my other harsh criticism thus far.Finally, everything else.  Graphically, it's ok... M&M has never been known to have particularly 'state of the art' scenery.  But what it lacked visually, it made up for in huge worlds labyrinthine worlds.  Now here's X:Legacy!  Nine sequels since the original. I'm going to use Sorpigal-by-the-Sea as my example.  It's not even a tenth of what Middlegate was (MM2) It's barely the size of Sorpigal (MM6). And it's grid based with borders that load a whole other area.  I'd almost expect the place to be Crap-My-Pants BEAUTIFUL!  Especially with the very minimal interactions with the enviroment, minimal movement options, and extraneous people/obstacles that are only there for visual goodies and serve NO purpose but to be in my way.  I haven't made it far into the so-called ""Open World"" but so far, it's a bit lackluster for what I'm able to see in such limited space.  Take a look at even older games as EQII or WoW or even new games like FFXIV.  Those worlds were free-roam with powerful imagery.  I'm in a grid-based static world and the imagery is just above mediocre.The Combat system is ok... a bit clunky feeling but for a turn-based set up, it's ok.  Again, graphically, it lacks quite a bit, in my opinion.  Ambushes are fun, that's for sure.  Do like them ambushes. LOL.  The auto-loot mechanic is ok.  Too subtle for my opinion though.  I miss the searching and the booby traps (MM1-2) or just the searching (MM 1-9).Sadly, I haven't fully explored the game so far... and finally earned enough gold to buy some new spells... that find traps and hidden areas.  I'm hoping those are useful.  However, since I haven't found a way to respawn monsters yet... there's a bit of a limitation in gold and thus... food/rest/mana potion options.Overall, I'd rate the game RAW out of 10!   I'll come back when the Full Game is launched and patched a few times and give an honest score. :)			"

												If you enjoyed playing might and magic 6 (the mandate of heaven) and might and magic 7 (for blood and honor) I think that you will enjoy the new game released by Ubi. Might and Magic 10 takes the old food and makes it fresh with a new game mode making the game incredibly more difficult (for veteran players of the series only).

												EDIT:I am pleased with how the game has turned out now upon release. I can now move between locations and the full features are quite a bit of fun. The game at this point is still a little rough around the edges (a character portrait disappeared for a little bit upon entering the first dungeon, walls will sometimes dissapear for a second and show you the outside world, and I had one crash) but it is still quite playable and fun.If you are a fan of tile based old-school RPGs get this one. It will bring back the memories and I am sure with future patches it will only get better.Old Entry: I want this to be successful. I want to like it. I can't right now. I have 5 crash reports that the devs say to send them but then give you no where to send them to. I get no answer from them on the forums and nothing but frustration anywhere else. This has the makings of a great retro-style game, but falls short on the part of working with Alpha players to get things right. I can't play past the first town. Wait until this is finished to buy.			"

Posted: January 28, 2014
												Hello,here is my review of Might & Magic X - Legacy:first off there is no free modding kit like advertised in the shop. To use the mod kit you have to download UnityPro, after 30 days unityPro costs 1500$ once or 75$ per month to use. 32 bit users are getting screwed because they have no sound effects and are reduced to middle grafic settings. So false advertising at work in the shop. It uses Ubisoft launcher as second layer of drm, isnt it fun? Problems with your internet connection? Bad luck you will not be able to play it.The technical aspect of the game is horrible. On 32 bit system the game is incomplete, you get only middle textures, no party sounds, no monster sounds and other features are missing. The overall performance is bad. On 64 bit you get hight textures, animations and all but it does not look too good at all. That would be tolerable, roleplaying games are mostly about gameplay and not super grafic quality. But the performance is supbar compared to the grafic quality delivered. It runs really choppy and many systems. Even on the latest 780 gforce power rigs it does not run smooth so that is that. Performancewise it is a catastrophe.Gameplay: 12 classes Defender, Bladedancer, Ranger, Mecenary , Freemage, Shaman, Druid, Runepriest, Barbarian, Scout, Crusader. Unfortunately ranged classes like the ranger and scout are useless farther into the game. You have very little opportunity to fight monsters at range, in melee they do next to no damage, because the main ranged stat perception does not improve the damageoutput of melee much. The Ranger gets a point blank shot, this does not really help to improve his damage output. Magic classes are strong until the monsters get rediculous high resistance against their magic school. Most monster are resistent against a magic school or general resistent against all magic, so tough luck if your chosen magic school like fire or wind does nothing against that special pack of monsters or the boss. Magic user tend to burn your mana potion resources like mana addicts.Defender, Bladedance and Crusader perform very good, the blade dancer with daggers buffed up by crusader spells is the best damage dealer in the game by a wide margin. He is so op that it brakes the whole class system. You will struggle without a bladedancer or barbarian as damage dealer in your party. The whole class system is borked and unbalancedThe combat relies very much on luck and potion chucking, It does not feel very might and magic like in the later stages of the game. With a suboptimal(no bladedancer or two)  party you get one tough as nails fight after the other, in m&m series the game would throw many easy monsters at you to test your resource managementskills and use of aid spells, but not one hard battle after the other. The pacing is frustrating and not fun even on the easier adventurer mode. The encounterdesign is not good, it is one overly hard battle after the other, even for trash monsters. There is no respawn, the monster count is too low to succed by grinding. M&m x is the only rpg i know where i can't win through overleveling, so for me it is no rpg at all. Leveling your character through grinding, getting better equipment, farming gold, leveling skills is what makes a good rpg for me. the skill system is more might and magic like. It is very rudimental and easy. You have 4 skillpoints per level to invest in your skills, after 7 15 20 skillpoints you can upgrade to a new skilltier, expert, master, grandmaster, you will get boni for each upgrade. Some skills are more powerfull then others. So magic skills get 5% 10% 15% spell penetration and more resistance against that magic school while the infamous dagger skill gets expert 1 extra attack and plus hitrate, and on grand master 2 extra attacks and plus hitrate. Combined with dual whield skill you can get a staggering amount of 6 attacks per round, your bladedancer becomes a weapon of mass destruction. Compared to this all other skills and magic school are just a joke in terms of damageoutput. You will need some skills/spells to progress like protection against status ailments, healing spells but for raw damage dagger and dual whield is greater then none.Per levelup you get 4 attribute points you can allocate where you wish. For a seasoned rpg player it should be easy to get a deasant build. Melee 2 strength 1 perc, 1 vit, magic 1 magic, 1 vit 2 spirit in the beginning and 2 magic 1 vit 1 spirit later when you have enough manapoints (never).I think the game release was rushed, the gameplay is boring and frustrating, the encounters are onesided against the player to the extreme, you cannot grind in a rpg!, the performance is bad even for the grafics and on excellent gaming rigs, the skills, classes, monster encounters are not balanced at all. I do not recommend this game.Have a nice day			"

Its not very well optimized and a bit laggy but i don't care lol...the game is fun. Awesome old school strategic RPG thoroughly enjoyed it and the DLC. Admittedly it is flawed but anyone can see its only because they ran out of time or money and alot of assets from Dark Messiah had to be added, the models that they did make are awesome though...the art is absolutely grade A fantastic and the story is classic M&M.

												I paid for the early release.  The game is very old school but is very incomplete, if it was released in the state it is now, 2 patches, you would not be happy. As I have stated it is ubfinished. For example, the second patch added ability to conpare items and mark map. If you have the money and want to be involved in the development process then try it,however, i can not stress how much the developers need to add. The animations are rudimentary. The sun cycles are not yet right. It is old School. If the Devs add voice and animations to brind it into this decade it will be a hit. I wanted a game like the ones from the 90s but with bells and stuff from 2010. It is far from thatUPDATE AFTER MOST RECENT PATCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Looks great!the finished game is now out and did mot let me down..The game is complete and with the new patch it is a must buy for those that played the original M&M or ever loved the 4 party square based game.+GREAT OLD SCHOOL FEEL AND CAPTURED THE SPIRIT OF THIS TYPE OF GAMEif u liked this type of game in the past you will love this iteration.However, if you do not like turn based  games and controlling a party on a grid, not like a tactical grid only used in fights, specifically grid moves and fights. You may not like this style of game. Lastly, for 25 dollars it is a steal for the older crowd that played these games as kids. If you want to see what old school really is like with todays grafixs /bells and sound go for it.If you despise turn based role playing dnd type games with clues, lore, and story then this game is not for you.

												Pains me to do so but Steam's inadequate yes/no recommendation system strikes again.  I'm not entirely sure of the development of this game but I suspect Ubisoft just threw these guys permission to use the license and very little in the way of funding.  The game feels extremely low budget.  Worse than some indie games.  Even looking past superficials like the unpolished graphics and lack of voice acting (things one would assume to be better with a AAA publisher) the mechanics are overly shallow such that most people will probably burn out on the excessive content due to tedium.Melee is very basic with only one talent tree and limited attacks.  Range is pointless given the number of ambushes you face (and there's a penalty for shooting things at point blank/melee range).  The magic schools don't feel sufficiently different and mostly consist of nukes plus a couple of superfluous buff spells.  Yes, there are towns and quests and merchants and the occassional puzzle but all of it is very rudimentary.  Itemization is terrible consisting of a few hand placed relics with the rest being randomized Diablo-style crap.MMX Legacy should be more polished and deeper than Grimrock (and not merely a turn-based alternative).  It isn't.  Moreoever it is arguably worse in some aspects like level design, character progression, itemization, etc.  You're better off playing the old Bard's Tale series as the graphics are only slightly worse but the gameplay is much deeper.   But that was funded by Interplay, right?  Well... this was ostensibly funded by Ubisoft.  Apparently not.  A shame.  Had they given this the funding they put in other iteration of the M&M series this would have been a fantastic game.  In its current condition it is mediocre at best.			"

												Forget about the fail MM9, this is back to it's roots, back to MM6-8 goodness.With better graphics, better skill system, better artworks and very interesting classes. The turn-based movement and fights system is interesting and works very well with the game, although you might need to get used to it nowadays. The story is good and carries you over a continent, several magical places and through at least two dreams/memories.PROS:- it's Might and Magic with it's old charm and playability- classes are great, each one of them has a different skillset and you can spend hours optimising and synchronising parties to reach the best combo.- lots of items, magic and world to discover- it's funCONS:- the turn-based/step moving may not be for everyone. Also, maps tend to be quite complex and the graphics around sometimes does not really reflect where you can and can not go, which will make you look more at the minimap, than the actual screen when moving. (Yon-chall forest, looking at you!)- maps can not be scrolled. World map shows artwork without paths and local map shows only vicinity around you. What makes running to the other side of the map a bit more difficult, when trying to find things or people.- the very last level in the last dungeon, where you'll meet the Big Bad of the story and he will attack you and disappear only to come back in a while and attack you again is more annoying than difficult.TL;DR - ""back to oldschool"" RPG game with very well made classes, skills and character development system. The story isn't bad either and the graphics is much better than oldschool games.			"

												Overall an excellent game - a definite must for anybody who remembers Worlds of Xeen. And while for my nostalgic value definitely amplified level of satisfaction, large amount of  mysteries and puzzles, solid character building should be interesting for any turn-based RPG fan.Personally,  I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs (game has been fairly solid on single GTX 660) and rendition of M&M universe was quite nice, Balance is also very good. Of negative things, I wish it did not require UPlay.			"

												I pre-purchased since I was a fan of the old school MM games. This game started out rough and only barely improved over the months. While it certainly has a bit of the old school feel it's also poorly designed and just not fun. I can understand wanting to recapture the nostalgia but in seeking to recreate the old classics they seemed to have mostly recreated all of the crap parts and left out much of the fun. This game is awful, especially at the price point they are asking and I would not recommend to anyone.			"

												REVISED (Post-Release)The released version does apply quite a bit of polish to the early version. Better graphics and options, smoother gameplay, etc. I'm addicted to a classic-style RPG.Like others have said, if RPG = Skyrim for you, try before you buy here, only because it can come off as outdated. That said, a ""custom party of four RPG"" is a timeless formula that should be sampled by all fans of the genre.PLEASE open this up to Steam Workshop!!!			"

												Good recreation of classic Might & Magic games of old. Lots of potential, but at this point there is only 5 hours of gameplay released for early access. If you like Turn-based RPGs, you'll love this game. Just wait until final release version before purchasing.			"

												Do not buy. Once your enganged in melee you can not move until you get yourself out, usally by pushing the mob back with something like gust of wind. That moves them back one square. Oh wait you already cast so you cant move until the next round. Now the mob moves back in range. So you need 2 casters to disengage if possible. But the first 3 bosses are immune to knock back and deal increased damage if you block or dodge their attacks.Celestial armor abosrbs X amount of physical damage. It does not stop you from getting poisoned or taking poison damage. Theres several spots where you have to fight multiple ranged opponents at once and they get the drop on you.Did I mention I was playing this on adventurer and Ive beaten wizardry 8?			"

												Might and Magic X - Legacy is manything but anything.It is true, the game is still in development, the game appear quite short at the moment but progresses have been vastly made since day 1 pre release and new updates keep coming up. It is not super fast but they keep coming up and considering the team is not huge then I tip my hat for their tremendous effort.This game is an interesting mix and remix of old days M&M and tile RPG mixed in our todays 3D engine capabilities.The game sticks well to M&M while trying to keep it cohesive and loose at the same time. The dev have so far been doing a real good job and I invite M&M lovers and new comers to this game for cozy days or during work lunch time for peaceful and definitely transporting time.Also as a good note, users can mod for the game and it is not too complicated with the use of Unity.

												I was looking forward to this. I have warm, fuzzy memories of Might and Magic VI, it was the first game that introduced me to generic fantasy and sword and sorcery. I was thrilled to see a non-heroes M&M title.This game is a complete disappointment for me. I came expecting to enjoy more of the bliss that VI-III and left sad and with less money.The game does not have paper doll inventories, does not have free movement, and didn't let me push a snake dude off a cliff with a wind spell.It is not worth my time, and if you wanted to experience what were objectively the best titles in the classic M&M series this game is not worth yours either.Probably pretty ok if you like the REALLY old ones, though.

												I really enjoy the game so far. It has a unique play style that reminds me quite a bit of a board game, which is a neat concept for a PC game. Some things are a little too powerful, (Ex. The Earth spell Regeneration) but that will probably be worked out seeing as how the game is in beta. I really hope they add a non turn-based play option, because one of my favourite parts of the old Might and Magic games was just running backwards and spam shooting.All in all, a fun game 8.4/10			"

												Sum it up:  If you are a die-hard old school MM fan, this is something that you long for.  If you are a RPG lover, stop by and look for a decent rpg, then you need to look for other better games.I have played through the early access, and it was disappointing. I didn't make a comment because it was still beta phase. The full version has made tremendous improvments. For instance, the weapons won't break every second; you wouldn't fail to see your fingers at night due to poor lighting design. I see more barrels with more intereting content and better designed balance such as monster strength and potion pricing.However, the core problems of the early access are not addressed.First is no innovation at all. The game play and design is shockingly simplistic. You walk, see monsters, press 1144, then the monsters die. Class leveling is a straight one-way ticket. Monster fighting is the battle on who has more potions. This kind of game design maybe interesting 20 years ago. But to produce such a game at 21st century and charge people 25 dollars for it is simply not acceptable. There are some interesting puzzles, but not enough to make the game attractive.Then here comes the cheapskate strategy of reduce, recycle and reuse. Ubisoft used this strategy on heroes VI, I still bear with it. However, what is this?  The monster appearance, NPCs, music and every other thing you see basically comes from dark messiah and heroesVI. Being of the same world Ashan, I guess some repetition is fine. But this games has gone too far. The worst part is these two games are of totally different age and types. Forcing elements of these two games into one feels like a big modded rpg from some random players community like WOG. Not to mention the texture and graphic is horrible. Some people say it doesn't work with 32bit OS, but my win8 64bit seems to have the same problem as well. In one word: they shouldn't charge 25USD just for a recycled product.In conclusion, I am not against turn-based strategy games or rpg. But this game is nowhere on par with any decent modern day rpg. It is good for nostalgia. But if you are a real old school MMM fan you won't be bothered to read this review anyway. So I won't recommend to any general rpg players.			"

												Short verdict: It is a good old school RGP improved by some of today’s standards and I would rate it 8/10Good:- Great character/skill system with many options- Highly motivating due to tough enemies and frequent level ups- Great feeling of getting stronger over time (enemies don’t level up)- Lots of different items to loot- Long playtime (at least 60 hours)- Comfortable automapMixed:- Fights can be really hard in early game (and depend on luck because of critical hit chances on crucial characters/enemies)- No group formation (but other crowd control possibilities)- No respawning enemies means no grinding possible- At a certain point (near the end) the fights get too easy and repetitive- Much backtracking- Much higher reward for quests (xp) and boss fights (loot) compared to regular fights- 2 passive companions kind of expand the party to 6 characters- Graphics are mediocre but good enough to enjoy the gameBad:- Unclear dead ends because some locations/characters/items are available but can’t be used because you don't have the needed characters in your party- Quest progress might get blocked by having no room for a needed companion- Still some bugs (huge lags while moving is the only problem that happens a lot)- You can't scroll the minimapDetails:Think of a mixture of Legend of Grimrock and Wizardry8 (there might be better comparisons but those games come to my mind).At first glance it looks like another LoG because of the tile based movement. But combat rather feels like Wizardry 8 since it is fully turn based so no moving/strafing around and wild clicking like in LoG.What is really different and could be seen as flaw is that it doesn't use any group formation. I really had to get used to this as I clearly expected to be able to place my weak characters in the back so that they won't get hit but in fact the whole group (and also a certain amount of enemies can) share 1 tile. But the game uses other features to circumvent this ""flaw"". Every character can easily (1 skill point) learn a skill that if he uses it for attacking lets the enemy counterattack this character the next round. So you have to use this special attack for your fighter/high defense/hitpoints characters to draw the attacks of enemies away from your mages/rangers. The problem with this is that you often face more than 1 (or 2) enemies at a time, some enemies are simply immune to that kind of taunt and strong enemies also often use group attacks that harm every member so even when using that skill the weak characters die/fall unconscious more often than your ""front"" warriors which really can be annoying. Falling unconscious only means losing the experience points from any enemies that are killed during that state while dead characters can only be revived with high level skills or in town. The fighting in general can be very tough. You often stumble over enemies that easily wipe your party. But this also is one of the best parts of that game - at least for me. It is highly motivating to encounter enemies you can't defeat yet but knowing that you will defeat them when you come back later. I love RPGs that handle it this way. Another thing I like is that enemies don't respawn. When you clear an area it stays cleared.Although I think that the fights are tougher than e.g. in LoG, the game is quite forgiving since you can easily quicksave/reload (not during fight though). Also it is much more convenient to play thanks to the excellent automap. The story of the game is mediocre I think and also there are no great characters that kept me engaged. But what keeps me motivated is the constant feel of reward because you level up quite often and always get attribute and skill points to distribute. Once you reach a new skill level (novice, expert, master, grand master) you need to find the correct trainer so that you can finally unlock the benefit of that skill rank. So the game always keeps you going (something e.g. Wasteland 2 lacks of). What greatly adds to the motivation is an item system comparable with diablo. So there are tons of items to find that always are a little better than the one you already own. There are green items with 1 magic attribute, blue with 2 and yellow (relics) that get up to 4 attributes but need to gain experience first. Those also don't need to be repaired - correct, items get worn over time and need to be repaired to restore their full potential. But this happens quite slowly and most of the time you found better gear already before you have to repair the old one. You can argue about if fights are rewarding enough though. You gain much more experience by completing quests and also the loot of the standard fights consists of standard (random?) items like potions or mostly useless gear. So only boss fights drop something special but most stuff can be found in chests (which are often hidden though).Secrets are also discussworthy. You don't have to search every wall for that special mark you have to click like in LoG but instead you either need to cast a spell that wears off after 50+ turns (depends on magic skill) and marks secrets or you need the correct companion to find secrets. Companions are also a neat idea. You can have up to 2 join and they give some special bonus to the party like better prices at the merchant or a healing now and then. Most of them need to be paid though and some quests let you have join one. There is one annoying problem with the companions. There are some that join for quests and you can't remove them from your party until the quest is solved. Also there is a horse as companion that doubles your inventory which is very important - at least for hoarders like me. To be honest you don't need it and will have enough gold to buy anything by the mid of the game anyway... But I ended up having the horse and a quest guy that needed to go to a special place I could not yet reach and the result was that I was blocked in the main quest until I got rid of lots of stuff and my horse to be able to continue.So back to the secrets: Once you found a secret you still have to decide which character of your group wants to try to ""use"" it. Different secrets make different checks for might, magic or perception (I think). You can either learn the different signs or just reload if it didn't work (the char will fall unconscious if he fails). The same can be sad about the barrels that can be found everywhere. They contain a liquid with different colors and every colour stands for a stat that increases permanently when drinking the liquid. So it is the basic functionality of permanent +1 to some stat that you know from other modern RPGs where you have to collect flowers or similar stuff and this also adds some motivation.I didn't mention the biggest flaw in my eyes yet: You will stumble across certain quest items/characters/locations that won't do anything because they are only available for certain characters and you can't have all of them in your party. That is some really bad design here because you end up confused and don't know if you are missing something or if it is just not possible to do something. I ended up checking forums whenever I was uncertain if I am blind...Also I should mention that large parts of the map are blocked as long as you didn't get certain ""skills"" that let you pass through. I think that mechanic is ok, it only causes much backtracking to locations you couldn't visit earlier. It is only really annoying when such a block is deep within a dungeon. You can mark such spots on the worldmap so at least they are easy to find later (the map can become clustered with notes though).So in the end I had a mixed experience. Most hours were great fun and I couldn't stop. Some were quite annoying and in the end I didn't finish the game because it was too easy and I already got most of the rewards/unlocks/max skills I was playing for.			"

												I think M&M X was somewhat entertaining. A decent game, I guess, but then again I'm super easily entertained. I also wouldn't buy this for 25 dollars. Here's why:A big portion of the game time is spent walking around, searching for the right trainers to unlock your skills or running around in repetitive mazes and teleport puzzles. Or trying to find some quest location on the game map. It feels like an unnecessary method for increasing play time.My game crashed every now and then. The graphics glitched and sometimes even the battle music got stuck in a loop, so I had to listen to it even though there were no monsters around. Apparently some of the quests have been buggy. I had to go and fetch a particular quest item twice, because the game wants you to do certain things in a certain order.The combat system was a bit unbalanced. There's a set number of monsters in the game, so you can't just kill monsters to grind XP and to learn new tricks. First half of the game I kept getting instakilled and the second half I was always several levels ahead of the monsters I encountered. Even the boss fights posed no threat, which was pretty boring.The story is just an excuse for a bunch of fetch quests. It failed to make me feel even a least bit involved.Overall the game is okay, but it's nothing to write home about. There just isn't anything special about it.			"

Posted: April 17, 2014
												I'm going to slog through this game anyway out of dedication to the series, but honestly... it's pretty bad. If you've ever played any of the original Might & Magic games and were excited to play the much-hyped revamp... well, that's too bad, because there isn't really anything they have in common with them aside from some loose superficiality.Character creation:There really isn't any. This may seem surprising at the outset -- after all, hasn't this kind of always been a hallmark of the entire series? Tweak your character and your party (because, hey, who wants the default party, right?) and test your theories to see if it's survivable. Sometimes you may not even find out until halfway through the game. Balance your party with early, mid, and late-game classes, and grind your way up to success, right?Well.. no. There are four races, and each race has three classes (a 'might' class, a 'magic' class, and a hybrid class). Each one gets one or two special abilities once they're promoted (like MM6), and also like MM6, you have to receive 'training' to go from novice to expert to master to grandmaster in your skills. Like MM6, these trainers are also spread all throughout the world, and you have to learn where they are (or read a spoiler). Your class choice feels almost entirely flavourless, and pretty much only determines what skills you can raise to what caps (and at times, what skills you can even learn at all). Also, you only get four party members.Control and feel:The game is on a grid, like Xeen-style era of Might & Magic, and things only move when you do. Monsters don't patrol, however, and unless they 'see' you, they won't go anywhere. When they do see you, the 'danger' light turns hostile, and they will proceed to chase you... forever. You cannot outrun monsters or get them to some kind of 'tether' range, so if you step into the wrong area, your only option is to reload the game. There is no fleeing.NPCs are also like the Xeen era of M&M, in the sense that they appear to only be found in towns (or in map objects on the main map), and do not move. They CAN be found standing around in the game world in towns, but do not actually move. The ones that you can't talk to (which is most of them) do, however, tend to say one of possibly four or five quipped lines, which will replay, endlessly, every time you are standing near them. This is also true of 'environment' sound effects like mumbling, people shuffling things, hammers on anvils, etc. It is generally one sound that loops forever until you step away.UI:The UI is pretty minimal, which is OK. There is an 'action bar', akin to the one on most MMOs, with 10 slots that you can set for each of your 4 party members. Frequently, however (particularly on a mage), you will have to go to your skill book and manually cast from there, as it's simply not feasable to have everything you need on the bar. Not a big deal; it's split up intelligently.There is a minimap, which autorecords your progress on a gridded map. Unfortunately, however, you can not scroll this map even when you make it larger, so if you're looking for somewhere that's off the side of the enlarged map, too bad.Gameplay:There aren't terribly many spells per spell 'level' per school, but there are a lot of schools, which means there's still a hefty amount of spells. Unlike previous games in the series, there are not 'master' or 'grandmaster' schools of each element, there are simply libraries in each town that have all the spells and you pick from there.Weapons and armour can break (this appears to be random chance -- I had a new item I just picked up break in a second combat, and a weapon I used the entire game until then -- 17 hours in -- never break), which degrades their stats until you go to town to repair it. There is no 'mobile repair' that I've encountered yet, though perhaps there is a spell for it that I'm unaware of.Like previous Might and Magic games, you can have two 'hirelings' (sometimes one or both may be a mandatory 'quest' hireling), but these hirelings do not participate in combat as they did in the later versions -- they are back to simply providing an auxiliary benefit for a small percentage cut of your gold and a hiring fee.There is no grinding, not because grinding is not necessary, but because monsters do not respawn. Ever. If you have killed a monster, it is permanently gone. This means that there is a *fixed* finite level of gold and loot in the game, and even things like the ""well, it'll respawn in a few months"" option in previous iterations of the series is gone.There is no party formation -- each spot in the party lineup is equal, and it doesn't matter if you get flanked or attacked from behind. Everything does the same damage with the same random odds of it hitting someone as anything else.Like some later M&M games, you get food (called 'supplies' in this one) to camp, and can only camp so many times before having to resupply. Camping cannot be interrupted.Areas are 'gated' by progress -- did you put points into 'shield' to get it to expert level (the first tier past the starting one) so you can have that extra edge on the boss you're fighting in the beginning? Well, too bad, because that's in the second town, and you can't get there no matter what because some NPC is standing around saying the bridge is off limits, or the gates are shut, or what-have-you. Everything is limited in this fashion -- you may be given a region to explore in that's open (and consequently, may have monsters too hard for you -- which, again, you can't run from, you simply have to reload), but anything outside of that region is always gated. Don't know what trainers are available in the area and don't want to read spoilers? Sucks to be you, because if you opted to put things into your skills and got to a skill tier that's in the next 'zone', you don't get to use it.You have one single inventory, and it's on a grid that does not get larger. Later you will find yourself needing to stop your dungeon delve to go back to town to sell everything, which is mildly obnoxious. I don't yet know if the Lloyd's Beacon spells have made it into this game, however, because...Faithfulness to source material:None. This isn't Might & Magic, this is Heroes of Might and Magic: the RPG, which is a *distinctly different game*. The original Might & Magic games were a kind of silly but fun hybrid of extreme sci-fi with high fantasy. There were spaceships and computers and people and races from other planets, and later your samurai would be dodging ray guns from robots. There is and will be none of that here (one early NPC, in fact, says he was exiled because he thought that stars might be other planets), because this is all set in Ashan, the world from the Heroes of Might and Magic games. This is actually *incredibly irritating*, much moreso than I thought it would be or than it sounds on the surface, but I think it has something to do with the fact that this was touted as a long-awaited return of a game for the fans, and then (presumably Ubisoft) proceeded to crap all over everything that would've actually done that.Conclusion:The game basically feels like Grimrock, except there aren't any secrets you can spy (you just cast the detect secrets spell, and if you don't have it up, the secrets don't show up, period) and the plot is less interesting. Yes, the plot is *less interesting* than ""yo we put you doods in a hole gl hf."" I've dutifully been reading everything that I've come across, including all the lore books, and I really just don't care at all about it. It's extremely low-tier regional politics (that will, I'm sure, eventually involve demons or angels or both), and I'm 20 hours in (the amount of time sunk being telling, given that everything is gated and linear). I'm really not happy with it. The entire game plays like a demo game that's a lead-in for user content. Sad.			"

												I'm going to slog through this game anyway out of dedication to the series, but honestly... it's pretty bad. If you've ever played any of the original Might & Magic games and were excited to play the much-hyped revamp... well, that's too bad, because there isn't really anything they have in common with them aside from some loose superficiality.Character creation:There really isn't any. This may seem surprising at the outset -- after all, hasn't this kind of always been a hallmark of the entire series? Tweak your character and your party (because, hey, who wants the default party, right?) and test your theories to see if it's survivable. Sometimes you may not even find out until halfway through the game. Balance your party with early, mid, and late-game classes, and grind your way up to success, right?Well.. no. There are four races, and each race has three classes (a 'might' class, a 'magic' class, and a hybrid class). Each one gets one or two special abilities once they're promoted (like MM6), and also like MM6, you have to receive 'training' to go from novice to expert to master to grandmaster in your skills. Like MM6, these trainers are also spread all throughout the world, and you have to learn where they are (or read a spoiler). Your class choice feels almost entirely flavourless, and pretty much only determines what skills you can raise to what caps (and at times, what skills you can even learn at all). Also, you only get four party members.Control and feel:The game is on a grid, like Xeen-style era of Might & Magic, and things only move when you do. Monsters don't patrol, however, and unless they 'see' you, they won't go anywhere. When they do see you, the 'danger' light turns hostile, and they will proceed to chase you... forever. You cannot outrun monsters or get them to some kind of 'tether' range, so if you step into the wrong area, your only option is to reload the game. There is no fleeing.NPCs are also like the Xeen era of M&M, in the sense that they appear to only be found in towns (or in map objects on the main map), and do not move. They CAN be found standing around in the game world in towns, but do not actually move. The ones that you can't talk to (which is most of them) do, however, tend to say one of possibly four or five quipped lines, which will replay, endlessly, every time you are standing near them. This is also true of 'environment' sound effects like mumbling, people shuffling things, hammers on anvils, etc. It is generally one sound that loops forever until you step away.UI:The UI is pretty minimal, which is OK. There is an 'action bar', akin to the one on most MMOs, with 10 slots that you can set for each of your 4 party members. Frequently, however (particularly on a mage), you will have to go to your skill book and manually cast from there, as it's simply not feasable to have everything you need on the bar. Not a big deal; it's split up intelligently.There is a minimap, which autorecords your progress on a gridded map. Unfortunately, however, you can not scroll this map even when you make it larger, so if you're looking for somewhere that's off the side of the enlarged map, too bad.Gameplay:There aren't terribly many spells per spell 'level' per school, but there are a lot of schools, which means there's still a hefty amount of spells. Unlike previous games in the series, there are not 'master' or 'grandmaster' schools of each element, there are simply libraries in each town that have all the spells and you pick from there.Weapons and armour can break (this appears to be random chance -- I had a new item I just picked up break in a second combat, and a weapon I used the entire game until then -- 17 hours in -- never break), which degrades their stats until you go to town to repair it. There is no 'mobile repair' that I've encountered yet, though perhaps there is a spell for it that I'm unaware of.Like previous Might and Magic games, you can have two 'hirelings' (sometimes one or both may be a mandatory 'quest' hireling), but these hirelings do not participate in combat as they did in the later versions -- they are back to simply providing an auxiliary benefit for a small percentage cut of your gold and a hiring fee.There is no grinding, not because grinding is not necessary, but because monsters do not respawn. Ever. If you have killed a monster, it is permanently gone. This means that there is a *fixed* finite level of gold and loot in the game, and even things like the ""well, it'll respawn in a few months"" option in previous iterations of the series is gone.There is no party formation -- each spot in the party lineup is equal, and it doesn't matter if you get flanked or attacked from behind. Everything does the same damage with the same random odds of it hitting someone as anything else.Like some later M&M games, you get food (called 'supplies' in this one) to camp, and can only camp so many times before having to resupply. Camping cannot be interrupted.Areas are 'gated' by progress -- did you put points into 'shield' to get it to expert level (the first tier past the starting one) so you can have that extra edge on the boss you're fighting in the beginning? Well, too bad, because that's in the second town, and you can't get there no matter what because some NPC is standing around saying the bridge is off limits, or the gates are shut, or what-have-you. Everything is limited in this fashion -- you may be given a region to explore in that's open (and consequently, may have monsters too hard for you -- which, again, you can't run from, you simply have to reload), but anything outside of that region is always gated. Don't know what trainers are available in the area and don't want to read spoilers? Sucks to be you, because if you opted to put things into your skills and got to a skill tier that's in the next 'zone', you don't get to use it.You have one single inventory, and it's on a grid that does not get larger. Later you will find yourself needing to stop your dungeon delve to go back to town to sell everything, which is mildly obnoxious. I don't yet know if the Lloyd's Beacon spells have made it into this game, however, because...Faithfulness to source material:None. This isn't Might & Magic, this is Heroes of Might and Magic: the RPG, which is a *distinctly different game*. The original Might & Magic games were a kind of silly but fun hybrid of extreme sci-fi with high fantasy. There were spaceships and computers and people and races from other planets, and later your samurai would be dodging ray guns from robots. There is and will be none of that here (one early NPC, in fact, says he was exiled because he thought that stars might be other planets), because this is all set in Ashan, the world from the Heroes of Might and Magic games. This is actually *incredibly irritating*, much moreso than I thought it would be or than it sounds on the surface, but I think it has something to do with the fact that this was touted as a long-awaited return of a game for the fans, and then (presumably Ubisoft) proceeded to crap all over everything that would've actually done that.Conclusion:The game basically feels like Grimrock, except there aren't any secrets you can spy (you just cast the detect secrets spell, and if you don't have it up, the secrets don't show up, period) and the plot is less interesting. Yes, the plot is *less interesting* than ""yo we put you doods in a hole gl hf."" I've dutifully been reading everything that I've come across, including all the lore books, and I really just don't care at all about it. It's extremely low-tier regional politics (that will, I'm sure, eventually involve demons or angels or both), and I'm 20 hours in (the amount of time sunk being telling, given that everything is gated and linear). I'm really not happy with it. The entire game plays like a demo game that's a lead-in for user content. Sad.			"

												It's a mixed bag really, for die hard fans of the series it's probably enough to keep you going right to the end just to see the familiar characters / monsters.However it's biggest problem is what I would call it's tipping point, at one stage you realize that you can pretty much faceroll any encounter and should probably just cut to the chase and head on to the final battle, which is not very enjoyable, despite it having a challenging and satisfying start to the adventure.Further dismay awaits in what can only be described as 'painful' voice acting, even the automatic checkouts at Tesco have more passion :-P			"

												I was going to recommend it, but the bugs (even two freakin' years after release) really annoyed me during the final boss fight with erebos. The game has that 90s nostalgia to it, and feels like the M&M classics (I've played MM3 through MMIX). However, it just didn't feel like it received the playtesting that it should have. Too many bugs. Combat movement a pain in the butt. Annoyingly long walks from location to location. Sometimes having to quit the middle of a dungeon and slow walk all the way back to town to restock. These aren't huge things to fix, but they're enough to really detract from gameplay. Disappointed.			"

												I did like some of the ideas in this game.  I found the combat good and engaging.  But I found the story-line kinda meh, as well as the world itself and the character advancement system.  As for the world, it just felt small and constrained.  The maps weren't huge ans sprawling, and there didn't seem to be many varied areas, and only 3 real towns.  Characters were far more constrained, with limited viable builds for each one.  Characters also didn't go up to 100+ levels like they did in the old games with vast piles of skills to invest your points (with the freedom to add points past the mastery to partially compensate for the limitations of that character).  The game felt small and pedestrian.  One might argue that the grid-based system constrained it, but I remember World of Xeen still seeming far more epic (probably because of a larger step-size for outdoors and a lot more dungeons).  And of course M&M VI-IX was more free-roaming, with huge maps, and used a world map to split the gameworld into far-flung areas (but I found the combat in those games as very basic, without the epic close-up heavily animated sprites of the Xeen games)..  So yeah, this is a pale shadow of previous Might and Magic games.  I hope Ubisoft goes back to the roots of the series and builds a word more true to the New World/3D0 franchise of old.			"

All you do is hurt the devs by not buying this because of uplay, Ubisoft don't care, they'll use uplay regardless of whether people buy their games or not.But to clarify this game doesn't need 'always on' uplay drm, which is what steam is, it just requires a single activation via uplay, after that you can go offline.So overall, decent dungeon crawler, I would recommend it.

												TL;DR:  You are better of with the Legend of Grimrock I and II.  Uplay DRM sucks. Ubisoft. Go ♥♥♥♥ yourselves.History:My first Might and Magic game was Might and Magic 3, on DOS.I bought this due to Nostalgia.UPLAY's DRM:What's the difference between a virus and Uplay? A virus works.Seriously. It's more like UPRAY the damn thing works.Now I know why their logo looks like a sphincter, because I got ♥♥♥♥ed in the♥♥♥♥♥They changed my ubi.com account to a uplay because '♥♥♥♥ you' that's why. But, then there was a password breach.Now. I can't log into my other account. 'Forget Password' is a button that does nothing.   ...NOTHING!When creating another account in-game it says Ubisoft's servers are down.Ubisoft servers seem to go down more often than a two dollar hooker.Yet, I was able to create an account on their webpage.Why does it work on the website but not in-game? Because '♥♥♥♥ you', that's why.Seriously ♥♥♥♥ YOU Ubisoft. I only bought this POS for nostalgia (and regretted it 20 minutes later). If you're an Ubisoft executive, you should go castrate yourself. You're too stupid to breed.DISCLAIMER:The 40 minutes of trying to bypass the UPLAY DRM just to play the damn game somewhat tarnished my feelings towards the rest of the game.THE STORY:Oh for ♥♥♥♥ sake. This is a perfect example of how NOT to do an intro.You get this amazing rambling piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ while this wonderfully rendered woman reads a book.  Exciting? No. It's like Grandpa Simpson...tons of references, and naming of locations I have no clue about.Imagine the fantasy version of this:""We can't bust heads like we used to, but we have our ways. One trick is to tell 'em stories that don't go anywhere - like the time I caught the ferry over to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so, I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. Give me five bees for a quarter, you'd say.Now where were we? Oh yeah: the important thing was I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones...""That's our intro. The 2D art in the book was nice. It would have been better if these 'Raiders' matched my character.Once in the game, It looked like Unreal Tournament or Quake 3. I had the graphics maxed out. I am rolling with a Titan here. It has to be a bug. But this was my play experience.I found it funny there's a retro option to make the graphics suck more.VOICES: Oh great voices! Oh wait. They give you a line, and you have to read the rest. The character's mouths don't move.It's like I got a game from the late 1990s.  Well, steam offers old games... what is the release date? RELEASE DATE 2014?!?! Oh ♥♥♥♥ you.  Legend of Grimrock was made by an indie studio with almost no budget and looks so much better. This game wishes it was Legend of Grimrock II.At this point, I gave up. This is an indie title made by a big publisher. Poor Developers, they probably would have better luck if they ditched Ubisoft and started a Kickstarter project to fund the game. Ubisoft makes you their ♥♥♥♥♥es and you have to see your work covered in a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥like UPlay. I have no interest in playing anymore of your game.OVERALL: If you REALLY want to play this... I'd recommend pirating this game than buying it. Ubisoft will blame their ineptitude on piracy anyways. The executives are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Buy LoG I and II. "

												A caveat: it was a close call whether to recommend this game or warn people off it. Keep that in mind when reading the rest of the review. Might and Magic X is basically a turn-based hack-and-slash game, and it's strength lies in providing a slightly more cerebral version of the Diablo-like experience: kill waves of monsters with sword and spell, loot the corpses (considerately done automatically in this case), level up and get new powers with which to kill monsters, rinse, repeat. There are people who give you quests, but they're not especially memorable in terms of personality or backstory. Your own characters are flat generic PCs. There a main plot involving insurrection and hidden puppetmasters, and as best I can discern it doesn't have any gaping holes, but it doesn't reach the level of the Dragon Age franchise, much less something like Fallout or Bloodlines. It does, however, provide plenty of turn-and-grid-based combats against enemies with somewhat varied abilities, plus plenty of PCs to customize and difficult, meaningful choices about how to allocate skill points (the source of many of my own considerable play hours.)In general, MM X delivers the turn-based tactical-RPG goods. In particular, however, there are a number of annoyances that detract from the experience: -OCD is mandatory. you need spells of Clairvoyance, Light, Whispering Shadows, a way to repair damaged gear (difficult when in the middle of the wilderness), antidotes and/or Cure Poison, one character with Might primary, one with Magic, one with Perception, etcetera, etcetera. Neglecting any particular little thing will at the very least cost you some opportunities and at most court a Total Party Kill-Hard fights aren't smart fights. Especially hard fights don't require that much tactical sophistication- once you've got a schtick your party can reliably resort to, for instance focusing fire on one enemy while Dark Magic users neutralize the other ones with Sleep, you just have to go through the motions. That means doing the same thing turn after turn, occasionally guzzling potions (of which you will need many). Most of the thinking goes into allocating your characters' skill points when leveling them up, before combat begins. -Take a wrong turn and die. Non-linear game worlds with difficult areas available early can be good things. The problems here are that a) there's relatively little indication of what you're getting yourself into, and b) you can't retreat from a fight (barring, maybe, one or two high-level spells that let you), which means saving and reloading. Think Skyrim, if you didn't have the option of running away from the big ugly like your pants were on fire and instead had to stand next to him trading blows until you drop, or just reload. The game has somewhat more good points than bad, enough to hope that the studio will correct these faults to produce a more enjoyable Might and Magic XI			"

												Seeing has this is my first turn-based rpg i can only judge it on how i thought it was has a game.Answer,the game is awesome.Been a long time since i really got into a good rpg and this definatly fits the bill.No doubt the game has a few faults in terms of optimization and  textures but putting that aside its fantastic.Tons of quests,tons of puzzles,tons of fun to be had and you get between 40-60 hrs out of it.Has you can see at the time of typing this i got about 170 hours playtime on this.Cant get enough of it.If you have the money i advise to buy it especially if it comes on offer.Hope this helps make a decision.

												This game is modeled after Might and Magic 1-5, in the sense that it takes place on a grid and is entirely turn-based.  It has a lot of what made the old might and magic games good to great, but you'll definitely notice some streamlining and trimming of features.  All character skills have shifted towards combat, and you won't reach a point where you get a forester or mountaineer perk that lets you pass through impassible terrain.  Regardless, fans of the series will enjoy a bit tighter of a Might and Magic experience.. and those unfamiliar with the series will be in for some new challenges and possible frustration.  Playing on Warrior difficulty, there were some definitely challenging moments, but I managed to make it through despite picking sub-optimal character classes.  At the end of the day, it was a good solid dungeon crawl with an old-school feel.  Recommended for someone who wants a dungeon crawl with the occasional puzzle.			"

												I started out liking this game but have go to the point of total frustration. It is indeed an open world to run around but you have no idea what lvl the mobs are. If you engage an enemy or mob (just getting near them is engaging) you can not run away. You have to win, die, or load a save file. I think you could see how this sucks. To many times I have turned a corner and killed this my lvl and then about 10 spaces later I would run into a mob that is way overpowered and smashed the hell out of my grp. I think that is something they should address in a patch asap as it makes the game insanely annoying. Also, tring to use bows is pointless because most the time you want to get in melee range and if all your points are in ranged abilities the bows do 50% less in melee range. Lame. Even crossbows x.x . There are more downsides but you can check out other reviews.			"

So, you end up just having a party of mostly magic characters so that the game isn't a horrible struggle. If the game wasn't so magic-biased it would be much better.			"

The graphics are nice but not neccessarily over the top but thats not what this game is about. It's about story and exploration. It's really a throw back to the original dungeon crawlers. Don't expect the massive scale of TES but there are some similarities. Its also refreshing to play a game at max settings that doesn't need a $1-2k system to run. The season pass added some extra missions DLC also.			"

												TL:DR - This is not a faithful recreation at all. The clostest thing you get is the freedom to make your own party of characters and even this is very limited. Besides that, you are moving along with a grid-based world, permentally stuck in turn-based combat. In a world that punishes exploration. ===Combat===Combat is all turn-based. If you and an enemy are right next to each other, you cannot move. This means that once you engage in combat, You're stuck. No leaving. No retreating. And this becomes a serious problem when you start to explore. You will go to areas that you are not prepared for. And You will get into combat with things you cannot fight. And You can't run. You will die... For exploring... In an open world RPG that encourages you to explore. The previous might and magic games have made it possible. But the problem is the addition of this grid based combat/exploration. In previous games, you could go to an impossible difficulty area, and the first attack kills a party member. You turn, and run away. Maybe lose another party member to a stray shot. But you can still run away and escape. Nothing bound you, like a grid does here. If an enemy engages you in melee combat, you're stuck exchanging blows. No smart manuvering or tactical fighting like in previous games or in legend of grimmock.... No, make your attacks, take your blows, repeat until you or the enemy is dead.===Exploration===As mentioned previously, you are punished for exploring if you happen to end up in an area you cannot fight in. You have to use that quick save... Alot. Its not even fun to explore. Everything is grid based. So you will find boundaries, and areas that look like you can go through but you can't because the grid says you can't go here. It's a massive step down from the previous games where you could scale mountions, fly above and look at the whole world, or jump into the water and risk drowning to discover cool treasures. Heck, it was rewarding to go exploring in areas, that your party wasn't prepared for, to grab some of the loot there. None of that in this game.			"

												To be fair, this is my first MM game, but I'm not impressed. I love RP games and I like turned based games (like Civilization) but this seems like a poor excuse for either. It has all the trappings of an RP, but it feels very uninspired. Perhaps it improves, but after 76 minutes, I couldn't force myself to continue on. I killed as many spiders as I could stomach, and I was ready to stab my myself in the eye with my Magic Mouse. I was hoping it would be in the vein of Dragons Age, but I was sadly mistaken. At least I only wasted $10. Now it's time to delete this from my Mac.			"

												Well, I read all the bad reviews, and came to the conclusion that everyone was crazy and they were all rating the early access version of this game.  Wrong.  Honestly, I love and hate this game.  I've played every M&M game before this, (6 being my absolute fave) and am a devoted fan of the series.  But people, this game is EXCEPTIONALLY buggy.  I'm a pretty patient person.  I overlook a lot.  But I have had to start over *3* times because of various bugs.  Once there was supposed to be a rusty key dropped by a couple of guards.  NO key, NO progress.  I killed the guards, the guards did not drop it.  No way to move forward.  Start over.  Once the game ""lost"" my saves.  Star over.  Once the game decided not to let me back into a castle I needed to get into.  Start over.  Then I decided to write this review.  This game will be super fun after a few patches.  It needs work on almost everything. Textures are awful, pop ups appear and disappear, NPCs and followers do not behave as they are supposed to, save games disappear and if you save and reload you may lose things from your inventory, IMPORTANT things  Go read the Ubisoft forums before you pay 25 bucks for this game.  Wait 6 months for the next 3 or 4 patches to go online.  I feel cheated and it's not fun.  If they fix this stuff, I would recommend it wholeheartedly.  If you have the time and patience to restart 3 or 4 times in the HOPES that you might be able to complete, go for it.  But don't say I didn't warn you.			"

The game is very pretty, which is one of the jarring things about trying to play the old games for me.   At low levels, I had a lot of fun.Negatives:  Still some annoying bugs.  Has the most outdated, annoying, frustrating, enraging and overall pisser of a game mechanic in the form of artificial limitations on your characters skillsets. Why can't I have a Freemage with Fire Magic at grandmaster? When I finally noticed I would not be able to achieve my planned skill and spell build I was a bit ticked. It made me nostalgic, indeed.... for the modern games that give me the freedom to build my character the way I want it.			"

Yes the boss ""encounter"" is a ""puzzle"" if you consider walking to 4 corners of a room a ""puzzle""....... but why did I spend 90 hours making a group able kill anything that walks, so that I could NOT fight the FINAL boss and watch him get melted by npc's.The final kick in the teeth was when the expansion starts off by taking away ALL your equipment, all my shiny relics and gear I hunted all over the world, gone.I did enjoy the first 90 hours but the last 1 hour ruined it all.

												I have been a fan of the series since the fifth game, but this one feels like Ubi just felt like throwing sand in the eyes of fans. The graphics are decent, but the game is buggy, the combat is cumbersome and very unfair (the enemies can move when in melee, but you can't), and the characters aren't interesting at all. I'm not just talking about the NPCs, but the ones in your party are also very dull cardboard cutouts and incredibly repetitive in what they say (they also announce warnings for no reason whatsoever). If you choose to play this game, save really, really often – you're going to find yourself constantly reloading.If you want a much more enjoyable experience, I would recommend the Grimrock series instead.

												I agree with those who struggle to give this game a ""thumbs up"". It really makes you hard to rate, especially given the  Steam's yes/no system.Of course, the graphics is great, the soundtrack is great, the gameplay is not so bad - BUT.Why it is so small in all aspects? Even M&M6 was more widescale and it was made 15 years ago! Seriously, why hadn't developers reflected upon that? M&M6 had respawning enemies, several locations per zone and in this ""legacy"" remake everything is not present. Like, WTF?And, yeah, the ""yo dawg"" style of DRM in DRM - having to play through UPlay from Steam - is just stupid, softly speaking.Well, maybe some youngsters from current generation can find this game fun, but I cannot.If you really want to feel nostalgia and experience old school hack'n'slash RPG - try Legend of Grimrock 1 and 2. Those are indeed promising titles.			"

												I write this as a major fan of MMVI and liking MMVII:Don't bother with this game. It is completely directionless and not in a good, open-world way. It's barely any fun because in order to figure out where to go next in order to either advance the story or stop dying during every encounter, you'll spend most of your time reading guides online and reloading.There are many, many better options for anything you think this game will offer you.

												As a game itself this is a great title in the series.  As an installation I'm afraid I am not very satifsfied.  The game does not run direct from Steam but from Ubisoft meaning I had to make yet another account for yet another software company.  This was not apparent upon purchase at the time either.I can no longer access this Ubisoft account and so can not play the game.  If you make a new account the CD code you get upon purchse will no longer work and so I am stuffed, even after reinstalling the game from Steam.I wouldn't have been so frustrated with the program were it not for the fact that game itself was rather good.  Not reccommended due to 3rd party requirements I'm afraid.  And if you search for help or support you will find NONE at all, apart from a few notes about the CD code basically telling you that you're screwed...			"

If I can ever get in I'll update this. Update I was finally able to connect to uplay long enough to activate the game and play. Now i play in offline mode, and its a deffinite throw back, kind of cool game. But apparently even if you bought the game, if you are in offline mode you can't progress and features (like any further than act 1) are disabled. Save yourself the money and don't buy this. I have spent hours just trying to cope with uplay its not worth it.			"

												I have been quite a fan of the Might & Magic series from the 6th game on.Finished 6 once (took a bit long for my taste), but 7, 8 and 9 I finished at least 3-4 times.This game however......Well it is clearly a M&M game judging by the poor'ish graphics and the turn based combat style.I don’t care about none critical mechanics like in M&M 8 getting your crew from taverns or special buildings, thisa gave the game some extra flavor and was interesting to play around with…However so far have not discovered anything new’ish.There is however 1 total game breaker for me with this game M&M X…Being in a constant turn based environment, every step you make is as if you hop like a bunny from place to place… Also the whole world seems to be 1 big huge chess board in which you walk and if your travels brings you not aligned with a door (which will happen like always), but be prepared to make several 90 degree turns to get to that door instead of doing the logical thing of going diagonal...From 6 up to 9 M&M you could walk or jump to every place you wanted like a normal FPS (the walking part), then when enemies were in melee range the game went turn based.This is what I love, this is what I want in my M&M games…Because I love the series in general I will still try to finish it regardless of its flaw, but I will never recommend this game. Simply because I don’t like this game. "

												Well what to say, this game is great a good old dungeon crawler with a freaking point to it. There is no grinding passage from what I know you just go explore this nicely made world and its wonders. The game mechanics are refreshing since most games nowdays are only about fastpaced action. And I enjoy it the most because i have enough time to go get me more coffee while in combat. Puzzles combinet with game world with keeping in mind logic that human brain should use are nice. On account of bugs mentioned well I did not see any so far at all. Only con is that compared to past MM series this  one is simplified with harder and more tactical combat so zyou dont miss out on fun. Even when I would welcome more things added I'm glad that ubisoft made a game like this and I would like them to continue in making games like this since i enjoy it. Go and enjoy if you catch it on sale buy it for sure.			"

												I'm a fan of old-school RPGs, and I really wanted to like this one, but there are just too many frustrating things about this game. The movement speed on the map is laggy and slow, which becomes incredibly annoying when you're forced to backtrack constantly. There are extremely long load times even on my SSD, and guess what, you're constantly loading save games after bumping into a creature way more powerful than you're capable of dealing with, without warning. These two issues ruined this game for me.You're much better off spending your money on the excellent Legend of Grimrock, which is slightly similar.			"

												I loved mm,6,7 so much and I dont feel like im in an open world at all. I dont feel like i can really explore areas and dungeons because its all blockmovement and every ankle is squared. You cant run away from units if you are getting chased because they will also move 1 unit every time you move a unit. either you must die or only engage in fights you are sure to win.  It promotes the auto save so badly because you simply cannot regret a decision and turn and run.. even a remake with better graphics  or any of the other mm6+ would have been better and way more joyfull.a game is not about good graphics but I cant help to feel like im watching something that was something which is 10 years behind the graphic developement of todays other games. I would always come back to might and magic games and replay it, but this is just too locked. the path units, clunky movements and locked view ankles makes it really hard to see it as an open world game. Im sorry to say but I hope  a new one would be made with very few aspects of the legacy implimentet in it, and more things from the older games.			"

												Playing this for about 25 hours in so far. I like to roam once more in the lands of M&M as i played my last game of this series severel years past when i bought the Limited Edition of M&M VI.I wanted some similar experience with MMX and straight went into the Digital Deluxe Edition.So far so good, but STEAM wrote you get also the Digital Audio CD when paying for that. No it seems not.Thats why:(German) http://might-and-magic.ubi.com/mightandmagicx-legacy/de-DE/shop/index.aspx(English) http://might-and-magic.ubi.com/mightandmagicx-legacy/en-GB/shop/index.aspxOnly boxed Editions get Audio CD. So STEAM just did made a big error to get more Digital Deluxe Editions sold. Very dissapointing. At least the extra Dungeon (Didnt found it yet, wonder where Dreamshard Dungeon is) and 1st DLC for free is a plus.Well the game itself is ok'ish, you got to be a fan of good old Dungeon Crawlers. If you where in for Legends of Grimrock, then prepare for a much bigger World here in MMX, but with simpler riddles. Battles can be tough and i did almost got stuck in the storyline where theres a contentblock where u get to fight an Earth Elemental NPC to get the story rolling. If you arent able to get past it it gets a bit tricky to level up more to get it done. But theres allway a way to squeeze some XP along the walk. Over all its a time consuming Game for those who love such RPGs and therefore you should get it and play it. But dont try to make the 24/7 Achievement. Not recomandable if you not want to get feebleminded.			"

												It's a spiritual successor to the previous Might and Magic games - you know, before they tried going 3D (MM6), then went 3D (MM9) and generally went the way most old-school RPGs at the time did and tried to modernize their worlds when 3D was a bit too new, and screwing everything up. Looking at you, Wizardry 8, Ultima 9 and Might and Magic 9.As a turn-based grid-based dungeon crawler, it's pretty good if a bit simplistic. It follows the lore established by other Might and Magic games, with maximums for skills based on class and only having a handful of those. It's also a bit easy to bone yourself early on, so go read an FAQ or two before tackling. You know, like the old days (where it was on BBSes, or picking up the game guide).Definitely recommended for its quality, and doing a ton with a little and for keeping the flame alive. Would buy MM11 in a heartbeat.			"

												It is not hard core enough to be the greatest chapter of Might&Magic, yet too hard core to be a master piece.Why? A game requires players do their home works...all kind of it...put notes on map, scheduel carefully on their finance, spells, party organizing... etc.. And we haven't touched combat yet.Non-escaping, D&D encounter, Geez! Im both thrilled and damned.Look, I don't want to save before each combat, but I put so much effert into my party, I can't just let them die and reroll the whole game again!strategic wise, there are too many ambushes. Players are pretty much conered most of time.Though it reminds me the old school M&M... we have to move forward around the inconvinient part...If designers expect players plan their own adventure, then make the game more open and allow more mistakes.The game is not hard, it is just unfriendly. But it was done so as intended. Therefore developer is to be blamed.It has the potential to be as great as Skyrim with such a completed resourceful world and mechanism.However, the playing through in an Open world with a Linear and steep learning curse is just sad.The execution just won't do.However,I still recommend this game because it isn't easy to find this style anymore, it is as rare as you can get.

												Having played and beaten this game, I speak from personal experience.The grid system is antiquated and rather clunky, but it does evoke the nostalgia of Might & Magic's past, which was amusing. The story is rather simple, the game play too, and the world is smaller than it feels. All that said, I had fun playing the game. It held all the qualities of a classic RPGLootMonstersHeroesPuzzlesLevelingParty membersQuestsall in all a fun little RPG well worth your time, especially if you buy it on sale.			"

												Pretty much just a stright up dungeon crawl RPG. You get to design 4 characters and customize them, which is in tradition with the old school Might and Magic games. However, now you have different races to choose from each with 3 unique classes. I never much cared for the other MM games, but I like this one a lot. It's really addicting. I also like how its played turn-based on a grid. Some people may not like it but I love it, it reminds me of tabletop D&D. There isn't much to do the second time around, so it is really only good for one playthrough. You get 40+ hours out of one go of it, though, so it isn't a big deal.			"

												I can't say anything bad about this game. I absolutely loved it. Played it completely through once, and recently reinstalled to play through again. Took me a couple tries to get a group i was happy with. It's turn based old school game. It's hard. you can wander into areas you aren't ready for. Some of the puzzles are easy, some are challenging and some so obscure i had to look up the solution online.I loved the length of the game. There was a couple times i wished there was more. I did pick up a few of the dlc's. But would love to see a whole new campaign with the same engine.Don't expect AAA quality of a game. There aren't many voice overs. and little to no FMV. But be prepared to read, and enjoy the depth of the game.Highly recomend this game. I bought this when it first came out. Just decided to write a review now as i seen the low review score.			"

												Even though I had fun with this game, overall I can't really recommend it.If you are a huge fan of the Might and Magic series, you might give it a try, because it will tickle your nostalgia with countless references to the old games and will at some points even feel like them too. But sadly it's nowhere near the level of the old Might and Magic games. This game feels more like a below average RPG trying to be a Might & Magic game instead of a genuine Might & Magic successor.I don't wanna throw around ""bad game design"" as a buzzword, but a lot of moments in this game certainly feel like that. Overall the game lacks a lot of polish. There are a lot of moment which make you question what the developers were thinking and it really needs several patches imo. But sadly the development for this game stopped, so it kinda has to stay in this current state. Let's not even talk about all the bugs this game still has.Contrary to most RPGs I played, the battle system in this game just feels really frustrating and not fun at all. Especially if you don't have a proper party setup the fights can get ridiculously punishing and force a lot of restarts (which take pretty long in this game and are always annoying on principle). On that note, I think the recommended default party is utterly ill-equipped to deal with what the game throws at you in the last third of the game and the DLC. Which is already a really questionable design decision in itself. Before you attempt to play this game, definitely look up a decent party build or the game can actually become extremely frustrating (on normal difficulty) and even impossible to beat (on hard difficulty).The DLC was the final straw for me and the reason I decided to write this review. I have never seen such a badly designed mess. Or well, unfun and frustrating. It was certainly the worst way for me to end this game and left a bad, disappointed and frustrated taste in my mouth.If you wanna get into Might and Magic, play one of the older games (Might & Magic VI: Mandate of Heaven is a good starting point imo), this is certainly not the game to get into the series.If you are already a Might & Magic fan, maybe give it a try. But even then, you would do better just replaying one of the older games instead of wasting your time with this one.And if you don't care about the Might & Magic series and just want a good RPG to play, then avoid this game, because it's just a mediocre RPG which lacks polish			"

												I strongly recommend this title to players who remember the golden age of cRPGs. This may not be everyone's cup of tea but if you like a good old-fashioned dungeon crawl, no other modern titles can touch this.Graphics: The graphics are good but the performance is a bit spotty. Still, if you ever wanted to try an old school dungeon crawler but were put off by the graphics, this will help you get into them.Sound: The sound is wonderful. The music, the voices, the effects, etc all work well.Story: These are not the kinds of games you play for story purposes. Still, if you bother to read all the text, there is a decent story there. There are even texts you can find to figure out the back story of the world or characters.Gameplay: This is where the game scores the highest marks. There are 4 races with 3 classes per race. You assemble a team of 4 from those choices. This makes the game immensely replayable. I have just finished the second act and am already planning my Hard mode playthrough.Also, the game has many nice touches. It has mechanics to limit rest abuse. Potion overuse is limited by hefty potion costs. Over-levelling is slightly limited by the lack of respawns.Overally, I love this game. It was a great surprise.			"

												I'm about 18 hours in atm, but loving this one. It's one of my favorite games of all time. I'm going to have to buy more of the M&M series ones. I see a ton of them on gog.com as well, but not sure which I'll pick up yet. I love the turn based combat, the somewhat open world, the quests, battles, the challenge, spells, leveling up, etc. This is a definite buy if you don't have it yet. As far as the uplay stuff, I haven't had any issues; I've also played other games via Uplay such as Driver San Francisco and never had an issue. I believe you only need to be connected to the internet when you first enter your cd code into uplay, but I'm not postive on that.			"

This game forces you into a fight, and the way that you gain money is totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, 5 gold for a boss? yeah thats decent. morons.Overall, don't do it, if ur new to this Franchise then go ahead, but i promise you, that you'd be better of playing any of the older games, like 5-8			"

However,,,be warned my friends, this game is delivered though UBI soft's dreaded UPLay and whilst I remained patient through 5 hours of regiostration requests (after a 5 min download), the game itself is then awful. The statement of FPS is simply not true and those of us of an age to rememeber Dungeon Master (II, eye of the beholder etc) will remember not a first person shooter but something very different. Awful even at Hi-Res with the suggestive quest development mechanics that scream of 'go there, come back'.. I would avoid this title until it appears at 90% off. I never learn....but you should...look at the screen shots and the into videos...this is as good as it gets...			"

												Might and Magic X is an ok game that falls short of pretty much all its successors (the word is correct, as technically, MMX is supposed to be something like MM 5.5, hence why you get MM6 to complement it), even the mediocre Might and Magic 9. As if to add insult to injury, UbiSoft gives us the extremely good MM6 as a part of the deal as if to tell you - here, this is what Might and Magic 6 represented - tons of spells, water walking, flight, exploration, the ability to look under every nook and cranny and actually be rewarded for it. Might and Magic 6-8 were the golden years of the franchise, and every game brought the lineage to new hights. Then came MM9 which pretty much destroyed all the exploration, but added new 3D engine and interesting locales with roughly as much freedom as its forefathers.And now, as a slap in the face comes MMX Legacy with its MM6 bonus. Let's compare the two:1. Movement.1.1. MM6 has free movement, turning, water walking, flight, strategic positioning even while entering combat AND during combat.1.2. MMX is rigid as hell. You are forced into a square grid which not only makes the whole movement experince choppy and unpleasant, but also forces you to turn around just as choppily just to see if you haven't missed anything. Why were can't I enter water squares without having a certain god's blessing? Did people simply forget what a Water Walk spell is?2. Combat.2.1. MM6 has the best of both systems - turn based combat and real time combat. Turn based combat works like MMX, while in real time you could fly, play to the enemies' disadvantages (like use Water Walk and escpe on water while range attacking the enemies). It was liberating as hell and actually encouraged strategic thinking.2.2. MMX combat is rigid and there is little need for strategy. Battles are best won if you can put yourself in a corner or a corridor so that only a few enemies at a time have the opportunity to attack you, while you pick them off easily as the others simply wait dumbly for their turns to enter your killzone. And people said that flying and water walking in MM6-8 was exploiting the system...3. Exploration.3.1. MM6 encouraged exploration on any level and at any time and actually rewarded you for it. And to prove that, the devs actually put a flight scroll in your starting city, so that you can go and explore. Opening every inch of a map in MM6 is exciting and rewards you with secret islands off the coast that have money or chests lying around, craters in mountains with obelisks, chests, and other rewards. I even found extremely rare items like artifacts and relics in such chests! Even if you encounter difficullt enemies (like even dragons or titans), you have a chance to fly or teleport away to escape and come back later.3.2. MMX offers little in terms of exploration, mainly because everything is a corridor - and even if you get adventurous and press on, you get punished by it, because you encounter very difficult enemies and have little or no chance against them, which results in death. Artifacts and Relics are found in specific location, and up until now with 2 running play-throughs with 2 different groups, I found the same artifacts in the very same spots in the very sam dungeons. YAY!4. Equipment.4.1. MM6 has tons of gear diversity. You would just bite your nails before opening a chest or looting a body, looking at that hotbar right above your characters. Ding... You find 24 gold and an item (Axe)! - hell yeah, my guy needs a new one, is it better? Ding... You found 1096 gold and an item (Relic)! OH YEAH!!! What does it do? Can I even identify it? Can any of guys use it? OH it's a ring, all of my guys can use rings, but I don't know what it does! Screw that, I am porting to town to find out! This nailbiting, mouthwatering experience is very much gone in MMX.4.2. MMX has a very rigid gear system. 90% of the time I have been finding better stuff in shops than in chests or the bodies of slain enemies. If you want to make a specific character build, you have to rely on the shops in the various cities. And yeah, just go to that same dungeon to get your artifact at the end. YAY...5. Characters and classes.MMX does have more diversity in Race/Class creation than MM6 (12 vs 9), but one can't escape the feeling that many of those race/class combos play and feel the same. They also reuse the MM6 system of making specialized fighters & casters, and then add hybrids of both classes. So in essense, you have 4 warrior classes, 4 Hybrid classes and 4 Caster classes. One nukes more, another heals more. One gets an extra attack, the other is better protected. Hybrids can really accomplish a lot and supplement your party well. A touch and go system, really...In MM6 you had limitations - you Cleric was a poor fighter, but could heal and learn Light/Dark Magic and become an even better healer, buffer, or nuker. Your Knight could wear the best armor and hit like a ten ton truck, and get more attacks per turn. Your Paladin (the Knight/Cleric combo) could hit and heal, but had no access to the best healing & buffing spells from the light tree.Here, you get a Crusader with Lay on Hands for max heals at any given time at the cost of all your mana who can learn Grandmaster Light Magic (cool heals/buffs), Grandmaster Sword (good fighter), Grandmaster Heavy (well protected), Grandmaster Arcane (Lots of magic resistance). Why not have a few of those in your party, then? IMO, Crusaders very much break the game.6. To conclude: please don't get me started on the UDONTPLAY 3rd party DRM...EDIT: As I put it in the comment: That being said, I am a completionist and I will still finish the game. I, however, cannot shake the feeling that it is inferior to all others though. It is like returning to the dark times before your golden age just for the sake of nostalgia.In short, I would recommend that you buy an MM6-8 bundle and immerse yourself in the 3D-ish world of those games. Explore, fly, walk on water, steal stuff and have fun. Don't be swayed by this Grimrock-style Might and Magic game just because of the Might and Magic in it like I was...			"

												Wow what a horrible game... The graphics are extremely dated, and not in a charming way (this game came out in 2014? srsly? Oblivion came out in 2006 and its graphics blow this away!). I have seen indy titles with better graphics and effects, I expect more from an AAA studio. The interface is clunky, wtf is up with the weird ""tile based"" movement system? You are stuck on a grid?!? What is this? Might and Magic II? MM6, 7, 8 and 9 had no problem letting the party freely move and look around, you toggled ""turn based mode"" on and off when needed. This game locks it on runs the world every time you step into the next grid tile (you know the way the old DOS 1-Xeen Might and Magic games did...). The character races, classes and skills are pretty basic and lack the options and depth of the games predicessors. It's like they decided to try to capture the look and feel of old titles but managed to capture all the negative things about them with none of the positive.I haven't played much but I already noticed several assets are recycled from previous games... Mostly sound effects that are from MM6, 7, 8. Several of the jingles, the sound of the quest log opening and closing, the sound of drinking potions are all from the old games. It is laughable and only makes me wish I was replaying one of the old titles.I mean... Might and Magic VIII Day of the Destroyer, a game that came out in the year 2000 had 7 base classes, plus 7 promotion classes, plus the dragons. MMX basically has 3... a ""warrior"" a ""hybrid"" or a ""caster"" and the class is a bit different depending on race. VIII had 35 unique skills, X has 25 and they aren't very creative. Your wizard can't even grand master all of the magic spells. VIII had very distinct magic skills, the 4 elemental magics were for wizards, the three ""self"" magics were for healers and the light\dark were shared (there was also class specific magic...) This game, I am not sure exactly how to distinguish between a healer and a caster, you don't seem to start with any healing spells. The previous few games were cool because you could explore the world freely in real time and then press ""enter"" to go into turn based mode when needed; you didn't feel like you were locked to a rigid grid.Also, dare I say, the graphics are almost better in 6\7\8. I mean sure they are low res pixelated sprite based images mostly but at least the characters wander around in real time, with a walk cycle. Your characters move their lips when they talk (yeah, no one moves their lips at all in X... it is sometimes hard to tell who is talking). It was a bit primative but at least it was easy on the eyes. Even MM3 through Xeen looked good, in a cartoony oldschool DOS way (and in Xeen the characters moved their lips when they spoke.) MM1 and MM2 had crap graphics, grid based game play and you had to draw your own maps (sort of) but they came on 5 1\4 floppies so they get a pass.Plus, no game since 6\7\8 has had the awesome inventory and equipment equip screens that 6\7\8 had. You could actually see what the thing in your inventory looked like and when you put it on your character they actually looked like they were wearing or using that item. MM9 and X went back to the oldschool ""list of items"" method and little squares to put the items in to equip them.6\7\8 had a few animated cutscenes, and they were animated well for their time. This game has an extremely long intro, plus another 10 minutes of naration as soon as the game starts and it is all told with still images and voice overs with characters that can't move their lips.The only thing that X seems to have taken from 6\7\8 is some ripped off audio assets.Add to all of this the ""wonderful"" experience of having to use UPlay... F-ck UPlay. It took quite an effort just to get this game to launch on my PC (among other things I had to sign up for a 3rd UPlay account because for some reason they can't find my old credentials) and - it wasn't worth it.The Might and Magic series peaked with 6, 7 and 8. 9 was OK. X is pretty bad.Go back to remaking ""Heroes"" clones Ubisoft! If this was an Indy title I would cut it some slack but... come on, this is Ubisoft, the guys who brought us Assasins Creed and Far Cry. Ubisoft and Limbic Entertainment are way above ""Indy"" level developers. I haven't been this disapointed with a game with the title Might and Magic since Dark Messiah. These guys are making me start to consider MM9 as one of the ""good"" Might and Magic games... (and I used to hate that game! Well, hate is a strong word. Strongly dislike is more like it.) I miss 3DO and New World Computing. They would have never let this happen.Damn, writing this review has made me want to go back and replay the good Might and Magic games.			"

												I really wanted to like this game.I saw alot of negative reviews on this and went to write a positive review because I was enjoying it.The thing is the more I played it and looked for good things to say the more I find reasons why you shouldn't buy it.Its a dungeon crawler with no random encounters; just scripted battles.The world is displayed as open but plays as if it is on rails.The writing so far is boiler -plate and bland.The production values are terrible, graphics and sounds far below expections, yet despite the low quality of these the loading time are many and long.The quests are handly orginal, the race and class choices are lets face is laughable.As much and I keenly want to recommend this game you are far better off spending your money on legend of grimrock or paper sorcerer.I wanted to enjoy this game and played it far long than I should hoping I would but the fact is it's a waste of your money when there are far worthier games out there.And that is ignoring the plague on humanity that is ubisoft's DRM which just terrible.

The first part of game was great and I am trully dissapointed. When it does crash it changes my desktop background to the same color of the Uplay background which is a bit suspicious and makes me wonder what is crashing. I see above that I have played the game one hour. That is wrong.

												I was not expecting this many bugs for a released game. I find that the ""open world"" that was advertised in the store page to be deceitful. Infact, the game is quite linear. There isn't much room for customization of the party because if you do not have a star squad, boss fights are impossible and you will have to restart the whole game with a better party configuration. Because the game has a linear progression you cannot prepare your party to mitigate the boss fights. The difficulty wasn't what was most appalling, it was the bugs. I would have to restart or reload saves killing a good hour or two of progress to fix a bug. The most annoying of the bugs that occurs the most is the combat music overriding all other sounds. This ends up with multiple combat musics playing at varying times in their tracks and without the sounds from actual combat this results in a sound similar to that of a heavy metal band practicing in a garage.I believe that only die hard fans of the Might and Magic series would enjoy this game. For the price of 29.99 this game was not worth the punishment of playing it.			"

												Pros:- Lots of spells, weapons, armor, and items to satisfy your cravings for treasure.- Engaging and clever puzzles.- Tactical combat that is easy to pick up, but still provides a challenge.- Solid story with characters Might & Magic fans may find familiar.- Simplified level system from previous games.Cons:- uPlay required (They do give you some extras when you use uPlay units though. I don't like it, but at least they give you some nice extras for it).- Slow to load, some objects don't appear properly (several shrubs appeared in the middle of a fight where there were no shrubs/foliage at first a couple times. Not a deal breaker, just a little weird).- There is a glitch that corrupts your save file (If this happens, don't erase your old game! Start a new one and enter the first dungeon. Then, when the game autosaves when you've entered, load your old game!)- Grid movement system isn't for everybody (though the old free movement system from 6,7, & 8 was a little wonky, so do what you like).All in all, highly recommended.

												Initially I had high hopes for MMX as I've been a long time fan of the series since the early 90s, but MMX makes me question the developers ideas because they simply do not work period.  Some of the worst aspects are combat related, such as being locked into combat and no monsters are in the local area, a bug that STILL has not been fixed, this particular bug occurs because of the ridiculously decision to make the combat turn based, where as the previous games was all psedo-turn based meaning you could move your party/pause the game and attack.   MMx locks you into a fight to the death once monsters reach a certain distance from your character, unfortunately I've had this bug out far too many times forcing a reload to a previous point to fix - not to mention this particular type of combat also punishes the players rather harshly against ranged monsters, because you sometimes can't move into melee range!! Absurd but true!!  Honestly - the person who thought up this mechanic should be fired because its one of the serious gamebreaking issues MMx has.If your a veteran of the MM series, you'll know that skill points are valuable but in previous games you had somewhat leeway into making some mistakes with your builds, MMx forces you into very specific builds and characters classes otherwise you could literally become stuck in game without the ability to progress either because of bosses being too difficult or some encounters completely overpowering your characters, so creating your party requires very careful planning and even more careful skill point allocation.  Another major problem MMx is balance, or lack off it.  The balance problems are so bad that I don't think the game was ever playtested properly.   Overall game difficulty is another issue as it wildly increases/decreases, for instance you don't know the level of any monsters and since they cut corners with monsters design (they just re-color) the difference in color of a monster could mean that you have your entire party one-shotted or you one-shot the monster.  But for the most part, you'll die ALOT when exploring, so save literally before every encounter.  Because a typical scenerio when exploring is...kill basic monsters...no problems...oh new monster!! Game Over...reload, avoid area until higher level, it happens far too often which makes me wonder if this development team ever played any of the original might and magic games...I could write on and on about all the complaints and issues I have with this game, but this is one of those games you're either going to love it, or hate it.  I just don't recommend this game to anyone who easily gets frustrated.  It is also especially time consuming because MMx also suffers from excessive loading, with entering buildings/inns...loading...enter/leaving areas...more loading...entering dungeons/new floors...more loading.Basically, This game needs to have the movement lock removed as that would solve many of the issues.

												Yes I did play many hours, but most of these hours were played with a trainer on the side to help compensate for the insane difficulty imbalance of the game, I really wanted to see if it would get better but it did not really...I've played this type of game for quite a while, that includes Dungeons Master, Eye of the Beholder, the original M&M series (including World of Xeen and then the ""3d"" versions), and more recently Grimrock 1 and 2.It's obvious that the team who worked on the game did not have a huge budget, but they managed to have decent graphics and style all over. My issue is more that they got all the small details wrong:- Hit animations and sounds play *before* the attack dice have been rolled, so basically you see characters die, explosion happen, ...BEFORE the main attack animation has even started. That makes the combat frustrating to say the least.- The characters are talking, which is nice, except it was done very badly: When my warrior is stunned, when my magician is dead, I don't want to hear them complain about whatever happen next or point out that they are tired and that we should sleep.- The design involves a lot of instant death, so basically you have to quick save a lot because your next step may just be the last one, and there was no way to know that. People who call that ""oldskool"" don't know what they are talking about. The olsdkool variant is as deadly, but in general designers left you some hints that you were going to have your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you :p- The loot distribution is abysmal, there's no link between the difficulty of a fight, the fact that the objects are well hidden in a super remote place,... it may still be a pointless non magic item.- The whole RPG system is broken. Skills almost don't matter, all that matters is that you can resist whatever is thrown into your face, which means magic shields and armors, resistance buffs, and protections against stunning, weakness, sleep, etc... the rest does not really matter.- Linking the progression of skills with the story events is so unfair... if you picked up some classes or weapons, you will not be able to level them up until way later in the game because you can't access the trainer you need for the skill.- The inventory system is bad (no auto sorting, no auto selling of the trash loot, you can't throw away stuff if you are looting (you have to close the chest, open the inventory, throw away whatever you wanted, then go back to the chest and finish looting)In conclusion I would say that it was a good attempt tech wise, but that the game design was bad, even the story was just generic fantasy with M&M typical characters while totally missing on the less traditional canon (that involves robots and spaceships.)Try at your own risk.

												It looks nice. Although no where as good as the original games ( 1 - 6 were the best in my opinion).Where this titles falls short is having the gameplay plopped on a grid world. The detail in graphics beg for free roaming, like in MM6. But instead, you're forced on this grid like in MM2/3/4/5. The two styles clash against each other, rather than compliment. And then there's the combat. It's turn-based meets World of Warcraft inspired hotbar mashing. You wouldn't even know that's how it's played, unless you read a walkthrough. The game never tells you you can click on the ability more than once in a combat turn .It's just an odd mesh of things that really don't jell together well, unfortunately. I'm sure if you are reall dedicated, you could probably find some enjoyment out of this title. I just couldn't, sadly. Perhaps one day I'll give it another go. Until, I'll play Wizardry 8.			"

												Unfortunately, both non-canon M&M world and poor design (several seconds for a single move/turn? WHAT?), not to mention same attitude towards releasing a product that will reach EoL while still having missing/incomplete features as with Heroes 6 make this game really unattractive.Even if you are new to M&M, and/or liked Heroes 6 despite plaguing issues, I would not recommend paying more than 20% of the release price (~5 EUR) for the deluxe (or complete, when it releases) edition of this game.To long-time M&M fans: you will not find any M&M in this game. 'Legacy' is just a marketing ploy, but Ubisoft is known for officially confirming claims even when they know they are wrong at the time of issuing a public 'official' confirmation.Don't buy it. You don't want to personally become familiar with how Ubisoft treats you and M&M.			"

												This game was a complete letdown. The grid based movement is reminiscent of the previous M&M games of yesteryear, but that is where it pretty much ends.There is very little content.. what is there is generally boring. There is not a large skillset and the story is rather bland. The textures and gameworld look like they were from the MM 3-4 era, which was intentional by the developers. However, that seems like a bad decision. The gameplay elements of the older games was great, the graphics not so much.. updating the graphics and providing some rich looking worlds would have went a long way to improve the overall immersion in the game. There are three towns and only 20 dungeons - that's a very small area to explore and overall, the content is around 20-30 hours of gameplay. That seems weak for any game in the M&M series.Modding support for the game is almost non-existent unless you are an indie developer with a Unity3D Pro license ($1500 - if you want one..) So, don't expect alot of community mods. The only good side is that it has a reduced price tag.. But even at $25, its still over priced for what you get. You are better of picking up a dos box and one of the older games in the series - atleast they have less bugs and a solid story.			"

												Worst Might and Magic ever made.   Even the horrible MM9 was better than this amateur fest of boredom.Bring back the style of MM6 to 8 where WE choose whether it's turn based or real-time and the camera/mouse control is true 3D instead of linear step by step nastiness.			"

												Very fun game and I'd recommend it, especially on sale where it's a steal.  One of those few games that I played obsessively to completion (I usually flit around between games as I own so many and have tons installed, and it's rare that something grips me enough to cause me to focus).The visuals never looked as good for me as they do in the screenshots here and I have a beastly computer - so maybe I was missing something (and usually the first thing I do in any game is check settings/options).The game for all its glory has some of the longest and load times and most pitiful performance of any game I've ever experienced.  It's a testament to how good the game itself is that one can put up with the horrid technical implementation of this game.  I mean, it's a turn based RPG with decent for the style graphics, and there's no execuse for how crappy the game performs when you're out and about in the world, or the insanely long loading times.  You would almost have to intentionally code something intentionally poorly to reach these lows and the fact that zero attempt was ever made to patch in optimization is pretty sad. "

												I am not usually a fan of these type of games, but this one is done very well. I am playing it on the hardest mode, and love how, although the world is pretty linear, it makes it feel a lot bigger when you have to search for your next combat, slowly progressing stronger and stronger. There are no massive stat items that make the game boring shortly after acquiring them, and overall, it's worth the price and will give you a many many hours of play.Unfortunately, some characters are a little unbalanced, such as rangers are nearly worthless as almost all enemies stay in melee range, and tanks don't do a good job of focusing damage on them. I would give the game a 8/10, but unfortunately on steam its like or dislike.			"

												I tried very hard to like this game. Some of my favorite gaming memories are playing early M&M games. I love the retro feel and tile based movement. I like how combat is thoughful and real strategy is needed. However this game just feels unfinished. There appears to be no real and obvious progression as you move through areas. The difficulty spikes in odd places to unplayable levels then lowers to easy for no apparent reason. The loading times are insane for a game of limited quality. The mini map is very poor and there is no way to back out of combat without reloading. If a game needs a narator for more than the opening sequence more though needs to be put into the story. Lastly the character portraits should change as you upgrade your equipment. I found this game exceedengly fustrating to play and after about 100 hours going to quit for a while.			"

Graphics are really behind the times, and gameplay isn't much improved of M&M IX.  Was very disappointed and would only recommend this game for $5 or less.			"

YouTube™ Video: Might & Magic X Legacy Hands on video Preview 

			Views: 1,753		

			http://cramgaming.com - A look at the early access version of Ubisoft's 80s throwback role playing game Might & Magic X Legacy on PC.		

Might & Magic X Legacy in its current state offers some excellent music, solid adventure and some fine character customization making for a worthy game to invest many hours in. Whilst the tile based gameplay might be a little dated, if you can look past this and enjoy the game for what it is, there's an large dose of adventure to be had here for any Might & Magic enthusiast and anyone else who wants in on something slightly off the beaten track. Might & Magic X Legacy is available via Early Access on Uplay and Steam for £19.99 and includes the full game when released, a ton of extra features including the option for the community to make their own content. If early access isn't your thing, then be sure to keep an eye out for the full game when it releases.			"

												As a fan of the later Might and Magic (basically 7 and 8) this game is an utter disappointment.This game is built around die and retrying to a scary level. You basically go to any area possible, get killed by the first mob or barely survive, then have to find the next area where you might possibly be able to advance.Difficulty spikes evenly at moments, for example you get a few solitary mobs for a while and then a pack of 2 and an elite with them which makes the fight annoyingly hard early on.Boss fights are also unbalanced. You might be able to complete their dungeon without pain, and still have to keep away from them,  go somewhere else leveling and getting better equipment, then come back for a hard fight.The mix of multiple mob levels in a single dungeon is also a pain as you are always saving before taking a step in another direction (level 10 in a area and level 15+ not far from it depending on another quest).I don't like the map designs, with at times just annoying path blockers, put there for no apparent reason, and towns are too big (while it makes for a real town for a grid based game it makes it a labor to travel the streets).Overall design quality isn't really good and game is unoptimized. Running into the forest and jungle kills FPS to a stop.Story wise you get a common story which is neither good nor bad per se.Classes are limited and some are apparently almost useless, like the defender which sacrifices damage for a shield but can't use his tanking skills on any boss and a number of mobsBug wise I only had a inconvenience with sound, after 8 hours of game time the combat music wouldn't stop but would be piled upon the last one after each new fight. Reloading or changing map restores the usual sound until the next fight (which isn't hard as you always reload anyway).			"

												The most depressing part of this game is probably Uplay, but if that wasn't bad enough, I mean it is Ubisoft that developed it.The worst thing about it, is its return  to grid style movement, and turn based combat.After MM6 7 8 and 9, you would think Ubisoft would have said, hmm maybe that is a good idea, you know keep it consistant?But no, no...If you liked MM 6 7 8 9, they are on sale for 19.99 on GOG in a package deal, buying this, MM X here will get you MM6 free, but with little extras, no achievements, nothing really extra, just the base game.Again the core game of MM X isn't bad if you enjoy sluggish turn based combat, but this isn't Pokemon, if I wanted that, and wanted to be stuck on a grid, I would play that type of game.I wanted a continuation, I wanted to know what was beyond in those worlds, what did the ancients leave.They left...turn based combat thats very slow and boring...Buy it if you want, but its not for me.

												I'm a fan of M&M. I love this series because of VI. I don't know why M&M X come back to I~V. It seems that the production team just lacks money.  M&M X, as the sequel of one of the greatest RPGs in Europe and America, could have been an epic game. Blame UBISOFT. Why can't they invest more money in this series? I remember the time when I was addicted to playing M&M VI for two whole weeks. Afterall, it's just an early edition. I'm still looking forward to some improvement.=====================================================================Now the official edition has released. I find this game is just okay after I have played for several hours. There are two points that should be improved. The first one is the inventory. Weapons shouldn't only be icons like M&M IX. It is very disappointing when we defeat boss and get loots whose apperance we can only see from pictures. The second one is about our characters' heads at the bottom. More expressions and actions should be added in order to increase sense of indentification. These two points are also the essence of M&M.Overall, its not too bad. It would be a great game if it was made for smart phone.6/10			"

												Main reason - uPLAY DRM breaks everything everywhere. No matter if you are registered game in uPLAY, no matter if you used griffin flight once (which actually only could be used in legitimate version and uPLAY realise your version as registered).  Game is absolutely broken if you are not ONLINE in uPLAY client.The game itself is great, as the veteran  who complited ""World of Xeen""  game (Might & magic IV and V both united in one game) in actual time - I admit it. But as I said - uPLAY DRM breaks everything, therefore - highly do not reccomend it  unless you have 24/7 internet connection The review will be reset to positive once DRM is properly configured (such as - only need to be online at uPLAY once to unlock full game).P.S. I play mostly offline. My real playing hours are about 15+			"

Very few spells, all of them boring. There will probably be no flight spell, because again there is nowhere to fly to.

												This game very effectively captures the 'old school' vibe of the M&M games of the days of yore, but also effectively moves the gameplay into a modern context.  The Xeen series is clearly the main inspiration for this title and the various RPG systems in the game interact effectively to create a compelling and addictive experience.  Exploring the world and discovering new locales is really enjoyable although the graphics are relatively cut-rate compared to similar titles.  Some locations look more impressive than others.  The dungeons in particular are quite well-designed, but the overworld and towns lack visual cohesion and suffer from occasional performance hiccups.  The combat is the meat of the game and  is purely tactical.  Enemies have a variety of abilities to keep you on your toes.  Don't settle into any one tactic or rely on key-spamming, you constantly have to adapt your abilities to the foes at hand.  The lore and world building gets the job done, although exposition is occasionally heavy-handed and long-winded. The grid movement system may feel constrained at first, but if you think of the game more like a series of large chess-like game boards, it makes more sense.  Simplifying the spacialization of enemies and move options to a grid forces you to make specific choices over what you can do spatially in combat - a good thing for a game of relatively modest scope.The main point I want to get about this game is that, as much as the game wants you to, you don't have to look at it through a nostalgia lens.  The RPG systems and tactical combat that hold this game together transcend both the weight of history that hangs over the series and expectations from fans of the genre.  Come in with the right amount of expectations and you'll find that the developers acheived what they set out to do: bring the essense of what made the old Might games such a joy to play and put it in a modern context.  Given the modest resources they had at their disposal and the weight of history they had to stare down, I believe Limbic Entertainment succeeded admirably.			"

												First impression is... it's awful. Nothing near the greatness of MM6-8, not even match the 9. It's more like older games in this series but with far more primitive roleplay system with very limited class variation. You can only turn in 90 degrees. No movement during the combat. Very cheap looking graphics and animation, sound recycled from earlier games... yeah and guess what? no MM6 in deluxe version. I immediatley regret buying this at the full price. Burn in hell, stinky Ubisoft.			"

												This is a pretty poor imitation of the original (or at least later) Might & Magic RPG's.  Despite the appearance of an open world the game is strictly linear and poorly designed.  The encounters are of the type where the NPC's frequently get to break the rules in one way or another and the game is not using cheap tricks like having enemies magically appear in areas you just cleared when you enter combat.  If this sort of game interests you I strongly recommend against purchasing this title and suggest you look elsewhere for your entertainment.			"

												Great old school game, but unbalanced - I was playing all previous parts since VI, but I don't see story continuation here. Graphics bit better, but mechanics left same as in previous parts. Why have I bought it? Definitely because of sentiment, I wouldn't recommend it for young players, because it didn't make any progress we already achieved and it's step back.One day I will finish it - right now there is a lot of much more playable titles in queue :)			"

Posted: October 15, 2015
												Yeah, I’ve played this game for 100+ hours, finished it 5 times, get almost all achievements… Yet I disregard it. Why?Well, all blame goes to Ubisoft, and two major points for I don’t recommend that game are:-	a wrong key feature policy (bad plan), and-	Insultingly high price, considering how low-tech, and limited in capacity that volume is.What is wrong key feature policy, you may ask? Well, that game proposes itself as HardCore and Oldschool. That’s the point for that I want to crush skulls and jaws. You see, using the old mechanic is not making the game oldschool. Forfeiting base common tricks, like adjustable map or in-game notepad, does not making it hardcore.The main reason for what people love old games is not about any type of mechanics. It is about passion! Guys who made those old games on their knees, in the dusty garages, but with full care a parent can give to its child – where every piece in every place is literally hand-made – that’s for people getting old-school. When Finnish Almost Human studio hit the shelves in the 2012 with the Legend of Grimrock, their game was praised not for using sluggish square-based movement. No, please! It was all about good combination of long-known tricks with the creativity and that famous “from gamers to gamers” drive.Might and Magic X Legacy in fact is just a tribute to old 3DO hits, snatchingly made by a small amateur game studio Limbic for a paycheck, and then sold as a full-scale hit by Ubisoft.Now, I don’t think that subsidiarity is a bad idea. It is one of the basic principles of the European Union, for example. But sometimes subsidiarity is not a good option. So rich is the fan-base of the old Might & Magic series! It is certainly have no less admirers than Deus Ex. Were Might and Magic X Legacy a stand-alone project, with some different name (Legend of Eryn, why not?) – I’d only recommend it. But as an inheritor of the whole serial… it is not even a basttard, it is an impostor.  When I’m hearing its name, it sounds to me like, “Leo Romanoff, the right heir to the Russian throne”.That’s all about two major aspects, for which I’m turning it down. Now, the base routine: normal review for a game without such big name.What we have is a first-person view RPG with tile-based movement (like in the M&M 1-5 or the Legend of Grimrock). There go some fans of M&M 6-8… I know some of them, and they don’t happy about that turn. What I didn’t like about that style of movement is that I constantly losing the track. Especially if the background is not flat, like in the Crag town. When you climbing up there, it is cool. But when you have to descend… you can’t look down! So you move, but don’t see where, because you don’t see ground! Un-natural, that concept is.The battle system is turn-based, of course: you have four of your characters, you make a move for every of them, then comes enemies, and so on, one for one. While challenge in those turn-based combats is quite high sometimes, the bad thing is that it is very clumsy in any case where you are not strong enough just to click enemy to death with single attack. It goes about applying your characters skills via game interface. Yeah, you have 10 buttons, 5 already binded (1-melee, 2-shot, 3-block, and 2 buttons for red and blue potions). Another 5 buttons are yours to bind, but boy, that’s so far from enough!After you get about 10-15 level, you’ll be constantly using sub-subdirectories to make every move for every character. I always thought that western PC RPG stands above JRPG like Final Fantasy, when we speaking about normalcy, convenience of combat performing. Alas, the turn-based fight in the M&M X is worse than in your normal JRPG. In the most of the battles it feels like romp in the mud.The story? Nothing spectacular. Go from A to B, then to C, return to A, to B, another round with new mail quest, and another. Wait! Twist! (bonfires) And go for another 3 rounds between A, B and C!There are too little place for decent amount of adventuring. Some locations are blowing my mind, but in the bad way. You go through a tomb full of ghouls and ghosts, managing through some part of it, and then – whoa! – you’re meet humans. Not necromancers. You think, well, I finished the tomb part; there is a Rubicon, now it is a human dungeon. You reconfiguring your skills to fit the fencing with humans, then hop! Another ghost attack! No logical explanation, what people and undead doing jointly, but they’re performing some cohabitation. Why? Well, not because it is a great plan of some kind. There are simply not enough place for two dungeons and variety of enemies for every maze you’ll have to see on your way through.Game falls low shortly after start. It is unnatural, bleak, and the only good point in it is the retro battle system, which gives you some trial to see if you’re fit to old standards. Oh, wait, I’ve already said that that system is clumsy and broken there! So – generally – there are no point to start it, at all!If only to cherish your curiosity… Save your time, don’t bother. My mark is 6/10.PS: I've almost forgot, but this is important piece: the sound in the game is its worst part. After about two hours of playing I was urged to shut down the voices, then, after I've got to Seahaven, I switched off the ambient, and it was not long until I totally mute the game and played only with my own soundtrack on background. What's so bad? Buzzing sounds. That's a total disaster, believe me. Limbic should shot their sound engineer, or at least, stop feeding him.			"

												Crunchiness rating: 2/10The crunchy bits:- Character creation- RPG level progression- Inentory managementThe not crunchy bits:- The character creation is very limited, only two heads per race (4 races only) and only one body per class (3 per race) - Only 3 classes per race, which is very limited compared to the MM titles of yore where you were much more open in your progressions. - Graphics while not normally conisdered in crunchiness leave much to be desired- Inventory management reminds me of MMOs like WoW rather than the more awesome inveotries of modern single player RPGs. - No more equipping armors and seeing them on the character paper doll like the old MM titlesI would say you should give this game a pass unless you ae looking for a simple game to pass the time with. If you liked the old MM games, you will be sorely dissapointed. There are many other better MM type games out there like Legend of Grimrock 1 & 2 on steam or better yet go get the old MM titles for GoG.Personally, I will go get my money back for this if I can. "

												Might & Magic X - LegacyConcept:A Dungeon crawling old school hack-and-slash RPG set in the Heroes of Might and Magic World. Graphics: ★★★☆☆Not Skyrim, but for  a 3D grid-base dungeon crawler it looks pleasing. Sound: ★★★☆☆The music is reminiscent of some of the classic Might & Magic titles as well as the Heroes of Might and Magic series. Sound effects are simple and repetitive.Playability: ★★★★☆Easy controls and interface like its predecessors. Entertainment: ★★★☆☆If your familiar with games of the past like the Wizardry series or the Might & Magic games, you will love this title as it takes you down memory lane but for those who are new to these type of games may get bored as the gameplay may get repetitive.Replay Value: ★★★★☆I feel the game has a High replay value especially since your party consists of 4 members and there are a total of 12 possible Classes to mix and match with the 4 races.Overall Rating: ★★★½☆☆ MY PERSONAL REVIEWThe Game takes place a few years after the events of Might & Magic: Heroes VI. Might & Magic X - Legacy takes place on the Agyn Peninsula. It's a throwback to the hack-and-slash RPGs of old and no knowledge of the past series is required to play it. You can create a Four person party consisting of 4 Races and 12 Classes to select from. While the party size is locked at four, players can pick up additional hirelings to fill specialized needs that give certain buffs or the pack horse that adds a considerable amount of inventory space which I found a must. The classes offer lots of skills and spells to choose from. The individual skills can be ranked up starting at novice and going up to Grandmaster. Some of the spells you get at Grandmaster are devastating but the road to get there is a long one. If you liked the Diablo style loot drops than you’ll like this game as there is a ton of different types of loot. The game adds some puzzle and riddle solving to take away from the constant combat grind.  Players can roam towns to find various power ups, coins, and quests that send them out into the wilderness. The game offers about 60+ Hours of play time if you explore every nook and cranny and take the time to read all the Lore it offers. This game is nothing like the Heroes of might & Magic series but if you liked games of the past like the Wizardry or Eye of the Beholder series or even the new Legend of Grimrock than this is the game for you.

But then bit by bit, I climbed in the levels and began to barely win my victories and feel great about getting revenge on the thing that killed me countless times before.  It is very rewarding to see your characters progress and get that much needed revenge on that jerk monster.It's a pretty good game, just make sure your party of 4 compliments each other well helping each other do more damage and protecting each other.

												dont waste your money on this game. its so very dissappointing you will hate that you actually paid for this. The fact that you spent money on this will cause you restless nights and horrors so unspeakable will visit you that you will want to attack the developers to stop it but it wont help. the game is cursed. Cursed to be so incredibly bad that even if valve software tried to fix it they wouldnt be able to and would instead end up going postal. The game is bad in all possible ways. Your family will abandon you. Friends will hate you. Enemies will hate you even more. DONT BUY THIS GAME IT SUCKS THE FUN OUT OF LIFE ITSELF!			"

												Despite some minor flaws in the technical department this game is surprisingly good. I guess the mixed reviews come from the rather oldschool type of game we have here. Grid based movement isnt everyones thing i guess. M&M X is more fight oriented than for instance Legend of Grimlock. Puzzels are there, but dont are the focus of the game. If you liked the old grid-based rpgs, you will like this one too.			"

												I can say, will do a bit of a quick review. So won't get too much into detail, but will cover the basics.It is a overall quite neat game. Taking the classic dungeoncrawl approach and spicing it up a little. While the graphic are notably ripped from heroes 6, I don't mind at all. After all, why waste assets when they have them? And they work well within the world so.That said, the game has some MASSIVE flaws, and some small annoyances.Can start with the small ones: For starters, there are too few lines of spoken dialog in this. Even with a diverse group, basically 70 % of all lines are identitcal between characters. Not that many, but heck, it's not far from it. They seriously cheaped out on that. The dialog that exist is pretty well done. But yeah, it incredibly fast gets repetitive  the 482'th time. Sometimes you can hear the same line 12+ times per minute. Depending on the situation.Secondly it's that, while more of a ""read up on it, scrub"" thing, your ""talent tree"" is something you heavily need to invest in, and plan ahead. You're not allowed to just pick it as you go, it became clear to me a bit in that I would have needed to plan my build from the start. As some skills are just far too vital not to have. Like how you literally can't complete certain dungeons without having certain spells and/or immunities.And while mostly a aestetic thing. It feels a bit dumb how you start as this ""kinda pro adventuring party"" with basically 0 equipment or skills. I get that you have to build your way up, but it's kinda derp how you're these supposedly bad♥♥♥♥♥""Raiders"", and you have some rusty, duct taped gear and barely know how to slap someone xP Not to mention: The game ocassionally forgets your UI, and resests some buttons to the ""default"" potion combination. Not a big annoyance, but can be a nuisance. Atop that, it seems some of the DLC content is bugged. I cashed in a reward for the deluxe edition package, but the item for it was never delivered, yet it claimed it had been cashed in.Now, for the massive flaws of this game in no particular order: (I was debating a bit wheter or not I would recommend this game, but in the end, it is a nice game. Yes, it will frustrate you a lot. But it has enough enjoyable moments to mostly weigh it up)1: The loading times are far too long.  It's not to bad in the start. But later in the game, these become a massive bother. ESPECIALLY as the game refuse to load if you are tabbed out. So you can't enter a dungeon or the like, then tab out, check a few things and tab back in during the up to 30+ second long loadingscreens. This becomes ESPECIALLY annoying due to the next in this list, which will force you to repeatedly re-load over and over and over and over and over. It's just a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way to pad on extra hours of gameplay.2: The RNG creep. I could be that I had a bad party combo. But some enemies just get plain stupid with this. Most of the undead are a great example of this. With one lucky hit, and many enemies seem to have 20-40 % crit chance, they can, and will 1-shot any non-tank party member. Just like that. Poof. And there's nothing you can do about it aside from spam protective spells. Which, makes you unable to attack. While they normally hit for like, 41 damage, when they crit, it can be anywhere from 180-260 damage if they feel like it. And when a ex: magic hero at that level has around 100 hp, they're just toast. So at many places, you just have to save, enter combat, hope RNG doesn't screw you over, if so, load and rinse and repeat. You're not being challanged the least, your patience is just being tested. 3: Broken skills and events. Some abilities don't work on enemies, or are outright broken. Like how if you stun an enemy, they can still retaliate, block and all that. While you aren't allowed to do so if stunned as a character. And there's dozens of design flaws like that around. And some events break when you save at a particular palce or time. Like, one event in a crow temple, an entire encouter crashes and vanishes if you save after you talk to a spirit. Which mind you, is a place with the issue in 2 mentioned. So you have to save before you talk to them. Talk to them, enter fight and hope each turn you don't have the ~5-10 % chance of getting instantly killed and be force to load, while you try to take down 6 enemies  at both sides of you with like, 1500 hp each. Each one of these capable to 1 shot your non-tanks. Currently at that fight as I am writing this, and have been for around 2 hours, 1 of which has just been pure loading time. For a game so heavily reliant on QS and QL, this type of droll padding just isn't acceptable. I'd at most expet 5-10 second loading time, at most. Many parts of this game is pure trial and error via RNG. Atop that, you only get experience for enemies if a hero is alive, and without and negative condition on them. Like what? My mage didn't learn anything at all from figthing a dragon, just becuase she got backhanded by said dragon and stunned, and her magical boots managed to kill the dragon? She had to be fully aware and witness as the dragon died, or else the entire fight was just some dull pasttime she couldn't learn anything from?4: No ability to flee. For a game that places it's level 20 monsters next to it's level 1 obligatory giant rats. This is such a huge design flaw I don't even know what to say... It's like removing/not including a dodge or block manouver in a fighting game... like, the actual murloc? This ties heavily in with the save/load issue. As, every time you find something new or a new area, you are forced to save to know if you even are allowed to be there, before you head on in. Your entire party got 1-shotted by a magically farting spider? Welp, you better load then, possinly after being forced through a game over screen, to then be made to wait a total of 1 minute before you are allowed back in. It's just not acceptable as said with the massive amounts of lazy padding this game has. It's like... it's a great game in here, why was so much bad descisions stuffed into it? Despite this being a late, patched version of the game. I really fear how terrible it must have been at launch.  There's seriusly a good game in here. It's just brutally hampered by multiple poor choices and design errors.I think this wraps up most of it... but yeah. I'd perhaps give a 6.5 out of ten? Nice game, but far too often just plain frustrating. Just knowing that ""Oh, I see my tactic and team was irrelevant here, I just wans't lucky enough with the dice rolls to progress... better spend a mintute reloading the... not saying RNG is always bad. But when it becomes a major part of the game itself... it's just frustarting. Adding numbers or making the AI cheat just to upp the difficulty is just poor design. Yes, I know it's sort of ""needed""sometimes, but it's very tacky regardless. There's just far too many areas where you're simply not allowed to do anything to affect the outcome of things. Or would have had to play the game prior to know which things to bring where.			"

												This is a work in progress as of 2013-08-22 and an ""early access"" game.  Even so I expected a LOT more out of this but it falls sadly very, very short.  It's painful to play.  The older games are better.  The ""grid"" walking system is painful.  The combat is ""meh"".  The characters are flat and boring. The interface works but is sadly lacking.  The graphics - well, I think the older games looked better in their time than this does today.  The writing is so-so, the sound effects are re-used from older games (mostly) so there's some nostalgic value there but otherwise they're very bland.  Combat, the key activity in the game, is boring so far.  Again, the older games were more fun.  Maybe it's just me, maybe I'm not the gamer I used to be... but hopefully they'll fix this up and do it right.			"

Nope, this is about uPlay, and why the #$@& I need a second program other than Steam to run a $%#(ing game.  Currently, my game is sitting on someone's email account from Russia and I guess their uPlay account.  Awesome.   Now I know I bought the game two  years ago, but it's still mine and I am furious.  By the way, had another game on that wonderful uPlay account too ... Anno 2070.  It isn't anywhere to be found either.  Will update if they fix it (guy is working on it now), but really?  Now ... they fixed it, finally!  Yay!			"

But I can't look past this game crashing on loading saved games! Hours of game play lost, and there's no desire to start from the beginning in case that ends up being lost, too. Until a patch comes out that addresses this critical functionality, I can't recommend purchasing this game.			"

Compared to might and magic 3 and 4, the scrolling is far slower, also the screen was smaller in those versions so had a slightly different feel. I actually enjoyed 6-8 so hope that maybe M and M 11 can perhaps try something like that. Overall i can recommend it , but probably its only going to appeal to old fans, i cant see new fans picking this up.			"

												First off, the bad stuff. This game has a few frustrating elements put there by the developers. Poison will kill you, and quite quickly, and you get no warning that you need to get earth magic's cure poison or buy antidotes before you get poisoned the first time, although hopefully you will have picked up enough antifotes to be okay. Secondly, while both the team and monsters are locked in space when they enter a melee fight (which is fine), there is one boss that doesn't, and who is going to push the team to their death if the I guess random number generator wills it. Lastly, a couple of things are very difficult to find, and there's no abundance of hints to where to go and the voice acting isn't that great.Apart from that, Might and magic X is a truly brilliant game. You start off choosing a team of four characters whose skills will complement each other on their Quest through the Agyn peninsula. From there on, everything is grid and turn based. You will move square by square through an astonishing world with a lot, really a lot, of cool secrets you may have to go out of your way to find. The game is really well made for people who like to explore places, as the world is big, and the only thing keeping you from going places are monsters. You will need to save often, as you may be ambushed by too difficult monsters in the early game, but even really difficult monsters can often be overcome if you employ the right strategy. Mages are given powerful but costly control options, and there are lots of different strategies to employ to get past the bad guys. Being turn based, you can even change your equipment during your turn in combat, yielding very interesting options if you stack up on cool equipment. This results in a lot of digressions from the tasks at hand; the party will find a new nook or cave they want to explore while on their way to the next location. Except for interdependent quests, you can mosttimes do any quest you have in any order you'd like.While difficult monsters can often be overcome with the right tactics (or a couple of levels, there are always other things you want to do in the mean time), easy monsters can often kill the party if you don't pay attention. The simplest monsters give 5 xp, the toughest give you around 50, so you will never feel that you are too strong for an area, you simply spend less turns during each combat.One of the aspects that really got me in this game was all the puzzles. All the way through the land they have put mysterious crypts, where you need to solve a puzzle to get to the treasure, with no dangerous monsters to distract you. There are a lot of chests which requires you to answer a riddle correctly, and they are very fun to ponder about, especially if you're playing together with someone. I already said there are a lot of treasure in this game, and it is sometimes hidden due to the movement in the game. If there's a chest to your side, you won't notice it unless you face that direction, and as you can't face every wall all the time, you need to keep looking for small boxes or camuflaged chests you need to face.For the level system, I think it's good. every level gives you 4 attribute points, to be spread over strength, perception, destiny, magic, etc. with very clear effects. This makes sure your character gets better at what he/she does at every level. The character also gets 3 skill points, which can be spent on increasing skills. All the skills a character chan choose between, he/she can master to different degrees, expert (at 7 skill points), master (at 15) and grand master (at 25). At these scores, advancement needs to be bought from a skill specific trainer, which will give an extra boost and let the character advance further. There are 12 classes to choose between, and each has a different set of skill mastery possibilities, but each class needs to get promoted through a special quest to access gm training (range -> warden can gm bow, barbarian -> warmonger can gm two handed), so the game really makes you work to become better. I already mentioned that mages have interesting battle control options; the fighters also do. There's a skill called warfare, which grants spell like abilities (two more at each new level of mastery) like reducing armor or taunting enemies to attack that particular character. This makes any kind of team viable, and gives the game a lot of replay value. When I say any kind of team is viable, I mean it, character creation is not something you need to ponder a lot on, there will be ways to destroy every enemy with what you want to play. Also, at gm level, you will be insanely good, and your party will feel like living gods. This feels great.I had a lot of fun all the way through this game. They have managed to scare me through sending enemies on me that I didn't think I could handle, they have given me riddles and puzzles I didn't feel like I could handle, but I did, and it was great. If anything is too hard or obscure, you can always google it, you will still enjoy the world of asha. Turn based and grid based games aren't for everyone, and it's difficult to do it well. I hated legend of grimlock, as the movement was annoying, and you could kick difficult bosses asses by figuring out their movement patterns. What they did badly, MMX has done in a very smooth way. Id you liked the stroy part of Heroes VI, then you'll love this game, as they expand upon it with great pieces of lore scattered around (and a story that follows in the footstep of Heroes VI). If you played the old games, you will definitely love this one, as they have included lord Kilburn and Crag Hack, as well as lore about ""Lord Caneghem"".			"

												I was unable to play the game once I entered the lighthouse due to what appeared to be a bug in the game, resulting in a downvote. I submitted a helpdesk ticket to ubisoft (I'm on mac, but they apparently don't admit to have a mac version, so I submitted it to the windows help desk) and got a useless response. They basically had me install every OS X update and some flash installers, none of which really helped. I felt like I had just called comcast and the script the ""helpful"" individual on the other end had them read the same thing, even if it was totally innappropriate. However, I changed my recommendation after following the directions in one of the steam forums. Apparently, this is a 32 bit game and, for mac users, you must find the actual program and mark it as such in order to get decent playability. Once you do, it is fine (though, not a stellar experience). I'm pretty sure Macs have been 64 bit for over 10 years now. But, maybe the code they are using is still 32 bit and they can't afford to have someone actually update it? Even the PC version isn't 10 years old...The game plays more or less like the old M&M games that came before it, but with better graphics. Having grown up with games like this, I prefer the turn based combat. There are some real problems, such as situations where the enemy you are fighting doesn't actually appear on your screen. However, you can still blow them away with fireballs, even if you have no clue where they are. I've seen pirates walk through walls to fight you, and combat turns for the opponent can take several minutes as the animations dig through to find you. All in all, this is a decent remake of those old school dungeon grinders that were king back in the 90s but modernized for semi modern hardware. If they put some work tuning the engine itself, it would probably be a great iPad or android game. Hopefully, it will get some attention and they'll fix some of the more annoying bugs (and maybe bring it into the 21rst centry of 64 bit hardware?). But, even now, it's a fun game that can be enjoyed for hours.			"

												30 plus hours invested in the game, with over 15 on my main group.  I reached Act 2, explored Seahaven, everything was grand.  Then, I started to get a few flickers of fractured graphics.  I was exploring outside Seahaven, saved, and logged for the night.  Next day when I tried to log into the game my Mac goes into an endless loop.  Now, every time I try to load a save I either get the loop or some wierd screen with one of my toons in all four spots and no way to do anything.  It's a great rendition of the classic turn based fantasy role playing game, but it's way too buggy.  I'd stay away, at least on the Mac version, until they get it fixed.			"

												Requires Uplay, so instead of just Steam running in the background you'll now have ANOTHER DAMN THING running in the background. DO NOT BUY unless you like signing up for stupid bullcrap where they want your email address so they can spam you and sell your information or send you advertising.Fun if you like to figure out where to go and what to do by trial and death. Save a lot. Reload a lot. There are no respawns, so do your internet research to figure out what your party needs before you go forth, or else you'll be behind the power curve that the game throws at you.Speaking of internet research, you need to know what quests/areas/subareas to do in what order, or else ...total party kill. There's no way to disengage from combat. You'll die. A lot. Because you didn't do your internet research ahead of time. If this is fun for you, go for it.Ranged weapons are mostly useless due to the grid system. You'll need to return to town a lot to restock on supplies. Buy tons of mana potions, because there's no mana regen that I can see.Want to improve your characters? Find the trainers. Run back and forth to town. A LOT. Figure out where the trainers are. YAY SO MUCH FUN. No. It's also grid based, and the texture quality in some notable places is just horri-bad. CHECK OUT THE TOWN NAME ON THE SIGN AS YOU LEAVE THE FIRST TOWN.lol.			"

												I don't write reviews, ever.  But being long-time M&M/Wizardry fan, I felt I needed to dispel some of the myths about this game.  I'm playing the game on a macbook 2011, with no problems running in 32-bit mode.  Gorgeous game, great interface, challenging battles, great puzzles, and funny references.  I've put some time in this game, and I'm on my first playthrough.  I have ignored butt-aches to play for another thirty minutes.  I am definitely playing this again once I complete it.  First let me say that reviewers that say you should min/max your skills, or you have to play a certain race/class combination are so so wrong.  I get a chuckle out of thinking of players not using rangers.  Now that I'm in the later stages of the game, monsters should feel privelaged to be able to survive long enough to get into melee range.  I love the turn-based combat and strategy.  Everything about this game makes sense.  If you liked the good ole days of Xeen, you will love this adventure.  Get it. "

												What can you say!!! I loved Might & Magic v1 The Mandate of Heaven it was a real challenge to play, the battles were tough and  you always had great feeling when you fought the battle's and won .... Might & Magic X-Legacy is extreamly frustrating to get used with the controls at the begining but something clicks as you peservere and you get used to the controls and it becomes a really good challenging game, I love the modern graphics which really improve the experience of the game it brings Might & Magic to life ..... Such an improvement I'm really loving playing this game, Its downside is the slightly long loading screens but you can get used to this, and where is the don't touch the mercendise! gone, or when you leave the chapel Bless you!  Me I miss that from Might & Magic v1, but other than that its really only the awkward get used to the controls bit!.... I recomend this to anyone who played the early M&M games,  this has a great retro feel and  the modern graphics are absolutely brilliant...... As said  a lot would be put off by the awkward controls at the start but if you stick with it! its an extreamly  good & challenging game to play!.......			"

												Highly recommend Might and Magic X - LegacyThe game is a perfect throwback to games I loved in the 80s and 90s.  It requires lots of thought to balance survivability and damage.  Putting a lot of thought into character development helps create an engrossing game experience.It's turn based, so it may appeal more to laidback gamers.  Success depends on planning, rather than mashing the keys at the right time.There is a great variety of spells and fighting styles, so for me there is replayability to try different spell schools and weapon types.I hope the developers make expansions based on this game, and look forward to the next edition.

												Not a review of the game, because I can't really play the game ... but I am sure I would like it if I could!  Nope, this is about uPlay, and why the #$@& I need a second program other than Steam to run a $%#(ing game.  Currently, my game is sitting on someone's email account from Russia and I guess their uPlay account.  Awesome.   Now I know I bought the game two  years ago, but it's still mine and I am furious.  By the way, had another game on that wonderful uPlay account too ... Anno 2070.  It isn't anywhere to be found either.  Will update if they fix it (guy is working on it now), but really?  Now ... they fixed it, finally!  Yay!			"

Posted: November 6, 2015
												I can say, will do a bit of a quick review. So won't get too much into detail, but will cover the basics.It is a overall quite neat game. Taking the classic dungeoncrawl approach and spicing it up a little. While the graphic are notably ripped from heroes 6, I don't mind at all. After all, why waste assets when they have them? And they work well within the world so.That said, the game has some MASSIVE flaws, and some small annoyances.Can start with the small ones: For starters, there are too few lines of spoken dialog in this. Even with a diverse group, basically 70 % of all lines are identitcal between characters. Not that many, but heck, it's not far from it. They seriously cheaped out on that. The dialog that exist is pretty well done. But yeah, it incredibly fast gets repetitive  the 482'th time. Sometimes you can hear the same line 12+ times per minute. Depending on the situation.Secondly it's that, while more of a ""read up on it, scrub"" thing, your ""talent tree"" is something you heavily need to invest in, and plan ahead. You're not allowed to just pick it as you go, it became clear to me a bit in that I would have needed to plan my build from the start. As some skills are just far too vital not to have. Like how you literally can't complete certain dungeons without having certain spells and/or immunities.And while mostly a aestetic thing. It feels a bit dumb how you start as this ""kinda pro adventuring party"" with basically 0 equipment or skills. I get that you have to build your way up, but it's kinda derp how you're these supposedly bad♥♥♥♥♥""Raiders"", and you have some rusty, duct taped gear and barely know how to slap someone xP Not to mention: The game ocassionally forgets your UI, and resests some buttons to the ""default"" potion combination. Not a big annoyance, but can be a nuisance. Atop that, it seems some of the DLC content is bugged. I cashed in a reward for the deluxe edition package, but the item for it was never delivered, yet it claimed it had been cashed in.Now, for the massive flaws of this game in no particular order: (I was debating a bit wheter or not I would recommend this game, but in the end, it is a nice game. Yes, it will frustrate you a lot. But it has enough enjoyable moments to mostly weigh it up)1: The loading times are far too long.  It's not to bad in the start. But later in the game, these become a massive bother. ESPECIALLY as the game refuse to load if you are tabbed out. So you can't enter a dungeon or the like, then tab out, check a few things and tab back in during the up to 30+ second long loadingscreens. This becomes ESPECIALLY annoying due to the next in this list, which will force you to repeatedly re-load over and over and over and over and over. It's just a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way to pad on extra hours of gameplay.2: The RNG creep. I could be that I had a bad party combo. But some enemies just get plain stupid with this. Most of the undead are a great example of this. With one lucky hit, and many enemies seem to have 20-40 % crit chance, they can, and will 1-shot any non-tank party member. Just like that. Poof. And there's nothing you can do about it aside from spam protective spells. Which, makes you unable to attack. While they normally hit for like, 41 damage, when they crit, it can be anywhere from 180-260 damage if they feel like it. And when a ex: magic hero at that level has around 100 hp, they're just toast. So at many places, you just have to save, enter combat, hope RNG doesn't screw you over, if so, load and rinse and repeat. You're not being challanged the least, your patience is just being tested. 3: Broken skills and events. Some abilities don't work on enemies, or are outright broken. Like how if you stun an enemy, they can still retaliate, block and all that. While you aren't allowed to do so if stunned as a character. And there's dozens of design flaws like that around. And some events break when you save at a particular palce or time. Like, one event in a crow temple, an entire encouter crashes and vanishes if you save after you talk to a spirit. Which mind you, is a place with the issue in 2 mentioned. So you have to save before you talk to them. Talk to them, enter fight and hope each turn you don't have the ~5-10 % chance of getting instantly killed and be force to load, while you try to take down 6 enemies  at both sides of you with like, 1500 hp each. Each one of these capable to 1 shot your non-tanks. Currently at that fight as I am writing this, and have been for around 2 hours, 1 of which has just been pure loading time. For a game so heavily reliant on QS and QL, this type of droll padding just isn't acceptable. I'd at most expet 5-10 second loading time, at most. Many parts of this game is pure trial and error via RNG. Atop that, you only get experience for enemies if a hero is alive, and without and negative condition on them. Like what? My mage didn't learn anything at all from figthing a dragon, just becuase she got backhanded by said dragon and stunned, and her magical boots managed to kill the dragon? She had to be fully aware and witness as the dragon died, or else the entire fight was just some dull pasttime she couldn't learn anything from?4: No ability to flee. For a game that places it's level 20 monsters next to it's level 1 obligatory giant rats. This is such a huge design flaw I don't even know what to say... It's like removing/not including a dodge or block manouver in a fighting game... like, the actual murloc? This ties heavily in with the save/load issue. As, every time you find something new or a new area, you are forced to save to know if you even are allowed to be there, before you head on in. Your entire party got 1-shotted by a magically farting spider? Welp, you better load then, possinly after being forced through a game over screen, to then be made to wait a total of 1 minute before you are allowed back in. It's just not acceptable as said with the massive amounts of lazy padding this game has. It's like... it's a great game in here, why was so much bad descisions stuffed into it? Despite this being a late, patched version of the game. I really fear how terrible it must have been at launch.  There's seriusly a good game in here. It's just brutally hampered by multiple poor choices and design errors.I think this wraps up most of it... but yeah. I'd perhaps give a 6.5 out of ten? Nice game, but far too often just plain frustrating. Just knowing that ""Oh, I see my tactic and team was irrelevant here, I just wans't lucky enough with the dice rolls to progress... better spend a mintute reloading the... not saying RNG is always bad. But when it becomes a major part of the game itself... it's just frustarting. Adding numbers or making the AI cheat just to upp the difficulty is just poor design. Yes, I know it's sort of ""needed""sometimes, but it's very tacky regardless. There's just far too many areas where you're simply not allowed to do anything to affect the outcome of things. Or would have had to play the game prior to know which things to bring where.			"

												First, I loved playing all the old Might and Magic games.  When you can put a dragon in your party, that makes for some good times!  So nostalgia is the biggest element in recommending this title.Sure, there are many more games far greater and more compelling than this, but MMX is like rewatching an old movie that was your favorite years ago, before you knew better.  I'm not a button masher, and the old school ""take all the time you want making decisions during a fight"" interface is something, I'm embarrassed to admit, I enjoy.Look, ""Legacy"" is right there in the title.  This is an old school RPG that's mildly entertaining, and just the right speed for ageing, casual RPG gamers too intimidated to jump into the contemporary open world games of today.  Like me.			"

												I got this game as a part of a bundle and thought ""well, this will be one game I'll nevel install"".But I ended up trying the game, and liked it so much I completed it.Despite being released in 2014, Might and Magic X has a very strong back to 90' feeling looming over it. It mostly feels like a weird mixture of roguelike and older Might and Magic games. Turn based game where you run in a grid. Certainly not something you would expect from such a new game.I, however, find this pleasant and nostalgic.If you like older Might and Magic titles and are fan of roguelikes, then this game will be good for you, try it out if it's on sale. If you aren't fan of either, better stay away. You will probably not like this.There are two major downsides for this game I disliked.-Damn much running around in same places.-No real game notes. Too often you keep wondering ""where on earth I saw that earth magic master teacher. Gotta go to google again, I'm not checking the whole world again to find him.""They certainly didn't stop me from playing, but I must admid both were annoying for me.			"

												Best RPG I've played in years, and has quickly become my single favorite game. After playing this I just HAD to play the rest of the M&M series, and I played from 3 to 9 and loved every second of it. This is how RPGs are supposed to be!Pros: - awesomely fun RPG game in pretty much every way.Cons: - support was unfortunately pulled by Ubisoft before a host of audio problems could be patched out, so we're stuck with them forever now. Battle music gets stuck on all the time, sounds constantly don't play or have wrong volumes. With a long enough play session you can end up with 3+ battle songs all playing at the same time all out of synch, which is pretty irritating to hear. these problems are extremely disappointing since the game itself is otherwise so amazing. exiting and running the game again does fix it though (temporarily). - After having played the rest of the series, there are a few things in comparison that I miss, but these are not strictly good or bad:    - most M&M games have an accelerating levelling scale. progression is slow in the beginning, but by the end you're gaining like 10 levels per trainer visit. in this one, progression does start slow, and does accelerate at first, but at the end it slows to a crawl, and you end up basically frozen and will never be good at everything you could have been good at. this is pretty strongly different than the other M&Ms where you could master everything about your class and still have tons of points left over. depending on your point of view this could be a good or bad thing.    - this game actually has *better* tactical combat than any of the other M&M games, and depending on which classes you choose, you can still become very powerful. though the classes are actually very imbalanced as well, some being extremely powerful and some being very weak. again, this may or may not be a bad thing.

												Such a fun game. If you like the old might & magic games, you'll love this one. It is buggy and I couldn't play it with the highest graphics because some effects will crash the game. I set all to medium or low and I enjoyed the game nontheless.Some cool riddles, cool but simple puzzles. great intense battles, cool unique items that level up. Really loved this game.I think that, if they step away from Unity and get an engine that doesn't make your life a living hell, and do more of  the cool things they made for this game, M&M XI should be a return to the old days when M&M was the best turn-based rpg out there.Would recommend? To a M&M fan sure, buy it now! To a regular rpg gamer, I'd say buy it on sale or look for something else.			"

												Old school turn based RPG. Move as a party, grid based. Quest, fight, loot, level and repeat. A bit rough around the edges but recent patches have fixed the most glaring issues. I enjoyed it, it is just hard enough to keep you on your toes and there is enough vareity in characters, quests and spells to keep it interesting. There are some annoying bits like teleport and pressure plate puzzles, if you lack patience for these kinds of things you'll be reaching for a walkthrough to get past these. It is a long game, I spent ~60 hours on a play through. A bit of a slog toward the end but I remained hooked enough to finish it.			"

I highly recommand this old school RPG with a new school look this game is vary beautiful and even has the option for pixalation (I hope I spelled that right lol). With that option a computer that has slightly below minimum specs can play it. Though watch out for bugs and glitches for quest items depending how far it is into the game for the item or quest you may have to start your game over, but this game is long enough with exploration, side quest there is so much replay value. If this does spark curiosity I suggest getting the delux edition for the extra stuff you will gain from it.			"

												I waited for the final release, having a blast so far.  Really fun game - highly recommend for anyone that enjoyed the old time RPGs of yesteryear.  If you ever enjoyed tile-based RPGs (MM, Wizardry, Eye of the Beholder, Dungeon Master etc.) I think your money is well spent on this game.  I'm just a few hours in and already know I will complete this game with pleasure.  Good stuff!EDIT - 24 hours in and loving it - it really ramps up in difficulty.  Playing on 'normal adventure mode' but still offers up a helluva challenge.  Word to the wise, be very careful in party creation. As far as I can tell duel-wielding trumps two handed quite easily.  I recommend two blade dancers and two magic users, freemages work well as they can learn any school.  But what do I know?  I'm having a helluva time!EDIT - Completed the game tonight.  Awesome value, and a crazy challenge at the end.  The game surprised me a lot and there is a lot of depth here.  If you enjoy a turn-based, well thought out and designed RPG then you can't go wrong with this game.  If you have reservations because of the 'old-school' vibe, give it a try, you'll be rewarded with a great game.			"

												If you like turn-based grid-style RPG games, this is a great one to pick up on the cheap.  Yes, you do hit a wall around Act 2, but if you power through it, you will be rewarded with fun.  This game is very buggy, and I was fortunate to have game-breaking bugs at the very end, but I was able to get through them.  The game itself is right up my alley in the kind of RPGs I miss from my younger years.  I was able to beat this with a Blademaster, Rune Priest, Druid, and Freemage, and I have watched quite a few win with other combinations, leading me to beieve that you can beat the game with any makeup, provided you spec into their strengths and figure a combat strategy that will keep you alive.

												Might & Magic X was a very positive surprise. The reviews were somewhat average, but I was looking for an old-style dungeon crawl and went ahead buying MMX shortly after it went out of early access. If you know what to expect (a tile and turned based game system), you might end up having a lot of fun with it.Graphics aren't the best, but look quite decent within dungeons (where you'll spent most of your time). I like the combat system, especially that you get the feeling of being in control and making good decisions without having to spent ages learning stats of weapons and spells. Almost 10 hours in, combat is still fun and I haven't encountered any frustrating difficulty spikes yet (although I faced some challenges).The story is rather weak, but then again, you're here for the dungeon crawl.I'm not a veteran MM player, but after MMX I'll definitely look into some of the classic parts of the series.

												I was a little sceptical of the grid-based navigation and relatively hardcore gameplay at first, but then I found myself very much addicted in the same way as I was with Lands of Lore and Dungeon Master. Those too young to have experienced those might find it an odd design choice, and it lacks a little of the convenience of modern games (you need to wander around town to get to stores, and find trainers yourself, etc) but it has a good minimap - that's the feature I can't live without, so I'm happy.

												+ Nice combination of old school turn-based RPG and modern comfort features (annotatable automap, easy comparison between different items via mouse-over, rest anywhere instead of only in safe zones etc).+ Turn-based battles require a lot of micro-management of your character's spells and skills. For me, it was a great part of the fun of MMX - for other players this might be a turn-off.+ Thoughtful management of your character's attributes and new skill points is a must - but it's also very rewarding when you reach a new weapon proficiency or finally master a new, powerful spell.+ Decent variety of enemies, though there are only about two to three different types per dungeon / overworld area. Each type of enemy has different resistances and skills - you have to adapt your attacks / buffs / debuffs accordingly.+/- Loads and loads of loot, but too often enemies drop only useless stuff (weak weapons and armour for the most part). On the other hand, a decent number of powerful ""relics"" (weapons, armour) can be found in the most remote and dangerous areas of the game. These relics make a real difference in battle, especially as you can level them up (4 levels each) by simply having them equipped in battle. Levelled up to max, these relics are the most powerful items in the game.+/- You will often run into enemies who are simply too strong for your characters, requiring you to level up and get some better gear before you return. A classic feature, yes, but this can be annoying if you haven't yes found an area / dungeon where your characters can level up without the constant threat of getting killed by strong mobs.- Story is okay, delivered mostly by NPC ""talking heads"" (text only, speech in very rare cases) and books containing background information about the world and its history. Almost no dialogue choices for your characters. All in all, the story of main quest and side quests is serviceable, but not very engaging.- Quality of character models and textures ranges from ""serviceable"" to ""eyesore"".- No crafting. Would have been nice because too many of the weapons in shops or dropped by enemies are useless.- As of mid February 2014, annoying bugs still remain (parts of the environment turn invisible, quest rewards not given etc). Your mileage may vary; I did not encounter any quest-breaking bugs.All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this games to all fans of classic, turn-based RPGs. It's not perfect and still needs some patching - but there are simply tons of fun to be had while fighting and exploring.			"

												It is unfortunate that when you purchase this game both steam and ubisoft fail to mention that you must sign up for a third party programn to run the game.  Unfortunatly only one of the cd keys worked in my case so i only have access to part of what I payed for.  The sign up process can be frustrating as well since you will have to translate on of those hard to see scribbles to prove your human, mess up to many times and they will ban you for an hour before you can try again to get your information to work correctly.Game might otherwise work fine if you can get through the red tape and do not mind signing a bunch of waivers allowing ubisoft to see information on your computer.

												short summary / Kurzzusammenfassung: game concept is quite nice, but too many bugs + flaws. / Spielkonzept ist ganz nett (habe auch einige andere M&M-Teile gespielt, es gibt aber zu viele Bugs und sonstige Mängellong versionafter playing several other rpg-style games from the M&M, the dark eye, D&D, gothic and alike series i was looking forward to play another nice game. After a quite nice start ( just a bit annoying expert/master/grandmaster-skillsystem ) the waiting on loads more and more angered me (takes 20s-1min per load). later on you will find out that it really sucks to come to an area which might be relevant for quests without picking those quests before. On some game-important occasions like promotion missions you will end up with an open quest unable to complete it, if you've been to the quest-relevant area before. other bugs will add up, you will have problems to become grandmaster on some skills before it stops to matter if you are, and so on and on. Some things can be fixed when using boards to understand the game scripts, but honestly: this shouldnt be a player's deal at all. Especially annoying are the relics. Of about 30 relics in the game about 2-5 might be of good use for your team, the rest is weaker than equipment that you can buy (granted you have the time to rest and reload often enough to reset shops), or you simply cannot use it with the party you chose. on late stages (about level 25-30), depending on your chosen skills and equipment, you either wont have any mentionable enemies (i killed the last boss of the main quest with 3 hits once), or you'll have quite some problems to win it. For example: there is equipment adding +6 of a certain skill. depending on the skill you can achieve 25 (grandmaster) + 48 (2x6 foki, 3x6 jewelry, and 3x6 other equipment) for magic skills, which is damn much OP. you also could try to become invulnurable, wich is no hard task with some of the characters (about 100 defense, about 100 resistences). but besides all that, at the end of the game you'll have to flee from a prison, having no equipment at start, being able to do lots of mistakes while fleeing. combined with the waiting time for reload, that was too much of frustration for me. even though i played that game quite some time, i cannot recommend it.

												First off, the bad stuff. This game has a few frustrating elements put there by the developers. Poison will kill you, and quite quickly, and you get no warning that you need to get earth magic's cure poison or buy antidotes before you get poisoned the first time, although hopefully you will have picked up enough antifotes to be okay. Secondly, while both the team and monsters are locked in space when they enter a melee fight (which is fine), there is one boss that doesn't, and who is going to push the team to their death if the I guess random number generator wills it. Lastly, a couple of things are very difficult to find, and there's no abundance of hints to where to go and the voice acting isn't that great.Apart from that, Might and magic X is a truly brilliant game. You start off choosing a team of four characters whose skills will complement each other on their Quest through the Agyn peninsula. From there on, everything is grid and turn based. You will move square by square through an astonishing world with a lot, really a lot, of cool secrets you may have to go out of your way to find. The game is really well made for people who like to explore places, as the world is big, and the only thing keeping you from going places are monsters. You will need to save often, as you may be ambushed by too difficult monsters in the early game, but even really difficult monsters can often be overcome if you employ the right strategy. Mages are given powerful but costly control options, and there are lots of different strategies to employ to get past the bad guys. Being turn based, you can even change your equipment during your turn in combat, yielding very interesting options if you stack up on cool equipment. This results in a lot of digressions from the tasks at hand; the party will find a new nook or cave they want to explore while on their way to the next location. Except for interdependent quests, you can mosttimes do any quest you have in any order you'd like.While difficult monsters can often be overcome with the right tactics (or a couple of levels, there are always other things you want to do in the mean time), easy monsters can often kill the party if you don't pay attention. The simplest monsters give 5 xp, the toughest give you around 50, so you will never feel that you are too strong for an area, you simply spend less turns during each combat.One of the aspects that really got me in this game was all the puzzles. All the way through the land they have put mysterious crypts, where you need to solve a puzzle to get to the treasure, with no dangerous monsters to distract you. There are a lot of chests which requires you to answer a riddle correctly, and they are very fun to ponder about, especially if you're playing together with someone. I already said there are a lot of treasure in this game, and it is sometimes hidden due to the movement in the game. If there's a chest to your side, you won't notice it unless you face that direction, and as you can't face every wall all the time, you need to keep looking for small boxes or camuflaged chests you need to face.For the level system, I think it's good. every level gives you 4 attribute points, to be spread over strength, perception, destiny, magic, etc. with very clear effects. This makes sure your character gets better at what he/she does at every level. The character also gets 3 skill points, which can be spent on increasing skills. All the skills a character chan choose between, he/she can master to different degrees, expert (at 7 skill points), master (at 15) and grand master (at 25). At these scores, advancement needs to be bought from a skill specific trainer, which will give an extra boost and let the character advance further. There are 12 classes to choose between, and each has a different set of skill mastery possibilities, but each class needs to get promoted through a special quest to access gm training (range -> warden can gm bow, barbarian -> warmonger can gm two handed), so the game really makes you work to become better. I already mentioned that mages have interesting battle control options; the fighters also do. There's a skill called warfare, which grants spell like abilities (two more at each new level of mastery) like reducing armor or taunting enemies to attack that particular character. This makes any kind of team viable, and gives the game a lot of replay value. When I say any kind of team is viable, I mean it, character creation is not something you need to ponder a lot on, there will be ways to destroy every enemy with what you want to play. Also, at gm level, you will be insanely good, and your party will feel like living gods. This feels great.I had a lot of fun all the way through this game. They have managed to scare me through sending enemies on me that I didn't think I could handle, they have given me riddles and puzzles I didn't feel like I could handle, but I did, and it was great. If anything is too hard or obscure, you can always google it, you will still enjoy the world of asha. Turn based and grid based games aren't for everyone, and it's difficult to do it well. I hated legend of grimlock, as the movement was annoying, and you could kick difficult bosses asses by figuring out their movement patterns. What they did badly, MMX has done in a very smooth way. Id you liked the stroy part of Heroes VI, then you'll love this game, as they expand upon it with great pieces of lore scattered around (and a story that follows in the footstep of Heroes VI). If you played the old games, you will definitely love this one, as they have included lord Kilburn and Crag Hack, as well as lore about ""Lord Caneghem"".			"

												I was unable to play the game once I entered the lighthouse due to what appeared to be a bug in the game, resulting in a downvote. I submitted a helpdesk ticket to ubisoft (I'm on mac, but they apparently don't admit to have a mac version, so I submitted it to the windows help desk) and got a useless response. They basically had me install every OS X update and some flash installers, none of which really helped. I felt like I had just called comcast and the script the ""helpful"" individual on the other end had them read the same thing, even if it was totally innappropriate. However, I changed my recommendation after following the directions in one of the steam forums. Apparently, this is a 32 bit game and, for mac users, you must find the actual program and mark it as such in order to get decent playability. Once you do, it is fine (though, not a stellar experience). I'm pretty sure Macs have been 64 bit for over 10 years now. But, maybe the code they are using is still 32 bit and they can't afford to have someone actually update it? Even the PC version isn't 10 years old...The game plays more or less like the old M&M games that came before it, but with better graphics. Having grown up with games like this, I prefer the turn based combat. There are some real problems, such as situations where the enemy you are fighting doesn't actually appear on your screen. However, you can still blow them away with fireballs, even if you have no clue where they are. I've seen pirates walk through walls to fight you, and combat turns for the opponent can take several minutes as the animations dig through to find you. All in all, this is a decent remake of those old school dungeon grinders that were king back in the 90s but modernized for semi modern hardware. If they put some work tuning the engine itself, it would probably be a great iPad or android game. Hopefully, it will get some attention and they'll fix some of the more annoying bugs (and maybe bring it into the 21rst centry of 64 bit hardware?). But, even now, it's a fun game that can be enjoyed for hours.			"

												This game is seriously recommended if youre a fan of old school RPGs like M&M 3, 4 and 5.Its a very hard game to put down and go to bed at a proper time. You just have to ""check a little bit more"", or ""run back to town to identify the new relic you found"".The class and race system is nice, and you have alot of customization options for your characters. Its a challenging game, making you value every gold you get and force you to prioritize what to invest in. At least on Warrior difficulty this gives a good old hard game feeling.It seems to have decent length. Ive played maybe 15-20 hours on this playthrough, and Im not halfway yet. Just finished Act 2, and I have a bunch of sidequests to do as well.There are some rough edges, balance issues and a little too much ""run back to town"", but overall they fade awayfrom the fact that this game is a little gem for us old school RPG lovers, enjoy :)			"

												Very enjoyable RPG,High quality 2D art, unfortunately can't say the same for the 3D art. Music is alright and special effect sound are not annoying.The games has an enjoyable way to develop your 4 characters. Due to a wide range available spells, magic characters are somewhat more interesting than melee characters.Unfortunately the game is somewhat buggy, but inside a forgivable range. Loading times are very slow, which requires developer's attention. Journal/Quest system is not very clear, sometimes it’s very hard to find your way around the quest.I defiantly recommend this game for players which enjoy old-school RPG games and love to build a character with items and skills. I give this game 8/10 points, due to long loading times and some minor bugs which can be easily addressed in the near future.-Vlad			"

												Watered down Clouds of Xeen with better graphics. (so it's an enjoyable game)If there's enough purchaches Ubisoft claimed they might make a real one (a post M&M VI revival).Still 100 times better than the new HoMM (not an achievment).Don't recommend to fans of the series expecting a Bioshock-Skyrim-Deus ex hybrid (aka M&MVII) - it's not.Do recommend to fans of pre-M&MVI or newbies who want to see what an 80's turn-based dungeon crawler feels like (except for the manually drawing your minimap bit).Basically if one gets his/hers expectations working for him/her, one might get the appropriate quantity of fun from this peculiar piece of entertainment.P.S.

												Yikes. Be sure you know what you are buying even if it is only $25. This is not just retro, it’s a trip back to the computer seventies. Movement is a square at a time. You are limited to the checkerboard regardless of what the picture looks like. Want your team to run off in a diagonal direction? Then get ready for a steady stream of left turn, forward, right turn, forward, left turn, forward, right turn, forward, etc. The enviroment is simply a desktop background. You can interact with very little that you see. There are no in-game physics. I don’t find this an immersive game play experience. There is some voice but mostly you will be reading lines. Team comments are limited, my team said “I think they smelled us, who hasn’t taken a bath?” at least 8 times in the 5 hours I've played. I’m not sure how much more of that I can take.Once an enemy is in sight you are most likely to become “engaged in combat.”   When you are in combat you cannot move, except to spin in place; and you cannot run away, a tactic that would be handy to use when you bump into an enemy too far advanced to handle early in the game. Not a deal breaker but another irritating thing about the new release is that you can't position your characters where you want in a formation. You can move them in the lineup but there is no overhead view or choice of formation. As far as I can tell, they are standing in a line. I loved the M&M series and looked forward to playing this with friends but I soon realized this is not the way I remember M&M.  With games like Skyrim, FarCry 3, Dead Island Riptide, M&MX is just too ancient to enjoy. I would have much preferred to see an M & M updated to accommodate free movement, an interactive environment and game physics like Skyrim et al. Such a game would have been interesting and I would have stood in line to plunk down $60 to play it.			"

												Highly recommend Might and Magic X - LegacyThe game is a perfect throwback to games I loved in the 80s and 90s.  It requires lots of thought to balance survivability and damage.  Putting a lot of thought into character development helps create an engrossing game experience.It's turn based, so it may appeal more to laidback gamers.  Success depends on planning, rather than mashing the keys at the right time.There is a great variety of spells and fighting styles, so for me there is replayability to try different spell schools and weapon types.I hope the developers make expansions based on this game, and look forward to the next edition.

												Fun game, lots of variety in party builds, good old school RPG gameplay (even has a retro-pixel mode!) but without the confusing sheets of numbers--everything is laid out for you to see and nothing is really hidden. Good puzzles with clever variety, challenging fights especially with some of the bosses, and an intriguing story as well. Having said this, the game does suffer from a lack of polish in terms of graphics and animations. It also uses Uplay which some people hate with a vengeance but I haven't had any problems with. But if you like Grimrock, baldur's gate, wizardry, or the older Might and Magic games (even 6, despite the lack of real-time mode in X), you'll find MMX quite satisfying.			"

												GREAT GAME.It's got the ""soul"" of the past Might and Magic games; lots of exploration, loot, character upgrades.  I had a great time.  It uses a lot of the same animation as the Heroes series, but the enemies are a little different in difficulty, to scale with the quests.The good: It's great fun if you loved the old M&M games or are new to the tile-based RPGs (Legend of Grimrock).  It will draw you in and you'll think about playing it and the next thing to do when away from it.The bad: It's Ubisoft, so it uses Uplay.The ugly: It didn't sell well enough early on so UBI is not planning a sequel.Update. Do NOT buy the DLC (Deluxe Version) ""The Falcon and the Unicorn"" if you have the chance. It's broken. It was clearly cobbled together and was not play tested before release.			"

												While most of the game was fun and interactive it had its downsides. For me free roam is a huge plus in a game which this game has. but the still restrict your movements by placing you on a grid. This is more challenging because it forces you into more fights which i love, but even then on the hardest difficulty this game is easy once you make it past the first act, the thing that i dont like is that i cant explore as much as id like to. the worst part of this game are the puzzles within the game. more than half of them dont make sense and i completed them with little more than luck and the last puzzle within the game is the worst of them all. it requires a certain knowledge that most people dont posses so good luck trying to figure it out on your own.

												This is a work in progress as of 2013-08-22 and an ""early access"" game.  Even so I expected a LOT more out of this but it falls sadly very, very short.  It's painful to play.  The older games are better.  The ""grid"" walking system is painful.  The combat is ""meh"".  The characters are flat and boring. The interface works but is sadly lacking.  The graphics - well, I think the older games looked better in their time than this does today.  The writing is so-so, the sound effects are re-used from older games (mostly) so there's some nostalgic value there but otherwise they're very bland.  Combat, the key activity in the game, is boring so far.  Again, the older games were more fun.  Maybe it's just me, maybe I'm not the gamer I used to be... but hopefully they'll fix this up and do it right.			"

												Well now, i am left wishing that this game was done by a out dev , basicly what this game is is heroes of might and magic with just a little classic dungeon crawl added with first person veiw intergrated into the game.alot of times i do feel like i am playing hom&m in 3d, that said it is a good game for what it is. it gives you a more personal veiw of the world of homm i honestly understand the mixed reviews if your looking for classic m&m game you probaly wont like this. if your a fan of hom&m you probaly wont like it if you like both m&m and heroes you will love it, with that pointed  out this game is quite great being a fan of both games "

												I can say, will do a bit of a quick review. So won't get too much into detail, but will cover the basics.It is a overall quite neat game. Taking the classic dungeoncrawl approach and spicing it up a little. While the graphic are notably ripped from heroes 6, I don't mind at all. After all, why waste assets when they have them? And they work well within the world so.That said, the game has some MASSIVE flaws, and some small annoyances.Can start with the small ones: For starters, there are too few lines of spoken dialog in this. Even with a diverse group, basically 70 % of all lines are identitcal between characters. Not that many, but heck, it's not far from it. They seriously cheaped out on that. The dialog that exist is pretty well done. But yeah, it incredibly fast gets repetitive  the 482'th time. Sometimes you can hear the same line 12+ times per minute. Depending on the situation.Secondly it's that, while more of a ""read up on it, scrub"" thing, your ""talent tree"" is something you heavily need to invest in, and plan ahead. You're not allowed to just pick it as you go, it became clear to me a bit in that I would have needed to plan my build from the start. As some skills are just far too vital not to have. Like how you literally can't complete certain dungeons without having certain spells and/or immunities.And while mostly a aestetic thing. It feels a bit dumb how you start as this ""kinda pro adventuring party"" with basically 0 equipment or skills. I get that you have to build your way up, but it's kinda derp how you're these supposedly bad♥♥♥♥♥""Raiders"", and you have some rusty, duct taped gear and barely know how to slap someone xP Not to mention: The game ocassionally forgets your UI, and resests some buttons to the ""default"" potion combination. Not a big annoyance, but can be a nuisance. Atop that, it seems some of the DLC content is bugged. I cashed in a reward for the deluxe edition package, but the item for it was never delivered, yet it claimed it had been cashed in.Now, for the massive flaws of this game in no particular order: (I was debating a bit wheter or not I would recommend this game, but in the end, it is a nice game. Yes, it will frustrate you a lot. But it has enough enjoyable moments to mostly weigh it up)1: The loading times are far too long.  It's not to bad in the start. But later in the game, these become a massive bother. ESPECIALLY as the game refuse to load if you are tabbed out. So you can't enter a dungeon or the like, then tab out, check a few things and tab back in during the up to 30+ second long loadingscreens. This becomes ESPECIALLY annoying due to the next in this list, which will force you to repeatedly re-load over and over and over and over and over. It's just a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way to pad on extra hours of gameplay.2: The RNG creep. I could be that I had a bad party combo. But some enemies just get plain stupid with this. Most of the undead are a great example of this. With one lucky hit, and many enemies seem to have 20-40 % crit chance, they can, and will 1-shot any non-tank party member. Just like that. Poof. And there's nothing you can do about it aside from spam protective spells. Which, makes you unable to attack. While they normally hit for like, 41 damage, when they crit, it can be anywhere from 180-260 damage if they feel like it. And when a ex: magic hero at that level has around 100 hp, they're just toast. So at many places, you just have to save, enter combat, hope RNG doesn't screw you over, if so, load and rinse and repeat. You're not being challanged the least, your patience is just being tested. 3: Broken skills and events. Some abilities don't work on enemies, or are outright broken. Like how if you stun an enemy, they can still retaliate, block and all that. While you aren't allowed to do so if stunned as a character. And there's dozens of design flaws like that around. And some events break when you save at a particular palce or time. Like, one event in a crow temple, an entire encouter crashes and vanishes if you save after you talk to a spirit. Which mind you, is a place with the issue in 2 mentioned. So you have to save before you talk to them. Talk to them, enter fight and hope each turn you don't have the ~5-10 % chance of getting instantly killed and be force to load, while you try to take down 6 enemies  at both sides of you with like, 1500 hp each. Each one of these capable to 1 shot your non-tanks. Currently at that fight as I am writing this, and have been for around 2 hours, 1 of which has just been pure loading time. For a game so heavily reliant on QS and QL, this type of droll padding just isn't acceptable. I'd at most expet 5-10 second loading time, at most. Many parts of this game is pure trial and error via RNG. Atop that, you only get experience for enemies if a hero is alive, and without and negative condition on them. Like what? My mage didn't learn anything at all from figthing a dragon, just becuase she got backhanded by said dragon and stunned, and her magical boots managed to kill the dragon? She had to be fully aware and witness as the dragon died, or else the entire fight was just some dull pasttime she couldn't learn anything from?4: No ability to flee. For a game that places it's level 20 monsters next to it's level 1 obligatory giant rats. This is such a huge design flaw I don't even know what to say... It's like removing/not including a dodge or block manouver in a fighting game... like, the actual murloc? This ties heavily in with the save/load issue. As, every time you find something new or a new area, you are forced to save to know if you even are allowed to be there, before you head on in. Your entire party got 1-shotted by a magically farting spider? Welp, you better load then, possinly after being forced through a game over screen, to then be made to wait a total of 1 minute before you are allowed back in. It's just not acceptable as said with the massive amounts of lazy padding this game has. It's like... it's a great game in here, why was so much bad descisions stuffed into it? Despite this being a late, patched version of the game. I really fear how terrible it must have been at launch.  There's seriusly a good game in here. It's just brutally hampered by multiple poor choices and design errors.I think this wraps up most of it... but yeah. I'd perhaps give a 6.5 out of ten? Nice game, but far too often just plain frustrating. Just knowing that ""Oh, I see my tactic and team was irrelevant here, I just wans't lucky enough with the dice rolls to progress... better spend a mintute reloading the... not saying RNG is always bad. But when it becomes a major part of the game itself... it's just frustarting. Adding numbers or making the AI cheat just to upp the difficulty is just poor design. Yes, I know it's sort of ""needed""sometimes, but it's very tacky regardless. There's just far too many areas where you're simply not allowed to do anything to affect the outcome of things. Or would have had to play the game prior to know which things to bring where.			"

												Despite some minor flaws in the technical department this game is surprisingly good. I guess the mixed reviews come from the rather oldschool type of game we have here. Grid based movement isnt everyones thing i guess. M&M X is more fight oriented than for instance Legend of Grimlock. Puzzels are there, but dont are the focus of the game. If you liked the old grid-based rpgs, you will like this one too.			"

												Started with early access. Played chapter one, was not impressed at all. This final release however is surprisingly good. Looks like developers listened to the comments and followed up most of them. It really has original Might and Magic feel with long-playing quests you strarts on level 1 and fnish near the end of the game, water walking abilities, hints of interstellar adventure etc.Uplay sucks, of course, but after initial installation it was fairly transparent.

Its not a M&M6-9 series: in Legacy you havent find large territory, tactitcs, flying spell and so on. Its not M&M3-5 series: Legacy doesnt have their atmosphere and plot.As a fan of M&M games i recommend not to buy it. It is fake.			"

												Fantastic turn-based, grid-based fantasy RPG.  Similar to Legend of Grimrock, but bigger and better in most respects.  Play on the warrior difficulty for a serious, but fair challenge.  There's not a lot of hand-holding -- with riddles, puzzles, and high-level mobs strewn about the continent.  It's an interesting, loot-filled, and occasionally unforgiving dungeon crawler, and I highly recommend it. "

												As a hardcore M&M series gamer and have finished this game. What this game lacks can be described in one word and that word is grandness. Start with music department. It is relatively weak and as I am writing this, I can't remember any of its melody. Whereas if I am asked to play music from M&M 6 on a piano now. I can do it in a heartbeat and it was more than 16 years ago since I first played M&M 6. Next thing is items. In Legacy, items are represented by small icons inside inventory window. How lame is that. A two-handed axe has the same dimension and takes up the same amount of spaces as an one-handed dagger. It just feels cheap and low quality. Another thing M&M 6 outshines Legacy is  critters. Where are titans, medusas and dragons? You even get to kill angels in previous games. In Legacy, minotaurs are pretty much the only epic monster left. And it is introduced early in the game (Act 2). By the time you reache the end, most of the monsters you are fighting are human like. If I want to kill human, I might as well be playing Battlefield 4.However, this game has shown some improvements. Improvements like spells. In Legacy, they have removed many useless spells. But dark school magic is still a waste of time once you reach expert level. Battles are not as grand but require more tactic. Map and towns are not huge, if you like sightseeing you may get disapointed. But the good part is that you don't waste too much time travelling around. Overall, this is a good game. If you are looking for an old school RPG. This is it. If you are a M&M fan looking for something that would blow every M&M game out of water. You may get disappointed. But Legacy is certainly worth a try.  "

												As a huge fan of the original games I have to say this game is disgraceful. It is not Might & Magic that  I knew and loved when I was younger. The Dark Side of Xeen from 1993 was more fun to play than this game :( I had really high hopes for this and I have kicked myself repeatedly for buying it. It is all turn based, no real time option like there used to be. The maps are super limiting in movement making it much less free roaming than the others. The art and effects are amazing compared to the old games, and the story line is acceptable, but the game play kills it.			"

												7.5/10. As a MM fan having played all MM games, this game actually succeeds in capturing the MM charme and spirit! It is nice to level up, train with trainers, and get to Expert, Master and GM status. The game is well balanced, quite difficult at the beginning, so that you will need to come back later for some bosses, and even in late game, remains challenging. The size of the game is nice, also that there are some riddles and puzzles in the dungeons.Negative: Graphics outdated, bad decisions in the beginning (many experts, Masters are not accessible until later acts, as they are located in cities you cant access!), a lot of walking around due to lack of decent teleport system; weak presentation of the ""story"". Last, UPLAY does not work properly if game is bought through Steam... you need to contact Support to be able to get UPlay points and unlock Rewards (worked with al other UPlay gmaes I have).All in all, a nice and addicting RPG similar to older MM titles, which could have been grand with a higher budget and a better engine, but delivers on what it tries to be. Too bad it was no success, and likely there will be no future games like this.			"

												Ahhh, that was a really enjoyable game. I played its older 'sister' and was happy to see the same spirit with immensely better graphics. All the cool stuff from the previous game remains and more interesting elements were added (fun secrets, riddles to stir your brain, etc.) The only minus I found was that some quests can't be finished because they are class-specific, but hey, that makes replayability potential higher :-) Although the plot is straighforward you can just go on exploring the world. I will definitely play it again in the near future and I await further DLC because one (with a bit hard level of difficulty) is just not enough. Uplay as usual is a definite minus for Ubisoft.			"

												The game is ok-ish at best. I am a huge Might & Magic fan and I always go back to mm6, mm7 and mm8.The game kinda stays in the same category and it can be a pleasant experience.There are a few things which put me off :1. Grid based movement. I mean 3DO build a world where you could move freely and so many years later Ubisoft can't do the same ? Really bad.2. The game is very small and the story lacking compared to any previous game.3. No flying !4. The biggest turn off for me was the complete lack of gear display. In any M&M game you could see the appearance of your character changing with every piece of gear equipped. You could what an armour looks like, on your character. This is actually very important for an RPG game. M&M X - no, sorry, w can't allow you to see that.5. skill advancement is blocked so you can't invest points as you could before. Once you hit the max level in a skill that's it, rogression stopped.All these things aside, the game is fun and worth playing. It can be challenging especially on warrior difficulty. If you liked the previous M&M games you will learn to love this one as well.			"

It is extremely fun to play and challenges the gamer to build an efficient party of travelers with enough diversity to handle the different challenges of the game.The gameplay and lore are top notch. The game renders somewhat slowly when transitioning from area to area and there's a small level of polishing that has been missed, but the core of the game is great.			"

												THIS IS M&M ! Wonderful game, but like everyone says, its less complete than the previous ones, but its been a long time since no game like these came out of development studios ! Definitely worth buying, even if main quest is quite short, they are tons of subquests. For M&M veteran, Warrior mode will add a good difficulty by increasing mobs HP & stats but also by increasing costs of items / repair etc.But like many M&M players, i feel that the grid-movment system is kinda wrong with an open world RPG like this even if we get accustomed to this really fast (Speaking of grid based movment, I really enjoyed Legends of Grimmrock in which, I think, it's more suitable than in this episode of M&M).Last words, WE WANT MORE OF THIS. MORE MORE MORE. PLS. :D			"

Making it basically unplayable past that point. I've looked on the web and apparently this is an extremely common bug (in that a lot of people playing this game get it) and there's no workaround. I strongly recommend against buying it because basically the game will be ripped out of your hands just as you're starting to really get into it, which is a lot worse than paying $20 and then getting no game at all.

												Might and Magic X was a good game. I picked it up at full price as I played and completed all MM6, MM7, MM8, and MM9. I was a bit skeptical about this game, but as I started playing I could not leave it alone. I do have to admit that map is very small compared to previous games and graphical performance is not opimized as I have GTX 680 with 4gb of RAM and I see frame drops. Thats bad. Game is very playable and enjoyable and I belive every fan of Might and Magic should give it a try. I enjoyed final boss strategy. Great game, just needs more content and optimatization.			"

												Jogaço. RPG vintage estilo os RPG de computador da década de 90. Basicamente é o já conhecido Heroes of might and magic, mas em primeira pessoa. Estou no momento com 64 HORAS de jogo e estou um pouco mais da METADE do game. Se vc sentia saudades dos rpgs antigos de computador e um nível de dificuldade hardcore, vale a pena a compra. E claro, é um mergulho de cabeça no mundo do Heroes... se vc curte a série, vai curtir ainda mais.			"

												+ Nice combination of old school turn-based RPG and modern comfort features (annotatable automap, easy comparison between different items via mouse-over, rest anywhere instead of only in safe zones etc).+ Turn-based battles require a lot of micro-management of your character's spells and skills. For me, it was a great part of the fun of MMX - for other players this might be a turn-off.+ Thoughtful management of your character's attributes and new skill points is a must - but it's also very rewarding when you reach a new weapon proficiency or finally master a new, powerful spell.+ Decent variety of enemies, though there are only about two to three different types per dungeon / overworld area. Each type of enemy has different resistances and skills - you have to adapt your attacks / buffs / debuffs accordingly.+/- Loads and loads of loot, but too often enemies drop only useless stuff (weak weapons and armour for the most part). On the other hand, a decent number of powerful ""relics"" (weapons, armour) can be found in the most remote and dangerous areas of the game. These relics make a real difference in battle, especially as you can level them up (4 levels each) by simply having them equipped in battle. Levelled up to max, these relics are the most powerful items in the game.+/- You will often run into enemies who are simply too strong for your characters, requiring you to level up and get some better gear before you return. A classic feature, yes, but this can be annoying if you haven't yes found an area / dungeon where your characters can level up without the constant threat of getting killed by strong mobs.- Story is okay, delivered mostly by NPC ""talking heads"" (text only, speech in very rare cases) and books containing background information about the world and its history. Almost no dialogue choices for your characters. All in all, the story of main quest and side quests is serviceable, but not very engaging.- Quality of character models and textures ranges from ""serviceable"" to ""eyesore"".- No crafting. Would have been nice because too many of the weapons in shops or dropped by enemies are useless.- As of mid February 2014, annoying bugs still remain (parts of the environment turn invisible, quest rewards not given etc). Your mileage may vary; I did not encounter any quest-breaking bugs.All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this games to all fans of classic, turn-based RPGs. It's not perfect and still needs some patching - but there are simply tons of fun to be had while fighting and exploring.			"

												It saddens me that this game was frowned upon by gamers. Because it is actually good. For me M&M-X looks like a large priceless ruby with small flaws and dents here and there.Yes, it has filthy Uplay, but once you set it up it won't bother you much.Game has minor bugs and glitches, but nothing gamebreaking so far.It degrades performance after a few hours of gameplay.It will have slowdowns when you pass through borders between locations with different objects (ex. From Plains to Forest), and poor performance in some locations like magic forest and jungle.I don't have CtDs, or other stability issues.Game has beautiful graphics and looks very nice. It also has pretty balanced and satisfying gameplay.Barks of your characters were poorly done and feels like a result of lazy work.Puzzles are somewhat easy to solve. Nothing too complex.I can't remember a single RPG from the past that hadn't some bugs in it. For an example: There were bugs in Ultima 8: Pagan, and in both Ultima Underworld games, but they still were great games because of gameplay.If you like this gameplay style and look and feel of RPGs from the past, then buy M&M-X on sale for a few bucks like I did. Game deserves to be played alongside with Legend of Grimrock 1 and 2.			"

												I was skeptical at first from some of the reviews, but i've been playing it for about 9 hours and having fun. No bugs and my middle of the road rig is handling it okay. Only reason I got it though was the 75% off sale, and its definitly worth it at that price. I dont like Grimlock because of the freakishly hard puzzles but this is more combat orientated which can be hard but not ""Pull my hair out and have to watch a you tube video to get past a level"" hard. This is just me though, some like those freaky ♥♥♥ puzzles, not me. Turned based rpg goodness I like. (Though having to sign up for U-play seperatly is kinda annoying).			"

												If you enjoyed the old Might & Magic games, this is OK for a couple of hours, but once the nostalgia wears off, there's not much reason to keep playing.  The format is very dated compared to modern role-playing games, and other than updated graphics, this is backwards step compared to the older games - it's much smaller and simpler, and missing many of the features that made the series interesting (e.g. potion mixing, arcomage card game).  Movement is constrained to a fixed grid and real-time play has been completely removed.  Combat locks you in place, and you can get a wide range of difficulty of monsters in a small area, so it's easy to find yourself up against something you can't beat with no means of running away.I bought the version that comes with a copy of M&M VI, and it says a lot that I've spent far more time playing that!

												I played mm6 thru mm8. I loved them all.I like this one very much. It has the feeling of the old ones. To sum things up:Pros:-combat sistem and spells/skills combos to get you thru the fight-it's big. Compared with the old ones. Usualy the new games you finish them in one day, this one can keep you posted for days.-mini puzles-unique items that lvl up with xp-after killing 7 times a npc you can get all his stats (resists, defence etc)-the atmosphere-the dificulty (i;m playing it warrior dificulty- the biggest) is just enough to keep an old school player on his toes.-the greed to explrore more and moreCons:-grid movement it;s getting me sick.-static NPCs, lacks life-overall static decor of the map-interface could be better-lacks customisation of your characters. 4 pictures and 2 voice types/genre-frew spells and skills (it could be interesting with more to spice things up)Overall i like it very much. If you loved the last MM's, you will love this one to.If you never played the old ones, start with MM6 and play them all until this one, trust me the graphix does not mather of what this game offeres.I hope this could help anyopne to decide.Buy it!

												Old-school rpg in a new coat. Skins and models are ripped of Heroes 5 and 6, sounds are rather nice (albeit there could be more variations), ingame art is OK. Game is more action-based, but there are passages for storytelling and side questlines with some memorable/funny moments. Game is oriented towards might and magic fans, who will be able to ""get"" some  hidden puns and jokes. Combat can be tough sometimes (on warrior difficulty), but it promotes synergy between characters and once you understand how things work, you should not have any significant problems. As far as I can tell, there many working ""builds"" for characters, so you do not need to rely on certain auto-include skills/spells, but basic party structure still applies here - someone to soak dmg, someone to heal and someone to do dmg.All in all I can recommend this game as solid and enjoyable RPG, for those who like to spend some time thinking how to make a party work and then apply it.

												A Welcome Return To Old School RPG GamingFor the tl;dr crowd:Pros:* Really truly does recapture the feeling of old school Might & Magic games, particularly the World of Xeen games (which was what this was patterned after)* Tough but fair* Strategic combatCons:* Optimization issues* Requires UPlay (It's Ubisoft, no way around UPlay, unfortunately)Now for the long winded review:When I first heard about this game I was first of all shocked, as it had been so long since a core Might & Magic game had been released (I bet there is a contingent of people that prior to the release of this game though Heroes of Might & Magic was the core series, rather than the spinoff it is) that I just assumed the series was dead and buried.  I was both excited and a bit scared.  Excited because holy smokes a new core Might & Magic game!  Scared because it was being made by a developer I didn't really know and that had, to the best of my knowledge, no prior experience making an old school RPG like this.  Would they be able to recapture the Might & Magic feeling?  Would they get the mechanics right?  Would they try to modernize it too much?After reading up on the team and following their blog for a bit, it became apparent that these people were a fan of the games and genuinely passionate about making an old school RPG.  They also revealed that they were patterning this game after World of Xeen (M&M 4 & 5), going with turn-based and grid-based, rather than free movement and real-time, like M&M 6-9.  While I enjoyed M&M 6-8 quite a bit, 9 not so much, I was also a huge fan of the World of Xeen games and was happy with this decision, so I decided to pull the trigger and get this.I can now happily say that I chose wisely.  This game has exceeded my expectations.  While the game isn't exactly pushing graphical boundaries and there are some jarringly low res models and textures mixed in, the game is plenty pretty enough for my tastes and it has a certain charm to it.  I suspect Ubisoft didn't exactly give Limbic a massive budget to work with, so I wasn't expecting The Witcher 2 levels of eye candy.  Much more importantly, this is an honest to goodness old school Might & Magic game.  The setting and story follow the Heroes of Might & Magic games timeline rather than M&M 9, but mechanically they really did a great job of recreating the World of Xeen gameplay.There are 12 classes among 4 races to choose from (3 per race) filling the roles of fighters, casters, and various hybrids in between.  The game doesn't hold your hand and you learn on the job, which may be a turn off for some gamers, but is very welcome in my book.  Certain class combinations will work better than other, and it's certainly possible to build a party that's going to get stomped in the game, but there is room for a variety of different viable combination.  Balanced parties (a mix of warrior and mage types) will naturally work the best, as they usually do in RPGs, but it's possible to go mage-heavy (though you will burn through a lot of mana potions) or warrior-heavy and still succeed.The game is quite challenging, but not cheap.  There are 2 difficulty settings:  Adventurer and Warrior, corresponding to Normal and Hard respectively, though, compared to the average game of these days, they're more like Hard and Very Hard.  This game will kick your behind and you will die.  There is no sleepwalking through fights except for the most basic of weak enemies.  If you try to sleepwalk on simply brute force your way (even with a warrior-heavy party) through battles you will get destroyed.  You have to use your head to survive.  The game constantly puts you into confrontations where you are surviving by your wits and the skin of your teeth, and that's on Adventurer difficulty.  Warrior difficulty is straight up punishing, and I love it!There is a good bit of strategy in using your various spells and abilities to protect yourself, buff your allies, debuff enemies, debilitate them, and deal damage.  Plus the grid-based movement adds another layer of tactics, making for a chess-like game of maneuvering where you try to lure ranged enemies into melee without getting pelted by arrows and spells while advancing on them, or getting as many ""free"" volleys of arrows on melee enemies before they close to melee, all while being mindful of the terrain to position yourself in a spot to prevent being flanked or surrounded.  It's a well thought out system that forces you to use all the skills at your disposal.  It can seem overwhelming when you're caught off guard and a group of enemies creeps up behind you while other enemies close in from the front and you're caught in a vice in a seemingly hopeless battle, frantically trying to keep your party members alive while trying to take out key enemies before they can demolish you.  But when you survive a battle like that, it's that much more satisfying, so much better than mindlessly steamrolling through trash mobs like in so many RPGs.  In conclusion, Might & Magic is a throwback to the RPGs of the 80s and the 90s, with much of the good and the bad that comes with that.  It's a wonderful nostalgia ride and Limbic did a terrific job of delivering an authentic old school RPG experience.  It's thoroughly challenging and quite satisfying.  If you're looking for an old-school turn-based RPG romp, look no further.			"

												This game has some potential, but the irritating design choices overwhelm that potential in my mind.First off, ""open world"" this game is not.  You have exactly one direction you can go through the first town, you can't even leave town without finishing a railroad quest, unless I missed something.  And even after leaving your world is made up of ""you can go to X different dungeons, but X-1 of them will kill you instantly"" so you really just have the illusion of choice.  Maybe it opens up past the first region, but if you have to get that far in to a game for it to be open world, it isn't.This railroading leads to the biggest issue I have compared to the old games, party composition.  I'm sure some dedicated players will be able to prove me wrong but I honestly don't feel like most party combinations will be viable in this game because of the mission you have to do before leaving town.  In the old games you could run a full ranged party and soften things up enough before they get to you if you were willing to accept that sometimes you don't soften them up enough and you get stomped.  This game doesn't seem to make that an option since there is no way to skip the first dungeon and it railroads you in to melees without the chance for an opening volley.  And that's not even considering the spells you have to run if you want to be able to explore everything.  Don't have a good coverage of the spell schools?  Prepare to miss a lot or use a guide.Even with these issues aside the mechanics just don't feel like they're there.  Outside of your weapons skills skill increases just don't seem to do much. For instance, armor skills reduce your penalty to wear armor, so if you've already negated the penalty it's just a waste of a point to put them there until you find the trainer or better armor. Unlike the old games you can't increase skills past a certain point without finding a trainer, so you end up maxing out your barbarian's mace and two-hander skills and then just throwing points into other things at random, or saving them until you can find the trainers, making your progression slam in to a wall.  Battles are just slug fests with both sides having what feels like high chances to block or dodge, which makes poison especially irritating since there's no, apparent, way to resist it and you can go three turns without anybody hitting someone if you're unlucky.  Any sort of incapacitation keeps that character from gaining XP, yes, even stun, so you find yourself stalling a battle so your tank will wake up and gain XP from the kill, only for the mage to get stunned and you to have to wait again.Overall there are just too many little issues that build up to make this game not fun, and there are too many games out there to waste time on one that's frustrating and not fun.  I feel bad for Limbic but hopefully this game got enough attention that Ubisoft will get someone that knows what they're doing, and has at least played a Might and Magic game before, for another attempt, because this could have been good.

Definitely worth buying, even if main quest is quite short, they are tons of subquests. For M&M veteran, Warrior mode will add a good difficulty by increasing mobs HP & stats but also by increasing costs of items / repair etc.But like many M&M players, i feel that the grid-movment system is kinda wrong with an open world RPG like this even if we get accustomed to this really fast (Speaking of grid based movment, I really enjoyed Legends of Grimmrock in which, I think, it's more suitable than in this episode of M&M).Last words, WE WANT MORE OF THIS.

												I would say for at least one run through the game is pretty fun and addicting. This is for those who like the turn based old school movement and battles. Although not exactly like the Might and Magic Xeen games, it takes many of it's elements into consideration. It's a little clunky in some ways not an AAA title, but probably just an A or B+ title. The dev team was fairly small lower budget, but still did the best they could with what they had I think. It is a must to play on warrior difficulty as adventure I thought was too east.			"

												I grew up on M&M games, sometimes spending all night playing them when I was younger.  When I found this game I was excited enough to just buy it without checking the reviews.  That was unfortunate, especially as a Mac user first, and Windows user second.This game does not work on Mac.  It is simple as that.  There are just too many stability problems.  It is consistently locking up at various times.As a M&M fan, the game play is nostalgiac.  It may not be exciting enough for new comers to the series, however.  I do enjoy playing it because of the connection I had to all the previous games years ago.Recommendation is No because it really is not compatible with Mac computers.Edit: OK.  I am going to change my review based on Windows version.  It works fine and is still pretty fun to play.  It reminds me of the days when I played many years ago and I have no problems with the game so far.  This is after completing Story 1 on the Windows Version.Mac version is still garbage.			"

												While most of the game was fun and interactive it had its downsides. For me free roam is a huge plus in a game which this game has. but the still restrict your movements by placing you on a grid. This is more challenging because it forces you into more fights which i love, but even then on the hardest difficulty this game is easy once you make it past the first act, the thing that i dont like is that i cant explore as much as id like to. the worst part of this game are the puzzles within the game. more than half of them dont make sense and i completed them with little more than luck and the last puzzle within the game is the worst of them all. it requires a certain knowledge that most people dont posses so good luck trying to figure it out on your own.

												For what it is this is an amazing nod to the genre... that being said I miss some of the elements of 6, 7 and 8 unfortunately was never able to beat 9. I would love to see the developers return to the old style and re-release the orginals so i can buy them and play them once more Awesome Game! Must play if you enjoy any of the might and magics!			"

												I loved it and had a great time playing it, but you may not.  So, let's discuss it's progency, for a moment.The game owes it's existence to the joyful Legend of Grimrock, which did a great job updating the games of my youth.  MMX is an even more direct throwback to the original Bard's Tale in 1985.  The Bard's Tale took Wizardry and added outdoor areas.  Sure, they weren't that different -- they were basically dungeons with sky blue tiles as opposed to underground grey and brown tiles, but the effect worked on me.  If you have some nostalgia for the early days of RPG gaming, this will likely hit a home run.  It reminds me of playing games on my Apple II, even including watching the graphics render.  What I really enjoyed most was developing my characters and watching them become increasingly powerful.  I wanted them well prepared for the final battle, and there are many opportunities to improve their skills and their loot.Pros:- RPG nostalgia- Good skills and character development options- Good magic system- The individual quests and dungeon were mostly fun- Combat is well done- To me, at least, the game is almost perfectly balanced (with the stock party).  Only toward the end did I begin to feel overpowered.  Most of the game, the battles were close and tense, but rarely did my entire party die.- Great opportunities for exploration -- there is always something new to find- No monster respawns!!  Once you clear an area, it stays clear.  I like that.Cons:- Graphics look good, but take a long time to render.  At one point, the landscape renders well before the castle sitting on the landscape renders.  That's just weird.- Members have your party have comments about everything going on around them.  I love that.  Except that they repeat the same things over and over and over again.  We get it... human cities are as dangerous as the jungle.  Let's move on.  When characters finish a major battle, they cheer an entirely disingenuous ""Yay!""  It sounds exactly like a bunch of poorly paid actors sitting around their home microphones trying to appear enthusiastic.-  With some exceptions, most of the battles use pretty much the same tactics.  I had the same criticism of Dragon Age.  So this game is not unique, in this regard.I've invested about 55 hours into this game.  And I had a lot of fun doing it.  If you have  a soft spot in your heart for the RPG dungeon-crawling heyday of the 80s, I think you'll really enjoy this.  I sure did. "

On normal, theres a hump in Act 2, and by the end it's a little too easy, but It's highly enjoyable. If you like RPG's, buy this game. It's not boring at all besides some of the world map navigation. Combat is a blast, leveling up is fun, some of your gear even levels with you. Minor complaints only. World map can be tedious and confusing and some quests are vauge, but they are supposed to be b/c it's ""old school"". Buy this game. Now. Don't wait. Support this. Enjoy this!			"

												I'm currently playing the full release.Pros:-Interesting update on the ""old school"" first-person step-based RPGs-Wide range of character classes and party customisation-Good tactical combat systemCons:-Mediocre graphics and ""generic"" world design - hardly has any of the charm of classic MM games; note the recommendation to play at minimum settings in order not to experience low framerate (which happens often)-Full of bugs and frequent crashes (my game crashed literally every 2 minutes in Act 2)-Despite the ""open world"" concept - in reality I found the game rather linearSuggest to purchase the game ONLY when more technical support and patches are available. Hardly lives up to the Might and Magic legacy though. "

												so, i will start off by saying, i REALLY enjoy this game. it's fun, it's a pretty good ""oldschool"" RPG, and it seems like there's a lot of content to keep you busy (i'm on act III).  if you do not have patience for games that are technical failures, because this game is just that, i recommend you save your money. it runs TERRIBLY on a high end pc with 4gb of video memory and looks kinda bad. frame stuttering, crashing due to moving too fast on the terrain, the worst popins you've probably EVER seen in a game, horrid sound issues (music keeps overlapping for some damn reason, combat sounds cut out randomly), among other random things. because this game was ""Released"" in such a techinically poor state, i cannot recommend this to the average consumer! companies releasing games in this state is becoming a trend and we shouldn't support it. don't buy this game.

												Basically if you liked the othet Might and Magic games you going to like this one. I do not regret having bough itPros* The game is fun in general.* The classes are cool.* Fights are tense and interesting.* Choosing where to spend you money, skills and atributes have a major impact in the fights outcome.* The game is quite challenging in the Warrior difficulty.Cons* The map needs a major UI overhaul. It is so hard to even understand it, there is no information whatsoever of what you visited, you have to create a note on top of every single thing. * You are forced to create an Uplay account and it has to be open all the time, such an annoyance.* Its hard to protect your casters as every enemy attack have a random roll on who it will hit. Taunt doesnt help much as it has a mana cost at each turn and can be blocked/dodged.* No information about what is the chance of block, parry and dodge of the enemies, seems QUITE high. "

												First of all: ♥♥♥♥ uplay.I seriously hate this godawful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t excuse of a software as much I hate ""origin"". And that says much.I guess cloud synchronizing save-game files is just too much of a feature to ask these days, huh? Just delete that♥♥♥♥♥♥and do it properly in Steam along with everything else instead of trying to push your useless subpar piece of software.Now, to the game:It's incredible. I love it to pieces, 24 hours in I am nowhere near final stages of the game it seems. If you liked Classic M&M - you will like this most likely. It does stray from some of the canons of 6-8, sometimes back to the roots, sometimes just keeping in tune with current-gen design practices. But the main - the feel of M&M is there, and it's gorgeous. I wouldn't try to compare it to Legend of Grimrock (though the comparisons really jumps to mind), because essentially the things that are great about this game are non-existent in LoG (Lore, colorful world, variety of characters, skills and systems) and vise a versa the things that made LoG great are a bit on the sidelines here (secrets are a plainer system, puzzles are not that convoluted, combat system not dynamic at all (it's actually Turn-based here), I would even say the graphics were a bit more spot on in LoG.Nevertheless, If you have waited for this game: buy it now, you will not regret it.If you haven't waited for this game: check out the videos to see if it's something that you might enjoy and probably give MM 6/8 a whirl first before picking this up, because that's an immortal cllassic. I cannot fully say this one is too, because I do see some problems with it. I guess 50 hours later I'll see! =)			"

												Its a very nice game in its series, got tons of lore and gives an old school feeling will playing. It allso gives a nice challenge where you have to get famillair with your characters skills so you can overcome some hard battles. With that said there is a voice of warning for all how want to buy this game, this isn't a mindless hack and slash game and there is some thinking ahead involved where you have to make you self familiar with the mecanics of the game your parties skills and abilities. Other then that they have created a nice use of turn base where like in chess you can think ahead with your moves.			"

												So you want to play a retro game? Remember a few things about the past games first. The difficulty level will be ramped up, there will be no hand holding, you will have to think not click past fights. No NPC with explanation points, its trial and error and dialog trees to get quests. Long time burns to go from place to place with unfair fights that you have to avoid for a while then come back to when you level up. This is the core of the original games and its a fresh breeze of awesomeness. So many new games are click fests, afraid to make the game too difficult for people. Not here, its not Dark Souls but it is very much Might and Magic. It will be a bit too hard for the average ADD click kid but if you have a level head and are willing to learn and grow with a game this will be your ticket. It has flaws still but forgivable flaws. My guess is in just a few months this should be a well polished game that will no doubt make me happy for quite a while.			"

												Disappointing game... I'm a fan of the series but this iteration falls flat.  Quest information does not help much.  Paper dolls don't change with class promotion so there is little feeling of change even though for the char they did a major mile stone.  No respawn of monsters.  Finally story is boring no sense of purpose.  Very crappy that the early access crew paid more than the release cost, I assume sales knew they had a flop.  Wait for the price to hit less than 10 then play this game when nothing else is out.			"

But I am sorry to say that this game is not like these old real-time games at all. If you enjoyed those old game this game is most likely not for you. Those are the main reasons: 1. All battles are lock-and-fight-turn-based 2. Every step you take is counted as a turn (meaning that all creatures stand still until you make your next move). In short: this is a boardgame in 3D environment. Best wishes  "

I'm playing on adventurer and it's a good balance of difficulty.+The music is excellent!!-Has a couple annoying bugs.

												I love this game, it has surpassed all my expectations.Yes, it's low budget, but what do you expect from such a niche title being released by a big publisher? Yes, it's turn-based and you move your party around on a grid. This makes the combat fairly tactical (especially since it's pretty well balanced) and a ton of fun, but if you don't like that kind of thing then stay away.It's also a difficult game at times, and there are places you won't be able to go at first because the monsters are too tough. But it rewards planning ahead in tough fights, and if you still can't win you can usually come back later when you're more powerful and have a satisfying time wiping the floor with your enemies.I'm seriously surprised that this game turned out as good as it did, I hope it sells well enough for expansions and sequels because I'd love to play more of this game on a new quest.

												I played mm6 thru mm8. I loved them all.I like this one very much. It has the feeling of the old ones. To sum things up:Pros:-combat sistem and spells/skills combos to get you thru the fight-it's big. Compared with the old ones. Usualy the new games you finish them in one day, this one can keep you posted for days.-mini puzles-unique items that lvl up with xp-after killing 7 times a npc you can get all his stats (resists, defence etc)-the atmosphere-the dificulty (i;m playing it warrior dificulty- the biggest) is just enough to keep an old school player on his toes.-the greed to explrore more and moreCons:-grid movement it;s getting me sick.-static NPCs, lacks life-overall static decor of the map-interface could be better-lacks customisation of your characters. 4 pictures and 2 voice types/genre-frew spells and skills (it could be interesting with more to spice things up)Overall i like it very much. If you loved the last MM's, you will love this one to.If you never played the old ones, start with MM6 and play them all until this one, trust me the graphix does not mather of what this game offeres.I hope this could help anyopne to decide.Buy it!

												Old-school rpg in a new coat. Skins and models are ripped of Heroes 5 and 6, sounds are rather nice (albeit there could be more variations), ingame art is OK. Game is more action-based, but there are passages for storytelling and side questlines with some memorable/funny moments. Game is oriented towards might and magic fans, who will be able to ""get"" some  hidden puns and jokes. Combat can be tough sometimes (on warrior difficulty), but it promotes synergy between characters and once you understand how things work, you should not have any significant problems. As far as I can tell, there many working ""builds"" for characters, so you do not need to rely on certain auto-include skills/spells, but basic party structure still applies here - someone to soak dmg, someone to heal and someone to do dmg.All in all I can recommend this game as solid and enjoyable RPG, for those who like to spend some time thinking how to make a party work and then apply it.

												First and foremost this game is RETRO!!! Which means all you noob gamers weened on skyrim and all the fancy flashy graphics and refined systems of modern day gaming...get over yourself and pay homage to history. I played World of Xeen back in the 90s when it first came out, and since then have played every Might and magic game I could, including the heroes games and every spin off etc. I mention Xeen specifically because this game is basically the great gand child of that game and all the games to come between then and now were just pretenders to the throne. I do my homework, I read every publication of every review for every game I buy without fail, I start with meta critic and work my way down the list via thier links. And every mouth breathing tard wanting to put down a few black and white pixels about the shortcomings of this game obviously missed the point of RETRO!!! Forget the reviews dont listen to the nay sayers every single part of this game was made intentionally, the grid system the combat, the OP enemies early on. Its all about the ambiance, and the history and the very concept of a game of this ilk. Its funny too cause you read reviews on games that scream RETRO!!!! fromt he start and they are considered masterpieces of old school gaming and should be admired for thier edgy psuedo-historical content. Most of the are garbage to be honest and just some lazy indie developer trying to get recognized or paid. Its a great game, well crafted and rich in content and ideas. Go in with a retro mindset and dont try to compare it to every modern game out there, appreciate it for its commitment to history, and wallow in its ""hardcore"" difficulty and most of all be proud of yourself for playing a true masterpiece of gaming, because to be honest, in this day and age we all eat enough garbage in our entertainment media, gems like this should never be overlooked.

												Disclaimer: This review is influenced by nostalgia.I grew up on Might & Magic and Wizardry games, and my favorite was the combined package of M&M 4/5 that was World of Xeen. It's to them that Legacy's core gameplay pays homage. You move your party of four on a grid in the first person. Everything functions in a turn based manner, and your party fights small groups, not armies. I'll admit that when Might and Magic 6 came out, I was a bit disappointed in that changes in the game mechanics. That's not to say I didn't enjoy the game, but I didn't care for the, admittedly optional, real time mode. With that in mind, I'm very happy with how Legacy draws many of its movement mechanics from my preferred games in the series. Legacy does use M&M6+'s (in my opinion) superior skill point distribution levelling system, allowing for a bit more hands-on customization of your character's progression. Unfortunately, your options for race/class combinations are a bit limited compared to previous games. There are four races to choose from, and each race has its own warrior/scout/magic classes that are not available between races. In other words, you choose the PC's race, and then each race has three class options. Want a dwarven tank based fighter? Great, they have that. Want a dwarf who specializes two handed damage dealing? No option for that, sorry. There are still plenty of very good options to choose from, and each class feels useful in its own right. In a game that can be difficult if you don't have the right combination of classes, I'm guessing this is a way to more clearly define the player's options, but I admit I miss the extra bit of customization that the previous games allowed.Speaking of character customization, it's one place I feel the game dropped the ball. For each race, there are 4 portraits, two male and two female, to choose from. Decide your fighter should be an orc female? Your portrait options are A or B, regardless of class. Same with voices. Each race has a male heroic or cynical and a female heroic or cynical option, which sound to me like they're voiced by the same person, but saying different things. While it's a somewhat minor complaint, it makes it harder to feel like some of the characters are mine with the limited options. Still, for the caveats and minor gripes I have, I can't forget to emphasize that the game is fun. It's a classic system in a more modern wrapper, but it's a classic system that I did, and still do, love. The dungeons are fun, the monsters are well done, bosses are appropriately tougher than the fodder you cut through to get to them, and while the world feels a little small compared to some of the old Might and Magic games, it's been an engaging and entertaining ride so far. If you really didn't like the grid based system and smaller fights of the earlier entries in the series, this might not be the game for you. However, if you do enjoy those older entries of the series, then you'll likely find Might and Magic X an enjoyable experience.			"

												A Welcome Return To Old School RPG GamingFor the tl;dr crowd:Pros:* Really truly does recapture the feeling of old school Might & Magic games, particularly the World of Xeen games (which was what this was patterned after)* Tough but fair* Strategic combatCons:* Optimization issues* Requires UPlay (It's Ubisoft, no way around UPlay, unfortunately)Now for the long winded review:When I first heard about this game I was first of all shocked, as it had been so long since a core Might & Magic game had been released (I bet there is a contingent of people that prior to the release of this game though Heroes of Might & Magic was the core series, rather than the spinoff it is) that I just assumed the series was dead and buried.  I was both excited and a bit scared.  Excited because holy smokes a new core Might & Magic game!  Scared because it was being made by a developer I didn't really know and that had, to the best of my knowledge, no prior experience making an old school RPG like this.  Would they be able to recapture the Might & Magic feeling?  Would they get the mechanics right?  Would they try to modernize it too much?After reading up on the team and following their blog for a bit, it became apparent that these people were a fan of the games and genuinely passionate about making an old school RPG.  They also revealed that they were patterning this game after World of Xeen (M&M 4 & 5), going with turn-based and grid-based, rather than free movement and real-time, like M&M 6-9.  While I enjoyed M&M 6-8 quite a bit, 9 not so much, I was also a huge fan of the World of Xeen games and was happy with this decision, so I decided to pull the trigger and get this.I can now happily say that I chose wisely.  This game has exceeded my expectations.  While the game isn't exactly pushing graphical boundaries and there are some jarringly low res models and textures mixed in, the game is plenty pretty enough for my tastes and it has a certain charm to it.  I suspect Ubisoft didn't exactly give Limbic a massive budget to work with, so I wasn't expecting The Witcher 2 levels of eye candy.  Much more importantly, this is an honest to goodness old school Might & Magic game.  The setting and story follow the Heroes of Might & Magic games timeline rather than M&M 9, but mechanically they really did a great job of recreating the World of Xeen gameplay.There are 12 classes among 4 races to choose from (3 per race) filling the roles of fighters, casters, and various hybrids in between.  The game doesn't hold your hand and you learn on the job, which may be a turn off for some gamers, but is very welcome in my book.  Certain class combinations will work better than other, and it's certainly possible to build a party that's going to get stomped in the game, but there is room for a variety of different viable combination.  Balanced parties (a mix of warrior and mage types) will naturally work the best, as they usually do in RPGs, but it's possible to go mage-heavy (though you will burn through a lot of mana potions) or warrior-heavy and still succeed.The game is quite challenging, but not cheap.  There are 2 difficulty settings:  Adventurer and Warrior, corresponding to Normal and Hard respectively, though, compared to the average game of these days, they're more like Hard and Very Hard.  This game will kick your behind and you will die.  There is no sleepwalking through fights except for the most basic of weak enemies.  If you try to sleepwalk on simply brute force your way (even with a warrior-heavy party) through battles you will get destroyed.  You have to use your head to survive.  The game constantly puts you into confrontations where you are surviving by your wits and the skin of your teeth, and that's on Adventurer difficulty.  Warrior difficulty is straight up punishing, and I love it!There is a good bit of strategy in using your various spells and abilities to protect yourself, buff your allies, debuff enemies, debilitate them, and deal damage.  Plus the grid-based movement adds another layer of tactics, making for a chess-like game of maneuvering where you try to lure ranged enemies into melee without getting pelted by arrows and spells while advancing on them, or getting as many ""free"" volleys of arrows on melee enemies before they close to melee, all while being mindful of the terrain to position yourself in a spot to prevent being flanked or surrounded.  It's a well thought out system that forces you to use all the skills at your disposal.  It can seem overwhelming when you're caught off guard and a group of enemies creeps up behind you while other enemies close in from the front and you're caught in a vice in a seemingly hopeless battle, frantically trying to keep your party members alive while trying to take out key enemies before they can demolish you.  But when you survive a battle like that, it's that much more satisfying, so much better than mindlessly steamrolling through trash mobs like in so many RPGs.  In conclusion, Might & Magic is a throwback to the RPGs of the 80s and the 90s, with much of the good and the bad that comes with that.  It's a wonderful nostalgia ride and Limbic did a terrific job of delivering an authentic old school RPG experience.  It's thoroughly challenging and quite satisfying.  If you're looking for an old-school turn-based RPG romp, look no further.			"

												This game has some potential, but the irritating design choices overwhelm that potential in my mind.First off, ""open world"" this game is not.  You have exactly one direction you can go through the first town, you can't even leave town without finishing a railroad quest, unless I missed something.  And even after leaving your world is made up of ""you can go to X different dungeons, but X-1 of them will kill you instantly"" so you really just have the illusion of choice.  Maybe it opens up past the first region, but if you have to get that far in to a game for it to be open world, it isn't.This railroading leads to the biggest issue I have compared to the old games, party composition.  I'm sure some dedicated players will be able to prove me wrong but I honestly don't feel like most party combinations will be viable in this game because of the mission you have to do before leaving town.  In the old games you could run a full ranged party and soften things up enough before they get to you if you were willing to accept that sometimes you don't soften them up enough and you get stomped.  This game doesn't seem to make that an option since there is no way to skip the first dungeon and it railroads you in to melees without the chance for an opening volley.  And that's not even considering the spells you have to run if you want to be able to explore everything.  Don't have a good coverage of the spell schools?  Prepare to miss a lot or use a guide.Even with these issues aside the mechanics just don't feel like they're there.  Outside of your weapons skills skill increases just don't seem to do much. For instance, armor skills reduce your penalty to wear armor, so if you've already negated the penalty it's just a waste of a point to put them there until you find the trainer or better armor. Unlike the old games you can't increase skills past a certain point without finding a trainer, so you end up maxing out your barbarian's mace and two-hander skills and then just throwing points into other things at random, or saving them until you can find the trainers, making your progression slam in to a wall.  Battles are just slug fests with both sides having what feels like high chances to block or dodge, which makes poison especially irritating since there's no, apparent, way to resist it and you can go three turns without anybody hitting someone if you're unlucky.  Any sort of incapacitation keeps that character from gaining XP, yes, even stun, so you find yourself stalling a battle so your tank will wake up and gain XP from the kill, only for the mage to get stunned and you to have to wait again.Overall there are just too many little issues that build up to make this game not fun, and there are too many games out there to waste time on one that's frustrating and not fun.  I feel bad for Limbic but hopefully this game got enough attention that Ubisoft will get someone that knows what they're doing, and has at least played a Might and Magic game before, for another attempt, because this could have been good.

												What can you say!!! I loved Might & Magic v1 The Mandate of Heaven it was a real challenge to play, the battles were tough and  you always had great feeling when you fought the battle's and won .... Might & Magic X-Legacy is extreamly frustrating to get used with the controls at the begining but something clicks as you peservere and you get used to the controls and it becomes a really good challenging game, I love the modern graphics which really improve the experience of the game it brings Might & Magic to life ..... Such an improvement I'm really loving playing this game, Its downside is the slightly long loading screens but you can get used to this, and where is the don't touch the mercendise! gone, or when you leave the chapel Bless you!  Me I miss that from Might & Magic v1, but other than that its really only the awkward get used to the controls bit!.... I recomend this to anyone who played the early M&M games,  this has a great retro feel and  the modern graphics are absolutely brilliant...... As said  a lot would be put off by the awkward controls at the start but if you stick with it! its an extreamly  good & challenging game to play!.......			"

												I don't write reviews, ever.  But being long-time M&M/Wizardry fan, I felt I needed to dispel some of the myths about this game.  I'm playing the game on a macbook 2011, with no problems running in 32-bit mode.  Gorgeous game, great interface, challenging battles, great puzzles, and funny references.  I've put some time in this game, and I'm on my first playthrough.  I have ignored butt-aches to play for another thirty minutes.  I am definitely playing this again once I complete it.  First let me say that reviewers that say you should min/max your skills, or you have to play a certain race/class combination are so so wrong.  I get a chuckle out of thinking of players not using rangers.  Now that I'm in the later stages of the game, monsters should feel privelaged to be able to survive long enough to get into melee range.  I love the turn-based combat and strategy.  Everything about this game makes sense.  If you liked the good ole days of Xeen, you will love this adventure.  Get it. "

												Yo, if you like old school RPGs in the veins of say the Might and Magic series or Lands of Lore you need to get this. It runs on a grid so it's less fluid than Escape from Grimrock (another game that harkens back to the time of old school RPGS), but that gives it an even greater retro charm, hell it even has an option for fuzzy retro graphics. It pays greatest homage to Might and Magic 1-4, it still does give refrences to six and seven (seven being my absolute favorite of the series). It even gives the synopsis of the plots for each previous game in in-game lore books while maintaining the new lore and world.Though character creation is limited to four races with three classes for each race, it's still not as bad as Might Magic XIII's character creation (IDK about you guys but that game had the worst race/class choices in the series). Combat can be a bit buggy at times, the latest patch seems to have fixed a lot of the release issues, so I can now give this game my full approval.			"

												OLD SCHOOL THROWDOWN. I really like this game. About estimated 70% through the game, the world map is a bit difficult to navigate, i found. It's not really open world, as you have to go to loadscreen upon reaching any location/town/cave. Still, a great game with impossible fights, if you step into the wrong area at the wrong time. 8/10			"

												It is unfortunate that when you purchase this game both steam and ubisoft fail to mention that you must sign up for a third party programn to run the game.  Unfortunatly only one of the cd keys worked in my case so i only have access to part of what I payed for.  The sign up process can be frustrating as well since you will have to translate on of those hard to see scribbles to prove your human, mess up to many times and they will ban you for an hour before you can try again to get your information to work correctly.Game might otherwise work fine if you can get through the red tape and do not mind signing a bunch of waivers allowing ubisoft to see information on your computer.

												short summary / Kurzzusammenfassung: game concept is quite nice, but too many bugs + flaws. / Spielkonzept ist ganz nett (habe auch einige andere M&M-Teile gespielt, es gibt aber zu viele Bugs und sonstige Mängellong versionafter playing several other rpg-style games from the M&M, the dark eye, D&D, gothic and alike series i was looking forward to play another nice game. After a quite nice start ( just a bit annoying expert/master/grandmaster-skillsystem ) the waiting on loads more and more angered me (takes 20s-1min per load). later on you will find out that it really sucks to come to an area which might be relevant for quests without picking those quests before. On some game-important occasions like promotion missions you will end up with an open quest unable to complete it, if you've been to the quest-relevant area before. other bugs will add up, you will have problems to become grandmaster on some skills before it stops to matter if you are, and so on and on. Some things can be fixed when using boards to understand the game scripts, but honestly: this shouldnt be a player's deal at all. Especially annoying are the relics. Of about 30 relics in the game about 2-5 might be of good use for your team, the rest is weaker than equipment that you can buy (granted you have the time to rest and reload often enough to reset shops), or you simply cannot use it with the party you chose. on late stages (about level 25-30), depending on your chosen skills and equipment, you either wont have any mentionable enemies (i killed the last boss of the main quest with 3 hits once), or you'll have quite some problems to win it. For example: there is equipment adding +6 of a certain skill. depending on the skill you can achieve 25 (grandmaster) + 48 (2x6 foki, 3x6 jewelry, and 3x6 other equipment) for magic skills, which is damn much OP. you also could try to become invulnurable, wich is no hard task with some of the characters (about 100 defense, about 100 resistences). but besides all that, at the end of the game you'll have to flee from a prison, having no equipment at start, being able to do lots of mistakes while fleeing. combined with the waiting time for reload, that was too much of frustration for me. even though i played that game quite some time, i cannot recommend it.

After playing for a while the game freezes and the only way you can play again is by starting the game completely over...

												I really love this game.  I am having a lot of fun playing this.  I love the old school feel and the updated graphics.  Also as a fan of everything Might and Magic, I have to say seeing the same creatures and story arcs from Heroes of Might and Magic VI in there is nice and emersive.  I really have to say that I am surprised at the difficulty of the game, which I like as it reminds me unlike skyrim, you just cant go anywhere you want and kill anything you want.  You have to level your party and try to stay out of tough areas, until you are able to handle them. Also, I love the map feature, if you find something on the map, make a note of it.  I have all of the trainers on my map, don't forget to make a note when you see a trainer.  They are then visible on the world map as well!!			"

												M&M X: Legacy - for those of us who have been playing games BEFORE Steam, and before the internet was the monster it has become, there were games played on boards, and before that, paper. Once computers entered the gaming world a few people wrote games in text only format to entertain the infant market. I even wrote a Star Trek game on the Commodore 64 that was stored on a floppy disk! M&M X is a new game which captures a little of the older, but not as old as that old C64 game I wrote. And thank heaven for that! Greatly improved graphics over past iterations of the M&M world, smoother play, old style movement and enough creatures, bad guys, and other diversions to keep the most stout-hearted adventurer in the game for many hours. This game uses an older type of interface that the younger generation might find ""clunky"" but this is only because they have no basis for comparison. Humor is always required in an adventure game as are challenges which increase in difficulty level as progress is made make gaming as time consuming blast! The first dragon encountered is very much a challenge worthy of the best warrior party - for this dragon is beautiful but deadly. Cyclops are always a challenge and M&M X gets it right by inserting a cave with a cyclops standing inside the entrance and it carries a club. Your party is in grave danger and there is no leaving the cave until the danger is past...er...dead. Get a horse early and let it carry the extra armor and weapons you collect along the way, leaving your arms free to hold a sword and shiled. Keep gold in your pockets though, horses can't be trusted!Easy to play, addictive style that will captivate the most jaded players due to the strangely adaptive A.I., and graphics that are old-school and yet pleasing to the eye -- Might & Magic X: Legacy is a great game! Oh, yeah, and it comes with M&M VI, a definite blast-from-the-past title that will keep you journeying and adventuring for hours on end.			"

												GREAT GAME.It's got the ""soul"" of the past Might and Magic games; lots of exploration, loot, character upgrades.  I had a great time.  It uses a lot of the same animation as the Heroes series, but the enemies are a little different in difficulty, to scale with the quests.The good: It's great fun if you loved the old M&M games or are new to the tile-based RPGs (Legend of Grimrock).  It will draw you in and you'll think about playing it and the next thing to do when away from it.The bad: It's Ubisoft, so it uses Uplay.The ugly: It didn't sell well enough early on so UBI is not planning a sequel.Update. Do NOT buy the DLC (Deluxe Version) ""The Falcon and the Unicorn"" if you have the chance. It's broken. It was clearly cobbled together and was not play tested before release.			"

												I purchased this game right after it becam available on early access.  It has been the buggiest game I have ever played (keeping in mind my first computer was a C64).  I waited for months for the bugs to smooth out but eventually gave up just before release.  This game also singlehandedly made me vowe to never take a chance on early access again.  To top things off you can expect double DRM (uplay)  This game is broke big time and the developers have abandoned it.			"

												On the down side, you don't get 3d action and controls in this game. It plays very much like the old 3d tile based RPG's that it's based on, with a few improved features. On the up side, I think this game has a really nice visual feel. It also uses simple text to give a sense of lore and story. As a huge fan of RPG's, I recommend trying this one out, and supporting its early access development.			"

												HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 10/10 (50 hours in so far)If you like Legend of Grimrock, Dungeon Master, Wizardry 8, Eye of the Beholder or Shining in the Darkness, etc.God help me, I am so addicted to this game right now.+Vast open world to explore with teleporters (Obelisks) to quickly reach anywhere you have been previously.+Battle system is turn-based and grid-based+Story is pretty good+Large varierty of classes, races, skills, and schools of magic+2 difficulty levels. I'm playing on adventurer and it's a good balance of difficulty.+The music is excellent!!-Has a couple annoying bugs. Music seems to randomly cut out and I have to reload-Battle log text box seems to be buggy sometimes, same with stat comparisons on weapons-Some backtracking requiredMore detailed review to come after I complete the game.

												Were you OK with Wizardry 8? That was one half-finished game, even more so than M&MX. That didn't stop it from being very good, though.Play M&MX if:1) You want an open-world, turn-based and grid-based dungeon crawler. 2) You are fine with thinking about class and party builds ahead of playing the game. M&MX on warrior difficulty is hard, some would say even brutal - even a very strong, metagamey party will get consistently challenged. You can't max out every skill (at most you'll max 3 skills out of 10+ available for each class) so you have to pick and choose carefully as well as making sure that your classes work well together. 3) You can appreciate the fact that it's actually very open. Recently we've been fed fake open-world games like Divinity OS and Xulima where you're actually meant to do things in a very specific order. M&MX handles this aspect very well so that going into a hard area, barely managing it through encounters and coming back some epic loot feels nice and rewarding.Don't play it if:1) You want a casual game.2) You want a faithful clone of Xeen or another M&M6. This is different - though it does borrow a lot of things from the older M&M's, at least style-wise.2) You hate turn-based, grid-based gameplay.3) Can't handle bugs, glitches and lack of polish.Have fun!

												This is a perfect throwback to the old Might and Magic (not heroes) games. Might and Magic X has been built from the ground up to have fantastic lore and engaging quests. It is extremely fun to play and challenges the gamer to build an efficient party of travelers with enough diversity to handle the different challenges of the game.The gameplay and lore are top notch. The game renders somewhat slowly when transitioning from area to area and there's a small level of polishing that has been missed, but the core of the game is great.			"

												So, I completely understand that my positive reaction to this game is incredibly personal, and, while I'm in no way blind to the obvious flaws in the game's design or execution, I still personally consider it my Game of the Year, 2014. I've been a fan of the Might & Magic franchise, both the RPG's and the strategy games, from childhood. When 3DO went bankrupt and dragged New World Computing down with them, I was saddened, and initially excited when Ubisoft bought the license and started working on it again. Then they released their games, and, apart from the Clash of Heroes spinoff, which became one of my favourite games ever partly due to its tongue in cheek nature, I've been sorely unimpressed by them, especially by Ubisoft's behaviour as a publisher.But then this game happened, and it is such a genuine piece of work that I couldn't help but love it despite the obvious flaws. I could go on for a feature length article about why this game is so personally important to me, but I'll limit myself to the technical aspects: this game has a great story and a great atmosphere, and it plays like a modern version of those old school, grid based, first person RPGs like Lands of Lore or, well, Might & Magic 1 through 5. Of course, this cuts both ways, in that Might & Magic X carries over some of the flaws of those old games we moved past, most noteably incosiderately placing two mobs of wildly different power levels within close proximity to each other, combined with an inability to actually escape from a fight once it's engaged. Also, like others have mentioned, it's not optimally balanced, and it's got the occasional, sometimes crippling glitch.Then again, a lot of old school RPG's weren't balanced, and had their bugs that made things annoying, and while we certainly should have moved passed this in the two decades, if you're already used to dealing with them, Legacy isn't egregious about it. And, for a Ubisoft game, the bugs and glitches are remarkably inoffensive.Like I said, great story, great atmosphere, and, you know what, some very solid puzzles that you don't see much of in modern RPGs. Like, legit puzzles, riddles, gimmick dungeon levels that are mostly intuitive, not easy enough to be insulting, or so obtuse to be frustrating. Also, if you're, like me, a huge fan of the original Might & Magic franchise, there's this moment at the end of one of these game spanning quests that made me giddy.So, yeah, recognizing that this is a flawed game, it's still incredibly important to me, and I still highly recommend it to traditional RPG lovers.

												Might & Magic X is an okay turn-based, retro crpg that do have some interesting ideas, but poorly executed. You play as a group of adventurers whose task is to deliver the ashes of their master in the Agyn peninsula, only to be greeted with brigands and monsters and political intrigue that plot to shatter the Empire from afar.The game start with a character creation that lets either pick pre-determined adventurers, make up your own or let everything choosed randomly. You will find 4 generic playable races being Humans, Elfs, Dwarves and Orcs, each race featuring 3 unique classes each, even though each one can be summed up as Warrior, Ranger and Mage.Each class have its own set of special abilities, along with a late game 'promotion' that will let you unlock Grand-master skills and new traits, although it's kind of blurry which one seems to be the most effective in what situations. Some classes are very late game based where others are early game efficient, so i recommend check a wiki before throwing yourself blindly into the game, especially if you want to play in Hard.Character progression will grant you attribute points and skill points to allocate in different capacity. You can raise the level of your skills up to a certain stage where you will need to find a trainer to unlock the next matery step, while granting you with additionnal traits. Each classes can only unlock certain skills up to a certain level of mastery, but every classes feature almost the same skills. Although, playing in hard, i started by allocating points in Vitality, especially for my 'tanks' so that they soak up more damage, until i realise that it was more a waste than anything since the Skill trait ""endurance"" end up giving a stronger health pool than what you can get from the few points the attribute will grant. So i'd recommend spending most of your points in dps or critical, eventually Spirit so that your caster can keep up firing spells.It is a fairly simple system, though one of the major complaint i'd have is that one of the skill tree that will give your melee caracter more combat skills will only grant you with more Mana, where you actually need them to control and add more strategy to your actions in combat. The main weapons traits will let you carry better weapon indeed, but never give you any actual skill to use in battle so, you end up wanting more dps rather than more mana for skills you don't have anyway.The ""seek a trainer"" system is also pretty sweet on paper, but they happen to be a bit randomly scattered through out the game, and so you'll find out that a lot of 'expert' trainers for early game skills you'd be tempted to spend points in will be located in later game zones you can hardly reach with a lower level. So you find youserlf specialising in skills you will be able to actually train rather than taking the ones that feels interesting for your build but can't make anything out of it because you can't properly train them.A good thing though is that the peninsula is somewhat open world with dungeon scattered around so, you rarely feel claustrophobic about your environment, compared to other dungeon crawler. You will find yourself exploring the world with care, trying to find every small cave or dungeon, hidden secrets and chests, which is probably the best part of the game. Most of the zones will be level capped so you'll know when you enter somewhere you don't have the level required for, mainly because most of the mobs will destroy you. But if you are determined and have a good team composition you can sometimes wander always a little further, which feels really rewarding to overcome enemies that gave you a beating a few hours ago. Although... you don't have that much to do in the exploration in the end. The peninsula feels really small after a few hours in, even if populated with a lot of little things and npcs all around, it always feels like once you've killed everything and clicked everywhere the zone become empty, with rarely any reason for you to come back. Unfortunatly, the game features a lot of backtracking, and an old chool fast travel system that, even if i liked it, can be a bit dull to use just to bring an early game npc a quest item you found in the other side of the map.Also, you can't interract with much of the walls or what is around you by yourself, so there would be no hidden switchs or moving objects around. It is fairly restrictive for most of the secrets will be overly obvious, highlighted 3D details you can only interract pressing [spacebar]. So in a way, it is very contextual.You'll speak to npcs and use different items like chest or barrel that will let you raise certain stats the same way, which is a shame because the game do present you with a lot of puzzle that are sometimes clever, but never escape the ""mash everything and press every floor switch until you find a solution"" problem.Combats are turn based, you have to take an action, either walking or attacking with your whole groupe, before the enemy move and so on. Each group will only be able to attack adjacent to their position so you will have to use the landscape and diagonales to prevent from being flanked by too many monsters at once. It's also important to know that once you're engaged with a group, aka next to their square, you can't move anymore or leave the battle. Enemies will also follow you to death once you aggro them so, once a combat start there is no turning back. Which can become really frustrating at time, especially since the devs use a lot of that fact to put you in really hard, unfair embushes you can't really prevent.The level design and placement of a lot of monster group will also be in favor of the monsters themselve rather than the player. Rarely you will have the line of sight to hit and lure monsters from afar, which makes ranged based classes or character build less powerfull than the regular melee ones. The only reason you'd max out a ""perception"" based character would be to detect traps and secret or eventually aggro at long distance just so you can lure enemy into a corridor, which is a shame.So is the game any good ? Well...I've never played a Might and magic before so i'm kind of unaware of its lore or what the former games were. The only one i almost got into was the 6th, but when i discovered it, Morrowind was released and so i was put off by the graphics. I approached that game thinking why not try the latest one so maybe i can get into the others, but the least i can say is that the game deliver its lore in a very unwelcome fashion for a newcomer. Most of the things that is narrated refer to a lot of details out of the peninsula, giving a sense of never really concerning you in any way except for the ancient war and a few other, quest related notes scattered here and there. Same goes for the npc that will usually tells you about themselves or about the empire but, never in an engaging way. So naturally, i left the background behind, only to realise that certain quests and puzzle needed you to answer things related to the informations you'll learn everywhere.Also, it may be because i have a Radeon but during my playthrough, i encountered a hell lot of visual glitches too like, background elements clipping and disapearing, reapiring when you face them. Some mobs were stuck in their animation making the game broken.But somehow, i liked the game. I liked the exploration and that feeling of completion you get from going back to early levels and finding solutions to encounter you couldn't beat. It's just really sad that the game feels like Ubisoft taking the oportunity and success of indy games like Grimmrock to grab some cash with a really low budget game. Because it feels rushed in many aspect.In the end, i'd recommend that game if you ran out of retro crpg or if you love Might and Magic. But if you're new to the genre i'd recommend to look for something else.			"

												This game is mechanically a relatively modernized version of the Might & Magic series, circa 4-5 (aka World of Xeen). It also includes the sometimes tongue-in-cheek humor, modern culture references and the hidden sci-fi elements from the games of that era. The music is pretty good when there's music other than ambient sounds, but regarding sound effects, the characters keep repeating the same lines throughout the game, which can be annoying. I had a lot of fun with it, even though the game is far from perfect.			"

												This game is fun, and fairly true to the traditional Might & Magic games, but it's very... linear and scripted, whereas Might and Magic was not.   There are a set number of monsters, and when they are dead, they are dead.  This can make it hard to progress since you cannot get more gold or experience.Still, it's probably the best Might and Magic product since Might & Magic VII.

												7.5/10. As a MM fan having played all MM games, this game actually succeeds in capturing the MM charme and spirit! It is nice to level up, train with trainers, and get to Expert, Master and GM status. The game is well balanced, quite difficult at the beginning, so that you will need to come back later for some bosses, and even in late game, remains challenging. The size of the game is nice, also that there are some riddles and puzzles in the dungeons.Negative: Graphics outdated, bad decisions in the beginning (many experts, Masters are not accessible until later acts, as they are located in cities you cant access!), a lot of walking around due to lack of decent teleport system; weak presentation of the ""story"". Last, UPLAY does not work properly if game is bought through Steam... you need to contact Support to be able to get UPlay points and unlock Rewards (worked with al other UPlay gmaes I have).All in all, a nice and addicting RPG similar to older MM titles, which could have been grand with a higher budget and a better engine, but delivers on what it tries to be. Too bad it was no success, and likely there will be no future games like this.			"

												Ahhh, that was a really enjoyable game. I played its older 'sister' and was happy to see the same spirit with immensely better graphics. All the cool stuff from the previous game remains and more interesting elements were added (fun secrets, riddles to stir your brain, etc.) The only minus I found was that some quests can't be finished because they are class-specific, but hey, that makes replayability potential higher :-) Although the plot is straighforward you can just go on exploring the world. I will definitely play it again in the near future and I await further DLC because one (with a bit hard level of difficulty) is just not enough. Uplay as usual is a definite minus for Ubisoft.			"

												This game is quite a mixed bag,the positives: its bighas many different enemiesgood looking dungeonschallenging fights (some could be called unfair)-----the bad:- you can gimp your party badly if you dont have proper magic users (I recommend having a heal druid and a fire runepriest, they should be able to carry the whole party thru the game)- the whole secret walls thing is very simplistic and all or nothing (dark magic, follower, quest reward are the only way to find em)- only the relic items are interesting and with the exception of items giving you immunities to various crippling effects, the rest of the equipment simply cant compete with immunitiesoverall I can recommend it to players that played similar games 20-25 years ago			"

												While most of the game was fun and interactive it had its downsides. For me free roam is a huge plus in a game which this game has. but the still restrict your movements by placing you on a grid. This is more challenging because it forces you into more fights which i love, but even then on the hardest difficulty this game is easy once you make it past the first act, the thing that i dont like is that i cant explore as much as id like to. the worst part of this game are the puzzles within the game. more than half of them dont make sense and i completed them with little more than luck and the last puzzle within the game is the worst of them all. it requires a certain knowledge that most people dont posses so good luck trying to figure it out on your own.

												For what it is this is an amazing nod to the genre... that being said I miss some of the elements of 6, 7 and 8 unfortunately was never able to beat 9. I would love to see the developers return to the old style and re-release the orginals so i can buy them and play them once more Awesome Game! Must play if you enjoy any of the might and magics!			"

												Great game but not as long winded (deep) as some of the previous M&M games.  Regardless... you can mod it or change things as you like... overall it is a nice game and challenging old school first person dungeon romping...			"

												I almost skipped this because it required uPlay to play. However, I picked it up on a Steam Sale, because I just couldn't pass up a first person party-based dungeon crawler. This game hearkens back to the old days of Eye of the Beholder, Wizardry, etc. Nicely done, and a lot of exploration to do. I'd like to see a sequal with upgraded graphics. The main failings of the game is requiring uPLay DRM on top of Steam DRM, and the game's graphics engine taxes the heck out of your videocard, despite rather plain graphics. I actually had to adjust my settings because my GTX 570 was almost overheating.			"

												Such a fun game. If you like the old might & magic games, you'll love this one. It is buggy and I couldn't play it with the highest graphics because some effects will crash the game. I set all to medium or low and I enjoyed the game nontheless.Some cool riddles, cool but simple puzzles. great intense battles, cool unique items that level up. Really loved this game.I think that, if they step away from Unity and get an engine that doesn't make your life a living hell, and do more of  the cool things they made for this game, M&M XI should be a return to the old days when M&M was the best turn-based rpg out there.Would recommend? To a M&M fan sure, buy it now! To a regular rpg gamer, I'd say buy it on sale or look for something else.			"

												So, I completely understand that my positive reaction to this game is incredibly personal, and, while I'm in no way blind to the obvious flaws in the game's design or execution, I still personally consider it my Game of the Year, 2014. I've been a fan of the Might & Magic franchise, both the RPG's and the strategy games, from childhood. When 3DO went bankrupt and dragged New World Computing down with them, I was saddened, and initially excited when Ubisoft bought the license and started working on it again. Then they released their games, and, apart from the Clash of Heroes spinoff, which became one of my favourite games ever partly due to its tongue in cheek nature, I've been sorely unimpressed by them, especially by Ubisoft's behaviour as a publisher.But then this game happened, and it is such a genuine piece of work that I couldn't help but love it despite the obvious flaws. I could go on for a feature length article about why this game is so personally important to me, but I'll limit myself to the technical aspects: this game has a great story and a great atmosphere, and it plays like a modern version of those old school, grid based, first person RPGs like Lands of Lore or, well, Might & Magic 1 through 5. Of course, this cuts both ways, in that Might & Magic X carries over some of the flaws of those old games we moved past, most noteably incosiderately placing two mobs of wildly different power levels within close proximity to each other, combined with an inability to actually escape from a fight once it's engaged. Also, like others have mentioned, it's not optimally balanced, and it's got the occasional, sometimes crippling glitch.Then again, a lot of old school RPG's weren't balanced, and had their bugs that made things annoying, and while we certainly should have moved passed this in the two decades, if you're already used to dealing with them, Legacy isn't egregious about it. And, for a Ubisoft game, the bugs and glitches are remarkably inoffensive.Like I said, great story, great atmosphere, and, you know what, some very solid puzzles that you don't see much of in modern RPGs. Like, legit puzzles, riddles, gimmick dungeon levels that are mostly intuitive, not easy enough to be insulting, or so obtuse to be frustrating. Also, if you're, like me, a huge fan of the original Might & Magic franchise, there's this moment at the end of one of these game spanning quests that made me giddy.So, yeah, recognizing that this is a flawed game, it's still incredibly important to me, and I still highly recommend it to traditional RPG lovers.

												Might & Magic X is an okay turn-based, retro crpg that do have some interesting ideas, but poorly executed. You play as a group of adventurers whose task is to deliver the ashes of their master in the Agyn peninsula, only to be greeted with brigands and monsters and political intrigue that plot to shatter the Empire from afar.The game start with a character creation that lets either pick pre-determined adventurers, make up your own or let everything choosed randomly. You will find 4 generic playable races being Humans, Elfs, Dwarves and Orcs, each race featuring 3 unique classes each, even though each one can be summed up as Warrior, Ranger and Mage.Each class have its own set of special abilities, along with a late game 'promotion' that will let you unlock Grand-master skills and new traits, although it's kind of blurry which one seems to be the most effective in what situations. Some classes are very late game based where others are early game efficient, so i recommend check a wiki before throwing yourself blindly into the game, especially if you want to play in Hard.Character progression will grant you attribute points and skill points to allocate in different capacity. You can raise the level of your skills up to a certain stage where you will need to find a trainer to unlock the next matery step, while granting you with additionnal traits. Each classes can only unlock certain skills up to a certain level of mastery, but every classes feature almost the same skills. Although, playing in hard, i started by allocating points in Vitality, especially for my 'tanks' so that they soak up more damage, until i realise that it was more a waste than anything since the Skill trait ""endurance"" end up giving a stronger health pool than what you can get from the few points the attribute will grant. So i'd recommend spending most of your points in dps or critical, eventually Spirit so that your caster can keep up firing spells.It is a fairly simple system, though one of the major complaint i'd have is that one of the skill tree that will give your melee caracter more combat skills will only grant you with more Mana, where you actually need them to control and add more strategy to your actions in combat. The main weapons traits will let you carry better weapon indeed, but never give you any actual skill to use in battle so, you end up wanting more dps rather than more mana for skills you don't have anyway.The ""seek a trainer"" system is also pretty sweet on paper, but they happen to be a bit randomly scattered through out the game, and so you'll find out that a lot of 'expert' trainers for early game skills you'd be tempted to spend points in will be located in later game zones you can hardly reach with a lower level. So you find youserlf specialising in skills you will be able to actually train rather than taking the ones that feels interesting for your build but can't make anything out of it because you can't properly train them.A good thing though is that the peninsula is somewhat open world with dungeon scattered around so, you rarely feel claustrophobic about your environment, compared to other dungeon crawler. You will find yourself exploring the world with care, trying to find every small cave or dungeon, hidden secrets and chests, which is probably the best part of the game. Most of the zones will be level capped so you'll know when you enter somewhere you don't have the level required for, mainly because most of the mobs will destroy you. But if you are determined and have a good team composition you can sometimes wander always a little further, which feels really rewarding to overcome enemies that gave you a beating a few hours ago. Although... you don't have that much to do in the exploration in the end. The peninsula feels really small after a few hours in, even if populated with a lot of little things and npcs all around, it always feels like once you've killed everything and clicked everywhere the zone become empty, with rarely any reason for you to come back. Unfortunatly, the game features a lot of backtracking, and an old chool fast travel system that, even if i liked it, can be a bit dull to use just to bring an early game npc a quest item you found in the other side of the map.Also, you can't interract with much of the walls or what is around you by yourself, so there would be no hidden switchs or moving objects around. It is fairly restrictive for most of the secrets will be overly obvious, highlighted 3D details you can only interract pressing [spacebar]. So in a way, it is very contextual.You'll speak to npcs and use different items like chest or barrel that will let you raise certain stats the same way, which is a shame because the game do present you with a lot of puzzle that are sometimes clever, but never escape the ""mash everything and press every floor switch until you find a solution"" problem.Combats are turn based, you have to take an action, either walking or attacking with your whole groupe, before the enemy move and so on. Each group will only be able to attack adjacent to their position so you will have to use the landscape and diagonales to prevent from being flanked by too many monsters at once. It's also important to know that once you're engaged with a group, aka next to their square, you can't move anymore or leave the battle. Enemies will also follow you to death once you aggro them so, once a combat start there is no turning back. Which can become really frustrating at time, especially since the devs use a lot of that fact to put you in really hard, unfair embushes you can't really prevent.The level design and placement of a lot of monster group will also be in favor of the monsters themselve rather than the player. Rarely you will have the line of sight to hit and lure monsters from afar, which makes ranged based classes or character build less powerfull than the regular melee ones. The only reason you'd max out a ""perception"" based character would be to detect traps and secret or eventually aggro at long distance just so you can lure enemy into a corridor, which is a shame.So is the game any good ? Well...I've never played a Might and magic before so i'm kind of unaware of its lore or what the former games were. The only one i almost got into was the 6th, but when i discovered it, Morrowind was released and so i was put off by the graphics. I approached that game thinking why not try the latest one so maybe i can get into the others, but the least i can say is that the game deliver its lore in a very unwelcome fashion for a newcomer. Most of the things that is narrated refer to a lot of details out of the peninsula, giving a sense of never really concerning you in any way except for the ancient war and a few other, quest related notes scattered here and there. Same goes for the npc that will usually tells you about themselves or about the empire but, never in an engaging way. So naturally, i left the background behind, only to realise that certain quests and puzzle needed you to answer things related to the informations you'll learn everywhere.Also, it may be because i have a Radeon but during my playthrough, i encountered a hell lot of visual glitches too like, background elements clipping and disapearing, reapiring when you face them. Some mobs were stuck in their animation making the game broken.But somehow, i liked the game. I liked the exploration and that feeling of completion you get from going back to early levels and finding solutions to encounter you couldn't beat. It's just really sad that the game feels like Ubisoft taking the oportunity and success of indy games like Grimmrock to grab some cash with a really low budget game. Because it feels rushed in many aspect.In the end, i'd recommend that game if you ran out of retro crpg or if you love Might and Magic. But if you're new to the genre i'd recommend to look for something else.			"

												This game is mechanically a relatively modernized version of the Might & Magic series, circa 4-5 (aka World of Xeen). It also includes the sometimes tongue-in-cheek humor, modern culture references and the hidden sci-fi elements from the games of that era. The music is pretty good when there's music other than ambient sounds, but regarding sound effects, the characters keep repeating the same lines throughout the game, which can be annoying. I had a lot of fun with it, even though the game is far from perfect.			"

												Best RPG I've played in years, and has quickly become my single favorite game. After playing this I just HAD to play the rest of the M&M series, and I played from 3 to 9 and loved every second of it. This is how RPGs are supposed to be!Pros: - awesomely fun RPG game in pretty much every way.Cons: - support was unfortunately pulled by Ubisoft before a host of audio problems could be patched out, so we're stuck with them forever now. Battle music gets stuck on all the time, sounds constantly don't play or have wrong volumes. With a long enough play session you can end up with 3+ battle songs all playing at the same time all out of synch, which is pretty irritating to hear. these problems are extremely disappointing since the game itself is otherwise so amazing. exiting and running the game again does fix it though (temporarily). - After having played the rest of the series, there are a few things in comparison that I miss, but these are not strictly good or bad:    - most M&M games have an accelerating levelling scale. progression is slow in the beginning, but by the end you're gaining like 10 levels per trainer visit. in this one, progression does start slow, and does accelerate at first, but at the end it slows to a crawl, and you end up basically frozen and will never be good at everything you could have been good at. this is pretty strongly different than the other M&Ms where you could master everything about your class and still have tons of points left over. depending on your point of view this could be a good or bad thing.    - this game actually has *better* tactical combat than any of the other M&M games, and depending on which classes you choose, you can still become very powerful. though the classes are actually very imbalanced as well, some being extremely powerful and some being very weak. again, this may or may not be a bad thing.

												I got this game as a part of a bundle and thought ""well, this will be one game I'll nevel install"".But I ended up trying the game, and liked it so much I completed it.Despite being released in 2014, Might and Magic X has a very strong back to 90' feeling looming over it. It mostly feels like a weird mixture of roguelike and older Might and Magic games. Turn based game where you run in a grid. Certainly not something you would expect from such a new game.I, however, find this pleasant and nostalgic.If you like older Might and Magic titles and are fan of roguelikes, then this game will be good for you, try it out if it's on sale. If you aren't fan of either, better stay away. You will probably not like this.There are two major downsides for this game I disliked.-Damn much running around in same places.-No real game notes. Too often you keep wondering ""where on earth I saw that earth magic master teacher. Gotta go to google again, I'm not checking the whole world again to find him.""They certainly didn't stop me from playing, but I must admid both were annoying for me.			"

												At first I had doubtful expectations, the graphics looked rough and I tought the story line would be inadequately short. Just a  few minutes of gameplay, and I was completely hooked. The graphics became flawlessly ordinary. And the story, unbaffeled and intriguing. Hours and hours of gameplay and puzzle solving my adiction to the game is endless.Still I have not completed the game, but I'm far in. The quests requires your full attention, if you don't stay sharp, any detail lost will hinder you from understanding how to proceed next. I love this.The game costs nothing compared to the high value gameplay that you get. Money well spent.			"

												this game gets a bad rap for a few reasons:-uplay-performance issues in the over world(that were worse at launch, but still havent completely fixed)-it has no issues in placing enemies you cannot win against in places you can reach without any warning.-is more similar to the earlier might and magic games than the latter ones, and even then feels more like wizardry 7 than a might and magic game.-grid movimentnow if you can get pass those things you will end with a very competent RPG that feels like a mix of a dungeon crawler with exploration that kinda remenbers zelda or metroid,  with a very very good combat system that is totaly worth your time			"

												While most of the game was fun and interactive it had its downsides. For me free roam is a huge plus in a game which this game has. but the still restrict your movements by placing you on a grid. This is more challenging because it forces you into more fights which i love, but even then on the hardest difficulty this game is easy once you make it past the first act, the thing that i dont like is that i cant explore as much as id like to. the worst part of this game are the puzzles within the game. more than half of them dont make sense and i completed them with little more than luck and the last puzzle within the game is the worst of them all. it requires a certain knowledge that most people dont posses so good luck trying to figure it out on your own.

												As a fan of M&M 1-6 I'm enjoying this more than I thought I would. Sure it's still a bit unpolished and has its bugs but none of them are too game breaking and it does seem to capture much of that old school Might & Magic feel. Thumbs up!			"

												Game gets better the longer you play.  I'm playing on 'Adventurer'(easy mode) and have probably died over 100 times.  In the begining of the game you are limited to where you can go and some of the places in that area are too tough for the level you will be at, trial and error will get you through in the end and I'm happy I stuck at it as the game is becoming an enjoyable romp for me.

												I loved it and had a great time playing it, but you may not.  So, let's discuss it's progency, for a moment.The game owes it's existence to the joyful Legend of Grimrock, which did a great job updating the games of my youth.  MMX is an even more direct throwback to the original Bard's Tale in 1985.  The Bard's Tale took Wizardry and added outdoor areas.  Sure, they weren't that different -- they were basically dungeons with sky blue tiles as opposed to underground grey and brown tiles, but the effect worked on me.  If you have some nostalgia for the early days of RPG gaming, this will likely hit a home run.  It reminds me of playing games on my Apple II, even including watching the graphics render.  What I really enjoyed most was developing my characters and watching them become increasingly powerful.  I wanted them well prepared for the final battle, and there are many opportunities to improve their skills and their loot.Pros:- RPG nostalgia- Good skills and character development options- Good magic system- The individual quests and dungeon were mostly fun- Combat is well done- To me, at least, the game is almost perfectly balanced (with the stock party).  Only toward the end did I begin to feel overpowered.  Most of the game, the battles were close and tense, but rarely did my entire party die.- Great opportunities for exploration -- there is always something new to find- No monster respawns!!  Once you clear an area, it stays clear.  I like that.Cons:- Graphics look good, but take a long time to render.  At one point, the landscape renders well before the castle sitting on the landscape renders.  That's just weird.- Members have your party have comments about everything going on around them.  I love that.  Except that they repeat the same things over and over and over again.  We get it... human cities are as dangerous as the jungle.  Let's move on.  When characters finish a major battle, they cheer an entirely disingenuous ""Yay!""  It sounds exactly like a bunch of poorly paid actors sitting around their home microphones trying to appear enthusiastic.-  With some exceptions, most of the battles use pretty much the same tactics.  I had the same criticism of Dragon Age.  So this game is not unique, in this regard.I've invested about 55 hours into this game.  And I had a lot of fun doing it.  If you have  a soft spot in your heart for the RPG dungeon-crawling heyday of the 80s, I think you'll really enjoy this.  I sure did. "

												If you like retro dungeon crawler RPGs with many classes and party creation, this is your game. I've sunk 89 hours into this so far, before the patch came out. It's excellent! Just like the old days!			"

												For what it is this is an amazing nod to the genre... that being said I miss some of the elements of 6, 7 and 8 unfortunately was never able to beat 9. I would love to see the developers return to the old style and re-release the orginals so i can buy them and play them once more Awesome Game! Must play if you enjoy any of the might and magics!			"

												I'm not entirely sure this is a fitting homage to the series, let alone a worthy sequel to the original Might and Magic first person adventure games. This feels more like a Wizardry game than anything, only it does not have random encounters.If you're looking for an updated version of M&M 6: The Mandate of Heaven, you're going to notice immediately that combat is turn based instead of action based and that you're not able to cheese the ranged attacks quite the same way you did in the last few titles. This forces the element of difficulty into the game that used to come from having to strategize about when and where to cast spells and run from enemies. Once engaged in melee combat, you can't back away or use exits, and very often you're arbitrarily ambushed and beaten down from behind. This leaves little to no strategy available to the player to decide when and where to engage the enemy. Worse still, every skill you need to progress is gated by leveling up multiple times and collecting money, which there is a limited amount of in the game. This entire game feels like it was designed by people who did not play the original series and do not fully understand the mystique and challenge of M&M adventure games. The elements are there but different. Most of the difficulty in this game comes from needing to block or chug potions at the right time. And you can't even equip the best shields available to you in the first town. You have to complete several incredibly difficult dungeons and make it to the second town before you're even allowed to purchase the training to equip them. This makes the fights with tougher enemies frustrating if not outright unfair. Those who would focus on defense to secure the best outcome are punished while people who choose whatever deals the most damage are rewarded; All in all, this is par for the course for turn based games but not balanced the way M&M 1-6 were. Moreover, entire methods of playing the game, such as going with heavy armor and shields, goes completely unrewarded, so there's no point to that portion of the content. You do not have a front-line and a back-line since enemies can reach any of your party members to attack them at any time, so there isn't even signficant incentive to have defensive members balancing against softer damage dealers until halfway into the game when you actually get usable healing spells. By then, you'd have been better off going full barbarian or mage across the board.The only genuinely positive part of this experience is that the dungeons and quests all string together nicely like an mmo and it's easy to figure out where to go next just from exploring and poking around on the mini map, talking to people, etc. That and, somehow acknolwedging the limitations of non-respawning chests and enemies, the game apparently dumps loot on you when you find it, so that's nice.I haven't played a full team of mages like I mentioned earlier yet but I suspect they work much better than the classes I was trying before; And if that is the case, then this is the only great similarity between the original games and this one. Overall, I don't want to take the time to play it anymore after having gotten my butt kicked repeatedly. I'm already too frustrated after a few hours of trudging around in the Lighthouse. The difficulty curve is ridiculous and fights go from being winnable to being totally hopeless, from room to room even. Moreover, there's almost nothing to indicate to you when going in a room or across a bridge will be life threatening so you can never learn from your mistakes. There are even several places you're clearly meant to return to when you're stronger, but how much stronger is somewhere between vaguely incomprehensible and utterly unfathomable. It feels like a big slap in the face when you as a player go in a door that was open to you and can't even escape certain demise because you weren't genuinely going to be allowed an opportunity to succeed at what lay behind it. This kind of high stakes trial-and-error is very unrewarding and disappointing.Update: I have now played with a full team of mages and it's as I suspected. I was able to get this team to the place of progress it had taken hours to get to before within about 30 minutes. Of course once you run into the one thing that's immune to the school of magic you've been focusing on or up the difficulty from normal to hard, you can expect to be back in the boat of unplayable content and frustration. Overall, the game seems to want to force you to have to bring a specific party to accomplish the goals it sets before you. Some doors can't even be found and some passage ways can't even be opened unless a person with a high score in a specific stat is able to locate and/or open them for your team, which means teams lacking that stat may not even be able to progress in certain dungeons at all. This is very detrimental as, 1) it's impossible to know what the recommended (or required) team composition is upfront and 2) playing with any other party composition is apparently almost futile. TLDR; This is a competent and somewhat fun to play turn-based RPG but has little to nothing to offer those who are fans of M&M6. I'd still like to recommend this one because it's challenging and a classic first person dungeon crawler like Wizardry, but I can't while it's at any price over 10 dollars. The fact that Wizardry 6 is the same kind of game and was slightly better than this despite having come out 24 years ago prevents me from doing so. If you were hoping to have some fun with this one, buy Wizardry Renaissance and play it all the way through first. Then maybe pick this one up and play it out of boredom when it falls below 10 dollars standard price.			"
