												I think this game will appeal to you if you are a certain kind of person. Do you like Firefly or Mad Max? Does the post disaster/apocalyptic setting appeal? Do you like melancholy, moody music? Do you tend to like more serious  'grown up' games that allow true role playing? Are you happy to wander around on your own, sometimes for long stretches of time, without seeing a soul? Are you more of a loner (a strange question for an MMO perhaps)? Are you more of a calm person who takes gaming slowly rather than rushing to experience a game in the shortest possible time? If the answer is mostly yes this game could be for you...For me, the atmosphere in this game is second to none. Fantastic music, incredible view distance that really hammers home the immense size of the game (around 1000 square kilometres I believe - to put that into perspective Skyrim is around 40 I think) and true freedom to go pretty much wherever you want right from the very start of the game. Note though that I play as a single player - I'm not a clan type of person - so I can't really tell you much about the social side of the game. It is fairly quiet of late - not too many players - but that suits me fine.It's certainly not a polished experience but then, if you're anything like me, that won't matter in the slightest. There's plenty of minor bugs although hardly any will stop progress (a simple relog usually sorts out most things) and there are plenty of minor gameplay things to moan about but, overall, the game is very unique and well worth the download. A huge thing in its favour is that it's a true free to play game. You can play the entire game without spending any real world money. Real world money will get you cool items to wear, cool vehicles, nice buffs and such but almost all of it can also be purchased with in game earned currency if you are patient and keep an eye on the auction house for bargains. It's also worth noting that a lot of the coolest, unique weapons and clothing items can only be earned through questing.I'm not going to go too heavily into the mechanics of the game - it's pretty standard MMO levelling and crafting (but a very deep and rewarding crafting system) and such but it is one of the very few MMO's with real time skill based combat - think first person shooter - and the whole experience of the game is very 'manual' - nothing's on auto pilot - it's all on you to use your skill to stay alive basically.Right, I think I've talked enough now...

												IMHO, this is one of the best and underrated MMOs I've player on my entire gaming life (20 years of gaming so far). Why, you might ask me? I'll tell ya.STORY:The background story is amazing and it mixes Fallout series, Mad Max movies and also A Boy and His Dog references (if you ever saw this movie, you, sir, consider yourself lucky). The game has an unique atmosphere aswell. Not only a futurist set, but a post-apocalyptic one, finely made. MAP:The map is HUGE, I mean, HUGE (already tell ya that♥♥♥♥♥♥is huge?!). You could spent like 8-10 hours to cross the sectors on foot, if you make it alive. CRAFTING: Forget everything else about other's game crafting. This is THE♥♥♥♥♥♥ You can craft your own vehicles or train your own animals! Ride a mutant chicken or a horse (you can have many, many different kind of horses) or go in a bad♥♥♥♥♥mode on a bike.  You can craft almost everything, even tents, campsites and stuff like that to get temporary area buffs. Craft armors, firearms, melee weapon, explosives, medicine, steroids, recipes, foods, drinks, mutagenics... the list is so big that probably I'd spend all the reviews talking about it. Also, you need to craft ammunition for your weapons and gas, diesel or biodiesel for your vehicles, besides ration for your animals and repair kits for heal equipment damage from fights. After all, even if it bothers some people, I must say that I LOVE the time required to crafting. Everything you make by crafting need proper time to get done, from just a few secs to hours or even weeks. A single tire for a car requires 8-12 hours. COMBAT:It's a partial FPS where you need to land your blows and aim to shot manually. No auto-target, which is great for PvP. Headshots cause a lot of extra fatal damage, rewarding you for your skill player.The game have a lot of customization, meaning your character can max various skills to fulfill different roles on a party or even solo. You could be a mutant DPS or a healer, a gunslinger, a rifleman, sniper, fight with a big axe, two tires, be a sneaking rogue, a buffer/debuffer leader or pretty much anything.PVP: Awesome. The game is partial-PvP. I mean, it's not a full PvP map, but, instead, we have PvP zones. On these zones, players need to fight over rare resources like petroleum! People can build settlements and siege-like stuff aswell.The game has 6 factions which the player can join. Each one has it's owns charateristics, RP-related and PvP gear. These factions are at war/alliance relationships with each other.The game also have a lot of player's guilds and alliances and people Pvping over resource nodes and PvP zones.MORE PROS (MORE AWESOME IN YOUR AWESOMENESS):- Not just more of the same. It really brings something NEW and FRESH to MMO players looking for something special.- F2P (doesn't matter to me, but it's nice to try for free if you're not sure about it).- Buy, craft and dye clothes and use them over your regular armor on cosmetic slots. You can even paint and customize your car, bike, etc.- Active, nice and helpful GMs; 24/7 on chat.- A LOT OF DANCE MOVES, including MJ and the awesome Carlton Banks dance (Alfonso to his close friends).- A LOT of creative skills that you don't see everyday. - Welcoming and active community (don't let the Steam numbers fool you, cause the most people playing it are using the non-Steam client). - Deep and beautiful scenarios.- Scary voiceover (turn it off, man).- You have a flashlight.- Immersion feel on every step you take.- Level up takes a long long time, giving you some sense of importance in the world.- Awesome PvP.- You can fight while riding or driving! Man, EVERY SINGLE MMO should have this. Drive fast while unloading a submachinegun clip on a pursuit, why not? Not a Fast & Furious type? You can do the cowboy Texas style aswell and shoot you Colt Anaconda on the horseback.- You can have a dog! (anyone remember Dogmeat from Fallout 2?)- Different paces of walking/driving/riding. You can walk, jog or run and drive/ride at speed as you like. Not so fast, no so slow, the way you want.CONS:- One thing I dislike in this game is it's name. Should be called Awesome Earth.- Performance issues on some PCs.- ""Dated"" graphics (I've player UO for 11 years, ask me if I give a dame for graphics?!)- ""Hardcore"", even not having a full loot system like Darkfall, Ultima Online and Mortal Online (love them all). What makes this game ""hardcore"" for some users is the fact that you need build and plan your character very carefully or it could be useless or disapointing at some point.- Unfriendly interface and learning curve.

												For those of you looking for a fallout-ish experience, you won’t find it hereFor the very few people who actually read this review, I’m going to start off with everything bad that it does.1)	The community feels as dead as all the enemies I had to kill to complete one objective2)	The game does nothing new, it is very generic and copy-paste of other games in the genre.The purpose of a game like this is to do what similar games of its genre did and build on those ideas and make them better. Not fabricate what already exists and slap a “done” sticker on the front. I want something new, with a quirk or unique feature, not a copy paste.3)	There is very little explanation about how skills, items and game mechanics work, only basic key mapping like moving, turning and combat.4)	The story is fairly mild at best5)	Melee combat is dull and unsatisfying6)	Quests have a tendency to “bug out” or have confusing objectives, one situation was where I needed to go to a point on the map, let an NPC follow me and walk back to the start point. Apart from I failed the quest somehow on the first try, the game never explained how or why.When I went back there the NPC that was meant to follow me no longer appears, and as such I have no idea how to complete the quest.Other situations like questing disappearing from my menu also happen frequently, meaning quests I was halfway through needed to be picked up again from a guy quite literally 3 miles away and completed in one go.7)	Menus are very clunky, from the start I was bombarded by a bunch of skills I didn’t know (and still don’t know) the effects or uses of.8)	The crafting system does nothing new, by which I mean it's all dull bashing objects togeather to make something out of thin air.It's also crafted in real time, which can sometimes be up to half an hour for some items. Maybe more.9)	How skills work is never explained, you have to figure it out via tooltips.10)	For me this game took over 50 minutes to download, unpack and patch before I could play. This was on a 100 mbp/s connection with no bottlenecks and commonly downloads big budget triple A games in under 30 mins.11)	I have no idea how they got the screenshots on the store page, I push everything to max and it still looks like something a commodore 64 would play.12)   Fallen Earth tries way to hard to be funny. Often forcing vulgar 12 year old humour at every turn.So what is good about it?Well for a start the skills menu and the depth of control you have is refreshing. You don’t get your hand held and from the start you can wander in any direction you please.Speaking of wandering, the map is decent and from my current playtime I could guess that if you wanted to skirt the edge like a racetrack it would take you several hours to do so on horseback or via a vehicle, it has many interesting points and few “blank” spots. Yet the map still does not feel crowded.If you are a nerd like me you will probably understand the skills system quickly, it’s very D&D style with character sheets and raising skills that all affect your other skills. The mechanics are probably what holds this game up.Dialogue feels forced but it’s fairly frequent, not every line is voiced but there are greetings you get from time to time. What makes it better is the lack of hand holding and the freedom you are given.I know I have scorned games that have committed fewer crimes than this one, but I honestly see it getting better later on if you sink enough time into it. But after that I think it lacks staying power unless you sink money into it.It’s kept me busy for almost 10 hours, it’s very consuming once you get immersed. But I have no real desire to play it again.If I had to give a score it would probably be a very high ""meh, eye candy. Made me forget I was starving for a few hours""It has lots of bad points but for me mechanics outweigh graphics, voice acting and storyConclusion;Good mechanicsBorderline graphicsBad immersionTedious crafting systemLots of freedomWon't subsitute bigger titles of the genre such as wastelandGive it a try, the game is like marmite.

												If you like Fallout and STALKER, then this game is for you, this game is mostly based in gameplay not graphical, but still has STALKER graphics, decent, it has First person, 3rd Person. Its similiar to Fallout, find missions, Find weapons and armor, but this game has a pretty dynamic view of recipe creations, incredible Gamemasters, which help prevent spammers from annoying you or harrassing you In-game. Although help is limited unless you buy at least one Store item, which isnt a bad thing, Its Free2Play why complain, if you plan on keep playing than buy something from the Marketplace to unlock You're Certain limits In-game. When creating Recipes, some take minutes while some take hours to days. So this game isnt for the faint of heart, if you can't read and follow through quickly and comprehend well, then this game is not for you.Certain Armor and Gear, are only available through PVP, which is recommended with Teams. This game has well endored people playing so its best to keep you're Manners at hand, you tick one person off and you're name is pretty much Kill on sight, game is comprehensive when it comes to recipes, FE is hard to play through without recipes, but isnt impossible since it has a similiar concept as Amazon sellers or Ebay Auctions, since this game has its Own Auction House, mail box which you can send and recieve mail just as real life with packaging.If you follow through the beginning Tutorial you will recieve free gear and a Vehicle. Easiest ways to make Chips as in cash, is to collect and farm and Auction off items, but keep an amount of items for yourself.The game is quite simple when it comes to making a clan or joining a clan, you also get a Help channel with Region and local, But Global Chats are unlocked with a single item bought from the Marketplace.The Devs, do their best at updating but at times can be slow, just like most any other games, the current level from this review is lvl55, since they take their sweet time when updating higher lvls.If you plan on playing this game keep in mind, DON'T rush the game, take you're time, customize you're controls, set you're Window Panels in-game best to you're level. Don't forget you get basic Training abilities with Mutations that disapear at a certain level. Max chip limits are all 9 chips in every chip collor for now. Don't Skip levels, if you play all missions you'll have more than enough chips to buy whatever suits you. I dont recommend Power-Leveling unless you already played all the missions on another Alternative Character AKA Alt. Its best to stay within the lines of all Factions until you know which Faction is best for you.----------------------------------------------------------------------Update 1/13/14Auction House: Used to sell whatever Items that are tradable, though most people I have noticed that are new to this game even older members tend to get two things confused at times, first.Remember that theres differences between Not Tradable and Not sellable. Not tradable means exactly what it means, you can't trade it with other members of the game like yourself, and Cannot be sold, means you can't sell that item to the Merchants in-game. This doesnt mean you can't place this in the AH unless it states its both Not Tradable and can't be sold. If it just says cant be sold, you can trade the item with players but cant sell it to the merchants. if the item says it cant be traded but doesnt say it cant be sold, that means you cant trade with Players but you can sell it to Mercs. If both are displayed, best th8ing to do is either two things, stash it somewhere or right click the item to delete or Scrap it for parts, if given that Option.Most players have a hard time figuring out where best to scavenge loot, whether its for crafting or selling. Try looking in the outskirts of Embry, Oilvile, Pass Chris and other towns, Oilvile contains alot of Copper and Lead deposits for example.Waypoints.Waypoints is VERY important in this game if you have a hard time keeping track of where your favorite spots are, rather its for looting and killing. To use Waypoints go to your Menu and locate the name Waypoints click it to open another window you can create a Waypoint or Add another. To create your own you can locate your Radar and click the globe icon to bring up your strategic map, from there, you can uncheckmark the Overhead to view detailed Information of where your at, and you can right click where ur Marker is at to add a waypoint, you can edit name to easily find it in your Waypoints Manager Window.Copy recipe Links or AH links to Chat WindowsIf you are near a AH or chatting in a Chat Bar, you can link recipes by going to Menu locating your Recipes and find the desired recipe and look at the bottom of your recipe, you will see an icon that looks like Shuffled cards, next to that icon is a chat bubble you click that to add it to any Recently Active Chat windows, then Enter it to show Full recipe to someone, But NEVER shout out recipes in the HELP section, since this will get you muted or possibly banned from Help for Spamming in the Help channel. Just like Adding Recipes you can also just directly link the Item itself rather the full recipe which is useful in the Auction Channel so you dont spam and make anyone mad. To do so, locate any recipe, find the actual item you want to craft, look at the Icon of the Item point your cursor to the thumbnail of it and you will see a Red pin like picture in the picture of it, you will then notice it will show a detail information of it, when it does that, hold down your Ctrl Button down on your keyboard and click your left click on your mouse to see it directly link to your active Chat Window. Works great for asking in the Auction Channel when saying WTB or Wanting/Willing To SellUpdate: 7/17/2014Some have been using the word Pay2win and thinking that just because you clear an area of enemies they respawn too quickly that it needs improvement, truth be told, yes the game does need improvement... but Name one game you played that doesnt need it. People that use the word Pay2win, you dont pay2win in this game, if you are refering to using In-Game Chips that are free in the game then its not Pay2win, its Working2win, you have to work to get money within the game to buy/make weapons etc. sure you can use the AH to buy weapons, but you arent using RL money to do so, unless you are paying RL money for Chips which isnt legal within the game, and yes the Marketplace have decent items that you can buy to trade off for chips within the game if you choose so, but you dont need Chips, you need Intellegence and good manners. Befriend the right people within the clans and you will always most likly get free help or get free items just for being Pendant and friendly. Karma goes a long ways. Now as far as Enemies appearing too quickly after death, think of this as the Prison in Kingman in Sector 1, its designed this way to give you more of an edge, which opens up the ability of having to rely on Friends/Team Work. Social Skills at best. If you are a loney, best advise check your build make a good power build for Solo Missions. Skip Hard missions for a low end Toon and go back later and beat that mission when your Character is stronger in the level.Best of luck and happy playing.This game is worth playing at least once			"

												The game itself is pretty cool. Full of bugs though, lost items, constant connection issues, etc. However that said, The player base is abou 85% rude. The GM's are a joke, Don't help anyone with a damn thing. Rude, throw bans around like the drunk girl on prom night. Spend close to $50 within the first month and a half, banned after my premium ended. Contacted support to find out why I was ""suspended"" about 3-4 times. No response. Been 4 days.  Overall. Their PR sucks, Their Staff Sucks, Their playerbase is full of trolls that suck the fun out of the game.   3/10			"

												Alright. This may as well be a rant but I'm going to break this review down on some subcategories. I've been playing this game for a while and recommend it to new people. HOWEVER, for people playing the Alpha and Beta like I had, GOOD LUCK GETTING YOUR CHARACTER BACK. G1 basically said ""screw you"" to me and I haven't even been able to access my character from maybe...3-6 months ago? Not even? TERRIBLE.CATEGORY 1: GraphicsNow the graphics AREN'T FALLOUT LEVEL. They're about average MMORPG...Like ArcheAge or TERA. Yes, you can set your graphics really high and I get about 50-60 frames on Highest, and when I lower about 110-120 FPS. They can use some work, but I noticed if you turn your graphics down even slightly, you loose A LOT of really nice detail that they put in there for fine polishing.CATEGORY 2: Gameplay (Combat, Movement, PvP, PvE)Gameplay is...it's...it's alright. The combat is either 1st or 3rd person; and personally I would rather go 3rd. 1st person is extremely wierd and awkward, and rather dull as well. Now, as for movement- THE MAPS...IN THIS GAME...ARE SO FREAKING HUGE. I SWEAR. TO GOD. They split them up into ""Sectors,"" and the last being ""Alpha County"" which is basically the end game area. Now, that being said, you can ATTEMPT to run there. However, I tried to get from Sector 1 to Sector 2, and didn't pack enough feed for my horse. I was left STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE  with a horse that eventually DIED on me (No it didn't literally, but it may as well have with the speed it was going). So, if you're going between Sectors, be sure to grab a mount. But what I would LOVE to commend G1 for doing here is I have never...NEVER...IN MY LIFE..EXPERIENCED A LOADING SCREEN TRAVELLING. Only will you ever for teleporting and loading INTO the game. Travelling is loading-screen free, along with dungeons as well.-Mounts in the game are very nice to have and can be pricey at times, but they're well worth the buy. You have two types of mounts, machines and natural. Natural covers things like horses and some kick♥♥♥♥♥massive wolves you can ride on. And no they aren't your stereotypical wimpy♥♥♥♥♥wolves. These things are H-U-G-E and well worth getting in the quest line that you complete to get them (yes, you can actually get mounts through questlines; GOOD ONES not just starter ones). Machines covers ATV's, Bikes, Buggies, and Cars. But, the higher tier you get on mounts, THEY ARE GOD-AWFUL TO TAKE CARE OF. Be ready to spend some in-game cash to take care of them, 'cause some use ""premium"" fuel.-PvP in the game is fairly decent, involving some ethics of ""skill"" and dodging. However, if you want PvP, it is HORRIBLY balanced. Rifleman and snipers are left in the dark, along with some longer range classes while melee is the way to go. Oh, and you think carrying a massive club around is going to get you where you want? HELL NO. Yeah, you have the OCCASIONAL good heavy melee weapon that can get the job done; but no, you'll be faced with a load of VERY....VERY...VERY fast DPS melee weapons that literally shred you. So for PvP, get some very fast dual pistols or duel machetes/knives.-PvE/Questing is nice in the game and is pretty alright. However, questing can get..repetitive. ""RUN HERE, SHOOT THIS, RUN BACK, TURN IT IN. DONE."" Now, there are the exceptional quests that do have you doing some pretty cool things such as setting explosives on a vehicle or hunting down massive bosses. And the bosses in this game are VERY...VERY hard to beat without a group. Other than that...Not really much else for questing. I commonly found myself GRINDING THE♥♥♥♥♥♥out of high level enemies just to rank up. Took me HOURS and loads of cash for ammunition. CATEGORY 3: CommunityThe community is alright, but nothing different from any other MMO community out there. You're going to have those OBVIOUS dickwads and terrible people. Hell, you will even FIGHT...LITERALLY FIGHT over loot sometimes. Seriously...fk that. Even then, on GLOBAL channels people are being harassed. I had to step in once and tell someone to back off, which then lead to me reporting these asshats to the online GM (Game Moderator). Their accounts were issued a warning. Don't hope for the best from this community, 'cause you ain't gon'na receive♥♥♥♥♥♥Now....now comes the Pay-to-Play/Pay-to-Win. N-O. All things you will get to buff up your character is IN GAME. The only thing in this ""cash shop"" is going to be cosmetics and SOME boosts such as EXP. Overall, a fun game, good setting, terribad community, decent cash shop. ♥♥♥♥ TRAVELLING BY FOOT. IN. THE.♥♥♥♥♥♥EDIT: Funny Things in the game>Running around in a speedo with a gasmask on.>Crafting horses. With Kits. That's right. There's a kit to craft a horse.Oh and one more thing, this game, as it is made by Gamers First, MAY NOT WORK ON SOME PEOPLE'S COMPUTERS. I don't know what is wrong with it but sometimes these games just don't want to work.			"

												How to do a review for a game that you spent over 3000 hours playing?Could it be objective? Hardly. But i will try at my best to keep it real as much as it is possible.First off, this game is not old. Its ancient.Graphics are, by todays standards, in world that saw titles such as Crysis, CoD:AW, Battlefield or Witcher series, laughable at best. It looks old, it ''plays'' old, but it has some of its charm for it.Story? Interesting, starting parts are very cohesive, but later on its starts to be very watered down.Gameplay? That depends solely on player. There are multiple things you could do ingame (crafting, pvp, pve, farming, exploring, ect), and it works well on its part, but some features definately need to be worked on.I could spend hours explaining each part separately, but generally, game has complex crafting system, pve is fun as far pve goes in other games (there are bosses, instances, dungeons, team raids, ect), farming and harvesting are nice way of getting materials in large quantities if you dont mind posibility of being attacked while doing so (depending on place where you farm/harvest).Over the course of playing i met lot of interesting people. Some were nice, some were not, but all around, Fallen Earth has (or had) one of best comunities around in MMO's. There is always someone who will help out new player, give some usefull advice, share money, resources or items. There are also individuals who organise various community events.One of biggest problems most post apocalyptic games have is that they are constantly being measured towards Fallout universe games. That is a problem, since most games do not measure up to Fallout.Fallen Earth is one of games that comes very, very close to that. Not the same, but not too much diferent from it. Each of those games has its own pros and cons.Sadly, at current time, it seems that G1 (company who owns FE) isnt too much interested in adding new things (although they do occasionally, but not to extent from before), but we always hope they will come to their senses and finish polishing the diamont that Fallen Earth is, and make it shine as it should.

												Given my extensive play time I figured it's about time I leave a review for this game. I'd like to start off with this game is not pay2win, PvE/Missions can be pretty fun given you're teamed with the right people - but generally the rewards are awful. The crafting system is pretty neat but has a few flaws with some recipes are odd given their level as well as some new endgame gear rendering some materials and gears utterly useless. PvP is pretty fun but it's not what it once was so you'll see a lot of people reminiscence about the old days. The community is probably the biggest killer for this game, most of which just whine about anything and everything. If you're looking for a post apocalypse game to play casually, then Fallen Earth may be it. The first few levels can be boring though but if you can bear through that then you're in for a good time.			"

												I'm a veteran on this game so i came here to tell the new players the real face of Fallen Earth.  At the start you might have some problems with the player community, trolls are all over the help channel and thats a problem that the GM's are always trying to prevent without much success. As you level up you start to make friends and enemies, specially when you join a faction, leveling up is the best part of the game and the world is huge, there are many ways to level up, you just have to choose the one you like. The real problem of the game are the community and the administration, about the community most of the players are rude and trolls, that's a fact, about the administration, some of the gm's are extremely rude and not polite,  and the game doesn't seem to have a anticheat engine, i was banned once just because i was part of a clan that had 1400 players and 1 or 2 were cheating, they did like ""idk who is cheating so lets ban everyone"". My account was unlocked because i never PvP and the cheaters were the PvP'ers, so joining a clan is not worthy and you are better alone. The old players are quitting or getting banned and the new players quit because of the trolls and lack of assistance, the game is dying very fast, but i still recommend this game for the good years that i spent there, i just wanted to prepare new players for what's coming for them :D			"

												World is not interesting, enemies are not interesting, dungeons are boring with bullet sponge bosses. The end game pvp is borderline pay2win with the way the shop works. The combat is aim/action based but still uses spammy hotkey skills. Overall the combat is worse than WoWs style due to how horrible the animation and unbalanced the skills are. The crafting takes a long time to do unless you pump money into the game. You can straight up buy the best vehicle in the game, and you have to buy a item to craft the best weapons. This is not fallout the mmo, this is a sad attempt to milk fallout fans.I have a lot of time in it from pressure by friends to play it. Same reason WoW still has so many subs who don't actually like the game much, they play it as a social experience. Also have a lot of time simply from being AFK. The best way to level is waiting in a place called Citadel. Also crafting is only viable if you AFK in game next to a bought crafting table.			"

												I was part of the beta testing for this game and played it up until the game went free to play and got sold to that third company, Gamers First. When the game was handed over to that company I lost access to my old account and the characters on it. I followed the instructions to 'merge' my account to their new system and lost access in the process, I contacted them and received no response on the issue. I tried making another account but found the game was being filled with microtransaction pay to win garbage so I just dumped the game.The old Devs were actually active within the community, and very helpful. The new Devs, in my short one sided interaction with them, are complete garbage. This game had a lot of promise to it but was snuffed out by the new company's greed and lack of customer service.This game is dead.			"

												I played this game early on, ran a very popular clan, and loved PVP. Gamersfirst destroyed Fallenearth. In 3 years, they have made 4 new weapons. No new levels, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ exspansion areas. This was one of the best games I ever played, but G1, destroyed the whole game. Don't let my hours through steam fool you, I played way before steam launch. The PvP used the be the best I could find anywhere, but now it is so plagued with aim botters, and all the PvP builds are cookie cutter builds. I made a  build from my own preference, a low heals high damage fighter, and it worked, so what happens, they nerfed it till I couldn't use it anymore. Building a character for PvP through your rp mindset doesn't work. The PvP is down to a variety of six weapons, and four reskinned sets of armor. The developers of this game, take all the money from it, and dump it into other games. It was one of the best MMOs I ever played, and it will not be forgotten, but as it stands I will never play again .			"

												Not worth the install in my opinion. When you look at this you think ""COOL! AN MMORPG JUST LIKE FALLOUT!"" What you get:Hard to follow missions with rude players who are really into it just to troll the ***k out of you continuously until you either quit playing or get good enough to beat them to death in return.

												don't do it. its a good game and i've loved it for years however the past 6 months it's died and there's not much point in anyone playing. there are bugs which damage the game greatly and have been known about for years - but never fixed. The GM's  / devs put very little time or effort into the game anymore and it's barely supported by them. The game has a crash or a downtime every day, but still the cash shop sales are pumped out. I feel they are just milking it for as much money as they can, when it's no longer worth anyones time - let alone cash.			"

												For SOME reason, my old and well viewed review for this game got removed and now i'll have to repost it:OH MY GOD,  how could i have played this crap for more than 170hours? It seems like some people wanted Fallout New Vegas to be a MMORPG. And here it is.Well, one thing is for sure, it can be addictive if you like power play.It's art style is obviously some post apocaliptic stuff, wich looks not that bad itself.But seriously. this game is out since 2011 but yet it's full of gliches ,unfinnished animations and messed up or even missing sound files.That ruins the atmosphere.But the thing that kept me playing for so long was the gameplay.First you start off with PAINTBALL GUNS AND SELF MADE SHIVES while rinding A FUKKING HORSE!.But then, you see some heavily armored guys with cool Gas-Masks and badass looking rifles, revolvers, and machetes while driving a dune buggy or a pocket bike(love em).So.what does a power player think? ""I WANT THAT SH/T RIGHT NOW!""Then you realize how fast you can get EXP by just exploring and killing mobs wich acctaly makes really fun.(atleast at the lower levels.)Of course finnishing quests gives you WAY more exp than just killing stuff.But the thing is, most of the quests are not as repetitive as in the most MMORPGS.Well...not all of them are...let's say 50% of the quests you can get are repetitive.But that's something everybody who likes MMORPG's has to deal with.Another thing is the crafting system.You can craft gear and equipment wich you could get from merchants and quest rewards 5-10 levels later.This includes....C@RZ!!!!!!!!!.you can craft your own ATV (wich is some sort of quad-bike) really early in game...if you do the right quest line.The AI is....well...not that good acctualy.If an enemy detects you in it's view (wich is 360°...) it will follow you untill it's close enough to attack. If you run away from it it might give up the pursuit after like 8seconds.Usual stuff.BUT it's the way they follow you....you can't hide from then.THEY CAN  TELEPORT!Example: I was in a house sniping out of a window. I shot some ugly a$$ mutant who was standing outsite and doing...well nothing.I shot him and took about 20% of his health.Then i wanted to swich to my shotgun and wait for him to get into the house so i can shoot him from upstairs.but while i was swiching weapons: GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWR. It was RIGHT INFRONT OF MY FACE.So yeah, teleportation.This sucks.But i must say this game got a  LOAD of different enemies from Aligators to Zombies(and humans of course).Seriously a sh/t load. But sometimes....i though to myself ""why in a game like this?"" Im talking about animals....NORMAL A$$ ANIMALS like bears, pumas, wild dogs, rhinos,snakes,Zebras etc. It seems like they ran out of ideas and started taking models from zoo tycoon.ANYWAY. This game if great if you are only about the essence of a MMORPG since it's full with content and customizable player skills. If you care about visual stuff like graphics, visual gliches and overall atmosphere then....GTFO------->I'm not sure whether to recommend this game for everybody or not. If you're someone who likes MMORPGs, then go download it.Um...yeah...that review is way too long and like 2 people are going to read it anyway.k thx bye(Sorry if there is any wrong grammar, english is not my native language.)

												This was a tough one to recommend or not, but I'm going to have to go with no. I wanted to say yes, and I would have, only if the Devs paid more attention to newer people who play the game for the very first time. I will first start off with a Pros/Cons listPros:Decent GraphicsHUGE mapGood combat (not just point in click, you actually have to aim and shoot)Factions is a neat idea ontop of clansPvP is for the most part, actually about skillLots of things to do at max levelCons:HUGE map, but not much in itMelee is SO overpoweredCan't trust faction members, you have half chance of them betraying youNot nearly enough support at lower levels (will explain later)Rude communityGM's don't do muchHorrible customer support (will explain later)Now, when I say ""Not nearly enough support at lower levels"" I mean that there has been so many updates in the game to keep higher level'd people to keep playing, example, the G.O.R.E. update (that whole update was a mess), while there's no updates or anything for lower level'd people, the game has a decent tutorial system, but just like anything, a tutorial can only help so much, you actually need to do it to get better. If you want to craft, you need to scavenege in PvP areas for certain things and people usually just camp there waiting for people to show up to get stuff to craft and waste them before they even know what happens. The economy is pretty messed up, ammo, which costs nothing to make really, is sold for a pretty pricey amount, I understand supply and demand but holy crap, it's hard to get money as a lower level so ammo isn't going to be cheap for them.Customer support... It literally means ""customer support"" if you're a f2p, they don't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about you, (it's kind of like TF2, if you buy a single item from the online store, you unlock things, such as no money limit and all that), in fact, unless you bought something or have a subscription, you can't even file a ticket! Even people who are paying a montly fee for the game, they barely care about you. GM's hardly do anything to help you, but they do throw bans left and right on a power hungry trip. The community is rude, 80% of the people there are the ones who have still played when the game is P2P so they thing they're better than everyone in general.As for factions, there are Techs, Travelers, Light Bearers, Enforcers, CHOTA and I forget what the last one is called, they're kind of like hippies, anyways, each one has a natural ally and a natural enemey, Techs hate the hippies, but Techs are allied with Travelers, but Travelers hate Light Bearers, etc etc, but unfourtantely none of that matters since if you if you're a Traveler, you'll get freaking shot up by another Traveler, otherwise the whole faction thing would be an awesome idea.I really liked the game at first, but it kept going downhill, the last thing I will say is the G.O.R.E. update, it released new weapons, a rifle, pistol and sword. Each one of those weapons were able to be upgraded 2 times, so it'd be rifle, upgraded rifle, upgraded upgraded rifle, but of course, each upgrade was harder to do, and the most upgraded rifle, could easily one hit kill someone, the DPS on the pistols (which shot in three burst (now fixed)) was insanely high, and well, for the sword, all melee is over powered so you get the idea on that. Some people made a clan to nerf the guns, some people made a clan to get rid of the update and killed anyone (the clan was always in a zerg) using the weapons, whether they were in the same faction or not. And then there was a clan that said to keep the update as is, and of course, they were using the Level 3 weapons. So they finally nerfed the weapons after about a month or so. Some people are wondering things like ""Why is he even saying this?"" Well, I'm saying this because if the Devs released an update that had insanely OP weapons without even thinking about if it's OP, or to test it or anything really, It really makes me not being able to trust them with future content, and also, the only reason the nerfed it, is because people were canceling their subscriptions until they nerfed itEdit: Typos and added a statement in the ""Customer Support"" part			"

												The poor man's Fallout online. Well, not exactly, but hey, it ís free 2 play and it does have that post apocalyptic thing going on.Either way, it's a pretty cool game. Lots of crafting and scavenging to get things done. And the community is quite nice too.The crafting system is pretty cool. While the first few items are quickly crafted, some things can take over a day. Luckilly the crafting still goes on while you're offline. From simple clubs, to a dune buggy, it can all be crafted... in due time.This game is quite easy to solo in the first map, but after that, you might want to team up with some people as bosses get pretty heavy.Another thing I did like about this game is the subscription system. It's not mandatory, and you can buy a months subscription any time. It gives a few bonusses, and when it's over it's over. Just like that. You can even buy them with in-game money.The pvp fields however, are terrible. A broken system trying to balance things. Higher levels get a seriously unfair disadvantage, not balanced at all.Oh well, I'm not much of a pvp fan anyway...			"

												It's a good game, but it could be better.The Bad...*Lack of server optimisation, PvP is sometimes a horrible experience because players strafe left and right to avoid damage because their hitboxes and character fly all over the place.*Lack of weapon variety in end-game.*Lack of useful weapons, some weapon stats are just better than the other.*Seen some clans camp newbies who enter PvP on accident.*Some mutation abilities are underpowered.*PvE enemies are predictable and boring to fight.*Character customisation is permanent (face, tattoos, paint, etc...)*Money, character, and crafting limit if you don't buy anything for real money.*Some skills seem underpowered because most abilities can hardcounter them (Dirty Tricks, Escape Artist, maybe a few more).*Loud bad player minority.The Good...*Lots of build variety, be as special as you want to be or become a jack-of-all-trades.*3 Weapon skills to choose from - Melee, Rifle, Pistols (all with different pros and cons).*Mutations enhance your abilities.*Some body and character customisation.*Lots of crafting.*Helpful help chat.*Freedom to choose what kind of build you want.*Community is friendly.*Full game experience is cheap, buy something in the store and the money, craft, and character limit is gone forever (Max character limit in ""freemium"" is 4)			"

												Im playing Fallen Earth since it went Free2Play, and i must say you wont like this game if you cant deal with the fact that there no dragons and elves here ! Fallen Earth is an MMOFPS that may look boring at first, but as soon as you get  into it you will love it more and more. im currently level 55, and Fallen Earth is not the game that will be boring after reaching this level, the way to level 55 ( the level cap ) is long and can be sometimes even boring, but you will feel very satisfied.The are factions in the game, which you have to choose one, depends on your playstyle.you can help your faction in PVP which really fun aswell ! really balanced and fun PVP ! you can't go wrong with this game, no Pay2Win here ! of course you have a marketplace that you can buy stuff from it, but its clothing, vehicles and pets.if you dont want to spend real life money you dont have to ! every month you getting reward points that you can buy all these stuff and even more ! the game is Play2Win, the more you play the better you get ! Edit: THIS IS FALLOUT ONLINE, really recommended to all fallout fans out there ! My score : 10/10			"

												I couldn't recommended this game to anyone. I've played it for years and now with the declining player base and lack of care from the company that owns it, the game has less than 200 players at peak times. This leads to an inbalanced system of older players having everything and newer players struggling to get what they need at lvl55. There are no updates anymore. Events have become non existant and if you need GM help forget it. There is very little oversight from G1. The game is being left to decay. Lag has become a real issue and over the months it has not improved. If anything it has gotten worse.When I first started playing FE it was great. Lots of players. events, GMs on daily. Any issues were sorted out in a timely manner. It was a very fun game to play. Now it is very different, which is a shame as there seems to be no other game like it.If you are into PVP forget it. It is dead. Only PVE remains with the very occassional PVPer online.In my opinion Fallen Earth isn't worth the download anymore.			"

Posted: November 23, 2014
												Over all a pretty good game , but FE has it's share of issues as I'll discuss below.Story: There isn't one. There is a bare bones backstory to the different factions, what they're about, and what they offer....but that's about it. There's also general story lines in each settlement along with a ton of sidequests, but they do little to establish any kind of narrative.Gameplay: FE works like a 3rd person shooter combined with WoW. You have to aim your own weapons (more on this in the PVP section) and there are a number of abilities you can activate during combat to give yourself an edge. This part of the game is done pretty well, combat is intuitive and if you pay attention to the tutorial, fairly easy to pick up. The crafting system in this game is fantastic, almost every material needed to craft everything you could ever want can be salvaged from the world, harvested at player created farms, collected by player made harvesters in PVP zones, or purchaced off the Auction House. Graphics: This wasn't that big of a deal to me since I don't get hung up on graphics much, but this game was developed in 2009 and the graphics look pretty dated. Player population: I don't get alot of the complaints about this as at no point were any of the sector hubs empty. As a crafter I had no trouble making money off the Auction House as there were plenty of buyers for most of my products (once I figured out how to price them properly). You probably won't be tripping over other players when you're out in the middle of nowhere on missions, but is that a bad thing?F2p or pay to win? FE is good about this aspect as well. There is a cash shop where you can buy boosts to things like experience and faction point award rates; but there's no explicit thing you can buy in the cash store that will give you any advantage against an equally skilled and leveled player whom has never bought anything from the cash shop. The items you pay real money for are largely cosmetic or purely for convinence. PVP: This is by far the most mixed aspect of Fallen Earth. FE does reward pvp kills against different factions with a pvp currency, but in a move I haven't seen in any other MMO (except EVE), FE adds a reason to fight in PVP zones other than pvp currency, Harvesters. Harvesters are player created structures that generate crafting resources that hard to impossible to find outside PVP zones, and as you can guess can only be placed in PVP zones. When all goes well PVP is fun & rewarding, regardless if your faction holds the conflict town at the end of the day.So what's wrong you ask? First off you're not likely to get a real taste of PVP untill you're close to level cap, granted if you hang around the level 20-45 conflict towns you might bump into an enemy faction; but if you do it's likely to be a clan blob of 5-10 people leveling their alts & steamrolling anyone in their path. The reason the lower level zones are so empty? The level debuff, which cripples anyone above a given conflict town's level range. The idea isn't a bad one: to keep tweaked out lvl 55s from curb stomping fledgling pvp players. But instead of bringing them on the level of people supposed to be in that zone it effectively renders the higher level player helpless; as a result nobody goes near conflict zones if there's even a chance they'll get hit with the level debuff.But the absolute worst part is the proliferation of hackers (aimbotters and the like) in pvp. G1 does a pretty inconsistent job of keeping hackers in check; every once in a while they do a purge of hackers and PVP becomes fun again, but they always seem to come back. 90% percent of the challenge in pvp is consistently hitting your opponent, preferably with headshots which do considerably more damage, getting good at hitting and avoiding being hit is the core of PVP. So you can see how the fun gets quickly sucked out of this critical part of the game when you have ENTIRE CLANS able to sweep whole PVP zones simply by activating a 3rd party hack and racking up 100% accuracy while their opponents have no recourse what so ever. The fact G1 has been unable or unwilling to find a long term solution to this problem is by far FE's biggest problem.Summary: Fallen Earth is f2p game that isn't pay to win; that alone makes it worth a try. But digging deeper this game has plenty to offer in terms of PVE, crafting, and (if the hacker population is culled at the time) end game PVP. It's really up to what you value in an MMO if FE is worth your time; it certianly is for me despite it's faults.			"

												I'm recommending this, but not.But why, you may ask? You have so much time in it, surely it's got something going for it?It does. Thing is, the game is pretty much an excersize in unrealized potential. The environments look samey, until you go out of your way and find lovingly crafted areas people will never bother with.The combat is clunky, if functional, and regularly gets screwed with by poor skill and item balancing.The setting is actually surprisingly good, and there actually is an underlying story that you can play through at your own pace that is, shock and awe, actually pretty genuinely interesting, especially for your average scifi buff.Noticing a theme? There are some wonderful ideas, but for whatever reason, they just never quite pushed them far enough. The game is sandbox-y enough to be impressively wide open, but they didn't quite cut away from MMO Theme Park syndrome.The crafting system is amazingly wide, allowing you to make damn near everything in the game just from things you can get yourself, except for the necessary endgame things that require asinine boss grinding or broken pvp point grind.Honestly it's getting depressing to talk about. It's one of those things that could have been flat out amazing, and for whatever reason, it just falls short. Still, it's the only modern MMO I've been able to stomach for any length of time, so there's that.			"

												You may have heard this game is buggy. That is an understatment. You may have heard this game is full of chat and PvP trolls. Well I am not going to argue against that. The things is I would not normally tolerate that from a game. It is unacceptable. The game however is in a league of its own. I cannot take my business elsewhere. There is no Elsewhere. Fallen Earth is an MMORPG that does not always look the prettiest but actually provides you with a massive world where there is a point to going off exploring. Resources are everywhere. Everything is needed in someway and almost everything has to be crafted by players. Character development is very customizable both in terms of appearance and performance. All clones are created equal but some are developed poorly. It is an easy system to learn, but much tweaking availiable when mastered.Fallen Earth really is the MMO you can play your way. Every clone can find a niche. Fallen Earth is not at all P2W, with the only advantages being convenience and cosmetics for cashers. Even a subscription can be bought with in game currency.The community has many helpful players and questions are answered quickly via the help channel. If you start playing use the help channel. The game is quite simple to learn but not very well explained by the game itself. Stick with it. Each in-game sector brings fun and different game mechanics. Do not be in a hurry in this game. Speed levelling when you don't know much is a very bad idea.			"

												I used to play this game very frequently and would again if one could purchase crafting queue slots.Since the addition of the patch 2.4 the style of gameplay has changed. Please be aware that this game is only marginally F2P like WoW, you need a subscription to properly play.A year on from this review and my opinion has softened, but if you want to play this game without micromanagment and a large sink of your time it will be hard to do so without a subscription. Bearing this in mind, I wait with baited breath for an expansion good enough to lure me back in or some way to permanently expand my crafting ability.			"

												I love Fallen Earth! So many great memories in this game. I downloaded it in 2012 and deeply regret that I missed its early days. I still play it pretty regularly, but I can't willingly recommend it. The player base is dwindling due to lack of advertising, non-existent updates, and what seems like complete abandonment from GMs/Devs. Every anniversary that I have in memory was met with a celebration for making another great year! And if you were subscribed you would receive an article of clothing with the game's name, usually. This year, (marking Fallen Earth's seventh) there were only three redeem codes to celebrate it. Just depressing.I unfortunately can't see a future for this game, if this continues. Recommending Fallen Earth is just letting gamers waste time, effort, and money for a game on its last leg. It pains me to write this because I don't want this game to end, but have no power to change its fate.			"

												I quit playing this game when I found out that the ""Devs"" were also the same people who were Hackers, who Hacked the game and used their cheats to ruin the game for other people.There is no customer Support system.You can send a ""Report"" to the company, but, the same people who are the game ""Devs"" will recieve it, reject your complaint, and then ask you to shell out more money for a Premium account.This game was a complete waste of time, and some money.The only good thing I found in this game was a Clan/Guild, that soon left the game due to Hackers, and the Devs that don't do anything about the Hackers, because they themselves are Hackers, and enjoy tormenting people in PvP with Invulnerable Characters, an are extremely abusive toward the Players.

												This game is one of the best F2P games I have ever played, and the biggest F2P game I have ever played.+The game world is huge. It spans over sectors and the overall map is bigger then triple A titles such as GTA V and Just Cause 2.+Character customisation. When you start the game you have the ability to change the appearance of your character, and during the game you can equip things that can add benefits and features, like dusters or combat suits.+Clans and teams. In game there is a team system that people can join into so that you can complete a mission together, and some missions require that. The team system also allows voice chat. There is also a clan system that works like normal, and the clan has a special ""clan vault"" that they can use.+Mega server. All players are on one server, but it works due to the map size.+Vehicles. The game has various mounts, such as horses and even giant mutated chickens, along with motorbikes, ATVs, dune buggys, and more.-Microtransactions. Since this is a free to play game, it is a given. You can buy almost any item in the game on their store. But I do not mind doing this from time to time, as I enjoy the game to the point that I want to support it.-Graphics. They aren't very good. Good news for people on lower end PCs like me, but for somebody running a machine that costs as much as a small family vehicle, not so much.-Voice acting. Barely any of it... at all. It is really BAD, it just isn't common.-Buggy. Some bugs will occur in the game, but there is usually a fix. Usually.TL;DR: This game is a pretty fun first person post apocalyptic online RPG. Possibly the only one of its kind. If you liked Fallout, you should try it out. If you hated Fallout, you. I reccomand this game for anyone, really. "

												I was a fanatic for this game, I couldn't get enough, clearly. It WAS a great game many years ago but as it was expanded and the combat system was changed several times the game became unbalanced with every change. The current build sytem defeats the purpose of builds since it's either one extreme or the other, no balance. PvP died several years ago due to all of this. So there was PvE for a while but the game went from 100's of players online @ all times to about 100 and it's down to about 50 or less, because most of the 50-75 online are AFK. PvP zones are dead, I should have quit several years ago, but I'm a diehard.  It's free to play but now ridiculous grinding to get the best weapons and armor to be able to duel. You'll need an overwhelming build just to compete. The game is nothing but CTF and duels between a few players that are playing some other game than what it was intended to be. You could check it out but don't expect it to be anything other than ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and grinding just to get the equipment and stats to compete with 2-5 players.  The game is dead, I'm not exagerating, it's on life support.It's pay to win but there's no reason to put any money into it, they're just sucking it dry before they shut it down.  Yes I'm still playing it sadly, haven't been able to find a game with the veteran community this game has. It's all about the nostalgia for me, kicks and giggles. I'll be playing until it's shut down, I'm an addict, I need help. :D			"

												A pretty damn good game. It doesn't have the best graphics, but it has a lot of content and has a nice atmosphere. You have plenty stuff to do and the maps are great. Wide open lands where you need pretty long to get across. You also have the possibility to teleport to certain points.Don't get irritated by it's bad reviewing quote, but many (kids/)players don't get the game and want fast action. Many of the young players are used to very low quality but fast action games like CoD, but this game has very much content and a pretty good quality. It just needs a little bit of time to get used to the game.			"

												Fallen Earth is an MMORPG that doesn't have a lot to offer in terms of combat, environments, mounts and interesting gear.NOTE: My character is only level 17 after the time that I've played. This review is based on my 56 hours total that I've played.Combat:Instead of doing the select and launch all nukes at highlighted targets you instead have an aiming system for the combat.This feels fresh at first as it hasn't been done an awful lot in MMORPGs to my knowledge, but the aiming isnt executed very well and doesn't go well together in combination with the rest of the combat.It feels out of place that you cant really dodge attacks in a system like this where moving and fighting can be done. Your enemies attacks can't miss you, but your attacks can miss them easily.There's three forms of combat weapons. You can use melee, pistols or rifles/shotguns. To be fair only melee and rifles are the most useful as pistols are in an awkward spot between melee and rifles. Theyre more efficient at close range since you can dual wield, but leave you vulnerable to groups of enemies. A melee type character as far as I'm aware of is usually build for that kindof combat and the rifles give you a safe way to play the game and pick off targets from a distance.The world and transport:The game's world is big, but empty. It has no interesting places to show off and the graphics aren't very pleasing either. I understand that this is supposed to be a post-apocalyptic setting but that doesn't mean everything in existance should not be very pleasing to the eye. The environments are already bland, empty and occasionally filled with resources and enemy mobs.The game offers you a two means of transport. You can either go on foot or use a mount. The mounts exist out of horses, quadbikes, motorcycles and cars. Mounts use their respective forms of fuel in order to travel. This makes it more attractive to take mounts that are more fuel efficient over any other mount that you'd actually prefer to use. Having to pay attention to how much ""fuel"" you have left and Quests:The majority of quests, if not all of them, are fetch quests or 'kill x amount of y'. Nothing interesting.Story:There isn't really a story except that you are a clone and thats very special and there  are a lot of factions who dislike eachother. The factions don't do much else as far as I'm aware. You can gain reputation with them but wether this will have some impact on the game isn't very clear. Also there isn't really a story line to follow as far as I'm aware.Dances:The dances are probably the only reason why some of my friends and I sticked to this game after the awful introduction. I wouldn't have played this on my own, now I think of it.Summary:Unsatisfying combat, bland environments, lack of interesting gear/loot and a terrifying amount of fetch quests make this game a boring experience. Looking back at it I don't understand why I even put this many hours into it.			"

												This game is great if you like fallout, crafting, and farming things. Its a great way to pass time waiting for Fallout 4. It gets alot of bad reviews from people who failed to understand its mechanics and give it the time needed, i think.  It is very complex, and takes a bit of effort to get into it, but if you dont give up on it and try to find your info, you will thrive even for free. The story is amazing, i dont like reading the ""quest text"" but in this game I do because it is actually interesting. People in the game are friendly and helpful. Its not the most populated MMO, which is a shame, but its a very good game if you like the theme. The map is huge, and even though most of it is quite plain, you keep running into interesting artifacts. In general, I do recommend this game to anyone who has atleast a bit of passion for post apo theme.			"

												With a story that was developed with obvious care, to the extent that character-respawning is one of the largest facets of the game, you can tell that this game had it's heart in the right place. This may seem like nonsense to you, but a lot of games out there these days simply tack on the story to the rest of the game, rather than the other way around (as it should).With a game like Fallen Earth, you can tell that the story came first, and everything else was built around there; from the architecture, weapons, vehicles, and equipment, it all makes sense within the setting. With the way the game's story is, there isn't the problem of ""when everyone in an MMO is the chosen character, no one is"", and the characters within the game treat you as a person and not The Big Cool Hero. Extremely refreshing.If that doesn't say anything, let me tell you something about my hours in this game (on the other version of Fallen Earth, as there are two in Steam, as for a little while FE wasn't on Steam): I have over 2000 hours in the game, a feat surpassed only by my GMOD hours.

												I played this game years ago and it was excellent. Crafting, questing, faction and clan PVP were all great. Not to mention the setting, massive world, rares, auction house, arena, and little out of the way places farther into the map that were just cool. Taking my interceptor for a spin and roaring past noobs on horses or swerving up and taking out some troll bullying noobs with the PVP setting on... Then the original developers sold it to the free to play people who started making drastic changes with minimal insight and ruined the whole thing. Then they built their F2P moneyfarm scheme on top and now you have the fallen earth mmorpg available to you today.			"

												At one point of Fallen Earth's lifespan it was truly a remarkable statement in an otherwise bland mix of MMO's. A massive open world with secrets not listed on the maps. And deadly creatures in every part of it. And the best part: No classes. You built your character EXACTLY how you wanted it, with almost no restrictions. The PvP aspect was mixed with several unique builds and players trying dozens of different ideas. The PvE had[well still has I suppose] hundreds, if not thousands, of quests to keep you occupied if that was your thing. Myself personally I enjoyed interacting with the market and just exploring the world. A truly open world with few restrictions.Today it's a shell of it's former pride. What once had potential to be an astounding example of how MMO's should be quickly became an example of what not to do. The company 'supporting' Fallen Earth has pretty much given up on doing anything with the game. And bugs/glitches now run rampant with no proper team to fix them any longer. The market's gone ballistic with duplicated items and the difference between who has something in game and who doesn't makes the social divide in our world look like nothing. I really wanted to believe, in the 7 years[as of writing] I had dedicated to this game, that the company supporting FE would've done something right. Kept telling myself it'll get better. But it seems all that GamersFirst can accomplish is letting a dying dog whine while it dies, and investing into products that aren't even half the quality this game was. It's honestly amazing this game company has stayed in the market for so damn long. But I guess stupid people will invest in stupid ideas, and a company of complete morons will continue 'developing' worthless products and letting them die once they've milked out every last dollar. I've seen better company response from EA when they were 'supporting' Star Wars Battlefront. Welp enough of that rant. Whoever reads this probably won't care about all that info really. So let's get into the Pros and Cons:Pros:-Massive world-Full control over character/class development. Build your class how you want to build it.[Ofc there's standard balances in place but overall the RPG builds you can accomplish here are pretty much limitless]-Lots of quests. Though many can get repetitive but they have to compromise somewhere. A few thousand unique quests would take a lot of resources to accomplish.-No Crafting limits. You see a shiny gun that someone else is donning you can build it. Every item besides microtransaction cosmetics are available to craft. It'll take time but the mounts/guns/armor/ etc etc. Can be assembled by you. Cons:-Lack Luster campaign. It's a vague story that just kind of throws you all over the place. But at the very least it explains character death and respawn in a moderately logical manner. So that's nice.-Factions you can choose from in-game mean literally nothing in terms of useful items/gear in the end-game. Only reason to choose a side is for PvP purposes really. Or if you like the lore and RP for it.-Community is almost non-existant.-End-Game is a dead end. Besides the almost non-existant PvP community once you reach the end that's it! -End-Game gear is a grind that's almost impossible due to a dead community. Acquiring the materials to build all the cool high end stuff is gonna cost you dearly. Or you're gonna spend hours on end acquiring it if you're lucky enough to find a few players willing to fight and gather the parts with you.-No support from the main publishers. Something goes wrong you're SoL.-Bugs and no pesticide to control them. There's bugs and glitches everywhere in the game and no developer in sight to fix it. Sorry kiddo~And for now that's it. So as a final word thanks to the orignal developers who did make this game. They did a damn good job and I really respect them having worked with them since the alpha stages. But as of today the game is simply a waste of time.			"

												First impressions:As you can see (at the time of writing), I haven't played the game much, as such I can only write about first impressions.Loading the game initially through steam, account setup is pretty basic (log in, verify e-mail, get to playing) except for one tiny detail... you can't choose your user name. The software generates a hash code for your name (around 20 characters in length including upper/lower case letters, numbers, and hyphens ( - ) ) and I have to say... the support team is *FAR* less than helpful (their response : we can't change unique user names)...Okay, let me rant a moment... so what they're saying is their programmers can't use SQL? Can't use PHP? Can't... um... access their OWN databases? I think not... I think someone is too lazy to correct their mistake. Log in with an e-mail because ""that's the username""... but tried logging in with my e-mail and it says ""invalid username"" but using the hash... all hunky dory.There, that's out of the way, let's get to the game itself and not the customer service.The game is old-school. The graphics sit somewhere between Fallout 2 and Fallout 3. The NPCs and ""Monsters"" are all standing around in one place, tethered to a spot (where they will chase after you for a predetermined distance before giving up and returning to their spawn) ~ a lot like EverQuest 1. The world itself is a little on the empty side, but I cannot honestly say if it remains this way (the internal zones and buildings are pretty cool, and for a game that is set in a wasted world, it's as desolate as it should be).The story-line is thoughtful and creative, even if it's a little flat and tired. It is interesting, it is engaging, it's just that it's a bit 'old.'The GMs are super helpful, and I've seen them online every time I've logged in. The help channel is busy, and responsive (I can't even begin to say how refreshing that is)! That said... they have the typical censored chat system that is pretty much par for the course... but don't bother censoring your own words (like: aw s*** that sucks) because a GM will threaten to mute you for language (a redundancy which borders on zealous). Hardly anything to complain about... keep it clean (and PG so you don't offend the super-innocent teenagers playing this game - note sarcasm).Movement is a bit cumbersome and unweildly ~ but once you're used to it it isn't too bad (such as hitting tab or the middle mouse button to turn on targeting, and therefore a locked mouselook instead of free-look). It's pretty hard to get the camera around front of your character (but it's entirely possible I've just overlooked something).Skills, stats, levelling, trades... a detailed system. A wonderfully detailed system. APs (which I may mistakenly believe to mean ""action points"") are granted frequently in small doses for everything from quest completion to simply levelling up your trade skills. Mousing over anything will give you a clear and detailed description of what that thing is for and what it does and what it effects - I've long desired that games did this, some do, but FE starts with this right out of the gate... they do NOT leave you in the dark (as long as you can read at a Junior High level, it's sweet).Questing is a bit weird to get used to - the map (okay, the map... WOW... if you like detailed maps that don't hold your hand, but make some pretty obvious markers... then this map system is for you - detail, detail, detail... easily one of the most beautiful map systems I've seen in a game in a LONG time)... anyway, the map... shows a little red X on your radar that when you mouse-over it will show you the name of the quest it's for. There are no indications of distance on the radar or for quests, and some quests are a bit ambiguous (really, they just don't hold your hand there - read it... then figure it out ya lazy bums)!Will I continue playing? You bet. What is the not free to play? Buying keys for dropped lockboxes. Unlocking your entire wardrobe. Paying for premium content (usually access to skills, timers, clothing, zones, etc) in three different monthly plans (from about $12 to $30), not so bad - but pretty steep considering you can get a great deal more out of a game like LotRO (Lord of the Rings Online) for about $15/month, with far better quality and content. Still, not too bad, save that it's comfortably on the expensive side (especially for what it is and offers).Do I recommend it? Yes. Get past the opening stuff. Put some points into Intelligence and Perception (both of those increase your maximums for tradeskills), and READ THE QUESTS.If you don't like reading, or actively engaging a game... this isn't for you. I, however, love reading the content in a game (I want to see what other writers and creative teams are doing with their work) and I enjoy a challenge. As such, I really enjoy this.In short, a rocky start, some negative experience with the customer service and GMs, a bit unweildly and old-school, and expensive beyond the F2P... but a game that grows on you quickly and really eats up time (that's a mark of a good game right there).Test it out. If you liked Fallout 2 and 3, then you'll probably enjoy this. I don't think it's a ""long term"" game (as far as playability) in my books, but that's simply my own opinion and nothing more. Plenty of players are really enjoying this game, and that speaks volumes about the overall content and quality.			"

												  First thing I have to say, if your a social gamer, then get this game. It's free to get. It's free play. Pretty much the only frustrating con to being a free player is having only one crafting queue slot and the 9 red chip (poker chips are currency and which you have white blue red and yellow chips) max. Do a couple free surveys and earn some GamersFirst credits and you can buy something cheap on the marketplace and get rid of the chip limit and up your crafting queue to like 4. Alright now that I got that out of the way lets see what's next. I guess I could talk about the game state as of these past couple of weeks. This is an older game. The graphics aren't the best. But I like them. It feels as though the game has died a little bit inside and there are actually times in which a town can be empty of players, beside the couple stragglers that leave their player online and craft (it's not required to do so but if you use a crafting accelerator item it is). This is no elses fault but of your own though. IF you play people will play more often.  I enjoy the crafting system if I may say so myself. You can pull up a window that has a neatly organized (well somewhat :P) list of everything you have learned to craft. Just click it then the ""craft"" button and it adds it to the crafting queue, as long as you have the required materials of course. Pretty much almost everything in the game has been crafted by another person. Whether it be vehicles or your favorite gun, or even that kebab that's been sitting in your inventory. Of course you get generated items through merchants or missions but this game allows for the better quality items to be instead crafted, thus relying on peoples ability to craft for a good economic system.   Lets see, what's another major characteristic about the game. Oh the pvp. Pvp/pve is pretty balanced throughout the game. Most places you are at are pve locations. There are locations that  are strictly PVP. You can turn on pvp and fight in pve areas. You can turn off PVP (has a timer buff as to keep people from shooting and switching) and not be bugged in PVE areas. You can also simply just choose to duel someone and lose at low hp without actually dieing. There is even a window to queue up for Blood SPorts pvp minigames.  Like I said this game is very social dependent to have fun, unless your one of those people who just like to be off in a secluded location and grind through all your levels. Which in that case you can do that to on here:P.  As said before the game is old , but in it's time it has made it very playable. It has it's bugs sure but what game doesn't. I barely see any of those ""hackers"" as kids like to call them nowadays. Most of time it's kiddie stuff like the auto bot script stuff.  I think that about sums up the major points of the game. I could go on more about it, just don't feel like it. :P I hope I have influenced atleast one more player to join. Could use a couple more newbies that I could pick on. "

												Fallen Earth is a post-apocalyptic game with sci-fi technology. It was released September 22, 2009 and with that said... Making a game with let's just go with a major title, CoD or Battlefield like graphics...It'd need a engine to process it and this is a game already finished. So the graphics are dated, even at it's highest setting can look like a mudded mess.You know what, no, no, I wanted to be a bit nice to this game. Look at my screenshots. The mane of my horse, a free mount is beyond s***. Hell my shadow while in first person is cut in half at the waist, and there's no first person animations what so ever. There are in third, but that is just horrid. If that isn't bad enough you get spells and skills like in World of Warcraft..I'm playing at max settings mind you. There are no animations, effects, nothing like that for anything you use in first person. So I don't know if I'm using a poison spell or a spell that s***s f***ing rainbows. Should I mention if I try to heal while in combat that I'll actually heal my enemy? WHAT!?! Oh yes, you have to TARGET yourself to HEAL yourself.This game is a hardcore knock off of Fallout 3 and New Vegas. The graphics are the same if not worse then both, huge lack of animations, glitches, and just awful, dreadfully poor, sloppy and LAZY design work. If that doesn't p*** you off then what about the fact you have to swap from mouse to aim every 2 minutes to click on a quest, item, object, whatever it be..Ending tutorials, etc.. Oh your mouse cursor is what they use as the game cursor. That's just f***ing pathetic work. Another fun thing is crafting, and timers. They haven't yet, but I'm damn sure a single timer can easily eventually be an hour if not longer. By the way you can only craft ONE, ONE ITEM AT A TIME IF you do not buy their stupid VIP. Want more, I've yet to go into PvP and frankly I don't think I want to with the other reviews I've read. Already see paid content is able to move ridiculously faster, and it seems at best if you don't pay for the game you're getting a horse. My mind is just blown. That's just mounts/vehicles...What about these keys and boxes and crap that give amazing gear you CANNOT GET ANYWHERE ELSE?! No. Just no. It figures, any title under ""GamersFirst"" is nothing but a pryamid scheme for your money. I'm dead serious too, look at APB: Reloaded and APB.Oh and the learning curve on this game might as well be a f***ing mountain flying in the air. If it wasn't for having looked at my keybinds, and even then I'd be having difficulty as hell. Don't forget, no animations, effects, etc. with most spells/skills/s***s/f***s I don't give about! The game is about you though and the other 20 or so people around, you died at the Hoover Dam and now you're a clone. Should I mention everyone here and everywhere else f***ing hates clones? You might as well be a Jew in NAZI Germany. Question, what game allows jumping that can't allow turning while in mid-air? Answer, Fallen Earth. S*** YOU NOT. The map could be really big, the thing is though... I DON'T HAVE THE F***ING ABILITY TO SCROLL AROUND THE MAP.3/10I will never recommend playing this game, even to see if it's really that bad. It's worse.			"

												I highly recommend Fallen Earth as a long time player I've seen this game go from greatness down to the mud and back again. The community is great and has a high loyal player base. No other game that I have ever played has brought me back to it as much as this one has. I see many negative reviews on this but if u notice their play time in game its less than 2hrs at most. Dont be fooled the game is even better with a low player count, it truly does give it that feeling of an apocalypse. Instead of running into someone every 2 secs considerably takes away the immersion of being a post apoclyptic game. I highly recommend this game, Join Royal Bloodline a noob helping clan.			"

												I looked at this game yesterday on steam and already knowing its an old game something inside of me told me to give it a try, its free, why not? I like MMO's after all..........My verdict after playing for just over an hour is that I don't regret downloading this game at all.It has every aspect of MMO's i enjoy and endless levels of character and clothing customisation. You even get to create your own vehicles which i haven't done yet because i'm just starting out, I did however get a horse to ride though.Set in a post apocalyptic world where you play as a clone, you set off on your own adventure. Making friends and enemies, it's up to you to fight, craft and survive the world before you.The tutorial may feel like a little bit of a drag but hang in there its a great game once you pass the tutorial, don't skip it though, there are a lot of useful tips and lessons to be learned here, skipping the tutorial will leave you feeling lost and puzzled whilst playing the actual game.Saw a few comments in the discussions of people complaining that the game was dead, not true, i've met plenty of people in my short play and even had a duel with one.I recommend this game. It's free, why not?			"

												Fallen Earth. A game based on around the Apocalypse in the year 2156. It's a cool concept and was definately in its own league when it was averaging in the thousands for players on daily login a few years ago.""Is this game like Fallout?"" No, they share the same genre. Nothing more. Fallen Earth tops Fallout when it comes to roleplaying and exploration. I've been playing this game for 6 years, I've still only achieved 25% of the achievements on Steam and still haven't found all the tourist spots. ""Is the game dead?"" Compared to its prime? Yes. I'd prefer the term ""quiet"" there's still a large number of people playing Fallen Earth in areas all over the game world. If anything, it adds to the genre of it being a post apocalyptic game with players being few and far between.This game is heavily based around crafting, as such the in game economy is subject to amazing highs and devastating lows. Inflation sets in, items you farmed for hours are worth nothing and that one item you kept hold of is worth a small fortune. Give or take a certain length of time it returns back to normal.The controls in this game leave a lot to be desired, it doesn't compare to your up to date MMORPG currently on the market, but that is not where this game is a powerhouse. It's not in PvP either.So what has this game got, that all other games on the market seem to lack? A social community. Fallen Earth was and is full of players who have roleplayed with one another and had a blast, those who have made clans numbering in the thousands for membership and those who organise fairs for everyone in the game to attend. So should you play this game? Yes. Don't expect the game to blow you away. The game is what you make it and for me it is not only a game that has allowed me to meet so many good people but also blow me away whenever I come back to it. The only way for us to get this game worked on again is to get enough players to come back so they will realised Fallen Earth should not be abandoned. The potential here is massive. Lets not waste it.			"

Product received for free
												There once was a good dev studio icarus who made this game, and they made it really well, the core game is awesome. Huge world to explore, somewhat interesting story, there's about 400 hrs of pve content, after that you'll ask yourself what's next? Well right now the answer is nothing, with population so low there's no pvp going on, which is actually really fun, even though hard to learn how to do it properly.   This game is not pay to win, I mean I really enjoyed game at first and bought steam package, I don't regret getting it, you can purchase subscription or buy tradeable premium for ingame currency, I bought a lof of them, I always had commander premium and it wasn't hard to earn enough game currency for it, there're multiple ways to make money in game, pve and pvp(but that's not the case now probably as population dropped heavily). I like the game so much that I would even pay for subscription anyway if not one but, and that's a big one, the G1, who bought the game doesn't develop it anymore, they keep 3 or 5 ppl on the staff and they do very little in game, it feels very abandoned. There's no anticheat and  there's also ways to dupe in game, they can't fix that, even though some dupers sent them mail telling how to fix it, but they didn't do anything.it's no longer an mmo, more like a bunch of ppl online, on top of that they downgraded their servers a few times, so there's much more lag, the content that G1 did is unfinished, and it's just a dead side of the map where nothing happens, they ruined the game and as long as they own it I can't recommend this game.

												Dig the game, but the shortcomings are a bit too many. The crafting system gets to be a bit unbalanced, and the length of time it takes to make things, can frankly put folks with jobs and real life responsibilities, off. Add in a slew of cash shop items that give you insane advantages, and you can begin to see the problem. This feels less like fallout, and more like a generic mmo with cash shop.			"

												Ok, so I've played this game for many years now (off and on), but I always seem to re-dowload and re-play. I've seen alot of negative reviews, and that's to be expected with any older game. Yes its buggy, yes its unpolished, no the story doesn't make the most sense, but none the less, it's a fun game and I've spent hundreds of hours playing it. I met a few great people playing it, whom I still keep in contact with. The game has so many features that are easily forgotten about when only focusing on the ""bad controls"" or ""glitchy water"" etc...The crafting is amazing, and you can build a character completely for crafting and most likely never be able to make everything yourself. The quests are fun, challenging most of the time, and the abundance of them is incredible! PVP is intense, hard to get used to, but very fun! And the maps are huge! with many different side-quests, areas, material deposits, hidden gems to find and waste tons of time on(Also hidden bosses all over), And vehicles...from horses to cars to quads and buggies and more! I once remember walking into a random cave in the middle of nowhere and ended up fighting a nest of spiders, followed by a giant Tarantula...all around, it's not the best game in the world, but if you like a steep learning curve and a game that's challenging, but also rewarding, try it out....It's free...play it, or delete it. Just put a few good solid hours in before you think it's a waste of time. Like I said, played for many years, and I always come back to it...			"

												I have plenty to say about this game. Some good, some bad.    For starters lets start with the story... there isnt one. Dont play this game if you like mmorpgs that have stories. Its just not there.  What story there is is poorly executed.  Having played on two different accounts and started in two different regions of the starter map, the story is boring.  Frankly I'm more intrigued in the happenings of each NPC settlement than the actual story of your individual character.    Next the world itself.  Be forwarned if you do not, and repeat DO NOT invest in any form of transportation (i.e faster horses and cars) you will not have a fun time.  It is a gigantic walking sim otherwise.  Other than that the world is freaking huge (clocked a 1.5 drive with a dune bug from zone 1 to zone 4 on a road)  There is plenty to do, plenty to mine, and plenty to kill.    There are a assortment of missions (will discuss details later) dotted all across the landscape.  And the landscape itself isnt  that much of an eyesore even at high settings.  But sometimes when traveling in a dungeon it seems it takes FOREVER just to reach the boss (which has been stated before in other reviews to be bullet sponges, which is very true.) So there are no real pros or cons with this.    Crafting is an interesting part of the game, though from when i first started has changed drastically when i first started this game.  When I first started as a free to play player, I could craft as much as i want without limits, although it has some flaws.  For instance if you ever wish to progress a specific skill some have to be bought if you cant make the skill book yourself, you must buy it with in game money.  Why gripe about this you wonder?  BECAUSE THE BOOKS ARE OVERPRICED AS HELL!  True you can grind for a couple hours and start selling stuff you get to get the money or make different stuff to sell at the auction house (I'll discus this later.)  And the process of leveling up each skill gets me the most.  You can craft the most difficult item or the most basic (to a cap) and you only get one skill point per item you craft for each specific crafting tree.  Another flaw was most likely implemented after I stopped playing the game for a while.  Right now for free2play players you can only craft a single item at a time, which was reallly frustrating for me since I started with being able to craft as many items as i wanted in a que.  Other than this the crafting system is engaging for those willing to spend time with it and most resources are easy to get.    Character creation isnt really that important but i will discuss it.  There is some variety in how you create your character, though it could have done a little better.  Combined with the crafting system you can make your character look pretty cool. Character progression is an entirely different story.  If you really want this game i will give you a few hints:      1) Invest in the mutations.  These mutations will help you greatly in pvp and pve combat, greatly increasing your chances of survival for your fellow players and killing your enimies.  Pick wisley though.  You either want to invest in crowd control and healing or full on offense with negative buffs.  never invest in both it will take forever to get anything useful.     2) invest in one and only one weapon skill.  As someone who tends to try to be a jack-of-all trades in mmos dont try to invest in multiple weopon skills (unless you really want to.) Pick one maybe two and stick with it becasue the stats of your weapon skills and another skill (i.e Rifle skill with precision skill)  determines your dmg ratio.    As for the skills themselves along with the mutation skills, there are way to many skills. Sure you have plenty of skill points to spend; ""the total amount your character can have spent on them level 55 is 1960 AP."" (febase.mmometaguide.com/ss-1/) However this would take forever.  My highest lvl character is 49 and that took the majority of hours i put into this game.  All in all character progression without the pay2win experience isnt worth for free2play players.  The community is a hard topic to describe.  It does have the common trolls and mean clans galore with a few diamonds in the rough.  The mass majority of players when i first strarted were some of the nicest perople i have ever met in any mmo experience.  I was in a really large clan that had four different offshoots coming from all six of the factions the game.  Of course this was my first experince. After my second go at the game the community had pummled down to nothing more than a bunch of trolls. Thats all I have to say about that.  The economy is my last subject.  The economy is by far the most annoying part of this game.  Unlike WOW which has a real fluctuating economy, Fallen Earths economy is set in stone and is overpirced.  For all the lowest tier items (scrap) they are expensive for a world that doesnt genrate money for loot on hostile NPCs. Unless you grind for hours like i did and make and sell a whole bunch of loot and items you will be poor as the bum that lives on your nearest street corner. Also beware for those who do join or make a clan, protect your clan vault as if it were your most important valuable in your life.  I have heard countless stories of clan members stealing huge stacks of loot, materials, and thousands of in game money and leaving the clan.  Although unimportant to the economy it had to be said.  A final note, the auction house is a joke.  There are obvious players being trolls trying to sell a rare item (mind you for only a single piece) at a unreasonably high amount of chips (in game money.) Though there are some reasonable people like myself who focus on creating stuff or collecting loot to get our wealth by actually being fair in our prices in the auction house.All in all Fallen Earth is a below average mmo as it stands right now.  There are some bugs here and there, but they do a good job at fixing them.  The graphics are mediocre at best and the progression is skewed by the common pay2win in most free2plays.			"

												Fallen Earth was my favourite MMORPG. But it's way to old, pay-to-win and unsupported now. The 6-faction PVP, no classes, super-deep crafting, horses and vehicles, wide open world, and best of all free aim made is awesome for its time. Too weird that the developing company went bankrupt after making the best MMORPG!Show me another open world, free aim MMORPG when you can take long-range sniper rifle headshots from horseback or gun down your foes with a submachine gun while zooming past on the motorbike you just crafted...We NEED Fallen Earth II, but it's not coming. The first game is just old and empty now...			"

												While playing FE, it truely does bring on the feeling of being in a post apocalyptic world. Not because the game is immersive and sucks you in, but due to the lack of a decent player base. 20-30 players online overnight and 50-75+ players at peak times. (US time)""It's dead Jim"" Twice a week they have maintenance, and occasionally they will ban a few exploiters. But, that's as far as Gamers First gets involved. They are hoping some other company comes along and buys the game. The only reason they have the game is because it was a package deal when they bought APB.There are no updates, improvements, or anything along those lines. Regarding the exploiters: For some reason, GF fails to fix the issues, and the people they ban, just make new accounts (rerolls) and they continue to do what they do. So you get a jacked up economy in return. Mostly everything is way overpriced in the auction house. In retrospect, if you spend $10-$20 on credits and buy items from their online store to sell in game, you'll have more than enough currency(chips) to last until you quit or get bored. I was up to almost 90 million in chips before I decided to go crazy and buy whatever I wanted, all four of my toons have wardrobe unlocks, filled with various types of vehicles,costumes,ect...and my highest toon is only level 28.(55 is the highest level)The game does have a decent crafting system, and this is where it pays to be a subscriber. Upon being a sub, your crafting Queue goes up to 20 slots, instead of 3 for freemiums (meaning they bought at least one item from the cash shop), and only 1 slot for f2p. But if crafting isn't your thing, then there really is no reason to sub. PvP in FE is mainly at level 55. Ya, sure, you can ask someone for a duel before you reach that level, or go wonder into one of the pvp zones and hope someone shows up. Other than that, there's just not enough people leveling up to get in some proper pvp pre 55.Leveling up can be achieved a few various ways. You can play the game normally, going town to town doing quests,killing mobs. You can craft, but I don't recommend this way to gain xp, very slow. Then there are a few spots that give good xp if your goal is to hit level 55 a.s.a.p. (plenty of guides on the net on where to go and what to kill)There is no steap learning curve when it comes to FE,  that other reviewer is full of it. Or maybe I'm just to old to think there is one. You kill stuff, collect stuff, go from A to B, and then on to C.Do I recommend you play this game? Well, if your playing on an old crappy pc such as I and your options are limited, or if your looking for something to do to kill some time, then sure, you may like the game enough to stick around. If your pc is newer and far better, then I suggest you play many of the other newer games out there.			"

												All this game has going for it is its setting. Everything else is quite barebones. The survivor settlements aren't interesting, the combat engine is boring mmo combat that tries to hide in FPS combat's trousers, the missions are mostly fetch quests and now it also has a bunch of free to play micro-transactions that really don't make it any better. I was really excited for this when it got announced, I wanted a true post-apocalyptic MMO, sadly, this is just not it.			"

												I love this game, and always have. Unfortuantely, Gamersfirst has abandoned it.  No support.  No GMs ever online.  Rarely is a Hazmat (think player guide) on.  The community that is left is very helpful and all, but it's dying.  The only real grouping that goes on is at 55 to run the same content over and over because there has been no new content.  Gamersfirst is just milking this game for whatever money they can get out of it.  I still enjoy it, and I subscribe at the commander level, but I'm one of the few.  Most people want to buy the premium subs with game money.  I could be filthy rich in game, but I am not inclined to spend all that money providing premium to people who are too lazy or inept to find a way to make $10 and pay for it themselves.Anywho, if you want to play for free, go for it.  There are a lot of benefits to subscribing, but I don't recommend it for most.  Its a dead game, and the only question in my mind right now is when will GamersFirst pull the plug.Edit:  I noticed a lot of people talking about bugs.  I don't know what they're smoking.  Either they have a crap computer, or they don't know what they're doing.  I have run into maybe 2 quests I could not complete in 34 levels.  The game works very well, and unless you're running a 10+ year old computer, it is visually appealing.			"

												Feels like an old school MMO. More social based with laid back gameplay.Good enviroment, captures the feeling of a wastland. Older graphics that still hold up, as we know graphics aren't everything, and runs well on older machines. That said, PvE is very simplistic. Plays as a very basic FPS. I'm not a PvPer. If that is your cup of tea, there does seem to be many active PvPer in the game.Crafting is a lot like Star Wars Galaxies, in the sense that most everything is player made. Player driven economy. Unlike Star Wars Galaxies, it is also very simplistic. Gather materials, click button, wait until done. No different qualities of materials, or experimenting on items, all gear is the same. (I use SWG as an example, as I think it had the best crafting that hasn't been matched yet in a MMO, IMHO) If you plan on making all your own gear, prepare to level slowly, as crafting take a longer time to keep up to date.Fair free to play model. Pay to unlock cosmetic options or xp boosts, nothing really game changing sold in the shop.			"

												I enjoyed Fallen Earth, but there is a lot to this game that makes me cringe.The crafting times get ridiculous, you don't get much help from the Help chat (if anything you just get extremely annoyed by the noobs asking how to ride a horse), the GM's act like punks as well as most other players, some enemies might be a little overpowered and may require you to bring friends, which are hard to acquire if you aren't lucky, and I guess you're not allowed to hold a ton of chips on hand...? I dunno, I had red chips in the mail and some on hand, but couldn't collect them. It's been a while since I played, so I don't remember everything, but I think I had to get premium to hold more or something like that.It's not all that bad, though. It's good for an apocolypse game that comes with good ideas for character builds and such. I like that you can craft pretty much everything you need, but some materials are extremely hard to get, and as I said beore, the crafting times are crazy.FE is basically an apocolyptic World of Warcraft. Obviously not as big, popular, or 'fixed'. 7/10 in my opinion to say the least.			"

												Well, despite the fact I have 101.9 hours playing this game on Steam, I am a veteran that played it almost 2-3 years, when it became F2P (yes, this game was once paid), stopped for a period of 5 years, and came back to play again. So my review will have lots of comparisons with the former years I've played.Long story short: Actual state of the game is almost --dead--. No other word to define it. Few players (barely 60-70), counting with the newer players that come slowly in numbers. The peak number of players, I suppose, never reached 200 or maybe 250. You will understand that this number is important when you know the HUGE extension of map.I will now point the most important details that will explain my veredict:OBS.: It is a HUGE text with plenty of details. You were warned.1. Features and GameplayFallen Earth implements very nice features, specially in terms of crafting and item reuse in crafting, that means, sometimes you need a specific craftable item to craft a better one. So, you won't waste a ton of items just to grind th hell of your crafting skill and throw away all♥♥♥♥♥♥you built to the air as it wasn't important. It was (when there was a handful of players around), now it is NOT anymore.Gameplay is still kinda robotic, with some need for grinding. Yeah, it is not a freaking grind, because there are plenty of missions, and most of them, are related OR with the linear storyline, or with a sidestory that reflects one specific situation, like, the reason of a decaying state of a city, per example. So you don't need to kill thousands of mutants to just earn levels. Just do the missions.The need of teamwork only is vital on the last level (55) when you reach a region called Alpha County, where the mobs are very difficult to beat alone, specially if you're a full crafter. On some middle-level bosses there is also one need of teamwork, but mainly, after you reach 55. And it has no meaning because the missions in Aplha County give mostly chips (ingame money), experience (that you won't need as you've reached the cap) and, a few of those missions, faction reputation. So, in a basis, no one does those missions because there is no need to do so.2. MissionsAs I've said, the missions are quite well made, and have some history behind (some of them). But indeed they're very straightforward (kill x wolves, collect y materials, destroy z element). There are no puzzles, nothing that could difficult the conclusion of a mission except for one or another boss that has a big pool of health and so you need some friends to finish it. Apart from that, easy missions, nothing spectacular, nothing puzzling. Just normal missions that follows one sidestory or the main storyline.The only exception are the Defense Towns, where there is a mission to maintain one player-built town (it has 4 in total in game) and, from time to time, a big raid distributed in various waves appear to storm this city. The mission asks you and the other players to defend the town and counter this raid. Remember teamwork? If you don't have it, you lose the city, the city that you and other players built, and can rebuild again if lose. Why that? What's the advantage? Resource nodes around the town, plenty of them appears depending on which buildings were constructed. Trust me, it worths.3. CraftingHere is the jewel of the game, and I really thumbs up for this. The game has a complex crafting system, where you have a wide range of melee weapons (hammers, pickaxes, slesgehammers and even a big bar with a 40kg weight), ranged weapons (pistols, revolvers, rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers), various armors and clothes, food and drink, buildings (generally temporary, except from Defense Town buildings), vehicles parts and vehicles assemble, live mounts (horses and wolves), medicine items, poisons, grenades, bombs. The variety is damn extensive, and everything has its purpose: help you against the dangers of the Wastes (including other players). Full crafters have some fun unlocking complex recipes and distribute the products for your clanmates or the open market (Auction house), and this is one thing Fallen Earth still maintains on a positive stats.4. PvPThe PvP on this game has a freaking damn potential, because it is firmed in one thing: the Faction Wheel. First things first: on a determined level, you need to choose a faction. There are six, i won't go into details, but if you choose one, you start to build some reputation with the faction (throught certain missions) you chose mainly, and with two other factions on a lower basis. On the other side, the other three becomes your enemies (your reputation with them diminshes on the same amount you earn for your faction and allies). Inside the huge territory of FE, there are PvP areas with outposts or keeps, where a faction that takes control of that keep, rules the area, and has some benefits, including special resource nodes and the option to lay down harvesters (resource drillers). When the game had a big amount of active players (5 years ago), the fight for power was so imense AND insane, that keeps and fortresses normally were conquered and reconquered within one or two hours (counting that it has 45 minutes of immunity after it is capped). The actual state of PvP is ♥♥♥♥♥♥, because there are not enough players to maintain an all-out war or a domination war over the PvP areas. You even find one or other flag caps, but nothing near the PvP state of 5 years ago.5. The company (Gamers First)I could say a bunch of bad things about G1, because, there are mostly only bad things about them related to FE. Suffice to say, when G1 bought FE from Reloaded Productions/Icarus Studios and changed the business model to F2P, a massive number of players quit the game on the next weeks, they knew what exactly would happen with the game, even with the fact Reloaded team would keep working on the game changes and new expansions. G1's legacy in turn one succesful game in♥♥♥♥♥♥is long and bold. Just ask the players of APB: Reloaded how the game is now. FE isn't an exception: the only news we, FE players, see are the Subscribers Rewards every month, mostly. Fallen Earth became, for G1, another reasonable source of money from subs, veteran players who still manage to like the game despite the lack of improvement over the years (only one new map expansion, a few new vehicles and gear and a new PvE coop mode called The Dome, all this in 5 years ... FIVE YEARS!!!!). What I could say to G1?? Follow the example of Keen Software House and ""Space Engineers"" game title. One update every week, either bug fixings or new improvements, EVERY WEEK FOR BLESSED 1 and 1/2 YEARS!!ConclusionI'd say, if you want one good experience of free open world game, you can even try Fallen Earth. It is a nice experience. You can still get addicted, but BE SURE that the end game, from the day of that review, is frustrating. To be very honest, the word that resumes all my experience from 5 years ago and now is this: frustration. But well, I have friends on this game, so that's why I still play. And the game has some nice features (thanks to Icarus Studios) I do study to develop something similar, so that's why I play. But, after all, considering the whole product and its actual state, I do NOT recommend the game.			"

												I truly want to like this game. It is a post-apocalyptic MMORPG, reminiscent of Mad Max but with a much greater technological and traditional science fiction slant. It is an FPS, with a proper akimbo system and a good variety of firearms. It has delightful melee weaponry in all the flavors one would expect and desire from such a game. The landmarks of classic MMORPG gameplay are all there: mobs, crafting, looting, harvesting, and all the economic factors that come with them. On paper, it is the MMORPG of my dreams, and years ago it was probably up to the task of meeting my dreams fabulously.Unfortunately, it seems someone forgot about it. Development has stagnated almost completely, its team brutally eviscerated and scattered in the desert. It has aged as well as tropical fruit on the windowsill, no longer pleasing to the senses. The combat is flat, awkward, and crippled by latency issues. Performance is what you would typically expect from an MMORPG, but with some inexplicable stutters and framerate drops that you would not (given the level of visual flair and fidelity). There is an option for Advanced Post FX which is apparently vaseline on the viewport that destroys what little definition and detail the game actually has.In essence, it has all the ingredients of a fantastic MMORPG and may very well have been one at some point in time, full of promise and ambition. It's such a shame that it has aged so poorly, received little in the way of meaningful updates in the past few years, and seems to embrace a trend of short-lived fascination for new players and long-term disappointment for veterans. It achieves the goal of feeling desolate and abandoned - as all wastelands should - but not in the way that makes a game something one looks forward to jumping into; instead, it feels like one that everyone is quite eager to jump out of, and justifiably so.

												For a F2P (yes you can totally play without spending a cent) it has to be one of the best MMORPG's.The in-game community is great, very helpful, there are ALOT of newbies so as far as i'm concerned the game is far from dead.Sure graphics are dated but graphics don't make a game, gameplay makes a game and this has plenty of that.Love the crafting and customisation and the fact you can't just wade into a mob of enemies 20 lvls above you with a bat and come out smelling like roses.Totally worth it.

												OMG This game had the potential to be great, not good but GREAT! As usual they are out for money, but they don't care about their customers. Features are there but due to the bugs are unusable and do not get fixed. The customer service either is incompetant or just unwilling to help with some issues and that makes the game not worth anyone's money let alone time. The crafting is good except for the time to craft gets very bad. Grouping and their maping system is terribly executed and still not fixed. MOBs are everywhere including areas that do not need it but in areas you would expect it, it is empty. it is a game that you can play and reach max level really quick if you want. No real story and some quests are terrible while others are set perfectly without any rhyme or reason. Tradeskills are about 90% to where they need to be but better than most other games out there. Storage is okay but needs more upgradablity.Help channel is okay but don't bother trying to talk to the GMs about anything because they really don't care and would rather help their friends not you.

												Fallen Earth isn't the most polished game out there, but hey, it's free, so what do you expect? Okay, so the interface and AI are pretty clunky and without buying premium you're limited to certain items, levels, etc...Despite these cons, Fallen Earth is surprisingly fun and immersive. The ability to do basically whatever you want, be it quest, scavenge, grind, or fight other players in PvP, is what makes Fallen Earth so addicting. No matter your level there is always something to do or something new to discover. Heck, even though I have 150+ hours into this game I'm still questing in the first sector and I'm barely past Level 19. This shows how much there is to do.Overall, I would recommend this game to someone who is patient enough to get used to the clunky UI and look past the cons of this game. It's not your typical plug-n-play shooter types, and that's what I love about this game. Plus, it's free, and for $0.00 this is one hell of an escape.9/10, -1 for cons mentioned above			"

A lot of EULAs which activate every time I launch the game.3.♥♥♥♥♥♥graphics and animations. I know the game is old, but for ♥♥♥♥s sake refresh it from time to time. If modders can do it, so can you.4. Character customization unacceptable. Not enough options to choose from, and existing ones are fugly.5.

Everything could be and was intergrated into a single mode and nobody should have to ♥♥♥♥ing switch it. UI layouts are kind of neat, but god damn hard to access with those camera and mouse modes.

												Amazing for a f2p game, the feeling of getting your first actual gun is like getting your first helmet in WoW back in vanilla. The mount system isn't perfect, but is deffinately above par. The crafting system is actually really fun to grind for, and the actual explorable world is massive, none of it feels like blank space inbetween more detailed areas. PvP sounds like it would be a♥♥♥♥♥♥show, but is actually fairly balanced. Auction house system is deffinately well thought through. Although there are immense amounts of weapons, none of them feel useless or like filler. Quests are actually fun and have some difficulty. There is always someone friendly at the beginner town who would gladly accept help or offer it themselves. Combat is okay, nothing to write home about.			"

												 Most people will look at this game and say ""Ugh, looks old"", or they will look at the reviews and go ""Oh, Mixed."" And leave the page, i am here to tell you that this game is VERY worth your time.Most people want straight statistics so here they are:Pros:A fallout style world with an incredible amount of things to explore.A decent combat systems with hundreds of skills and almost THOUSANDS of weapons you can craft, find or buy.A BEYOND enormous map with hundreds upon hundreds of different types of enemies to kill.A brilliant scavenging system, you can find piles of all types of junk, plants, and graves all around the map, all are lootable and all have a wide variation of items.A fairly decent storyline, the likes of which you won't find in many other games.Cons:A pretty dead PVP system, there are still some who play this, but good luck finding a PVP match, and if you do, you will get destroyed by high-level people.....that's pretty much it.I know i make this game sound amazing, that's because it is, if you look past the SLIGHTLY dated graphics for an mmo, (Even now they are pretty damn decent.) If you look past the lack of people, this is still a brilliant mmo to play, and even today you will find massive enjoyment from it.			"

But then I ran into delema's with the main story where you are not a single man army.  This game will probably be more fun if you work in packs or join a guild,  Also, this game isn't free if you, it's just got a free mode that used to be sweet.  It still is sweet, but a sometime after the release of the free edition, they removed the ability to have craft ques for free players.			"

But it is abandoned by developers, thus doesn't have lots of players.You can still play it as PvE and have lots of fun. But if you are thinking about getting into PvP, it is Pay to Win as hell. And you will have some trouble finding opponents, as there aren't so many players around.			"

												Pretty good game with very rich and rewarding crafting system. The world is VERY big (I don't know if it really is 1000 square kilometers, but if the other sectors are as big as the first one that's possible) and it rewards players for wandering in the wasteland by the form of resources laying around. The music is moody and a bit of melancholic. The gunplay is fairly good and requires a bit of skill. Although many zones are empty and there aren't many players, the game still feels good. But the game is harsh for new players and it doesn't really explain anything in the beginning. The world definitely sucks you in and the crafting system is so rich and interesting with lots of customization options and a lot of gear to made... The game is good overall and I like it. And it's relaxing to just wander in the vast emptiness of the desert on your own, just you and your horse (the atmosphere, if anything, is pretty solid and gives the player the feel of a dying world)...

Than some staff quit and the game was given to a different company, they dumbed it down in my opinion, skillset combinations became simplified and not as exciting or interesting as they were previously which in the short run made me quit.If they brought back the original way skills were I'd probably play again but I know that will never happen just like me giving my money to this game will never happen.Thumbs up for the original Fallen Earth, thumbs down for what it is now.

												I consider myself very discerning when it comes to games. I don't play very many, but the ones I do play I tend to play a lot. More often than not I'll find myself getting bored of whatever game I'm trying out within the first few hours. I decided to try this game out and take a chance on the mixed reviews after seeing it on Steam many many times. At 30 hours in I can safely say I'm hooked. The crafting system really is AMAZING. Potions, poisons, medical kits, weapons, armors, clothing, dyes, VEHICLES (including but not limited to motorcycles, ATV's, cars, trucks), and you can craft create temporary building and camps. That's just a small portion of it.Skill system is easy to use and straight forward, combat is familiar and was easy to transition to, not sure what else I can say. On the negative side, the game world coudl use some more clutter. Wandering around the map feels quite barren. And the server downtimes need to be addressed. This is killing this game for me despite all the great potential it has. I've been playing it for 5 days and the servers have gone down for 1 hour intervals at least 3 times and has gone down for extended intervals on anther two seperate occasions. This is on top of regular maintenance. This needs to be fixed ASAP. Despite this I'll give this game a positive review and recommend it assuming this one huge issue will be fixed ASAP			"

												Updated : 8/18/15Currently the game has undergone large changes to the combat system (Skills and Mutations mainly) which gives far more choices for character builds. Previously there were skills, and mutations, that were not worth taking for any given reason. This isn't the case anymore.Missions beyond Sector 1 are terrible unless unlocking vanity items or social boosting items, you're better off spending your time killing NPCs that give the best XP for the least effort (rats for example) because the Devs are most likely never going to fix this issue.The ""story"" within the missions is still good, but you will feel cheated after completing a 5 hour long quest that you could have earned 30x the experience along with 20x the profit/reward.Weapon choices for PVP will feel very ""one sided"" in 1v1. I recommend not going ""Rifle"" if you plan to fight 1v1 in PVP. In Group fights is where it shines, I strongly recommend avoiding Assault or Battle Rifles at level 55.Lack of updates since the previous major update (8/1/2014) beyond increasing ""Dome Tokens"" have lead to a heavy decline in population. DO NOT EXPECT THIS GAME TO HAVE REGULAR UPDATES, the Devs are depressing when it comes to this. Not to mention never finishing projects completely... they simply move on to the next ""big"" project.Examples : Terminal Woods, Alpha, TC, and Dome, None of these are ""finished"", just ""acceptable"".If you plan to get to end-game, ignore ALL previous weapons/armor at 55. As there is no progression into the newer armors, it is best to save all your chips/DT for the AP weapons and GT Armor since they are the same price or lower than the previous armors.DO NOT EXPECT TO NOT DIE TO SOMEONE WITHIN YOUR FACTION IN PVP : It is intended through lore and mechanically for your own faction to beable to kill you in PVP, this is indeed a wasteland and should be treated as such.THERE IS NO GROUP CONTENT WORTH DOING IN THIS GAME : It is nice to bring a friend, but don't expect to find some amazing place for your 8-32+ group that's challenging... let alone rewarding :(I only play now to help others learn the game, kill rerollers (those who remake after previous bans), and PVP if there is any.While the game is old, it is limited by F2P standards I would recommend it for a game to play if you enjoy MMOs, crafting, and of course PVP. Only downside, don't expect to master 1 skill, it's better to be great all across the board on skills to give yourself the best advantage in PVP at least.			"

My absolute favorite MMO of all time.• Great, atmospheric game with a deep skill tree and well-developed lore and setting.• Amazing, yet sadly both tiny and dwindling community.• A lot of early-game variety and content.Words can not describe how much it sadness me - to see this game being run into the ground by halfarsed development and terrible support, both in-game and on their website - but maybe my playtime can. I spent almost 9000 hours, watching Gamersfirst transform this amazing game into something much, much lesser. From the updates that only implemented lackluster “new” content, which always boiled down to nothing more than a few reskins and a single set of entirely balance-breaking new gear. To the GMs that seem more interested in harassing players for personal amusement than actually assisting anyone. To the glaring glitches and exploits that were ignored rather than fixed - the game’s economy has been entirely broken by cheaters.To the fact that the game has not received neither update nor patch in over two years.At this point, I would say that it seems to have been abandoned, but their cash shop is still up and running - for anyone brave (or possibly just ignorant) enough to utilize it.In closing, Fallen Earth is a truly amazing game with an even more amazing, overbearing community - but also impossible to recommend, due to the incredibly shady company behind.

												Even after many years, I still reccomend this game as a F2P title.  For free, you get access to pretty much everything.  Really, the only thing extra you that is worth a damn as a paying customer is the extra xp gain.  Leveling is quite tedious and slow.  So if you don't know anything about FE then here we go:  FE is a post apocalyptic MMORPG developed by Reloaded.  I think the original developers went bankrupt shortly after the release of FE like 6 years ago and Reloaded picked it up.   FE survived for awhile but the player base quickly diminished.  This is due to a few factors.  Rampant hacking in PVP and a poor interface and content supply.  PVP hacking is something I personally have never experienced because I never pvp.  To PVP, you must go to a specified area.  Apparently there are aimbot hacks used there that give hackers an easy 1 shot kill to the head.  Since this is a skill based game which active targeting, you can see why players are angry with this.  The developers have shown to not care at this point and just allow it.FE is on life support at this point but still a playable game.  People are obviously still pumping the publisher with revenue and some people even have a $30/month subscription.  The combat is FE is very active and somewhat exciting because you have to aim at the head to do maximum damage.  I think full loot PVP would be an even better addition to this but it'll never happen.  The developers barely push out content and i think the last major content update was 3 years ago.  So, the publisher is just milking this game for whatever is left, like a vulture.  Still a good game to waste some time in.Here is my review from 2015

												Fallen earth really was a surprise for me. Ive been playing for around a year now on the standard client and I can't say enough about this game. Switching over to steam client version was perfect for sharing moments with friends. I am really having a blast playing it right now. Steep learning curve keeps a lot of the 'usual' mmo crowd out. This I like! Huge open sandbox world. Think I read over 5,500 quests and 11,000 square miles of area? MASSIVE!The game has some amazing developers under its wing too. They are trying to improve the game daily with small updates, bug fixes and is one of the minor few games which takes community thoughts and feelings into persepctive.Great community and if you get stuck or need a friend to help there are help chats, auctions, private chats & town chats (In-game!)Class-less characters to play as you wish and 6 factions and the factions are not all against each other but have their enemies, arch enemy, and allies among those 6. The character design feature is superb also! Very open and user friendly.The graphics and model designs are not the best in quality terms but its not about the graphics on Fallen earth. The quests and community is the main focus in my opnion; which is great! Got a nice mix of PvE and PvP. PvP in certain areas as well as conflict towns in the higher zones.Concluding, Fallen Earth is a great game if you have a varied lifestyle with a couple of hours every week to login and play. System specs are a little high but this keeps the younger generations away, A more adult style game. Worth a try! (4 Stars)			"

												Fallen earth is a great game that has a larger then most like learning curve,and that's most likley why it gets bad reviews. For being 7 years old and has no Dev support for the last couple. I still have a lot of fun running around the wastelands.It's crafting system is one of the best I have ever  come across in any other MMO, only one better is SWG. I would recommend this game over many of the new trash cookie cutter WOW clones that have been coming out lately.			"

												A post-apocalyptic MMORPG with a steep learning curve (Definitely not for the impatient).Once you get the hang of the mechanics, it is easily one of the best post-apocalyptic games (eh, is there even another post-apocalyptic MMORPG?)The game offers a huge♥♥♥♥♥map for players to explore and a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of items (I think there're like at least 500+ items), but the game could be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to non-premium players (e.g. the crafting system is very unfavorable to F2P players and certain items, mostly cosmetic, are available to P2P only )But still, it is a pretty decent game. 6.8/10p.s. I am writing this for my Steam community badge, I love dem badges.			"

												You like:- complex crafting- open worlds- classless character progression- postapocalyptic setting- manual targetingYou don't expect:- a very colorful cheerful game- a set on rails progression- next-gen graphicsIf this fits to what you like, then you will most likely like this game. The crafting is great, the graphics are in some ways not so good (character animations), in some ways average (character models), in some ways really nice (for example having a huge view over the open landscape during a sunset).It's definately not for everyone, but I enjoyed it a lot and played it a lot. The community is friendly and helpful too. There are a lot of factions, an ongoing storyline, and you often have ""what is behind that hill"" moments. And Fallen Earth lets you find out what is behind that hill. There are no invisible walls (except that you can't enter water, of which there is not much to begin with).I think the game is very relaxing, when you ride over the open landscape and look forward to have your next crafting items finished (crafting can be done while you are offline or doing other stuff), and at times intense, when you are stuck in a cave full of spiders and slowly running out of ammo.

												I'm really suprised this game has a mixed rating, because it's a very good one! This game isn't for who are looking a good graphics, it is focused on gameplay, interaction and etc... I really don't like RPG games for true. I like games like Gta, but somehow, this game made me be curious and i really decided to download it, and see what would happen. In first minutes, you don't have any clue, any idea of what you have to do and this is the part where a lot of players give up to the game, because almost no one'll help you thought your adventures. You have to have patience, this is the best part of the game. You will be discovering new stuffs, new things to collect, new NPC'S by yourself. The is game is fully of players in almost every part of the map. You have an unexplainable freedom to do whatever you want, and you can do the quest any time you wish. The main thing that made me like this game, is the fact you can have a bike, a car or a horse. there's a good number of vehicles, Atv's and etc.. You can repair your vehicles, paint them, you have to feed your horse, youo have a garage. You can trade your stuf with players or sel them to some specific NPC'S. You'll be playing GTA and dark souls at same time, because this game is very hard.Why this is a very good game: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*** YOU WON'T LOOSE ANY OF YOUR VEHICLES, ITENS OR WEAPONS IF YOU DIE AT ANY PLACE OF THE GAME. *******- If you die, you won't need to walk hundred of kilometers to pick up you vehicle again. There are some bases near some quest places you can spawn, and you can take your vehicle back easily where you left before be killed.- Wasn't made for who is looking for a good graphics game. Fallen Earth, is focused on gameplay.- Unexplainable freedom.- It's a very hard game, you must have patience and sense of exploration, or you'll give up easily.- You can play GTA and Dark Sould at same time, choosing if you want to be a casual player, or a high level monster killer.- You can fight against other players, while defending or invading a base.- You can craft a lot of stuff, since a simple clothes or even an expensive car.- You can scavenge stuffs.- You can do some quests that require a higher level, but of course, you'll die easily.- Very good interaction.- You have a lot of skills to improve. Also, you'll earn XP points, and you can spend it upgrading your skills.There's a lot of things, but you need to play a lot of time to find out. This is just a 1000 square kilometers map!			"

												Aside from the clunky controls, the odd but fun (not modern) gameplay (ragdoll physics, actual aim, decent graphics,...), this game is probably the best free to play 'fallout-ish' game I can recommend to anyone. The core apocalyptic elements are present and the game works the best as it is. Give this a try, it's free after all.			"

												So, I have 1,000 hours in this game. Frist off, yes this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥But that is because it is old. If you prefer the feel of older game engines and gameplay over the current stream of games coming out that all feel like they where built with the exact same philosophy by people who all graduated from the same college courses, then this game is for you.Fallen Earth has a dry and crunchy feel to it, especially at lower levels. It's nothing like today's games that all have a bit of a wet and polished feel to them.You have to get into the story and you have to have some of your own imagination to enjoy it. This isn't Call of Duty where you can log on and have instant, fast paced fun after a short que time. If you want fun you have to travel far and explore the nooks and crannies of the game world to find it.I like oddities, and this game has plenty of them. From pets to rarely visited corners of the map, this is a playspace not a themepark. It's up to you and maybe some friends to find the enjoyment in it.			"

												The microtransactions are unbecoming. The community is mixed, some trolls some helpful, and the gm's, on average, are over zealous. I had some fun while playing, but making a purchase is the only reason it was playable. I have an acquaintence who RP's and they really enjoy the game and has made no purchases, however, they recieved the perks of males being nice to a female. While I know what it is now, and I wouldn't waste the space on my drive knowing what I know, I'd still suggest that if you're curious find out for yourself.*Update: My characters have been deleted while that could be due to inactivity my g1c purchases are forever gone. Caveat emptor I found out about the missing characters when I logged in on my female acquaintance's PC.			"

												Fallen Earth is a very fun and unique game, it has a lot of features such as mining rocks and scavaging in rubbish piles...with the copper you mine from rocks you can craft into bullets. You can also  lvl up  geometry skill which will allow you to mine higher lvl rocks and get more resorces from them, as far as pvp goes i have yet to try it out. I find that melee is a good skill to start lvling up right away because it can become handy later on, also the quest system is nice filled with different varieties and you never feel as if you have done the same quest more that twice.The map is HUGE and would take hours to explore and going out past a certain point you will find that enemies will get tougher very quickly which will force you to lvl up before exploring more which is good because when you die from a hard enemy and then go lvl up a little bit when you go back to that same enemy you feel like you are getting stronger and making progress towards you'r character. I very much enjoy a few hours a day of fallen earth and would easily give it an 8/10 for mmo standards. I have not seen many fps open world mmorpg's around and this is quite the package if you are looking for a game like this.			"

												Used to play this when Age Gate still had it.Was fun,had a lot of people playing,we had large clan wars and I had the 4th or 5th most active enforcer clan online at the time,always tried to fix bugs or problems and you could get GM's pretty much all the time if needed.Then along came Gamers First.Hey let's mess up ALL the skills and mutations so they resemble nothing of what they used to.Hey lets nerf EVERYTHING in the game so they have to pay to do anything.Hey let's make it so EVERYONE can get ANY skill no matter what faction they are so no one feels left out.And now the game is dead.I didn't mind paying $20 a month for the game it was,but now I feel paying that sub to have a hull of the game it used to be,that I'm only paying for the same name but not the same game is a waste.DO NOT BUY or pay for anything from Gamer's First.They suck the life out of every game they touch until they get all the money they can from the players,then abandon the games and you are left with nothing.Find other games that are kept up,that has good rep and actually enjoy what you pay for.Good hunting and good luck to all.

												I like this game, but it has many problems people won't simply dismiss.  I for one can forgive them but it confuses why these problems exist.  Problems like animation, hitboxes, crafting system.  They all seem outdated and worse versions of what other games do.  The first person animations are monstrous, but the third person animations are alright.  The hitboxes can be a bit wierd but bearable.  The crafting system is a click, wait, get kind of system, where you get the materials, hit craft, wait a while (5 min to 10 hours depending on the item.) then you go and get it from the menu.  Also something that bugged me was that this game came out in 2009 originally and that they had the nerve to put a price on this game before it went free to play.  This game is a good free to play but paying for it is a horrible and idiotic idea, simply because the polish in this game is next to nothing.  This game does get in depth later on though with factions, vehicle (Better vehicles I should say, since you get a horse ealy on.), and more advanced and better looking weaponry.  The quests are interesting and sometimes challenging but luckily I had friends to help me out, this also improved the amount of fun that I had with this game. When you first get in it may look like another hotbar World of Warcraft like game (I actually like WoW it's just that many MMO's borrow so much from it that it gets boring.) but all those keys are 100% option for a more ""magic"" oriented player.  The tutorial is horrible, boring, and useless aside from simply teaching new players and should be skipped if you have played before.  Now onto the better parts of this game.  It progression is slow but it feels good to finally get that first revolver after using pellet guns for a while.  The custimization in this game is good ingame but in character creation it is limited but acceptable.  The towns feel alive due to all the other players going around doing their missions, crafting, learning, etc.  Now for a more personal opinion, I found this game alright, it gave me fun times with my friends but sometimes I would get locked getting resources in an area for crafting and trading.  I saw myself just joking around a lot before heading out to do a mission, which my friends would have fights over because some would go ahead of each other and it honestly annoyed me.  This game also has PvP which I never participated in since I had no real reason to.  This game gave me some rewarding progression (Which was created from the effort and time put in),  confussion as to why it isn't more polished and improved, and a annoying but sometimes fun time with my friends. If I would have to give this a score it would honestly be a 5/10.  I see the appeal here it's just I can't get over why it is like it is now: a messy MMO shooter with mechanics which could be improved easily.  I recommend this game to someone who takes MMO's as serious as a mature Arma player.			"

												If I could I would put a neutral vote, I enjoyed most of my time with it, but sadly It's not what it used to be.Fallen Earth is just another good game that was ruined by the devs, or at least the people who bought it and now run it. I hesitate to call them 'devs' since they don't actually develop anything more like shady owners. Like the kind of owners who run dingy casinos and never fix the machines that break down or clean the toilets.That said it's probably still worth a look as there aren't many mmo's out there similar too it. The crafting is complex enough to be interesting for awhile and the FPS mechanics certainly make combat a little more engaging than the normal 'lock target mash button' style of mmo . It's free so apart from time and some data you don't lose anything from trying it. Best read a guide or two though, as the ingame tutorial leaves a lot unsaid.P.S. Please note that I played Fallen Earth for well over a year, long before it appeared on Steam, my Steam playtime isn't indicitive of my actual playtime.			"

												Fallen Earth is a free to play mmorpg from GamersFirst.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.   Graphics and artwork looked dated, sort of like a Source engine game.  Has extensive crafting system and player run economy.  Has contextual help game tips, but not full scripted tutorial. Try it if you like MMORPGs, it could be your poor man's Fallout 4 game with Multiplayer.  But i suggest you Don't Spend any real money here.For more info:

												So, this here is a quite typical MMORPG, made by Gamers First, so if you are gonna download it, you are going to have to make a user to play. It's not meant to be that realistic, it's a god-dang mmorpg for christ's sake. Examples; Enemies can melee you with a corkscrew from 10 meters. You kill a flock of prearie chikens (a mutated chiken that has nothing in common with an actual chiken) and any of them won't defend each other. A custom made Closet Rod is more deadly than a sledge hammer. And the enemies will kill you if you try to flee from combat, like they will not simply stop following you. The good thing in the game is that it isn't Pay 2 Win, althought outside the safe zones it's full pvp war out there. Most of the games weapons and armors/clothing is usually made by YOU. That's right. Crafting takes a huge part in the game, as you make a ragged t-shirt from cotton and such. Later on you can craft better equipment from better ingedients etc. As usual, you'll get better in scavenge, harvest and skin skills by using them constantly. It can be quite dull at times, sure.In the short version, this combination of S.T.R.I.K.E.R. and fallout has potential, but that's about it. It takes way too much effort to get it working, and even then you will ask your self, was it worth it? See for yourself, it's free anyway.			"

I am going to start with them first.--NEGATIVE THINGS---The game hasen't been updated since November of 2014, which is horrible at the game's current state.Edit: The game is still updated, but it's only for the marketplace and not for the bugs...-Lots of minor bugs-The crafting times can get ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for F2P players-Unlike most MMORPGs, you cant choose to be an evil bandit of the wastes, which reminds me...-Did I mention that the game feels more like the western times with a cloning mechanic thrown into it?-The game seems rushed, the spawn points for enemies are just thrown around and oftenly crammed++POSITIVE+++Clear tutorial+Finally, an MMORPG where I can actually stand playing in firstperson+Decent gunplay, no broken hitboxes or any sort of bug+Actually playable for a F2P game~~NEUTRAL~~~The game is at the bottem of good for GraphicsOverall, don't play this game if you either don't like or don't care for MMORPGs, then you will hate them even more.As for the people who do, Try the game; I don't expect you to like it, just try it.

												game was awesome but the fact is, that today the game is dead and the fact that someone hacked into my clan, disbanded it and took all my stuff that was into the clan vault, i would get them off and put on my vault but my vaults were full, don't play this game because you'll find nothing but idiots and sometimes trolls, and if you go to PVP, you must be one of the ""terror raiders"" otherwise you'll be overwhelmed, because almost every pvper in the game is in that damn clan today			"

												For a Free Game, this game rocks! In 2 days I have already put 20 hours into the game. This game has so much to do, and so much is going on, that you are spoiled with missions and activities! If you're looking for an RPG in the Post-Apocoliptic era, or you just wanna play a game similar looking to Fallout, than this is a game I highly recommend downloading, whats even better is if you don't like it you're not losing anything because its FREE, and I am surprised it is after how much fun this game is. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking to play a good game and have fun with other players. This game has most pieces to an RPG game such as Clans, Events, Tons of Weapon, Armour, and Clothes! It also has skills you level up after getting AP Points, which yout hen use to upgrade your skills. The crafting system is also nice, and you can basically craft almost anything. (PS if you're trying to download this game and you think the Update downloader is stuck, its not. I also thought mine was stuck and after looking up how to fix it I found no solution when turns out I just wasn't being patient. I started the downloader and left it on over night and it was finished by morning! Hopefully that helps any of you that have that 'problem'.)			"

												Played the game since Beta and I have enjoyed throughout. For the games ****y exploits and the various bugs, glitches and what-not, it can actually be playable. As lots of other reviews have said, ""The community is♥♥♥♥♥quot;.. It's not too bad if you're with the right people. The Player versus Enviroment is fun, very well balanced but I can't say the same about Player versus Player, it's  not really something that is balanced.  It's fun, sure.. But, not when you first start and you don't know what you're doing.The starter quests are fun for a little while until they become repetative, but it's quite easy to get over that. For the thousands of quests there are, you can't really say ""I have nothing to do"". The huge world offers a wide variety of different enviroments to explore, some full of danger at every corner. As you progress throughout the game, you're going to need some help at some point. Implemented in the game is it's ability to create and join clans around the Grand Canyon. I like this aspect of the game, but, it's extremely ""NOT"" lore friendly, I think.For what is now a F2P game, it's worth it. I know I have missed things out but I don't want to ruin what Fallen Earth has on offer!			"

												A game you must play at least once in your life (and will probably for the rest of your life). At first the game is a little (very) confusing but as you progress and figure it out it gets interesting, fun and will take up a lot of your time. It first gave me the impression of ""just another game"" but is very far from. It is quest based and leaves you wanting to complete more and more - addictive so to speak and the quests are reasonably challenging for whichever level you are. It has many items to loot and craft, every time you think you've figured it all out and there cannot possibly be any more it surprises you with something new and even more curious than the last.Another thing I really like about this game is that you can ask for help at anytime and you will get it. Gamers are friendly and willing to help in chat. It gives a sense of comfort for those who ""get lost"".			"

												I remember this game very fondly. I spent plenty of time in game scav'ing for resources, playing in the pvp arena, joining up with clans, and roaming the province. It has a unique and very loveable style even though it was clearly trying to edge its way into the WoW market. When I played it was fresh out of beta, the developers were very close to the community. Even for the year or two I played that didn't change much. But then it just died. I'm not blaming the developers for selling the property to gamers first. You do what you gotta to stay afloat. But the change never took well. The community never talked to each other anymore. The only changes that were ever implimented were to make the microtransactions float and the f2p model more appealing. The content grew stale and dried out and eventually it became akin to the wasteland it portrays. I would not recommend this game to anyone new. Its a dried out husk of a community that once was and there's no chance of it ever coming back.			"

												This game is quite good for its age and hardware requirements. The open world maps are huge and designed using topographical satellite imaging data producing a varied, immersive environment spanning over a reported 1k+ kilometer area. Fallen Earth (FE) posseses the most expansive crafting systems I have ever seen allowing players the opportunity to create a vast array of items including the basics like armor, weapons and healing/food stuffs. This title offers solo & team based play for co-op (PvE) and PvP in addition to clan membership and a friend system.The game may not host an online player presence comparible to other titles like Dota, but is still adequately populated supporting player co-op. FE demands little by way of hardware and its file size is still small enough that anyone remotely curious about trying it out should; if it doesn't appeal after a test run uninstall it and carry on with less hassle than some other titles. If your into titles like Fallout 3 and Borderlands then there is a good chance that Fallen Earth will appeal to your inner wasteland survivalist instincts.In closing and on a humorous note, I choked on my coffee when I realized Fallen Earth had over 600 achievements; yes FE has that many achievements and all relevant indicating an involved play through lie ahead. The game is has all manner of missions, side-missions and grind easing out boredom on rainy days in a low impact, rewarding way. I have grown to enjoy Fallen Earth in the short time I've spent playing it and will continue thus recommend the game. For what it does it does so in a cost effective manner from free to cash shop without heavy nagging or a self a destructive pay-to-win brand.			"

												This game is a piece of art. Developed by a pretty unknown studio the game has been being developed since 2006. It changed hands to Gamersfirst and the game has continued to be developed. (Gamersfirst might not be the best group to own the game but they keep it running)The game is the culmination of a lot of different games that always got some things right but never went any further.The game as a very robust crafting system with nearly 90% of the items found in game being craftable. (The other 10% is usually unique item drops or materials for crafting.)The combat system while at times can be a bit wonky requires people to aim their shots and attacks (Something that a lot of people look for in an MMO today)If you enjoy games like Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout Tactics, Wasteland, or Wasteland 2 (This is in regards to the Genre and crafting/party system) Then this game is most likely going to fall into the Niche of games that you'll die for. The game has a die-hard fan base that has kept it runing through the transitions and the bad times. The game has undergone a ton of updating and in the near future another sector will be added to the game. (Essentially another expansion.)Many people discredit the game because of graphical glitches or a poorly designed tutorial. (Which graphics don't matter but the tutorial is credible.) Yet the game continues to find ways to bring people into the world.The mythos of the game is incredible. The storylines are interesting and they dialogue is engaging. (Dialogue here meaning Text, you have to read =P ) I cannot find a lot to say about the game that is at fault.PvP has consequences on the world and the Factions that battle it out are fun to engage with and make the game interesting to say the least with ""Politics"" in game. The economy is for the most part player driven and this engages people even more that like to play the market.All in all this game is a solid 7/10 and hell it's free, so what are you waiting for? GET OUT THERE AND MAKE ME PROUD! I'll see you in the wastes.			"

												I've only put a little over an hour... but man I am HOOKED. It takes a little getting used to, but the whole idea behind it brings a new perception to MMO's. The multiple item equips is awesome (especially how it shows on your body), the skills, the mounts (You get one for free at the begininning!). It is a little glitchy here and there, and the constant changing views can get a little annoying.. but past that it is a good game to get, especially if you want to play with friends (there's a reason why it's an MMO). Get it now! It's free and definitely worth the time!			"

Such a great potential, but sadly, wastedWell... I've spend some time in this game like two years ago, was focusing on pvp when more and more p2w and overall pvp performance annoyed and bored me enough to quit. Some ideas in this game are awesome, but increasing amount of things to buy and how they are being introduced to players kinda sucks. I understand game needs to earn for itself to be maintained and feed developer's families but well... it's sad, because in my opinion potential for something great and unique became wasted.I loved crafting, yet amount of time and specific materials required to craft late game stuff gets insane. Of course you can help your self with $.I loved free roaming and gathering stuff, but it doesn't feel like wasteland if just outside town you can find areas filled with stuff to gather.Ways to customize your character (visually) are nice. Skills system and ways how you can develop your character is interesting. PvE is boring and just bad. For a fps-like game AI is terrible.Community was nice (when i played).And finally, PvP. The idea to make most resource rich areas pvp-free areas is great. Too bad it's faction-limited (you can change your faction). But the mechanics for fighting were terrible, really. Jumpy characters, people lagging on purpose, just meh. It took out the beauty i loved after some time. Dunno if they ever fixed the netcode and pvp mechanics.The SummaryI can't recommend, neither don't recommend this game. Best see for yourself, however be warned: Falling in love after first looks might disappoint a lot later on. If you'll get hooked, mind amount of time spent on this title.			"

The idea of selecting your weapon off your body seemed cool at first but is just wonky, then when i was trying to complete one the boring quests my character's head got stuck on the ceiling when trying to go down some stairs. I had to create a NEW character and make him shorter just to complete a story quest that wasn't optional!I was a fan of the Fallout series so this looked cool but in the end this is just an unpolished F2P that couldn't live up to it's potential.

												An exelante game for any MMO fanatic. Game that will keep you busy for a very long time with allot of different people from around the world trying to carve their own little place out in the wasteland. Has a couple of bugs now and then but is fixed with a simple relog, and also has a very active update and bug fixing comunity that maintains it. Has a very comlicated HUD but you make it your own. Modular HUD.After more than 1000 hours on this game, I must say it was nice. It does get very frustrating waiting for crafts to finish, and getting all of the materials but in the end its all worth it. A game that will keep you busy for a very very VERY long time and has so much to offer. Looking at the Single Player content such as NPC's that give missions and places to discover on your own, it has more than 1000 hours worth in it. I have not even covered 1/4 of it yet. PvP is somewhat a battle but you get the hang of it, make sure you got a good build for it though. This game is very modular in allot of ways, from HUD layout, to Charachter Build and Look. You are set free in the Wasteland. Group in a clan, gain a faction, make new friend from across the Planet (Seeing that its ONE Global Server) and Survive. So Carve out your own spot to call home in the Wasteland.At 1199 Hours in this game I have finally reached the maximum ammount of money that you can have on a single character. 9y99r99b99w. This is through only crafting, trading and selling. Something I am very proud of looking back at now in the game.As of the Steam 2016 Nominations: I know there are many Titles that can keep you glued to your seat saying that iconic yet oh so white lie, ""Just 5 more minutes"" but of all of them I believe Fallen Earth has drawn me in the most. (As an Massive Multiplayer Online Game) Community, Crafting, Setting and just the aspect of exploring this massive world all connected as one server. It was a grind, but all of those grinding memories are oh so cherished. Thank you to the Developers of Icarus Studios, LLC.			"

												The Population has seen much better days, but Fallen Earth remains on of the best, if not best, PvP-lite games on the market. Want intense pvp, with full aim and RPG elements (eg healing) but don't want to be fully looted when you die.  Welcome to FE pvp, If you don't want pvp, or RP then sorry FE falls really short the pve is poor at best with little challenge.  A great game that fans of play for years, and yet you can get a capped toon with full gear in less than a month, only thing that stands between you and a Vet player is the skill level and understanding of the combat system.

												I'm new to this game that's why I can't tell you much about this yet. This game, as the others says, is a post-apocalyptic MMORPG. I love this game even though there are small number of players. Yes, there are still players playing this game that's why it is not yet ""DEAD"". If you have a problem in-game, just ask in the chatbox and many will respond to you. They will help you a lot. There are also many quests (main or side quests). It is not that easy to level up but it is fun killing and tracking monsters. You can craft, ride horses/vehicles and so on. As of now, that's the only thing I can say. I recommend this game. I'm not telling you to expect that it is a good game, but for me it is awesome. It's still best if you review it yourself. Have a nice day!			"

Then bought out, then trashed by what should be a classic example of Pay to Win enacted in an mmo.I tried it several times, but between the P2Win and what seemed to be an absolutely cliquesh community based on kissing the♥♥♥♥♥of either a GM or someone who was in good with a GM.Sad, but true story, this game should have been top of the charts for a time when it released.

												Challenging players to advance without telling them exactly how to do it is taboo in any game, but perhaps even more acutely taboo in an MMO. Many players may find the game confusing at first, and for others the combat will not be lively or vigorous enough, but as with any MMO these aspects can be improved over time. What will certainly not change is the inherent difficulty infused into the game by holding players responsible for their actions. This game isn't for everyone, and that may be the most compelling reason to try it for yourself.			"

												I played this game for many years before hand and when you see it now. The game is just a barren husk with no content to show for the years I've been away. Nothing new to make me enjoy it also. Everything is now just, boring in it. Go with Fallout, you'll have more content at your hands than this game ever will.			"

												Graphics we very ""meh"".  After awhile, it got very repetitive with the level grinding.  There were also major bugs when I played, but I'd say a good half of them have been fixed since.  I haven't chosen to return to this game because I hit the level cap and it wasn't interesting enough to justify paying for it.			"

I really like the idea of this game. You are a clone bent on either saving or destroying the post-apocalyptic world. The execution is one issue. Lack of players is another. I logged in on Saturday night, literally 54 people in game on the map the size of Kalimdor. I played last year without Steam account, 400+ people were online Pros>Very friendly players>6 classes, 2 fractions (simply: Barbarian, Gatherer, Scout VS Soldier, Engineer, Priest) in reality its Barbarians vs Soldiers >Fighting mechanics like in Elder Scrolls Morrowind but with guns >Missions are plentiful and not boring. You often have to make a choice between two missions, you can only complete one and this will change your character's future>Humorous content (Dark and Macabre Humor)>Fast download, little bugs>FreeCons>Only 4 types of Background will bore you to death>Crafting takes forever(sometimes Hours to make an item)>Building a vehicle or a house takes Weeks>If you don't start honing your picking skills right away, you will fail >PVP is dead6/10 Play it as if its an offline RPG before it kicks the bucket			"

												The year is 2156.  The Apocalypse has had an Apocalypse.  A mutant army is reshaping the world into mutant hell, and only one thing can stop them.  From the toxic ashes of Occupy Wallstreet 2 a renegade soldier is born.  part man, part hobo.  Your character is leading the battle between good and evil, as it has never been faught before.  You are on a mission to bring down a battalion of ruthless mutant soldiers, and save the world.  ...is what I would like to say.  Don't trust the screenshots that allude to gameplay.  Herein lies a tragedy.   You will spend the majority of your time in expansive untextured areas doing nothing more than shooting mutant dogs with your busted pipe rifle.  Avoid, unless that sounds like a good time to you.			"

												Such an underrated game. If you like to craft then this game is for you. Crafting in most MMO's is generally pointless and uninteresting. In Fallen earth you craft everything. All your clothes, all your armour, all your weapons and even your mounts. Want to travel the wasteland in a dune buggy well collect your materials, craft your components and put them together to drive your own set of wheels. This game is all about gathering, quests and crafting. it has a very friendly community which will answer any question in the chat window instantly.Exploring and fighting is challenging at times but always good fun. the game can be complicated as it is so in depth. Easily the most in depth game i have ever played.The great thing about this game is that it is absolutely free, yes you can subscribe for extra benefits but you can play the whole game for free in its entirity.The graphics are a bit dated now but the gameplay more than makes up for it.its free, give it a go.

												While I love this game with my heart and soul, I can't recommend this game to ANYONE. First off, this is a free to play, MMORPG with more numerical values in skill points and microtrasactions than are reasonable in an MMO, RPG or not. If you are one of those people who can keep tabs on their progress every 20 seconds great, you 'might' like this game. Secondly, crafting takes the longest it should ever take you. Building a gun in the game takes about as long as a machine might take to calculate the numeric value of pi. I sat waiting for literal days, waiting for crafting items to finish. Third, after finding most of the beginning quests, you struggle to find more, leading you to take hours on the crappy little ATV you spent 5 days (real-time) to make, running strait into a PvP field, dieing instantly from a stray bullet or an overpowered NPC. Last but not least, there is the problem of buttons. I have never played a game where every key on your keyboard + keys you don't even have is/are used in game to perform simple tasks such as turning left. I don't want this to sound like I'm griping about this game, but its just something where if you can deal with organized chaos you may have a chance to play this game, otherwise, stay clear of this game.

												After playing for a little bit and ended up realising that this game just isn't fun. They give us an open world that is just completely empty, the hit boxes are horrid, and the fact that in order to PvP you have to accept duals is kinda stupid for a gaint game such as this. This game just feels like World of Warcraft with a Nuclear Apocalypse skin on it. Someone's review said it was like fallout. That is completely wrong it only looks like Fallout:NV (Gaint, empty, and brown being the main color) I would not download this game as it is a complete waist of time and space on your hardrive. Also one other thing, everthing goes by levels, so instead of going around and being ableto take on things and people because they have a gun and you don't you take things on because one side is mega level 9000 (just an expression) and your not. Leaving this unbalanced and enemies just plain boring. Especaily since you start out with a gun that can kill things from lvl1-10. Its just plain boring.			"

Join a faction and fight for the contol of war zones for bonuses or form a lil team to fight tough boss. You're now exhausted. What about farming?

My character is and more than likly will be sitting in the middle of nowere for the rest of his life, sitting on the side of a long forgoten empty road. It was an amazing game then, years ago.

												In my opinion Fallen Earth is one of the best post-apocalyptic games out there. Wether you enjoy fighting, crafting, exploring on your motorbike or whatever - this game can deliver it. I myself really enjoy going out into the wilderness and scavenge old cars and microwaves for a huge variety of items to use in my crafting.The gamemasters are pretty much always there to help you as is the awesome community (most of them anyways).The combat is pretty straightforward and easy to learn, The skill ""tree"" can be a bit difficult as a new player to understand but there are roadmaps to give you some idea where you should put your skill points.With the game being free to play there's a shop for microtransactions which does contain items that can help you quite a bit but nothing that would give a player a huge advantage over another in my opinion.Unfortunatly I don't know how limited the gameplay is as a free to play member but either way I would really recommend that you try out Fallen Earth - it does offer alot of fun.

												I honestly love this game. It has a VERY steep learning curve, but once you get your bearings it is so worth it. You can go so far, in so many ways. Classes don't excist in the slightest, you can  be everything from the dashing medic with a large rocket launcher, to the big brute with a spiked baseball-bat and telekinesis. Your options are about as big as your imagination. The setting is ver well done, even with graphical settings on low, it's lovely. I highly recommend it, so if anyone needs help with this game, add me as a friend, and I'll see waht I can do. Sleep tight, don't let the raiders bite!			"

												A very entertaining game if you're into riding around a hue map and collecting things, the graphics are absolutley beautiful which means running around the map is fine by me and the map is over 600 miles by proportion to the real world so its pretty massive for a free game... overall it's really fun for those who like beautiful scenery and killing things at the same time.

												this game is VERY incomplete. the game needs more sound theres hardly any and this makes for an underwhelming game, i also think that the controls are a bit much and also very odd (i.e Y being the action/interact button). However for the most part the character design was pretty awesome and the only thing i think they should do to it is add a few more clothing options.			"

												just downloaded this game today, and I can already say its not off to a good start...while it seems like a very fun game, and I couldnt wait to get into it myself..as soon as I started to updater, it prompted the login screen (as to be expected) and it gave me the wonderful option to validate it with my Steam account, just behind a tab that says ""No account data found..If you dont have an account, create one now. Would you like to create an account?"" but behind it, you have the option to try and create an account just in case..seems pretty standard, and very easy...so I first tried my steam account, only to be told that the username and password didnt match/werent correct...so I tried my steam name in itsself, still nothing...then I decided to take a chance and go ahead and make an account for the games main website, again, a very standard procedure, enter your email and the password you want...type in the random captcha thing to prove your not a spam-bot, then opt in/out for getting emails and newsletters of the site itsself and the original ""by clicking (whatever it is) you agree to the privacy settings and rules"" so I clicked it, and now to validate my email!....waiting...still..almost been an hour now and still havent gotten the validation email and I have already tried at least 5 times..if your looking for a good post-biochemical-apocalyptic survival game, from everything I have read and seen..this IS the game to get, especially if your into STALKER or FallOut, but so far..I can easily say, save yourself the hastle..its nearly impossible to get into the game for those who have not made an account or anything yet			"

												I've put so much time and patience to this game and I gota admit that this game is AWSOME!!!!! sure that during this month  and november that the game has some bugs. But that doesnt stop me of exploring each section in this mmo.  It has the type of feeling of all the fallout series. Even the crafting recipes in this mmo is unbelievable!!! there are so many creation  recipes you can make (armor,mounts,viechles, medicine, construstion, mutagenics, melee weapons, ballistic weapons etc...) the list keeps going on and on like for an eternity. Thats what makes this game awsome! Even the missions go on forever. And building your character has so many choices of what kind of character you want to be. It only takes time and patience of creating your character. Just give this game a chance if you havent played it before or to anyone that have only played it for a couple of hours. Heck, this game is FREE afterall and there are even special events on holidays and give aways. Only thing is that you gota find the special gift boxes during those events. Just dont listen to the negative reviews about this game and just keep on playing. Oh and if you want to be a freeinum player, just buy ONE thing in their marketplace and you get  character limit to 4, chip limit to UNLIMITED, and other free stuff they give to you when you just buy one thing. I give my support to the company for making this great game ^^			"

Making vehicle parts and selling them was my best experience in the game.Explore as much as you want, you'll see nothing but bland enemy mobs and clustered harvest nodes. I expected nuclear wastelands to have abandoned buildings waiting to be explored. All buildings were the same: no loot, only mobs in some.PVP is meh.PVE is meh.A few years ago free players had three crafting queues. Now they reduced it to one.			"

												I owned and played this game before I started using steam.  I played alot and loved it dearly.  It is to me, a wonderous falloutish mmorpg with a beautiful crafting system.  That being said, its GM's are very problematic.  I was friends or at least friendly with one named Tiggs and one day I got an e-mail from her saying my account was banned for breaking or exploiting a game rule.  I e-mailed her back asking what she possibly thought I had done.  No response. I pleaded with her, mind you I loved this game dearly, and its players, and it broke my heart that with as much as I played it, and contributed to other players I didnt even recieve the grace of knowing what I was accused of... So what I guess Im trying to say, is its sort of like an ex-girlfriend you cant stop thinking of or understaning how you lost, yet cant tell someone they wouldnt have a better experience.			"

												A very good game, bringing into the MMORPG genre many features I wished for since a very long time. Such a feature would, for example, be the manual aiming and attacking, as opposed to the timed autoattacks of other games such as WoW. Also the profession and crafting system was a positive surprise for me, enabling you to grind ahead of players who just followed quests blindly and did nothing else. Has relatively good graphics, especially when considering when this game was launched and the best feature yet: it is F2P !! The achievements are also very good, encouraging the players not just to level up and complete the main quests, but also to grind and explore as much as possible.Personally I'd rate this game with 8/10 leaving some room for improvement but also sufficiently praising it's attributes.

												Have to say I have no idea how i missed this game. While the initial learning curve is relatively steep and some controls initially feel clunky it progresses nicely to become second nature and not what you initially thought. The community is simply fantastic, i have never seen such an active Help channel with old timers, GMs, mentors and new players all chipping in to assist with any questions. On that note I have also never encountered a game so well moderated, trollers/spammers etc will actively be muted and banned if it becomes excessive and the GMs do not hide, they actively PM responses to  Help channel queries or respond direct to the channel.The game itself is essentially Fallout 3 turned MMO mostly, 95% of in game items are craftable. You start only being allowed one character and one crafting queue slot plus a limit on chip (in game money) amount but a very small real money purchase on the store unlocks additional characters, crafting slots and removes the credit limit. You can earn store cash through surveys so no real money is even necessary. 5G1C is needed to buy a ""Return to home"" device and that can be earned six times over from one survey.So the gameplay, its a crafters dream and nightmare as you will spend a ton of time just trying to hoard resources :) Combat is targetted in that you actually need to swing for the head or arms or shoot for the location and if your cursor is off, well you miss. On that note you get six, YES SIX, weapon slots on your character which all show in the game. You can have a primary meleee two hander on your back, a primary ranged two hander on your back, two pistols on your hips and two one hander melee on your hips. Its choicetastic ;)Seriously recommend that as its F2P you check it out and just give it a few hours after running the tutorial as you learn a ton through the inital and subsequent missions. Well worth checking out, so much so i subbed after only 20 hours of playtime.			"

You can stay on point and do quests, or venture off and level up in the desert on your own; to a certain degree, in that you'll have to sell loot eventually. After crafting two lawnmower blades into dual-weild weapons I had the most fun.NOTE:I live in the area it is set in and they got our night sky, the star constellations, right.

												This is the MMO that I keep coming back to.  If you want crafting, questing and sandbox, some would say one cannot go with the other, but it works here.  There is also farming, pvp, only in certain spots, but those spots are rich with resources, so there is no griefing the noobs.  Also the community is pretty good and the Help channel actually helps.  To top it off players moderate the chat and I have seen the ban hammer come down more than once.  Yes the interface is clunky, yes the graphics are not AAA, but I love this game and it gives me a sense of accomplishment when I can go out, gather stuff and make myself a shirt.  Although its F2P i have played with and without subs and I have not really seen a differance.  But for $10 a month you cant go wrong.			"

												If you like a cheap knockoff of fallout new vegas with crappy ai, Horrible admins, and people who use side chat to explain their life up untill now then sure get this game. I have to admit it was fun for like 30 mins, after that a repetitive piece of crap. The leveling system is totally flawed making it sometimes damn near impossible to complete a quest. Good premise of a game but horribly taken a turn for the worst.. Its rated mature so who cares what my name was it wasnt derogetory in anyway, and was changed by an admin without any notice. the game itself is 5 outta 10. But the admins make it more like  a 3 outta 10 would reccommend changing the rating to an kids only. The landscape is bland with bits scattered about for you to scavenge if your the right level... All in all if your trying to burn time play it, but dont forget to hit that uninstall button before you leave... Its free for a reason... kinda blows			"

												I owned and played this game before I started using steam.  I played alot and loved it dearly.  It is to me, a wonderous falloutish mmorpg with a beautiful crafting system.  That being said, its GM's are very problematic.  I was friends or at least friendly with one named Tiggs and one day I got an e-mail from her saying my account was banned for breaking or exploiting a game rule.  I e-mailed her back asking what she possibly thought I had done.  No response. I pleaded with her, mind you I loved this game dearly, and its players, and it broke my heart that with as much as I played it, and contributed to other players I didnt even recieve the grace of knowing what I was accused of... So what I guess Im trying to say, is its sort of like an ex-girlfriend you cant stop thinking of or understaning how you lost, yet cant tell someone they wouldnt have a better experience.			"

												Really fun Post Apocalyptic MMO. Even a good implementation of F2P. Very much enjoyable for casual/normal play (F2P) and inexpensive to upgrade on a monthly bases when you have more time to play. From a crafters point of view and with the extra thought on Post Apocalyptic it is really fun. Going out scavening and then crafting. Another plus is that crafting can be a big part of your playstyle, but if you hate crafting you will not miss out if you ignore it totaly.			"

												It's a good game if you have a lot of patience.The scenery reminds me of a cartoon where that mouse is running from the cat and the same tables and chairs keep scrolling across the screen. The hugh landscape (Its pretty damn big) does take the edge off because you can't have everything. That thing i mentioned about patience?It's pretty much like any other mmo quest wise. Go here, kill this many of that, come back, here's something you could have used 6 levels ago now listen to this NPC make some sarcastic comment about chickens blah blah blah. There is, in fact, quite a good quest line giving you the main jist of what's going on, what/who you are and whats happened, which takes the edge off. Patience again.Combat is alright... Bit clumpy and unreliable at times. You agro' a guy in a building, he runs around in circles for a couple seconds then just warps his♥♥♥♥♥♥though that wall. Those guys dont mess around with doors and shet. Like most mmorpgs you have some different combat types (melee/pistols/rifles) and as always it's normally best to stick to one and do some research before you hit level 20 and realise you suck because you did it wrong. You can re-spec of course but that's gonna cost you. Crafting is one of the games saving grace for me. It's hugh. You can pretty much make anything and everything you could ever need from guns, helmets and knives to horses (Yeah, you make them, like from stuff) motorbikes and farms. You don't NEED to buy anything from anyone if you plan ahead and scavange as you go. I'm not 100% but I think f2p is limited to 1 que. so you can only set one item to craft at any time. After buying something it opens to 3 slots. Which is still pretty limiting. Without being able to que crafting it could take like 20 hours to make an ATV, which is one of the lowest levels of transport other than a horse.... Patience once again.This game is totally playable and enjoyable without paying a penny. If you can put up with having to do everything the hard, tedious and long♥♥♥♥♥way. The dev's.... owners? I don't know who but whoever calls the shots seem to care more about new, shiney and down right pointless stuff to buy rather than fixing issues that I remember existing when I first played the game. After writing this I don't actually know why I'd recommend this game but I still would. It ticks enough of my boxes (take that as you will) for me to see past the flogging of horrible make-you-pay tactics and see a really good, enjoyable and fun game.After all it is a free game...			"

												Well, I'll start it off simply put. I played this game from the creation of my steam account (In late 2012) and I consistently played it from that period until around December 2013, for no specific reason.Basic Positives:The game is very well designed, and has virtually unlimited customisabilityThere has always been a community of players willing to play with me or it's free, so you can easily get your friends to join you if needs beIf you don't want to level up too high, you can easily get what you need within a week, and be self sustained with crafting, which is literally used for everything from making basic weapons, to the best vehicles and armour, which might I add, is very detailed and advancedThere is a smooth mixture of PvE and PvP areas, which make the big difference, with PvP areas in every area of the map, and plenty of gameplay features for anyone who likes either to play alone, or with a huge clan to enjoyBasic Negatives:The community isn't the best it could possibly be, and I feel that it is that way because of the development and releases of more MMORPG based games in the last 2 years. With games such as Defiance, Planetside 2  and the ever standing World of Warcraft eating into the community, it's been progressively decreasing in the last year or 2. (There used to be a consistent upto 20000 people online)The game is very heavily based on a single £5 (or whatever in other currencies) to become an efficient crafter, and earn the option of crafting with a waiting list, to put it simply. Personally, I had no issues as I have 4 characters (The max) and each is heavily levelled into various aspects, but it's a shame that that's what the game has had to resort to.Gameplay:The game was released in 2009 (Not on steam) and has been consistently updated and used by Devs and GM's (General Managers/Moderators) and I seem alot of steady improvement in items, early and late game dynamics and near areas/features. One thing i've enjoyed about the game is that it's never the easy way to play, and challenging the play to do whatever they want/need to do is a key feature in this game, with a very heavily player based community, and teamwork being very heavily needed and used in events and boss battles. The game itself is very good, and requires little to no processing power, with my old 2008 Toshiba laptop easily running the game (Which might I add, had an old AMD Processor/Integrated Graphics). As a whole, it requires little to no power to play and run effectively over the long term.Community:Fallen Earths community is very unique, with literally all kinds of players involved, and have the capability of being involved, with RP easily implemented into the way you play the game, and more warrior type players can easily goto various areas/towns and just massacre anything and all they want, with areas like that in every Sector of the map. There is even a dedicated map for pure PvP for any and all players, but is usually for much more advanced and high level players.Enemies/AI:The enemies and AI in Fallen Earth are very advanced for their age, and with enemies like Bosses all having their own unique dungeon like places, and areas with enemies relating to them, as well as an area in one of the later areas which has a prison which is guarded by enemies, and has varying levels and harder enemies as you move in, with around 5 bosses before you reach a 'grand master' type boss, and essentially have to have a big group. Enemies as a whole are very well balanced, and progress very well, with no real intermingling with levels or players in general getting into the thick of a battle with enemies 10 times higher level than they are is literally 0% (Unless they travelled for quite a while).Conclusion:It always has been, and still is my most played game ever, and I would definitely say to any MMORPG fan, that they should definitely give it a go, and if they need help/advice I will gladly clear up any issues or problems with the game.9/10 (Only due to community loss)			"

												A very good game, bringing into the MMORPG genre many features I wished for since a very long time. Such a feature would, for example, be the manual aiming and attacking, as opposed to the timed autoattacks of other games such as WoW. Also the profession and crafting system was a positive surprise for me, enabling you to grind ahead of players who just followed quests blindly and did nothing else. Has relatively good graphics, especially when considering when this game was launched and the best feature yet: it is F2P !! The achievements are also very good, encouraging the players not just to level up and complete the main quests, but also to grind and explore as much as possible.Personally I'd rate this game with 8/10 leaving some room for improvement but also sufficiently praising it's attributes.

												I have once recommended this game, mostly because i was young and stupid, i played this game for a considerable amount of time and havent for up to a year now. I understand what the original devs were going for but tbh its a terrible mmo, the combat is worse than WoW it can only be accuratly described as ""hotkey spamming fps"" since you still need to aim your weapon and shoot. The combat in itself is terrible pve is a waste of time in the long run, endgame is completly pvp and is entirelly p2w since you need to buy items for real cash in order to craft the top tier items. PVE is broken as hell with bullet sponge bosses and normal mobs at that, i remember a specific type of mob that dropped some mid level loot required an insane amount of time to kill, but was also terribly slow, so you could easily spend 5 mins attempting to kill it before it got even close enough to you to attack.PVP is completly p2w as stated above, and the community is so terrible that max level players can be regularly seen in early level areas farming players for easy ""Deathtoll"" which was the pvp currency, that enabled you to craft pvp armor and weapons which though arguably good were still terrible in comparison to p2w gearThe crafting system is terrible, from what i recall you can queue up to 3 items without a sub or without buying a consumable that enabled you to have a few more slots with real money, but again this consumable only lasted a few hoursCrafting based characters will have a hard time getting to the better resources because most of them are in pvp zones, except one specific resource who is a garanteed drop in a bullet soaking raid boss, but has a 1/100 chance of dropping to you.I have played this game activelly for a few months and spent nearly a year popping in and out just to check up on a community of friends. Its not worth spending time on, there are plenty of other games out there who are way better than this game.As a final verdict i cant even say anything out of 10 cause i dont think its even worth an honorable mention.

Fallen Earth, Worth playing?This all depends on what you want from an MMO'RPG'FPS, Its an open world like fallout, a post apocalyptic world to be precise, Very Skills and Crafting orientated.Graphics - 6 (Very dated and Textures seem lazy in parts)Gameplay - 7 (Steep learning curve, very skills and crafting Orientated, Loads of Professions)Difficulty - 8 (Fairly hard, but it can be easy in places.)Content - 8.5 (Would be a 10 if you counted amount of stuff to do but most quests are the same and unrewarding.)Customization - 8 (Your average mmo customization, loads of items and some cool stuff on the marketplace too.)Community - 6 (The community is one of the best I've seen, extremely helpful when they can be but in and around the world it comes to If you're not in a clan this game is going to be very lonely, Most don't really cooperate.Business model - 10 (Its how it should be, Mostly cosmetic, pets, vehicles and wardrobe items)Hackers and Scammers? - Yeah, its an MMO dont trust anyone fully. People are People.This game relies on Skills and Crafting a damn lot, Its tutorial is kinda of empty but the Default Help channel is full of Nice and helpful community members and admins, Asking them would be a great way of getting into the swing of things.Overall score - 8 (This game is pretty good for the Hardcore Player or the Skilling casual.)

												Basically, this game is a cheap fallout mmo that's free to play. It doesn't have the best graphics or anything but it's as close as we can get to  an actually mmo set in the fallout universe. COME ON BETHESDA, SCREW ELDER SCROLLS ONLINE, MAKE A FALLOUT MMO....... sadly for now though this will have to do though.But still, its a great game. "

												Interesting MMO game produced by GamerFirst Live, this game is really interesting and functionable there are many things that i havent seen yet but some games have the same capability to have same functions.. this game is really based off Fallout: 3 / Fallout: New Vegas.. I have played this game up to 37 level, and also with my other character up to 17.. i started to play this game 2011 so i have experience in this game so yeah i guess il be rating this game 5/5.Warm Regards,MikeN			"

												This is the MMO that I keep coming back to.  If you want crafting, questing and sandbox, some would say one cannot go with the other, but it works here.  There is also farming, pvp, only in certain spots, but those spots are rich with resources, so there is no griefing the noobs.  Also the community is pretty good and the Help channel actually helps.  To top it off players moderate the chat and I have seen the ban hammer come down more than once.  Yes the interface is clunky, yes the graphics are not AAA, but I love this game and it gives me a sense of accomplishment when I can go out, gather stuff and make myself a shirt.  Although its F2P i have played with and without subs and I have not really seen a differance.  But for $10 a month you cant go wrong.			"

												Before I start, let me say, yes this game isn't as good as it could be!But it could be worse. To start, some of the major flaws are visable from the get go, lack of character slots, you want more then one character, buy slots, this itself is a huge turn off, and makes it seem like a demo for a pay once to play MMO. This honestly detered me from playing, but I decided to press on to see if it got better, and it did.....some what.While the skill system takes a moment to learn due to it's unfreindly new user interface, it's well designed once you get the hang of how it works.The crafting systemis superb, while it is long, and a lot of the crafting times are broken, meaning they take more or less then what it says it will, only those who are really in to crafting will actually make use of this. All crafting skills have purpose, if you seek to play a more support role, medical and cooking skills will be of the most use to you. want a role to inflict maximum damage, science, ballistics and possibly nature (whick could also be put under support) would be a good suit for you.You can buy slots to have the ability to craft multiple items at once, and buy a device to speed up the crafting times all together. What more, the device can be bought from other players in game.The ability to create camps, and material generaters gives this mmo a unique feel to it, making it seem more like a sand box game then an mmo. But this is also it's downfall, because it seem it can't decide if it wants to be an MMO or sandbox game, the AI seems unfinished and buggy, audio clips break at times, and enemy AI is flat out broken. But the broken enemy AI may also have been done on purpose, as even something one or two levels higher then you can easily come close to killing you, if you're not swarmed that is. Therefor, it's better to travel out in teams so you're not caught in a fray alone.Yes this game is Pay to Win, yes it has a lot of bugs and could be considered still in beta, but this game has merit, and tried to do something different.If I had to rate this game, I'd give it a 8/10 something worth keeping regaurdless of the playerbase or cons, as this game could be easily fixed.

												Have to say I have no idea how i missed this game. While the initial learning curve is relatively steep and some controls initially feel clunky it progresses nicely to become second nature and not what you initially thought. The community is simply fantastic, i have never seen such an active Help channel with old timers, GMs, mentors and new players all chipping in to assist with any questions. On that note I have also never encountered a game so well moderated, trollers/spammers etc will actively be muted and banned if it becomes excessive and the GMs do not hide, they actively PM responses to  Help channel queries or respond direct to the channel.The game itself is essentially Fallout 3 turned MMO mostly, 95% of in game items are craftable. You start only being allowed one character and one crafting queue slot plus a limit on chip (in game money) amount but a very small real money purchase on the store unlocks additional characters, crafting slots and removes the credit limit. You can earn store cash through surveys so no real money is even necessary. 5G1C is needed to buy a ""Return to home"" device and that can be earned six times over from one survey.So the gameplay, its a crafters dream and nightmare as you will spend a ton of time just trying to hoard resources :) Combat is targetted in that you actually need to swing for the head or arms or shoot for the location and if your cursor is off, well you miss. On that note you get six, YES SIX, weapon slots on your character which all show in the game. You can have a primary meleee two hander on your back, a primary ranged two hander on your back, two pistols on your hips and two one hander melee on your hips. Its choicetastic ;)Seriously recommend that as its F2P you check it out and just give it a few hours after running the tutorial as you learn a ton through the inital and subsequent missions. Well worth checking out, so much so i subbed after only 20 hours of playtime.			"

												for any fallout fans, you need/want this game.for once, its not a pay-to-win MMO, where you can buy epicly tricked out gear on the item store. hell. the item store is kinda junk after you realize you can get everything in game, and get better than the item store by area 2 (and this is comming from someone who spent the money to find out).the setting is post-nuclear apocolypse, so fallout fans will have a field day with it. hell... if the rumored fallout online is like this, then i'll have found the game i live on >.>.the skill system is one of the best elements. you HAVE to craft stuff to get better at it. and i mean aLOT of stuff. you have to use your skills to get better at them as well. theres no book to buy, no item to find, that will do it for you.while it DOES have some bad points (every game does. dont ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t yourself), they tend to be rather small. downtime (an MMO standard) tends to be frequent, but kept short... usually less than 5 hours. there ARE the odd glitches that allow critters to hit youy from across the map, or, to one shot you.... but then again, you may have just wandered too far into the wasteland for your own good/level.  finally, pvp is just as open as the world. there ARE specific zones for it on some servers, but they warn you well enough when your heading into/near one.gamers review? 9/10			"

												Oh... This game.This game is worth playing just to see how legendarly bad it is.In my adventures during this game I made a topless dude in a G string with a pink mohawk with the utmost classy name ""Bondageslave"" and trolled so hard that the butthurt admins banned me despite not breaking a single rule.There's not many games that has the potential lulz factor of how bad this game is and even less with butthurt admin, but I assure you the admins here are a breed of their own.Never have I seen a more raging group of admins on anything. Not even TF2 servers.So yes, I do recommend it. For the wrong reasons? That depends how you look at it.But personally I have never laughed so hard in the 0.9 hrs i've had on this game, untill I got banned.If you ever get the desire to troll for 0.9 hrs and don't mind installing game that takes roughly 50 minutes to a hour, I assure you that you'll never run across more vulnerable victims.The game is bad but the lulz is good.

												Have you ever been playing Fallout? Did you think `Why isnt there a game like this with Multiplayer included?´ Well...This game is exactly what you were waiting for. The graphics of Fallen Earth isn´t as good as in Fallout New Vegas, but who cares? You can travel through an area 5 times bigger than that ( I don´t know exactly...maybe 6 or 7 times bigger). The crafting system is the biggest one you have ever seen. It is bigger than in Minecraft! :O. Play it on First Person or Third Person ( Third Person is better ;D ). The best way to enjoy that game is...Play with your friends and enjoy the huge questing system!			"

												I played this game when it was in beta, and for a long time after this game. I really enjoyed it. This game has come a long way... but not in a good way, and here is why.Let us start with the Pros of this game:-The crafting was great, you had to go out and fight for what you needed, and there were tons of guns and melee weapons and gear that you could make.-There were no classes, you got to make your character from skills that you chose to level up and spend points on.-The world was fun. Think Fallout MMO-There are people who are actually will to help you! and you don't have to know them!-The early game feels like an actual apocolypes-The map is HUGE! i think it would take about 10 hours to walk from one end to the other, probably even longer.-Fun with friends-The game is Free to Play-Last time i checked there was no pay to win, however you can pay real money for very and i mean VERY good items in game. However this is random and you may get cosmetic gear or actual gear.-Six different Factions that each complement the player's play style depending on how they build their character.And now, for the Cons:-There aren't as many people playing this game as there used to be, And most of the people who play it now are either very low level or max. Not many in between-There is Faction racism. there where many time where i would be invited into a group or raid only to be kicked out when I got there because i was a certain faction.-End game is PvP required. End game gear needs materials found only in PvP zone. There are no ways, other then buying the items of the player market (which is expensive), to aquire the mats-End game is also repetitive. I spent hours apon hours at one spot waiting for a single event to happen.-The late game doesn't feel like im in an apocolype as much-The game Dev dont and i mean DON'T give a damn about this game anymore, period.-Clan are almost all PvP focused. Hardly, if any, PvE Focused clans-F2P has a money cap and they gain reduced exp if i recallIn my opinion this game isn't that good anymore and i wouldn't recommend this. HOWEVER! This game is quite fun to play with friends and the begin of the game is some of the most fun i have had in a MMORPG game. I would say take some friends and play this game to get a feel for the game. It is a F2P game after all. But i would't recommend it.			"

												Fallen Earth is an RPG which offers a wide range of activities. According to me this is one of the best RPG offered in the world of videogames. It's not pay to win and it can also be considered a mix of Fallout and MadMax. Why?. Because it offers a wide map, such as Gran Canyon and  veichles are available. You can drive a wide range of veichles such as ATV, motorbikes,  choppers, Dune Buggy, sport  totally customizable (there are even animals to mount)!. For people who think that it could be pay to win, i am able to tell you that it's not pay to win, you do not have to pay anything to be stronger than other players! There is people who tell that Fallen Earth is dead. This is not true. The number of players is increasing but at the same time some players stop to play because it's a a bit hard as  RPG, but do not worry about it, you'll can join a clan which will help you to learn how to play and how to be stronger! Furthermore this game is also playable by players who have a low end PC, so don't worry about FPS.			"

												A post-apocalyptic shooter MMO, it has low-requirement graphics and is free-to-play. Fallen Earth has an elaborate crafting system on which the in-game economy depends on; since almost all equipment, usables, and mounts are player-created. It has an emphasis on PvP towards the mid-game and thereafter, in which players join factions and fight eachother. Combat is straightforward, and stale: point-click-shoot, and no bullet drop. There is an attempt at ""magic"" in-game described as ""mutations"", but from my experience it is mostly a useless addition.			"

												Yep, you read it, 1879 hours!Well, I used to like this game because I could grind and talk to friends at the same time, take over territories, and engage in awesome shootouts (PvP) with up to 20 players or more.I really got the feeling that I was part of a team and that some people were real helpful with noobs (mainly because of the clan aspect). I had a lot of fun playing this and there are a lot of missions and content. In fact, I am still only 33% of the way through completing the achievements, albiet some of them are unobtainable now.When the devs were active, they would appear in-game all the time to give away items and be helpful. This was great! Sometimes they would use ""god powers"" to be invisible and watch us play new areas that just got released, then make private messages ""I see you!"".    - HAH That's great!I met a couple devs that would recognize me and start chatting; even added me to their steam friends list. Pretty cool!The best experience was on Halloween 3 years in a row where the devs would come out and give away treats (bling for your character). The first year, a dev transformed himself into a giant 4 story tall beast and he ATE ME! HAHAHAHahhaaSo the next two years I stood in the mass crowd of online players and typed ""Turn into the beast again!"" and sure enough he did, and he ate me again, and everyone started clattering their keyboards to respond. SO GREAT!But yeah,..  it's just a ghost town now...  If more people played, the devs would care again, and this game would once again bring me joy (bugs and all).			"

Furthermore this game is also playable by players who have a low end PC, so don't worry about FPS.			"

												This game takes time and lots of grinding to higher levels, and it is difficult as if you where actually in an apocolypse. This game is very fun if you are able to get past the fact that the story is everywhere and the constant need for better equipment and materials. Though personally if you get a few friends and play through the game it makes things alot more fun for all involved.			"

												This game is extremely addicting and fun, the first few hours are boring but once you get past that this game is AMAZING. Graphics are meh and the combat system is kinda bad, however the simple fact that I can go into a cave mine some coal kill giant ants and underdwellers to find a secret cavern is just awesome. And th MMO part adds so much immersion to the game, know whats more fun than attacking a bandit camp? Attacking it with a group of people. I normally stray away from games like this but I have been playing this bad boy nonstop. Also notice how most of the bad reviews complain about difficulty or buggyness or complicated gameplay yet they haven't played for more than 10 hours? They say some crap like this game is Pay2win, and its not at all, Sure paying gets you some ""new"" things faster but you can get most of these things ingame anyway. If you are a realism fan then get this game. Note this game has a big learning curve and difficulty spike.Now to the problemsThe enemy AI tends to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Enemy's respawn in 1 minute taking away from immersion, for some reason the damage and health system is bad (No joke dogs do 20 Dmg a bite and attack every seconds or so and I've gotton surrounded by em and killed in seconds as the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥take bullets to the head) Stay away from junkyward dogs and gurad dogs is my only tip, The scavenging system can be quite stupid sometimes as well. Over all this game has+Great gameplay mechanics+Interesting storys and characters+Great immersion+Addictive micro managing+Great trade and communication systemThe middle groundGame lacks mercy for new player which can drive people away but not a problemand is more made for intense gamers, not bad but not great graphics.Now the bad -Terrible AI-Unhelpful NPC's-Strange level system-Fast enemy respawnsOverall I'd give this game a 8.9/10 "

												It's F2P but I sure don't see a reason to pay montly, you get practically nothing from doing it. Anyway, It's fun for a free game, you can't be picky in that regard, so I enjoy it. The only downside I've seen, is I haven't really found all that unique loots. It seems you craft most of your stuff and that you usually just get componets from killing stuff. To that regard, there are more than one way to get mats, 1 is just on bodies and then 2 is on various plants and things around the world, also you can your skill up and at certain points skin and harvest harder plants/animals/whatever. So it's not just run around and kill♥♥♥♥♥♥ there are skills and an active improvement based skill set that increases when you do more of stuff close to your skill, increasing it. It's worth a try, the quests seem plentiful and if you have a friend you may be able to pull some harder quests  and creatures earlier on. I started at what seems to be the crafting hub, it seemed the most friendly--farmstead.			"

												Fallen Earth, at its time of release, was actually a pretty fun romp. The world and landscape was vast and full of nice locations, as well as keeping an excellent post apocalyptic tone to everything. There was a lot to do, many places to explore, mutants and enemy factions to hunt down and kill, and hundreds of items to craft. In fact over 90% of all in game items where craft-able at the time. It was a ambitious game that didn't quite hit the mark on a lot of things. While it was a pretty game and offered a lot of options as far as what you could do and where you could go, the big headaches of the game ended up dragging it down. For starters it used a skill system that was pretty open ended. Normally i would say ""Ah hell yeah, i can really be what i want to be!"" Unfortunately that is not the case. It was pretty easy to bork a character and you really had to specialize if you wanted to be remotely effective in anything. The skills you could learn and acquire throughout the game where nothing amazing, there just wasn't any wow factor. It also implemented a quasi magic system, which acted more like a enhancement to a weapon style vs a more caster role. A pure caster is possible, but in game it just wasn't all that effective.Combat itself was about as boring as it could get. Weapons where just a bore to use. The game offered multiple firearm classes to specialize in as well as melee. The animations and sounds where nothing short of drab. Weapons felt like peashooters, even if it was a higher tier rifle or machine gun, all guns just ""felt"" like you where shooting a BB gun. Melee was even worse, as the animations and damage indication was sloppy. On top of that, mobs sit around, waiting to be engaged. I'm a little over early MMO troupes, how about you?However, even though i may be a little harsh on its short coming, with a group of friends, this game can be a blast. There are a ton of areas to explore, side missions to cash in on and a mid/late game faction based pvp zone. This is where it can really get interesting. All players have the option of joining a faction, and each faction has some special skills and perks associated with them. Fighting over control towns and resource fields are really fun with the right gang of people.Fallen Earth will not be for everyone. If you can get past the poor combat system and dated MMO style of quests and combat, it is a pretty big game to explore and get sucked into. Its even F2P, so if you like Post Apoc settings and are up for something different and new, give it a shot. It might surprise the hell out of you.			"

												Don't listen what the negatives say, its like Fox News. Anyways the game is fun especially with friends since you need backup and pretty much I hadn't spent a penny on anything. All items are mostly crafted especially weapons. Yes the mobs are pretty annoying.. but if you had backup you can clear the way. Best apoc MMO experience I had. Clans have a great way to make new friends as for me I had been in 3 already but my 3rd one is my permanant. The game has actually gave me free stuff like a brand christmas themed Chopper during Decemeber of 2014 and I already have like 4 cool mounts to travel in the wasteland. The world itself is so large there are secrets awaiting for you. And don't be shy to ask others if you need help on missions. Most high lvls tend to go back to the starter sector(Sector 1) to help others or ask question. (Start in Embry, high lvls tend to hang out there so you can ask them questions if you want). PvP isnt that bad but its horrid. Prefer PvE instead. There is no player looting either as it is not ment to be like DayZ, H1Z1, Unturned, etc as its not that kind of genre. 10/10 would play			"

												I love Fallout. Well, I loved Fallout 3. I didnt get into the others so much but the post nuclear/disaster/world gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥scenario called out to me. When I first stumbgled into this game in 2009 I was overjoyed that someone had the brains to bring the MMO world a new change. One that didn't invole swords or spells or people running around yelling "" you're not holding the aggro ya nooob"".Thats what this game is. Simply put it's the best MMO I have ever played. Quite string terminology I know but let me tell you why. Moderated help chat. This is a key in any game that people are new to and I think should be a staple in ANY MMO. The GM's are friendly but also help you when you need it. Crafting. I have honestly never played a game with better crafting. Literally everything you can think of can be made. Want a shirt? Craft it. Need new shoes or pants? Craft them. I've heard some people say SWG had the best crafting system but I didnt play it so I cant comment.The classless system. This in my book is a bonus. You can be whoever you want. Want a guy that beats the crap out of things with a 2x4 and shoots pistols? Thats ok. A lot of people get confused by now having a rigid class to stick to but I think its a breath of fresh air. Ok so the graphics might be a bit outdated and theres constant bugs but the heart is there. Not many people are playing it these days but theres still enough people to make a game out of it. My only dissapointment is that Icarus studios sold it. A lot of people grumbled about the micro tranasctions but in my opinion you either buy them or you dont.Anyways if you like fallout then I think you should enjoy this. Plus its free to play now so if you dont like it it wont cost you anything :) Its the closest to the fallout MMO your going to get for a while. "

												Fallen Earth, in my opinion, is one the best MMOs I've played; the community is very helpful when needed and the GMs keep the help section of the chat regulated and reduce spam as much as possible. There are a total of 55 player levels as of now, im only level 30 so I havent really seen everything, but from what I have experienced, a very enjoyable game.         For me, the one biggest problem is definitely the client-to-client synchronization. Players may look as if they are in a position, but really they may not be there. You may also see NPCs glide across the screen due to the synchronization being terrible, but it has improved a bit. In the beginning, you start off with an axe, two knives, and three pellet guns (one being an air rifle and the other two being pistols). After about two or three of the beginning missions, you are awarded a horse for basic transportation, but as you progress further into the game, you get other mounts/vehicles. The basic vehicles are: ATVs, Motorcycles, Dune Buggies, and Interceptor Speedsters (basic cars). Each vehicle has many different variations that you can craft.         The crafting system isnt too complex, but it can be very slow; vehicles can take up to a few days to fully craft from raw materials, but smaller items, such as ammunition, can take a few minutes. If crafting isnt your thing, then there is also an auction house in almost every city; here you can buy player-listed items for how ever much the player lists the item for.         If youre someone who absolutely has to have good graphics, then you may not be too fond of this game; the graphics are pretty bad, but that shouldnt really be too big of a deal if you dont mind it. There are also limits to free to play players however, but they can easily be negated by purchasing any single item from the game's market place. The only limitations i am aware of are a limit to how many chips you can have (currency), a character limit of only one character and no access to the Global chats, but there may be more. In my opinion, its definitely worth it to go 'freemium' by just buying a really cheap item from the store, or by purchasing the Survivalist Package that is offered by Steam. I believe that the limit to the amount of chips you can have if you are free to play is about 100,000 chips. This would be 10 red chips and each red chip is 10,000 chips. Chips go by: Yellow>Red>Blue>White. Blue is 100 white, Red is 100 Blue and Yellow is 100 Red.         There is a total of six different sectors in the game (The entire province is huge, roughly 83km by 83km, according to the Wiki) which all have different fast travel locations that you must first travel to via mount/vehicle. The game also encourages palyers to use roadways with vehicles as they provide a 'boost' and significantly increase your speed. There are also six major factions you can choose to be a part of once you reach Sector 2: The Techs, The Enforcers, Travelers, The Lighbearers, The Vistas, and The CHOTA. Each faction provides unique equipment that you cannot use unless you have a certain reputation with the appropriate faction. All in all, a very enjoyable game that will last a while if you can dedicate yourself to playing.			"

												This game is not bad bad by any means, but it's not Fallout. If you found this and are hoping for a Fallout-MMO, then you'd be sadly mistaken. I haven't spent much time on this game, mainly because it's a bit tedious to actually get started playing it. If you have some free time, and you're looking for a new game to try out then go ahead and download this one. I feel that once you start progressing into the game, it just continues to get better and better as you go. I give Fallen Earth a 7/10.			"

												well, not to far in this game, but its pretty good. It takes a bit to get into, but now that I have gotten to lvl 5 I think I have a decent feel for how it works. Its really an open do as you want thing, the missions at first are very drab feeling, but they teach you how to craft and give you plenty of good starting stuff. Although its a F2P, and does have a shop I have not found anything that is needed to buy. Most of the shop items are just cosmetic. No push to shop for items at all. The community has been really good to play with also.  A dedicated HELP channel is the default for the chat channel and it has decent folks to help, and I have seen a good in game GM presence. One thing that is actually nice is they dont allow the chat to be overrun with garbage either. By that I mean like today,  a guy was talking racist garbage and they shut him down ASAP. SO overall, a bit slow to get started with, but well worth the time to try it out.EDIT:I have a bit more time in now, so thought I would add here. Its a pretty good game. The community has been great, the GM's are actually there, and I have not found anything in your face about having to buy anything from the store. Its not pushing any Pay 2 Win envelopes on you, and even in the PvP area I have finally felt good enought to go to, it was a good time. So far all the equipment I have seen is just as available to a F2Per as to a buyer. Seems they were smart in making the system so that instead of pay to win, you can pay to get something you may just not want to take the time to craft. No super weapons for the buyers only, no uberness in paying to win. The money is so far balanced also, its called Chips in game, and is based on Poker chips, and its not hard to find or sell stuff be it to merchants or other players and actually get some fair return. I was even amazed to see that the things I could buy at my current level on the AH were actually not some overpriced manipulated economy, I could afford them if I wanted them. yep its a good time for a Free Download.

												When I first started this game, I was expecting my computer to not be able to run it from the images.  Luckily, the game ran a scan of my computer and optimized it for my computer and I run at max FPS.  It is Fallout Online which I love.  My issues with the game are that the graphics are not as beautiful as I would like but it is incredible for when it was released back in like 2008.  When I start up the launcher and try to launch it, it will either tell me I cannot connect to internet (which is usually true) or that the server is having an issue, and also, lets not forget, this is a game where you are asked to upgrade but you do not need to, it is a one time request.  However, disregarding the graphics, age, upgrading, and techincal issues, it does everything masterfully.  You can craft and it is not instantly created, making it more realistic, you get a vehicle (horse) from the very beginning so you don't have to walk all over the Grand Canyon.  You get a speed boost when you ride on the main roads, you can roleplay and go killing other players who are in PvP mode.  I recommend it to anyone who loves Fallout and is dying to play it online with people.			"

												this game is sooooo very clunky and horrible controls but if you want a game thats fun to play with friends and solo if you like then this game is ok but the game suffers to have an interesting storyline along with the terrible control schemewhich means there is a crap ton of enemy grinding but alot of games have this and this dosent bother me. but what does is the f2p aspect this game is totally F2P but if you want you can pay a subscription like World of Warcraft but the difference between World of Warcraft and fallen earth is that in WoW the subscription is a reasonable price but fallen earths subscription is terrifyingly expensive			"

												It's a pretty ok game for being free , has a pretty nice crafting system but leveling up can be a pain if you are alone. That and the game is almost dead , there are very little players around.I sincerely wish the devs would do something to draw players in and make this game alive again, this game also has one of the biggest worlds i have ever seen, it took me 2 hours to get across the one zone on horse and thats not even counting the amount of times i had to stop to feed my horse.

												Gritty and plain, this free to play game has an interesting theme for a MMO. Set in the future, after a nuclear and biological war, the human race is completely decimated, leaving only hostile and dying settlements in the Grand Canyon. FPS or third person, this game involves guns and melee on a PvP/PvE lvl with decent customization. The story is very interesting, keeping you playing, but the PvP and endgame PvE is lacking and very unbalanced and the presence of pay to win does not help its cause. Giving you large amounts of playtime and story, this is a good game if you have time on your hands and are seeking a free, simple and story driven MMO that plays more like an RPG. If you enjoyed the Fallout series and want a game that can't beat it, but really tried hard, this is your game.Personal Rating: 2/5			"

												TL;DR : Fallen Earth was a dream, years ago. It was actually one of the best communities I've seen, and had a lot of promise for the future. When it was released, there wasn't a single popular MMORPG that was not drowning in magic and pretty colors with hotkeys.Then the genre of not-magic based MMO's that don't use hotkey and are first person took off, and they all superceeded Fallen Earth nearly immediately. The title was sold after a few months and visible LARGE decrease in playerbase, and immediately turned into a F2P model. Not saying it's 100% business 0% gaming, but it feels like it.			"

												Edit: I've got a decent computer so more thoughts on the game are at the very bottomSimilar to APB Reloaded, only that it crashes instead of giving me huge framerate issues, it has many graphical glitches which lead to framerate issues.I found myself trying really hard to enjoy this game because it's basically a multiplayer version of Fallout, Match made in heaven, right? But it simply just doesn't work at all. All the times I tried to play it, it crashed my computer, even while I was playing on the lowest settings! and to top it all off: these weren't even regular crashes, these were BLUE SCREENS! on WINDOWS 7! I didn't even know these existed on modern systems!Don't play this game, it has♥♥♥♥♥♥compatibility.So, I played the game for a while, it looks sloppy and ugly even on the highest settings, the animations and models look so old and dated. Also the aiming is weird in this game, I'm used to my aim not completely following my crosshair, and instead hitting where the animation plays, which is not how melee works in this game.So, if you were to attack something with a melee weapon, it may look like you hit it but you haven't, and same thing in reverse. Speaking of combat, you cannot hit NPCs which are too far away (even though it looks like you do, blood and dust does show, but their health bars do not deplete) I can understand this was done to prevent people doing this to players, but come on. NPCs. Seriously.It's also very boring, but I'll have to give credit for making the game semi-straight forward. Still not worth downloading.			"

												I'll forego my usual verbiage becasue I feel it's important to get to this message out quickly.I did not enjoy this game. Because it is bad. To clarify, I did not enjoy playing this bad game.So, in summation: It is a bad game and you should play something less bad than Fallen Earth.Promises of a massive, open world and amazing, varied loot are all pointless because the frustration that you experience trying to navigate the interface or work the woeful controls will have you ragequitting long before the supposed grand scale of the map is revealed.The 'tutorial' is a battery of textwall hints.The combat is clunky (and quite frankly stupid-looking).The story is a garbled, unengaging nonsense festival.The... ugh. Forget it.Definitely a 'you get what you pay for' free-to-play title.			"

												This game is unique, and the best FREE MMO Post Apocalyptic Game there is in my opinion. What can you do in it ?: well alot of things. you have a huge in game map to go where ever you want and explore and not Just one map but a bunch of them. it is A PvE And PvP game so you wont lack any action of killing other people and ofc Those that feel blood is not for them got nothing to be scared off they can just stay away of the PvP area's You can Craft Alot of things ! (Alot of em) from small things such as ammo and up too cars and horses or wapons. you wont get bored Trust me on that. And now for the part that makes it Stand out from the rest of the MMO games is that it got an incredibleStable currency at the Aucation unlike any other MMO's wich there currency at market places/Aucation houses is Ridiculous To say the least. this game is perfect for people who look for that Apocalyptic game in wich they free to do What they want and go where they want (its best to play with friends) there are factions wich fight each other over Points of control on the map Did i say that this game is not a Pay To Win Game ?! Hell yeah you dont have to pay money Just to be able to even have a chance vs someone who did pay for the dlc for an example (Winterfall) to all of those who Say it is too hard to get chips in the game (the in game money) all you have to do is go to the Aucation house see what is In high demand and figure out the best way to get it and sell it after you do that a few times you can go to just Buy at low Cost and sell at higher prise to make profit* (My Tip is for free ^_^ ). Now it is true that this game is not as popular as it was a few years ago and in my opinion it is sad and pity. for such a Game to go to waste because of people crying about how hard it is or complain about some small bugs well i have news For you there are no games with no bugs. we are all humans and we make mistakes and im sure that even now there Team is working hard to fix them all. And since its a FREE TO PLAY GAME i dont think anyone got the right to criticize the Team for being lazy for maintaining a FREE TO PLAY game.			"

But they seem kind of weird to me and quite annoying, and it causes me to need to change them all which I dislike. In the end the game seemed alright from the tutorial, but I gave up pretty quickly. You can check the game out if you want but I didn't like it therefore I don't recommend the game to those of you that are like me.			"

												I don't write reviews...at all but the hell this game gave me for the first 20 minutes was pure HELL. First, i spawn in the clone room as usual and proceed with the tutorial. The problems started when i attempted to complete the first kill task, I start the fight to only notice there's no sound. No ax swings, swooshes, GAAAHHH, nothing. So after this, I shrug it off as a small glitch that's in every f2p. I get to the point where you aquire the sniper where thereis again no sound; this annoys me so i decide to exit and search online for a fix (It was simple) so i relaunch it ( did i fail to mention each launch took about 4-5 minutes?) and rejoin where my progress last took place (one pro i found). There was sound, scratchy but there. I start the ""kill the sniper"" objective only to find I once again have no sound. Oh but it dosent end there; I have a 40 degree pov, couldn't move (almost like i was stuck in the floor or wall) and couldn't see the snipers. I couldn't advance any further so I said ♥♥♥♥ this (20 minutes or so later) and decided to write a review.			"

												Detroit, Detroit never changes.This game is a simulation of the aftermath of the collapse of Detroit. As you roam the streets and search for other sane denizens of downtown Detroit, you will encounter many vile mutant hobos, street gangs, feral dogs and even the fabled Detroit Lawnmower gang, who truly are a formidable foe. As you fight to keep your sanity in the streets of Detroit you will uncover its darkest secrets. Detroit is a dangerous place, children, remember to pack your gasmask because Detroit's atmosphere is toxic due to the large amount of drug and automobile use. The number one way to survive this harsh enviroment is to do the Detroit shuffle, I know that this might seem to be a difficult task at first but once you've done it, you'll never forget. Detroit truly is a dangerous place. Overall this Detroit simulation is good, it sums up the trials and tribulations of downtown Detroit perfectly. The weapons are a perfect representation of what one will find in the dark corners of Detroit. The only con to this game is that there is not enough Detroit, as one can never have enough Detroit. Overall, this game is good. If you are looking for a good Detroit simulator then this is the game for you.10/10 -DetroitRemember kids; when in trouble, do the Detroit shuffle. "

												Fallen Earth is an MMORPG game with the Post-Apocaliptic theme. You can either play in first person , either in third person ... But in first person you can only fight.      Its OK for my taste. Its free . Its good for MMORPG lovers . I recommend it.			"

												I would recommend this game mainly because of the great crafting systems it has and is more, ""Oh, you want this? well too bad, either go make it your self or have a tech build it for you."" That might scare so people off, but for people like me who love that sort of game then you might anna give this a try. I also see alot of peopel complaining of slow download times and game crashes, i never had the game crash on me at all and got this thing done downloaded and playing in under 30 minutes, which for me is fast. Another thing Fallen earth does that i like is the fact you can either be in 3rd person or 1st, i for one enjoy it in first person, but to each there own i guess.			"

												This game is quite wonderful if you didn't play fallout new vegas before it, many people who don't like Fallen Earth claim thats their reasoning, and I can agree, when I first played Fallout: New Vegas, I drew many comparrisons towards Fallen Earth, and its entirely based on their core gameplay styles, rather than mechanics. But this game is more balanced towards PvE, unlike fallout, you actually have true crafting and scavenging that doesn't just give you what your looking for, you have to make it, or learn it, unless you have friends in high places, such is the true life of a survivor in an apocolypse. This game also offers a nice explaination for one of gamings biggest mysteries, respawning. You have a collar, which transfers your DNA into a chamber, reconstructs you atom by atom, and gives you a ""new life"" as a clone of yourself, something I wish was in other games rather than ""you died, restart"" the game is vastley large, I could easily see Skyrim's map fitting within all the sectors, possibly more than once, and weapons are vast in the beginning, as you get stronger, weapons tend to become more scarce, with good reason, so you rely much more on your skills than an overpowered Bumper Sword, and with the character menus, such as Abilities and Stats, your options are endless in what type of character, or ""toon"" you'd like to create, vs. Bethesda's way of ""upgrade it all over time"" your more limited, but in a good way, and you have the ability to reset all your stats and start over to specifically fit how you play, along with the adition of mounts, which start off bad, give you 7 types of vehicles to choose from, Horse, ATV, Motorcycle, Dune Buggy, Chopper, Station wagon, and Sports car, they also have different types of each, an example would be ""dune buggy"" vs. ""cargo buggy"" or ""chopper"" vs. ""Tribal Chopper"" they have different stats, and each vehicle handles certain terrain better than others, as well as the ability to have more than one vehicle. The crafting is intuitive and very thourough, with real time crafting that takes time to make more complex items so you can't just spit out the best of something like a machinegun with the right tradeskill componants, it gives you a greater sense of acomplishment by knowing you built something that took hours rather than buying it from the Auction House, though as I said before, with friends in high places, anything is possible, I suggest craft early on as much as you can, ask the Help Channel for any information, for myself and others often know detailed answers on how to complete a task or quest, or locate specific items. The Wiki can be useful too, utilizing tools given to the player and figuring out your best way to play is the greatest part of the journey, to see all the pieces fall together:... IN SHORT: This game is for DEDICATED PLAYERS, those who will take the time to do these things listed, and many more unlisted tasks, some amazing, some time crunching, to acomplish your higher, longterm goals. I recommend this game to those looking for something to pour their hours into and want something that keeps giving them different challanges to overcome, AS FOR THE CASUAL PLAYER, I suggest giving it a try and seeing how you enjoy it, but not taking it to heart that it will be like fallout or anything that simple, its a rough game, for rough players, and if you don't like it, you can simply move on to another game, though I must warn you, I've found few MMORPGs as interesting as this one, only POTCO could hold my attention longer than this, and that may have been because of its simplisity and fun nature towards its gamers. With that being said... Enjoy the Apocolypse.			"

I have not played it in many months, however, so patching and the like may have fixed many of those problems.

												It's addicting to play, I like the whole idea of building things to use in the game.  I'm going to list the Cons first:Cons:-Graphics are pretty basic, but the game it free-There are about a billion quests and you can only have so many on the active page so you can spend a lot of time wandering around doing quests and not realize you had two others you could have done while you were there.  Now you have to go back where you just were to do those.-If you follow along the recommended quest lines, and skip the others in order to level up, you will be in over your head quickly.  Not to mention some of the quest lines are 25 minute rides on a horse between them.-This can be a good thing or a bad thing, stands out bad to me, but respawns of enemies/creatures is WAY too fast.  I understand that if there are a lot of people playing the same area with the same quests, you need to have respawns set faster in order for people not waiting so much, but this game has been out for a while and it's very rare to be questing near anyone else.  If you are involved in clearing an area out and meet the boss, you retreat a little to reload/heal whatever and you will run into all the people you just killed and die in a horde.  They really need to make some of the bigger quest jobs into their own instance without enemy/creature respawn.  The game uses instances for some quests, they just need to do it more often, like the PRISON!!Pros:-I find people are very helpful in help chat.  I have seen the same question come up in less than 10 minutes from three different people and someone is willing to answer it all three times without being a smartass.-Lots of higher level players give things out to lower levels players which helps a lot in the leveling process.  I got 50R from someone early in the game and can buy anything I want now at my level and I have a ton left over.  Thanks dude!-It's fun gameplay, As a final note, you can do surveys on the Fallen Earth website (not really, they redirect you to a company that handles it).  These surveys can drive you insane.  You can choose to do a 15 minute survey for a certain amount of points and then do 10 minutes of a ""pre"" survey to determine that you are not a match for the ""real"" survey and receive nothing.  That needs to be fixed.  I think when I initially started doing surveys for points, I spent two hours doing them, selected about 15 different surveys and only received credit for doing two.  Not worth my time.  You should at least get something for doing the ""pre"" surveys even if you arent a match for the real one.Anyways, fun game, kinda basic, surveys can be PITA.			"

												This is the best MMO I have ever played. I played it 6 years almost exclusively. Why the G1/owners, continue to milk this game for every penny they can on store items and new ""junk"", without adding new in game content, is mind boggling. For 6 years I would recommend this as a p2p game. Now? I won`t recommend it as a f2p game. The game let down it`s most stalwart fans, imho. It is barely a good f2p game, ""now"",  because when max level is reached there isn`t a lot to do. And the majority of gamers will always ""tend to"" rush to max level. FE was never intended to be a play to win game as it was ""supposed"" to continually expand it`s in game playable content.This may as well be a boxed play to win game now. Not eben a Hint, if it will ever get new playable content. No, now it`s just a pay to play, as you can`t do anything decent in the game unless you spend money on it. Too bad a game company as prominent as G1 failed avid MMO gamers and got greedy. The funny part is they can`t possibly be making much money off this once great game. JMO, and exactly what you paid to read it.			"

The first 3 hours of this were spent simply installing crap onto my computer for the game and I really wish I could go back in time and undo all of that because I'm never going to play this thing again. After that I had to create an  account on the company's website just to be able to play. The whole game also feels like its going ""It's not Fallout, its my own original game Fallen Earth!"" For Christ's sake, you even start in an underground lab like area.Not recommended. Go play Fallout or even RAGE.			"

												It's a great game if you can get over 2011 graphics, has a unique  leveling system with the addition of a tradeskill system, obtaining resources can be challenging in lower level areas but you will almost always find the essentials, combat is enjoyable in both third person and first.

												I've played this game on and off over the years. I met some great people as well. I really like the quests and crafting system. Feels a lot like a pay to win kind of game, but it's free to play, so income has to come in some way. The only thing that's sad about it is the player base. In S1 there are plenty of people to run into. As you go on, it gets far more empty. Maybe one day it'll recover, but overall I would recommend it. Just be sure to bring friends along.			"

												Yeah... no..Looking at it, I thought I'd get an open world post-apocalyptic survival game that I'd get addicted to. It turns out it's just a poorly made MMORPG with no excitment in it whatsoever. It's complete and utter bullcrap. If you're looking for a decent MMORPG, try Neverwinter, any of the Elder Scrolls games, Wizard/Pirate 101, or Star Wars the Old Republic. Most RPGS will be better than this, I guarantee you that.

												I don't write reviews...at all but the hell this game gave me for the first 20 minutes was pure HELL. First, i spawn in the clone room as usual and proceed with the tutorial. The problems started when i attempted to complete the first kill task, I start the fight to only notice there's no sound. No ax swings, swooshes, GAAAHHH, nothing. So after this, I shrug it off as a small glitch that's in every f2p. I get to the point where you aquire the sniper where thereis again no sound; this annoys me so i decide to exit and search online for a fix (It was simple) so i relaunch it ( did i fail to mention each launch took about 4-5 minutes?) and rejoin where my progress last took place (one pro i found). There was sound, scratchy but there. I start the ""kill the sniper"" objective only to find I once again have no sound. Oh but it dosent end there; I have a 40 degree pov, couldn't move (almost like i was stuck in the floor or wall) and couldn't see the snipers. I couldn't advance any further so I said ♥♥♥♥ this (20 minutes or so later) and decided to write a review.			"

												It's got a lot of problems, such as dated graphics, a fairly large learning curve, blocky animations, bugs, glitches, and a weak story. I've only got a few hours in it, and I had considered quitting it already. It was pretty tough to decide whether to recommend or not, given all of its problems, coupled with the fact that I still can't decide if I really like it. I'll also say it is very MMORPG-like. By that I mean, it's pretty much bland and generic in its gameplay, unless you like that type of game. All that said, what it does have is a magnificent atmosphere. It's basically a hybrid between fallout 2, fallout New Vegas and a very mild, husk-like reminder of borderlands. I think the atmosphere and appocalyptic world is the only thing that will keep me playing this game for any longer, tbh. I was very impressed with the combat and overall gameplay as I played the tutorial in the beginning, but it got stale pretty quick. I think it could be fun as a social experience, and/or with friends, but if you're going solo like I will be, you're probably not gonna have a good time.At the end, I would say try it out for a little while to see if you like it, because its free, and if you like it, then great, theres a new player in the game and you get enjoyment, and if you dont like it, then you haven't lost any money. WARNING: This game does take a pretty long time to download the update at the beginning, so just beware.			"

												After playing this game on and off since 2012 (and not using the steam launcher as much as I could cos it chugged the game for me for soem reason) I have to say teh game is dieing. The gameplay itself is a blast and you will have fun for the first 15-20 levels, I can promise you that. The graphics are good,, though not amazing, the crafting system is one of teh best I've seen in an MMO that is not Eve Online, it does the whole real time crafting thing real well. The community has always been pretty toxic when you step into the PvP aspects oft eh game but that is to be expected as some people have grudges with others that span years now or they simply hate a faction regardless of who is on it (there are 6 total factions though now a days they do not matter due to low player count in game and removal of faction based bonuses, the only advantage now is the armor cosmetics and which faction chat your can talk in). The PvE community however is prettygood and open to help people.Now the bad. G1G (the company that bought FE from Icarus Studios) have been doing the minimal to keep the game ticking over and making money. The game was meant to be spread over 9 total zones and having an in depth and intriguing plot and story line. When G1G bought the game I belive 4 of the zones where done (don't get me wrong the zones in this game are HUGE and pretty well detailed). Now since 2012 to now, only 1 of the new zones has been added and it's one totally thought up by G1G and has practically zero addition to game play. It is effectively a mix of 2 zones or 2 parts of 2 zones I should say, saying that it does look good, it just has no body or soul, it's just that, looks and some newarea to grind in to get a new tier of gear. It's nice however it took over a year to finish and just looks like a rehash.Now another thing that is a MAJOR killer in this game is MASSIVE CONSTANT LAG. I'm not kidding when I say if your playing early morning in the US or late at night in the US, you will have in game lag whenever you go to loot a body (1-10 seconds to loot where normally it's instant) or if you gather a resource node. It also happens in the chat with 1-5 second lag between hitting enter and the post appearing, if it appears at all (I've had messages just go into the ether and no, not muted or anything, just parts of a convo just never get delivered). These problems result in G1G having to restart the servers at least once a day where they have to take them down for up to 90 minutes, sometimes longer, just so the game doesnt crash.Now saying all that I must say give the game a shot, it is a good game and the latency issues are newish...well month or two of it happening every day, butif you love post apoc games and just want to drive around mad max style in a car or beaten up dune buggy with a 50 cal on the roof, this is the game for you. It just sucks how most people don't give it a good run past level 20 as at 40+ (level 55 is max level currently) is where it starts to open up and give you freedom to do whateer you want.			"

												I would recommend this game mainly because of the great crafting systems it has and is more, ""Oh, you want this? well too bad, either go make it your self or have a tech build it for you."" That might scare so people off, but for people like me who love that sort of game then you might anna give this a try. I also see alot of peopel complaining of slow download times and game crashes, i never had the game crash on me at all and got this thing done downloaded and playing in under 30 minutes, which for me is fast. Another thing Fallen earth does that i like is the fact you can either be in 3rd person or 1st, i for one enjoy it in first person, but to each there own i guess.			"

												Pretty fun, especially since it's free, I haven't played it in ages but I have fond memories of roaming the lands with my friend, we did quests, got loot, pretended to be hobos living in dumpsters, untill we found an empty building and used that as a house, that was pretty fun. For a Free to Play game it's quite easy to advance without buying♥♥♥♥♥♥ infact, I got myself an ATV, full set of decent armor, 2 pistols, ammo and pleanty of weapons, I even went on raids with some friends I met through a clan. Just thinking about all this makes me feel kind of sad, sad that I haven't played it in ages, and those firends have left, never to be seen again. The gameplay is pretty grindy, but advancing and getting better gear is very rewarding and the game world is ♥♥♥♥ING HUGE HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ I once set out on my horse, travelled the lands for abut 3 hours straight, I ended up in some huge rusty old town, I have no clue if I will ever find the town I first set out in ever again. Infact, just writing this review makes me want to go play the game again actually I think I'll do that.			"

												This game is fun, especialy for those how like post apocalyptic survival kinda games. You basicly go around doing missions from npcs and craft weapons, armor, vichles, etc. Theres alot of wierd creatures in the world that you can kill and harvest after, moast of them are mutants or npc bandits. Don't wory about getting killed and losing your stuff because moast of the map is pve, but you still have to whatch out for  agressive npcs. The ones you enconter in the first town are quite weack but every town you go to the npcs are stronger and cooler, so i advise you to craft the best armor and weapons possible in every town you go. Over all it's a really fun game and will entertain you until you get bored of it and find a new one. Because has we all know thats how games work.			"

												Has allot of potential. Devs don't give enough attention to it though in the areas that it needs large amounts of improvement. My main complaint isn't the fighting physics (while they aren't very good, being that you select a monster/person and just let your character hit them over and over again on their own, think world of warcraft in a free2play game) but instead the hook to come back and play more. I just simply couldn't get immersed in the gameplay, it lacked a good storyline, and instead gave out shi tty quests as a way to waste your time. Upgrades are disgustingly expensive, leveling up takes forever, and pvp isn't even under discussion. Plain and simple, imho, its a bad game. But hey, it's free, don't listen to some dipsh its comment you read on steam reviews. Download it and try it yourself, it only took like 2-3 hours.			"

												The graphics are terrible. Now, this wouldnt be so bad if its 2014 and the gameplay trailer had amazing graphics.At least with WoW they made the game a long time ago so its an excuse to not have good graphics, but this?But what is worse is the launcher. It took me 3 DAYS to download this dissapointment. To put that in perspective. I downloaded GTA 5, which is 16 gbs in 1 day. Fix your♥♥♥♥♥♥The gameplay is clunky and the instructions are unclear. The first person mode is glitchy as all hell, and I could barely walk to the other towns without some high level destroying me.The story looks like it was pulled out of a toddlers imagination and turned into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vampire love story for teens.Also, the map is big. And I'm not saying this is bad, its just that the map is WAY TOO ♥♥♥♥ING BIG. It breaks the gameplay and is so boring when I have to walk for 45 minutes just to complete a mission.I may have not played a lot, but I played enough.Overall, this game is a big, dissapointing pile of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3d models and bad voice acting, peppered with bad camera angles and broken game mechanics. 2/10.

												Fallen Earth is the story of a really awesome idea getting destroyed by poor presentation, horrible gameplay, and just making a great example an how not to make a MMORPG. The story is sort of simple, you are a clone and stuff happened and then other stuff happened and now you are in the open (after a 20 min tutorial). I'm being for real I didn't know what was going on the entire time. The dialouge is horrendous which becomes a problem since thats how you get both important information and quests. Even though it's free it's not worth your time.			"

												I was there at start before the layoff when everyone got to eat their contract and was told to walk. The skelton crew that followed and the people who tried to keep it together (sorry Tiggs) just couldn't do more than bandage the wound. Was an awesome idea and I loved what it could have been but it's over. The company who owns it now isn't even the original one because they gave up on it and essential bugs that needed to be addressed never will as the only people who really understood it were fired early in a bid to get what little cash they could. My guess is the company that now holds it is just doing the same thing, trying to get some random subs before dropping it too. RIP Fallen Earth and thanks for the few good memories there were.			"

												very much like Fallout and STALKER. This game is very interesting with its PvP and mechanics which i enjoy very much and the transportations like horse's, and vehicles are a good feature. The community of Fallen Earth is the best part, everyone doesnt try to kill you they're pretty much friendly unless you kill someone then theyre gunna all go in a all out war with you. If you play PvP and kill someone with a different faction there WILL be consequences like for example, getting more noticed which is a problem since that will lead to death for you. I reccomend this game if you love Fallout and/or STALKER.			"

												Overall, the game has a great concept.  Playing alone makes the game turn boring quickly - same goes for gathering resources.  It doesn't have jaw - dropping graphics, but the level of customization and immersion is quite the spectacle.  FE does a great job with capturing the ""post - apocalyptic"" setting, especially out on desolate stretches of sand and dust.  For a F2P game, it's a great piece of work that shouldn't be over looked.			"

												The game is all right I suppose. It is an open world game that is based around the Fallout series. Though Fallen Earth is a much more boring experience in my opinion. When I finished the tutorial, the beginning video made the game look bigger than it actually was. The graphics are terrible and the HUD was just all over the place. It was too lagy, and even on the lowest graphics settings possible for my computer. I do not recommend this game.			"

												  When I saw this game, I expected to be somewhat of a DayZ experience to the extent that other players would be trying to kill you.  I was very wrong in this assumption.  It turns out that the only enemies are the npcs.  Speaking of npcs, they aren't even ok.  All they do is walk around in a ten inch radius and will only attack you if you shoot at them or get really really close.  Even if you're like three feet in front of their face, they will not attack you.    The weapon switch is also very finnicky.  It took me five minutes just to get my character to dual wield. (that was either the game or just my lack of a good mouse  If you are looking for a game that has just an ok gameplay, I would bring this one up.  But if you want a good survival game with good fighting and gameplay, do NOT get this one.			"

												This is the best MMO I have ever played. I played it 6 years almost exclusively. Why the G1/owners, continue to milk this game for every penny they can on store items and new ""junk"", without adding new in game content, is mind boggling. For 6 years I would recommend this as a p2p game. Now? I won`t recommend it as a f2p game. The game let down it`s most stalwart fans, imho. It is barely a good f2p game, ""now"",  because when max level is reached there isn`t a lot to do. And the majority of gamers will always ""tend to"" rush to max level. FE was never intended to be a play to win game as it was ""supposed"" to continually expand it`s in game playable content.This may as well be a boxed play to win game now. Not eben a Hint, if it will ever get new playable content. No, now it`s just a pay to play, as you can`t do anything decent in the game unless you spend money on it. Too bad a game company as prominent as G1 failed avid MMO gamers and got greedy. The funny part is they can`t possibly be making much money off this once great game. JMO, and exactly what you paid to read it.			"

But seriously not, I've played this game for a month and got to lvl 55 and to do so all you have to do is kill loot and sell and get a good clan to get some new friends and hang out in the Wasteland. It has all kinds of cool looking armor and weapons but here ammo can become scarce sometimes if you dont watch how much u have.

Where to even begin....Pros; -Free-Easy to learn-Good for teaching / good first game to get into if youre trying to learn how to games-Doesnt take up much space-Runs really well / Isnt CPU nor GPU sensitiveCons;-Poor/Uninteresting/Generic Story-Looks like... Well, Pixel games are better.-Extremely repetitive/boring gameplay.-Enemies have the skill and threat of a one legged kangaroo.-Theres only like... One of each type of gun.

												Idk why people call it pay2win when almost all weapons are from crafting...most are much more better than the pay weps...yeah sure its a grinding game but when you have the level its pretty fun especially with friends if you dont have 1 and...you're practically lazy...well thats your own fault game is pretty fun yeah SOME places are empty but everything else are just hostile but its still your fault when you are going alone ona hostile zone that you still cant handle alone aim is good but some issues are just about to be fixed i recommend this as 8/10 yeah bugs..and pretty much slow level and crafting time takes more than 5 hours..(well some crafts like building a car) free to play players can only craft 1 item at a time...but despite the crafting item completion time others are pretty fun...yeah ok some people dont like it because you have to craft and do some stuff but when you reach to good levels and good friends to play with you if you want fast leveling get friends to help out that may/may not need the leveling requirements to get fun the game is open world and pvps an faction wars its fun so dont be such a butthurt if you dont like the game then dont play it and stop telling people not to play it because EVERYBODY have different taste for gameplays and besides theres alot of ways to kill/level up fast/choke/snipe/smash skulls/craft and war against other factions			"

												very much like Fallout and STALKER. This game is very interesting with its PvP and mechanics which i enjoy very much and the transportations like horse's, and vehicles are a good feature. The community of Fallen Earth is the best part, everyone doesnt try to kill you they're pretty much friendly unless you kill someone then theyre gunna all go in a all out war with you. If you play PvP and kill someone with a different faction there WILL be consequences like for example, getting more noticed which is a problem since that will lead to death for you. I reccomend this game if you love Fallout and/or STALKER.			"

												Overall, the game has a great concept.  Playing alone makes the game turn boring quickly - same goes for gathering resources.  It doesn't have jaw - dropping graphics, but the level of customization and immersion is quite the spectacle.  FE does a great job with capturing the ""post - apocalyptic"" setting, especially out on desolate stretches of sand and dust.  For a F2P game, it's a great piece of work that shouldn't be over looked.			"

												Very interesting, blending FPS into a gritty-looking survival/crafting game. It is definitely quite a game, and very much worh a look if you are okay with making another account somewhere else. This game does revolve around gathering, so you will find yourself stopping a lot to get things that you may want or need, but it doesn't hinder the game in my opinion, as it doesn't feel like ""farming"" in the traditional MMO sense, but in a survival sense, since this is about you surviving in this post apocalyptic world. Definitely fun to RP with, I can tell you that. X3			"

												This is a great MMO to play with friends, I've probably spent 70 hours just playing with friends alone. Playing it by yourself is BORINGFirstly, the gamestaff and helpers are never online, I'm not sure if they are paid, or just volunteer, during my last weeks play, I found no staff on, and it was a Saturday at 5 PM PST. The players are very toxic and rude, mostly calling eachother out, taking peoples grinding spots, and just general ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gery.The games content is completely outdated. You can watch Lestat2150's video about the 2015 version 


YouTube™ Video: Fallen Earth Revisited - 5 Years Later - Worth Your Time? 

			Views: 34,285		

			It’s 2156, and the world has been destroyed by both nuclear and bio-chemical means. Your story takes place in one of the few habitable places left in the world, the Grand Canyon.		

 He sums up all the points. The game still has a small playerbase, mainly veteran players. But the biggest issue is the lack of content, and the sub-par NPC raids and grinds.You should try the game out, but be cautious as the gameplay gets very repettive and dull. Once you venture out and gain levels the game becomes fun. But it is an insanely grindy game. You can craft lots of weapons and armor and can be almost completed sustainable.Would i recommend this game? Sure, try it out. BUT expect to grind and play old content for hours on end to farm some weapon or item.			"

												The main reason I am recomending this game is because of the fact that I can actually run it- that, and it is free. The combat is quite poor, as you can be stabbed from 10 feet away, and the combat animations are subpar at best. Graphics look like they're from Chaser, and there is an odd way to go into First Person (by standing near a wall). Voice acting is pretty horrendous. Don't even get me started on one of the most clunky interface systems in any game I've ever played. Also, AI are mindless idiots at best.Then again, I shouldn't expect much for a free game.On to the positives then; the Character creation is cool, giving you a free range of choices that are not limited by any Premuim feature. The crafting system is intresting, making you have to scavenge for books full of useful info and techniques. Although I only have spent 2/3 hours, I can tell that the map is quite large.Right now, I'd have to give the game a 6.5/10. Its okay, and if you have a crap computer like mine (windows 7) and can't run anything else, then this will provide some free little fun. If this gets enough ratings, I'll update my review. Thanks :)			"

It was too lagy, and even on the lowest graphics settings possible for my computer. I do not recommend this game.			"

												After wandering the wasteland of Fallen Earth for more than 200 hours, thought it was time to give my opinon.   There is a staggering amount of quests, mutant creatures, and crafting.   Being this is such an awsome free mmo, I would rate this a 9/10.   This game has been around for years now, and still has alot of people coming back for more.   The graphic are smooth and realistic.   A variety of sound, grapic, and other setting options.   The help chat is one of the best I have ever seen!   Hard not to get a help queston answered by more than one player.   The ability to ride horses, atv's, and sweet cars across a very large map makes me want to get 3D headset.   If there were air and water craft, I would probably never want to stop gaming!?.			"

												Fallen Earth is a free TPS/FPS. It takes place in the post-apocolyptic future where you have to scavenge items which are in bad condition like the items Questionable milk, Sklunky beer and Tainted meat. You complete missions which I guess revolves around a story. In this big open world Grand Canyon you can travel from a peaceful little village to a Flaming house Guarded by level 70 blade dancers with OP shivs. The graphics are ok but the combat mode on and off thing is a little annoying. It doesen't lag often but you need to either be really rich or premium to craft something good. 8/10 because I hate when premium is shoved in your face "

Don't even get me started on one of the most clunky interface systems in any game I've ever played. Also, AI are mindless idiots at best.Then again, I shouldn't expect much for a free game.On to the positives then; the Character creation is cool, giving you a free range of choices that are not limited by any Premuim feature. The crafting system is intresting, making you have to scavenge for books full of useful info and techniques. Although I only have spent 2/3 hours, I can tell that the map is quite large.Right now, I'd have to give the game a 6.5/10. Its okay, and if you have a crap computer like mine (windows 7) and can't run anything else, then this will provide some free little fun. If this gets enough ratings, I'll update my review. Thanks :)			"

												Before I start my review, I would just like to point out that this is not from recent experience. I played this game about a year ago, and I hated it. First of all, I had to ask people how to enter FP perspective. Not that I think that it's the game's fault though. Anyways, the graphics are about as good as with a mixture of great models and horrible textures. Also, the reason I'm not reviewing it for the recent version is because when I started it up, all of the textures were missing, after downloading the 3+ GB game. tl;dr:1/10 would not apocalypse again.

												I've played this game on and off over the years. I met some great people as well. I really like the quests and crafting system. Feels a lot like a pay to win kind of game, but it's free to play, so income has to come in some way. The only thing that's sad about it is the player base. In S1 there are plenty of people to run into. As you go on, it gets far more empty. Maybe one day it'll recover, but overall I would recommend it. Just be sure to bring friends along.			"

												After nearly a year away from the game, I came back. First thing I did was get rid of my old useless starter character. I created a new one in a few minutes. I arrived in the starter area after a few loading screens AND, that is as far as I got. The lag was so intense that my game froze three times in two minutes. The server lag is more than just a nuiscance, it is quite literally fatal. As I write this, Fallen Earth is waiting to respond in the background. This game, I have some fond memories from it. Now I'll never be able to relive them.These Developers also created APB Reloaded. I love and hate that game, but Fallen Earth was always so dear to me. The Dev's really should have focused more on FE than APB. This game gives you so much more progressive choice than APB's ""you need to level up your standing with this person to get socks,"" outlook. I can't recommend you buy this game. Look at other reviews as well. They will show you what is truly going on right now, even if like me you don't get to see it for yourself. Good luck Clones, I will miss every one of you.			"

												I didn't get to play this game, nor am I going to bother trying ever again. I downloaded the 5.4GB from Steam in about 30-40mins yesterday, but then before I could actually play the game it apparently had to update. No problem I thought as it is just a 130MB update. However it said it was going to take 11 hours to download the 130MB update, when it should take less than 1min! I gave up after an hour and assumed it was a problem that would be resolved the following day. It is slightly faster, my wait time is down to 3 hours now, but that is 3 hours too long for me. By the time this update finishes they will have released another one. Frankly the game doesn't look like it is worth the hassle or the wait, not to mention the fact that poor servers don't bode well for an online game. I am going to get my 5.4GB (plus the 25MB update) back. I'd advise that you avoid this game and don't waste your time or your hard drive space.			"

												*Edit* I have more hours in this game than steam has reportedThis could have been a exceptional game. The devs are completely out of touch with what direction they should take this game. Crafting is more or less useless, which makes gathering useless which in turn makes 50% of the game meaningless. PvP is hard to get into. It's geared to favor those who have been playing for a long time rather than skill. PvM is buggy, enemies can melee you from a distance, kinda reminds me of SWG in that reguard. This is one of those games that could have been really great. But its also one of those games where the devs listened to a fraction of the player base and now you have a bad game with hardly any players. Those players who are active consider themselves elite. The devs have promised so much in the past, such as housing, better more meaningful crafting and gathering, BALANCED PvP. and over the years only minor bug fixes are what they give.I cant recommend this game as it is. It almost like its in constant beta. Such a shame.			"

												When i first played this back in 2012, i was using an ""All-in-one"" touchscreen computer, and to say the least, the graphics were not that good (on my end), but here's my actual opinionPro's:- The combat alright to say the least when it comes to a cycle between a fps/rpg battle system, but it has it's merits for it's time.- with the current level of graphics i COULD muster, the game's visual was ok.- The npc/monster/enemy AI was mediocre at best, but that's common in most fps/rpg games.Now for the Con's:- The explorability was ok, but unguided in it's purpose.- The story line was (IMO) uninteresting, and lacked that edge that captured the player's attention.- The enemies felt re-hashed in different areas of the game, and it was repetitous.Decision?Try the game, and see for yourself. if you feel it might be a predecessor to Borderlands; then you might be right. but i wouldn't reccommend buying the dlc for obvious reasons. I tried it out of a whim, and got bored of it shortly after playing a few hours.			"

												Very boring, lack luster graphics and has choppy gameplay mechanics. I would stay away from it but since it's free, try it yourself!			"

												Walked into hallway, walls explode with texture glitches.  Tried playing anyway, until I realized I was playin futuristic Runescape with a lot less work put into it.  I'm not 10 anymore, so I didn't like it.  Even if I was still 10, I wouldn't like this game because it sucks.  The AI is something I could surpass with HTML5 script, even though you can't use HTML5 to write AI.  UI is so bad that trying to do anything is as complicated as the thoughts that go through Stephen Hawking's head.   5 gigs of wasted storage, 2 hours of wasted time.  Do not download this game, if you do, you support isis.			"

												Dear makers of this wonderful and very entertaining game...     Shove this *thing* up your arses! Wanna know why? Well.. let's start from the beginning, shall we?     First of all this game is free... that mean that the persons that created it must be nuts to let it be free. Of course, it's free and that means that they must find a way to make money out of it one way or another. And that means P2W. And if we hold for a minute and think it's a good thing. You must get your money out for the effort that you've put into this game. But... to make two separate classes... the poor ones that play for free.... and the rich ones who invest good money just to be better than the rest and of course, to win. Well. With that said... we arrive at the subject that I've wanted to express. To make a game like this one and to ruin the good time of it... that is a crime. Maybe I was in a bad mood. But it takes you like 1 to 2 hours for an effect to dissapear for you to be able to view the ironsight. That is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ttiest thing that I've encountered in a game in my entire life. And for what? For the *sickness* to dissapear and when it does to tell you that you must pay money for the ironsight? Oh no! NO! This game broke my day. And the rest of them. How can a man / or men could think of such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. And don't you tell me ,, Well, it didn't pop that I have to pay money for the ironsight'' cause someday a person will introduce that into a game. And when that day comes, you can be sure that I for one will throw that game out of the window.     Passing on... the rest of the game is ok. It has first person view, and that is a good thing for a F2P. The gameplay is very entertaining, I'll give it that.Don't believe me?JUST PLAY IT AND FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF!			"

												This Game Was Fun when It Came Out. I was And Original Member before Steam. I played It also when Gamers 1st Took over  they Did A great Job in the Beginning. I just Joined Again and Prepaid for My Wife And myself. But Unfortunatly I could Not reccommend The Game Any Longer As the Devs No longer Support it. And They Are letting the Game Die. The community if Very Good Mostly Diehards Like myself. if your just looking for a free Gameplay It might be worth your time but I won't be Paying another sub As it feels They Are just taking our Money And putting nothing back Into the Game. I really With gamers 1st Would let someone who cares about the Game take it over as it was So fun and the Game Concept was Well Written			"

												A cycle that seems to be unfortunately common with games like this. Originally it was an excellent, albeit, slow-paced MMO. Open-world with a cool Mad Max style to it that promoted cooperation. You don't have supplies or can't kill something? Join a clan and they can hook you up with materials or supplies, even help you kill what you need. The game even had active GMs that were usually pleasant and active in the game's community. AND THEN IT SWITCHED DEVELOPERS!The new developers couldn't maintain the old-timers  so the community took a nose dive into spiked floor. Whoever is left from the old days now puts their rivalries aside so they can at least have something to do. Overall, it's a shadow of its former self with a dead/dying community. HOWEVER don't take my word for it, I admittedly haven't played in months and could very well have a somewhat active community again.While this is obviously a ""back in my day...!"" review, I'm giving it a negative rating. The game is free so try it out for yourself and you may actually like it.			"

												The game is overall decent at best. It is definitely a survivial game no doubt about that, however it is old and has some a terrible gameplay in my opinion i believe the game would be pretty good if you could control the player as in many newer MMO's.. Another thing i instantly noticed is that crafting takes time and better items take longer time, makes it realistic but not what im looking for really. The fact that you craft whilst you fight, hunt, mine, ride makes no sense at all. Whenever i did something it didn't feel right, for me the game had no story/intro/movie that really said yes this is the reason im here. Overall the gameplay is just too old for me.. and no story? nah.. sry..			"

APB is still♥♥♥♥♥..After all of my playtime on this, once amazing game, i decided, a f2p cant get anywhere on an mmorpg xD so i gave up all together. Combat is lame, Only the tutorial NPCs have unique voice acting, AND IF YOU LIKE GAMES WHERE YOU HAVE TO GRIND JUST TO GET TO LVL 55 AND DO THE SAME ♥♥♥♥ING EVENTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN, I RECCOMEND RECCOMEND RECCOMEND! Also, how do you get a game out of your library? :) APB reloaded is nothing but a gta knockoff and i want it outta there, its like a wine stain in a white carpet :)			"

												I've played Fallen Earth from 2012, and here's my Review and heres why most people don't know what there talking about when it comes to negative Reviews.This game Defines Apocolyptic MMO RPGs as one of the greatest yet.Here's why Players put all this foolish Negative Feed Back and Here's why:Most new Players find it very difficult to play this game because it's not easy to play, It's challenging, most players want a simple and Easy MMO And if that's the case then this MMO RPG is NOT for you.Alot of Players find it hard to gain chips, if your serouis about this game and actually take the time to explore the massive gameworld and see what's worth what, gaining chips is relativly easy easy for new players.The crafting system is one of the best I've seen in an MMORPG making it time consuming to figure out where to find certain matierals or if you have the chips just buy them off the auction if you have the chips to, and if there's any on the Auction. (Most players think this is stupid and QQ about it, This MMO RPG is not for you then.)PvP is Unfair? Doubtful, you just need to know how to create a proper PvP build not just slap your AP points in whatever you think is best, they do make Fallen Earth Character Planners which you can access online by just punching it into google search.The thing with PvP is most players now are experinced Veterens playing, making it more challenging for newer players that hit higher levels to PvP, which is where Clans come into Play. Once you find a clan It's not so hard learning the ropes of PvP, however it is still a steep learning Curve.Everythings to Expensive. Well heres the thing about that. It's the Apocalypse, Nothings going to be cheap especially not Vehicles, your lucky to even aquire one, most players think this is stupid However it's not. It's challenging just the way a game like this was Met to be.Staff are useless GM's are bad? Doubtful, out of the few thousand players that play Fallen Earth theres only a Few GM's online so you need to stop and think you have other players PMing them at once to, they can't drop everything just to Help you. Your no Special then everyone else, The GMs/Staff are very Helpful once they actually get around to Responding to you, If you think there's only 2 or sometimes 3 GM's on at a time. A few Thousand Players.. Don't have high hopes of getting a responce. Your better off Submiting a Support Ticket @ Gamersfirst.com rather then comming here and QQing about it because you think your special.Now my Plus's about the game:The game engine may be old but no one has yet to make a better MMO RPG, most game reviewers look at a game by graphics and gameplay, If it has bad graphics it automically get's a bad Review just because. That's now a game Reviewer at all but more of a Person that has to diss a game because it's not to there likings and specifications, It's probably better then what you could ever create to, so my question. What gives you the right to judge a game by graphics when you probably don't know a thing about game creating and how much effort and time and hours go into it? You don't. Peroid.The game is hardly buggy at all. Theres the occasional the ground is invisible but that's a 3% chance of happening to you and even so it's an easy fix, Disable Post FX/Adv Post FX and it's fixxed, re enable it next game launch and it's fixxed. Again it's an old game engine and it's very good considering how much detaiil is in each area, even players with Windows XP can play it without an issue.I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes challenging and fun MMO RPGs. Then this game is for YOU.Overall this is a one of a kind game and everything about it is truly Unique.9/10 "

												I've played Fallen Earth from 2012, and here's my Review and heres why most people don't know what there talking about when it comes to negative Reviews.This game Defines Apocolyptic MMO RPGs as one of the greatest yet.Here's why Players put all this foolish Negative Feed Back and Here's why:Most new Players find it very difficult to play this game because it's not easy to play, It's challenging, most players want a simple and Easy MMO And if that's the case then this MMO RPG is NOT for you.Alot of Players find it hard to gain chips, if your serouis about this game and actually take the time to explore the massive gameworld and see what's worth what, gaining chips is relativly easy easy for new players.The crafting system is one of the best I've seen in an MMORPG making it time consuming to figure out where to find certain matierals or if you have the chips just buy them off the auction if you have the chips to, and if there's any on the Auction. (Most players think this is stupid and QQ about it, This MMO RPG is not for you then.)PvP is Unfair? Doubtful, you just need to know how to create a proper PvP build not just slap your AP points in whatever you think is best, they do make Fallen Earth Character Planners which you can access online by just punching it into google search.The thing with PvP is most players now are experinced Veterens playing, making it more challenging for newer players that hit higher levels to PvP, which is where Clans come into Play. Once you find a clan It's not so hard learning the ropes of PvP, however it is still a steep learning Curve.Everythings to Expensive. Well heres the thing about that. It's the Apocalypse, Nothings going to be cheap especially not Vehicles, your lucky to even aquire one, most players think this is stupid However it's not. It's challenging just the way a game like this was Met to be.Staff are useless GM's are bad? Doubtful, out of the few thousand players that play Fallen Earth theres only a Few GM's online so you need to stop and think you have other players PMing them at once to, they can't drop everything just to Help you. Your no Special then everyone else, The GMs/Staff are very Helpful once they actually get around to Responding to you, If you think there's only 2 or sometimes 3 GM's on at a time. A few Thousand Players.. Don't have high hopes of getting a responce. Your better off Submiting a Support Ticket @ Gamersfirst.com rather then comming here and QQing about it because you think your special.Now my Plus's about the game:The game engine may be old but no one has yet to make a better MMO RPG, most game reviewers look at a game by graphics and gameplay, If it has bad graphics it automically get's a bad Review just because. That's now a game Reviewer at all but more of a Person that has to diss a game because it's not to there likings and specifications, It's probably better then what you could ever create to, so my question. What gives you the right to judge a game by graphics when you probably don't know a thing about game creating and how much effort and time and hours go into it? You don't. Peroid.The game is hardly buggy at all. Theres the occasional the ground is invisible but that's a 3% chance of happening to you and even so it's an easy fix, Disable Post FX/Adv Post FX and it's fixxed, re enable it next game launch and it's fixxed. Again it's an old game engine and it's very good considering how much detaiil is in each area, even players with Windows XP can play it without an issue.I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes challenging and fun MMO RPGs. Then this game is for YOU.Overall this is a one of a kind game and everything about it is truly Unique.9/10 "

												On first impressions... The idea behind the game is nice and I like the story line. The controls are difficult in the beginning but after a while you get used to the configuration. A BIG problem is the combat. You can't hear when you take damage and there is no active audio for combat, so while in combat there is only silence. When you are engaged in a fight it feels like you are swinging at rather than a target, and when you shoot you cant hear the shot so you do not really know if you hit or missed. But these are all things that can be fixed in the future. I love the base foundation of the game and I feel ONCE THE BUGS ARE FIXED it will be a good edition your game library.			"

												I do not recommend this game to anyone. 1. The sign up process is too long and not worth it. 2. The graphics are terrible, no where near the quality of the pictures.. and even those aren't the best. 3. The control configuration is too much. You use the awsd to walk like most other games, but insteas of using your mouse or trackpad to look a certain way, you have to use the arrows.. poorly designed. And to fight, or shoot. You have to click the middle button on your mouse to be able to go into ""Aim-mode"". To look down the sight of your gun, you have to hold B which is highly inconvenient. And the combat in the game is terrible, there's no blocking, nothing. You just walk up to an opponent and hold down the attack button and hope for the best. Overall, this game is like a 2-3 outta 10. I definitely understand why it's free, even then. I still don't recommend it to anyone. Terrible game.			"

												Honestly this game took such a ♥♥♥♥load of time to download, I couldn't stand to even play it anymore. Just playing the intro, there's a lot of controls to memorize and figure out just too switch weapons and equip something.I wouldn't take this review too personally since I didn't play it as much, but just a warning getting the game.

												Well Had to Update this review!My first opinion do not get this game at all.Why?Because just to start up the game it takes about 15 minutes.Secondly Its very repettative.Thirdly its story line is kill this kill that, earn a bike and car and just wander nothing really intresting.Last but not least the skill this game requires to do somethings is outrageous it would say something like science 23/90 Or whatever your skill is out of 90 Who in the hell dose not know how to take apart a fridge and look for parts like really?Now the prosThe vast selection of weapons well the names so weapons are just stronger with a diffent name but same model.The Vast map, The map is very large with 8 sectors of explorable land.There is nothing holding you back from exploring the map except for the dam enemy. Usally once you hit a differnt sector you will always get 1 hit.			"

												This game has such an indepth crafting and leveling system, and the community is very small so I would not reccomend this game for most people. If you love MMO's, RPG's, and FPS's, and you want to dedicate your time to an incredibly expansive game with a close community, than i would reccomend this game. It is a great game, but its certainly not for everyone.			"

												An interesting post-apocalyptic game. Usually when I think of post-apocalpytic games I think of a generic zombie shooter, so when I went into Fallen Earth, I was surprised (Granted there is a part of the main story where they kind of have zombies). Fallen Earth is a open world MMORPGFPS. It's alittle more hardpressed towards the survival aspect then the shooting aspect. Crafting is a big thing in Fallen Earth and is probably one of the funnest thing to do. Almost everything you can get, can be crafted. From weapons, armor, and even your ammo. Sure you can buy most of your items from the auction house, but there's a certain feeling of just crafting it yourself that is so amazing in the atomsphere that Fallen Earth has created. The combat is a twist between a FPS and a TPS. You can shoot in a third person camera view but I perfer playing in a first person view, Although it feels just a tad bit off and could use some work  it's generally pretty good. Although not the most innovating or new, that's not really what Fallen Earth is about. In my opinion Fallen Earth is about the grander feeling of the atompshere of a Post-Apocalyptic world. Not saying anything about it being a hardcore role playing game but if you can get past the generic combat, it is quite an intriguing game. Theres plenty to do, and even from a story perspective, with all of the side quests and even the main quest is kind of interesting, it caters to a wide audience. If you're looking for an openworld MMO that focuses on elements other than combat, than look no further.			"

												Well, what can I say about this amazing game?+ For sure it's definitely better than the overhyped Fallout 4.- Graphic wise, it's not as good as Fallout 2,+ but in terms of multiplayer and price, Fallout 4 can't beat that.+ If you ignore the Freemium stuff, it can be pretty fun. Great community who are always happy to help you out.+ Not sure what the negative reviews were about, as I have never encountered the said bugs.+ But hey, at least it's better than APB Reloaded, right?UPDATE #1: Now that I have spent at least 300 non-Steam hours I have some polished thoughts to share.+ The humor and references present in the game is endless and incredible. Some of them are just meant to make you laugh. Not many game developers cared to do that. On a free game.+ 650 achievements might seem a lot, but it takes time. It may seem grindy, but it's not. They are there to make sure you know something about the game (discover a town, complete their missions, unlocking their secrets etc.), not just spamming the kills and skills.+ There are more than 500 weapons available (both melee and ranged), some of them provide different attribute boosts.+ The game is not even dead. Those who say the game is dead probably never entered the /Global channel (you need to be a Freemium for that) which is very much alive.UPDATE #2: I have discovered the Dark Side of the game (didn't even receive any cookies)- I started to have a lot of achievement bugs: achievements that do not get unlocked even the requirements are met. The devs never cared to fix them. One of the representatives on the forums replied ""it's random""...- Adding salt to the problem, help is harder to get nowadays with only the help of the unofficial wiki (which is so much incomplete even until now). I noticed third-party sites that supposedly provided more information or secrets about the game which little people knew about, were disabled (By Devs?). Players lingering on the /help channel do not have enough experience to deal with advanced issues, Hazmat volunteer helpers come online only at certain times of the day, GMs don't come online anymore (even if they do they'll log in in Ninja mode and spy on all of us)... so you see, it's terrible- Devs can lay the banhammer on absolutely anyone permanently without giving whatsoever reasons at any time, whether you may be a suspect of cheating or not. (Needs updating)All in all, I think FE is ideal for you if you want to play it for a short period of time (say, ~200 hours), avoid being too immersed in the game like i did).Update as of 25/11/2016:Dupers ruining the market, botters killing PvP, rerolls everywhere. that's just how you want the game to end.Personal rating: 5.5 3.5/10			"

												On first impressions... The idea behind the game is nice and I like the story line. The controls are difficult in the beginning but after a while you get used to the configuration. A BIG problem is the combat. You can't hear when you take damage and there is no active audio for combat, so while in combat there is only silence. When you are engaged in a fight it feels like you are swinging at rather than a target, and when you shoot you cant hear the shot so you do not really know if you hit or missed. But these are all things that can be fixed in the future. I love the base foundation of the game and I feel ONCE THE BUGS ARE FIXED it will be a good edition your game library.			"

Thru Steam it is Free To Play, and I can't seem to get the game to start. Did a file validation, there were 11 files missing. I already have an account with Fallen Earth, so I should be good to go, as soon as I get those 11 missing files. What could have happened? Looking forward to getting started again and I'll update my findings. Yay Steam.			"

												Great game but unless you pay to play your character runs into xp level issues getting new quests in the 3rd region.Also the melee based character is completely disadvantaged in many areas as the threat range for other NPC is within melee range, and they all have guns. So mnay quests can not be done ntil much higher levels (reduce threat ranges), thus less rewards (which are already reduced due to not playing to play).The lack of players means it is hard to find teams to do some quests.

												I know this game has been out a while but I just got it recently. I have roughly 39 ish hours into it and I like it. Its fun, It can be a bit grindy with all the walking until you get some fast travel locations unlocked and getting your first quad ( Still havnt managed to get mine yet) is a ♥♥♥♥♥ by yourself. If your looking for a Fallout experiance then go play Fallout, however it does remind me a bit of it. The customisation is pretty awsome and you can build literally anything you want, wich is what is appealing to me about this game the most. Takes patience though. All in all its an enjoyable game.

												This game can be addicting when it comes to collecting materials and crafting, I always been fond of crafting in any game and a horder of materials... In that respect there is tons to do in this game and you will spend a lot of time on it.As for the questing/leveling aspect it can be quite boring, the quests interface and actual quests are the old fashioned go here kill this amount etc... The graphics are a bit dated as well as the pathing with the AI mobs.PVP can sometimes be frustrating at least for me and this game can be very unforgiving for new people who havent leared all the ins and outs about making a good build for their character.At times the game lacks the feel of a living world as real people can sometimes be far in between, for this reason you should find a clan. Overall I have mixed feelings on the game but its worth a try considering you can play for free.			"

												I enjoyed this game, up until the ""how I horse"" questions bore through my skull like a diamond bullet.  I never really joined a clan, but I did team up with people now and then.  Can't say as a single player that I have had too many people try to kill my characters (factions).  Haven't played in awhile, but my recollections was that the mods were very helpful, the forums full of information, and the pace was easy and slow (for some parts).  Grinding is what you have to do and I got tired of it.			"

												If there was a fallout online, and it had a massive dump, this game would be that dump. Good community, once you reach the areas they hang out in. When you start, the game will put you clean off and you may very well quit. It has massive maps, and the starting map is very empty, you'd be forgiven for thinking the game was about to shut down due to no players. I quit the first time i played, but if you keep at it, you'll locate the player community on the third section. I got a good few hours in the game, I really enjoyed the clans and the big drama they all love to cause. You'll find the Devs are friendly and you get to know them after a while.give the game a try, hell it's free so why not.			"

Half the pumpkin and remove the seeds (you can keep these for roasting), then chop into wedges. Place the pumpkin on two large baking trays and drizzle over a little olive oil. In a pestle and mortar, grind the chilli and coriander seeds with a pinch of salt until finely ground. Sprinkle the spices over the pumpkin with some black pepper. Roast the pumpkin for 1 hour, or until soft and slightly caramalised at the edges.Meanwhile, roughly chop the onion, garlic, carrot and celery. Heat a lug of olive oil over a medium heat in a large saucepan then add the vegetables and cook for 15 minutes, or until soft and sweet but not coloured.When the squash is ready, add to the pan with the hot stock. Blend with a stick blender, adding a little more water if you like a thinner consistency. "

												The game is pure awesome in a Fallout 3-like world (with a bit of green) with Multiplayer. There is also first-person view mode by using the Mouse Wheel (or pressing F9), so you can play it like an FPS game as well as the usual Third Person.There is about 6 different *big* Regions to explore, Missions (some can be done co-operatively), Person Vs Monster with set PVP Zones shown on the maps, Factions, Crafting numerous items such as Snipers/Pistols/SMG's & other stuff, Scavenging, Leveling up, Auctions, use Vehicles like Cars/ATVs/Motorbikes/Horses, Clans, Riots, and a whole lot more.I've played this game for at least 4000 Hours by now (even donated at least $80), and I must say it's a very good Free To Play Game. If you donate at least $10 by buying something from the Marketplace, you get a LOT of extras for being a first-time purchaser.			"

												If you liked Fallout 3/ New Vegas but always wished that you couldn't use that annoying fast travel feature, Then welcome to Post-Apocalyptic Hiking Simulator 2156 with free Shooting and Stabbing Things DLC. And just incase you thought this game had PvP, it should actually be called ""Whoever starts shooting first wins because everyone has he same mundane assault rifle.""Game play is monotenous, but if you want to waste time, this is ok.Oh yeah, also one of the early missions where you have to talk to someone was almost impossible because of an imprecise minimap.

												I had this on my old computer, and have always played it F2P. I don't really have a lot of complaints about it other than the crafting, even low-level stuff, can be insanely time-consuming. Everything else is fine, but just the crafting time alone has turned me off to the game more or less, as I currently don't have it installed on my new computer but am considering reinstalling it. It's just really hard to progress at any rate if you don't pour money and constant 24/7 game time into it. But overall it's a pretty decent game. If you don't mind the crafting times (which I personally do), then I'd recommend the game.			"

												Fallen Earth is pretty fun.. if you can get passed all the grinding. It's your typical MMORPG set in a post apocalyptic/fallout type of setting. This game is not pay to win, unless you want shortcuts in crafting or faster leveling.Pros:- Crafting system- RPG style- Small and helpful community- Massive world- Variety of weapon types (Guns, Crossbows, Knives, Swords, Hammers, Etc.)- Variety of skills- Incorporates faction based quests and items- Holiday themed quests and items- Vehicles- Fast traveling- And so much moreCons:- Combat system is a bit shabby- Leveling up is very slow- Hordes of monster everywhere you turn outside of the townsNow i haven't played since October 2014, so i'll come back and update this review if neccassary.

												There is a lot wrong with it. Enemy AI is terrible. The faction system, what was once its greatest strength, has been neutered into non-existence. But if you like crafting, like the open post apocolypse world, like the idea of a genuine RPG FPS MMO without tab-targeting, this could be for you. And it is FTP, so you have nothing to loose in trying it! (The only real limitation on FTP accounts being crafting is slower and you may only craft one thing at a time).			"

												People who ar reviewing this game with playtime under 10 hrs suck anyways.. You are still a noob in this game after 100 hrs. Even i after way over 1000 hrs playtime havent seen every corner of the really HUGE maps. It has a lot stuff that it does right and stuff that it does wrong . Like all Games it has PROS and CONS ! ..However, looking at the overall perspective its a good free to play title. If you invest 5 or 10 Dollars even more so. Yes the people here are right about the old and outdated gameplay. The graphics and the lack of end content. But it has a lot of other cool features you cant find in todays games anymore. Like a really complex crafting system or player housing or compass navigation. For Western and Apocalypse fans its a great game to play for many many hours. But only for a patient player who likes pve over pvp. I ve done a lot in this game and still come back very once in a while just to enjoy a few desert sunsets or check back with the community which is one of the best ive found out there in MMOs. At first i hated the game and stopped playing it. But then i gave it a second chance and it was quite FUN. Try it or dont.. your decision .. ^^			"

												great game love everything about it...its different and IMO better than your classic style MMO which is well all there is right now.  It doesnt hold your hand as much as blockbuster MMO's do. but it does help you along just enough that you wont flounder for to long unaware of what to do next.  It has real genuine challenges, no bogus strings or restrictions you wouldnt expect. basically anything you want to do you can do it.  it has hardcore elements that are in the player universe but are kept far enough away for the msot part that if you dont want to be a part of it you dont have to be.only downside I can see is it needs a major overhual fairly soon. graphics and animations need to be redone and brought into 2015.  if they did that this game would skyrocket to success no doubt about it			"

												I just got this game today and I'm already in love with with it. This is definatly one of the absolute best MMO's I've played, even more so then ESO, I'd have to say at this point. I love the game, though you really do have to spend like an hour scavenging materials just to get a little amount of ammo because you'll need it, ammo runs outin this game like crazy. So just be conservative. All in all, great game, hope it's around for years to come :)			"

												There is a lot wrong with it. Enemy AI is terrible. The faction system, what was once its greatest strength, has been neutered into non-existence. But if you like crafting, like the open post apocolypse world, like the idea of a genuine RPG FPS MMO without tab-targeting, this could be for you. And it is FTP, so you have nothing to loose in trying it! (The only real limitation on FTP accounts being crafting is slower and you may only craft one thing at a time).			"

												I went into this game thinking it would be like Dying Light or Fallout. It turned out the game is like World of Warcraft or Star Wars: The Old Republic. Don't get me wrong, I like those games, but the pictures were misleading, and I was in the mood for a game like Dying Light, so when it gave me the MMO create-your-character screen, I was not entertained. If you like/ want to play an MMO, download the game, if you want a zombie survival, keep looking.			"

												I would like to start off with stating that this is a review from someone who is just the average player and has gotton a very good look at the game..so far. Now I will state what you will notice right away! The combat im not going to lie is very bland and there is not many ways to approch at enemys. The missions are straight forword and doing the side missions proves to be your main source of income other then crafting and selling gear to other players. There is no lack of missions as I may stay in the some main Starter towns but on my way to a mission get side tracked and find a new town, then Im there for a few play times doing those missions. By the time I realize I have forgotton to do the mission I came for at the start of collecting like 10 copper for example im killing roaches for sugar cookies from so random guy. The missions in each town are mostly focused towards a area, so collecting 5 at a time is better then 2 becuase you will find you are walking to hand in a mission to realize the next mission you find is in the same area like 10 feet from where you did the last. There is not too much to say for the gameplay as if follows the bases of most. The leveling and skills is a very nice system in the game that is easy to understand and you can really see how your upgrades effect the game. The crafting is very time conruming but it pays off when you can create good gear and sell it for big profit cause you put in the time and grinded. The graphics are ok for a game of its age but it does have many textures that are used to often. The game for overall enjoyment is a 7/10 for games in its group as it has some elements that are not in the basic template for most.			"

												If there was a fallout online, and it had a massive dump, this game would be that dump. Good community, once you reach the areas they hang out in. When you start, the game will put you clean off and you may very well quit. It has massive maps, and the starting map is very empty, you'd be forgiven for thinking the game was about to shut down due to no players. I quit the first time i played, but if you keep at it, you'll locate the player community on the third section. I got a good few hours in the game, I really enjoyed the clans and the big drama they all love to cause. You'll find the Devs are friendly and you get to know them after a while.give the game a try, hell it's free so why not.			"

												The game is pure awesome in a Fallout 3-like world (with a bit of green) with Multiplayer. There is also first-person view mode by using the Mouse Wheel (or pressing F9), so you can play it like an FPS game as well as the usual Third Person.There is about 6 different *big* Regions to explore, Missions (some can be done co-operatively), Person Vs Monster with set PVP Zones shown on the maps, Factions, Crafting numerous items such as Snipers/Pistols/SMG's & other stuff, Scavenging, Leveling up, Auctions, use Vehicles like Cars/ATVs/Motorbikes/Horses, Clans, Riots, and a whole lot more.I've played this game for at least 4000 Hours by now (even donated at least $80), and I must say it's a very good Free To Play Game. If you donate at least $10 by buying something from the Marketplace, you get a LOT of extras for being a first-time purchaser.			"

												I had this on my old computer, and have always played it F2P. I don't really have a lot of complaints about it other than the crafting, even low-level stuff, can be insanely time-consuming. Everything else is fine, but just the crafting time alone has turned me off to the game more or less, as I currently don't have it installed on my new computer but am considering reinstalling it. It's just really hard to progress at any rate if you don't pour money and constant 24/7 game time into it. But overall it's a pretty decent game. If you don't mind the crafting times (which I personally do), then I'd recommend the game.			"

												I really liked this game. The maps are HUGE and really familiar to the Fallout world. The crafting on this game is really good. I loved the fact you could scavange for parts and craft anything with it. At first, I didn't know what I was doing, I was kinda lost and had no clue on how the game works. The weird and dated gameplay didn't help at all, so I did quit that time. After some time I decided to give it another try. I saw how it works and started to get familiar with it. I trought it was hard as hell to purchase ammo, until I found you could easily craft ammo. I just fell in love in the crafting on this game. Its some kind of runescape on a fallout world ahaha.I don't play this for a few months, but when I did, I didn't think it was pay-to-win, but yes pay-to-boost. I know that you could craft multiple items with premium and purchase boosts and already built vehicles on the cash shop. If i'm not wrong, you can purchase them or craft them. Purchasing is always a way to get it faster.The community is very friendly. They are mostly adults. A faction with a big ammount of members helped me a lot! I wouldn't know most of this game without them. They always replied to my questions and they also gave me lots of things to start with. :)The ONLY thing that made me quit this game was the money ammount limit as a free-to-play user. That feature really sucks! That means you cannot purchase expensive items as a free-to-play user because you have a limit. I think fallen earth should take some F2P unnecessary restrictions which takes the motivation of a player to play it, such as the money restriction. And, if they could in the future do a update with gameplay optimizations, new free content and some bug fixes, I think it would bring back lots of players that did quit due that.I was thinking of re-installing this game, but i'm not sure. I don't think its worth since I can't purchase anything expensive with all the money I farmed. I hope they listen to the community and atleast take that only restriction away...I recommend this game if you like to explore, scavange, level up a bunch of abilities, craft(ammo, armors, weapons, objects, consumables, vehicles), if you like huge wastelands similar to the fallout map and if you are social. It's always nice to drive around and explore. It takes ages to travel a city to another! You also have to feed your mounts or purchase fuel!I wish the best for this old game. I hope it lasts. As I said, a big update with a bunch of new content, improved gameplay and with some unnecessary restrictions for f2p users taken off would bring lots of players. The gameplay is not bad, but for new players it will be strange. Its just a matter of getting used to. Good games don't need a perfect gameplay tho.I'l edit this later, that's my quick opinion of my last time on fallen earth, months ago.			"

												A game that promised a very sandbox like experience, but was eventually altered to suit theme park players. A very immersive world with amazing feel to it. One of the most immersive games I've played. Try it yourself, but I think it's no longer the game it could have been. But, and this is important, do NOT listen to Bro Team's review. They're idiots with no grasp on how to approach games. I think I lost half of my brain cells just listening to their review which is basically devoid of  any substance. I recommend this if you like a Fallout/Western world with multiplayer elements			"

Half the pumpkin and remove the seeds (you can keep these for roasting), then chop into wedges. Place the pumpkin on two large baking trays and drizzle over a little olive oil. In a pestle and mortar, grind the chilli and coriander seeds with a pinch of salt until finely ground. Sprinkle the spices over the pumpkin with some black pepper. Roast the pumpkin for 1 hour, or until soft and slightly caramalised at the edges.Meanwhile, roughly chop the onion, garlic, carrot and celery. Heat a lug of olive oil over a medium heat in a large saucepan then add the vegetables and cook for 15 minutes, or until soft and sweet but not coloured.When the squash is ready, add to the pan with the hot stock. Blend with a stick blender, adding a little more water if you like a thinner consistency. "

												I've been playing this game for a lot of time, more time than i could think of playing a game now i restarted on steam after maybe one year and it still feels as good as before, its maybe the most underrated game or at least mmorpg ever, the world is huge, you can scavenge/harvest in most places of the world map so that you can even spend hours driving your madmax-like buggy through the wasteland scavenging for different ressources that others would buy for a lot of chips (money) at the Auction House and its also easy to make yourself rich if your smart and not lazy, factions  also bring a lot of fun you can capture different zones for your faction, you have arch enemies, ally factions and there are 6 factions in total each being very unique. To all who say this game is p2w, its not like those people say that you have to pay monthly to enjoy this game, if you pay  5 bucks all of the limitations will be gone and you get a nice starter pack, no need to buy anything and can go straight for the end level without limits, its really worth it !

												I would like to start off with stating that this is a review from someone who is just the average player and has gotton a very good look at the game..so far. Now I will state what you will notice right away! The combat im not going to lie is very bland and there is not many ways to approch at enemys. The missions are straight forword and doing the side missions proves to be your main source of income other then crafting and selling gear to other players. There is no lack of missions as I may stay in the some main Starter towns but on my way to a mission get side tracked and find a new town, then Im there for a few play times doing those missions. By the time I realize I have forgotton to do the mission I came for at the start of collecting like 10 copper for example im killing roaches for sugar cookies from so random guy. The missions in each town are mostly focused towards a area, so collecting 5 at a time is better then 2 becuase you will find you are walking to hand in a mission to realize the next mission you find is in the same area like 10 feet from where you did the last. There is not too much to say for the gameplay as if follows the bases of most. The leveling and skills is a very nice system in the game that is easy to understand and you can really see how your upgrades effect the game. The crafting is very time conruming but it pays off when you can create good gear and sell it for big profit cause you put in the time and grinded. The graphics are ok for a game of its age but it does have many textures that are used to often. The game for overall enjoyment is a 7/10 for games in its group as it has some elements that are not in the basic template for most.			"

Don't get me wrong, I like those games, but the pictures were misleading, and I was in the mood for a game like Dying Light, so when it gave me the MMO create-your-character screen, I was not entertained. If you like/ want to play an MMO, download the game, if you want a zombie survival, keep looking.			"

												If there was a fallout online, and it had a massive dump, this game would be that dump. Good community, once you reach the areas they hang out in. When you start, the game will put you clean off and you may very well quit. It has massive maps, and the starting map is very empty, you'd be forgiven for thinking the game was about to shut down due to no players. I quit the first time i played, but if you keep at it, you'll locate the player community on the third section. I got a good few hours in the game, I really enjoyed the clans and the big drama they all love to cause. You'll find the Devs are friendly and you get to know them after a while.give the game a try, hell it's free so why not.			"

												The game is pure awesome in a Fallout 3-like world (with a bit of green) with Multiplayer. There is also first-person view mode by using the Mouse Wheel (or pressing F9), so you can play it like an FPS game as well as the usual Third Person.There is about 6 different *big* Regions to explore, Missions (some can be done co-operatively), Person Vs Monster with set PVP Zones shown on the maps, Factions, Crafting numerous items such as Snipers/Pistols/SMG's & other stuff, Scavenging, Leveling up, Auctions, use Vehicles like Cars/ATVs/Motorbikes/Horses, Clans, Riots, and a whole lot more.I've played this game for at least 4000 Hours by now (even donated at least $80), and I must say it's a very good Free To Play Game. If you donate at least $10 by buying something from the Marketplace, you get a LOT of extras for being a first-time purchaser.			"

												I had this on my old computer, and have always played it F2P. I don't really have a lot of complaints about it other than the crafting, even low-level stuff, can be insanely time-consuming. Everything else is fine, but just the crafting time alone has turned me off to the game more or less, as I currently don't have it installed on my new computer but am considering reinstalling it. It's just really hard to progress at any rate if you don't pour money and constant 24/7 game time into it. But overall it's a pretty decent game. If you don't mind the crafting times (which I personally do), then I'd recommend the game.			"

Its trying to be a Fall out 3 Online but it fails at doing that. Yes there guns and outfits at the store, which also the store is very confusing, Npc's and a open world. Thats all there is though it brings nothing new to the table. There's crafting, weapons, outfits, enemys. There is no random event or boss battle no huge lore. The graphics are muddy and the AI is okay. The last hit system is bad and its hard to stay in a party. You dont care about other people, or the story. Enemy's at terrible at the start and are bad later to. But they throw hordes at you which feels like a grind. It may be better later on. But how long do you want to put yourself through that.I give it a 4 out a 10 a okay game.			"

												This game is terrible, if your playing aloneThe good-Free to play-Good starter area to explain the game-The freedom to choose how you want to play-Explains to the player why you come back to life after death-The guns look like they would be in a apocalypse-Massive world-Mount up really early no strings or anything-Go from horses to quad bikes to buggies to cars that look like they would be in a apocalypse-Good gameplay-The grapics contribute the gameplay-I crafted my own gun, ammo and chemical granadesThe bad-You need friends to enjoy it-Spent most of my time traveling -Can be boring when your grinding for meterials -Want your armour and appearance to be different, pay us-my horse died, had to walk for a bit to grap another-the gameplay can get boring after awhilethe inbetween-My new horse ran out of stamina and i had to buy feed for it-The when crafting it takes time for it to finish.Overall its a good game if you dont mind traveling a bit and you have friends who can deal with traveling as well.

												Downloaded off of steam, made account at whatever website it redirected me to, website only used my email and password. The game itself is asking for a username, but I've never been given an option to make a username, and when I go to make a new account it brings me to the same crap where it only uses my email. Can't figure this out, I'm probably just autistic. Still very dissatisfied that this whole sign in thing was very poorly designed, if I can get helped with this or get it fixed if this is a legit problem, I'll write another review when it actually lets me play the game.

												Oh boy yes do I reccomend this game. The Combat system is a clever mix of Third/First Person Shooting/Melee like Skyrim or Fallout with some Tab Combat like WoW when casting Mutations (Basically spells for healing, damage and support) so you can choose to simply ignore one play style over the other or use a mix of one. If you want to dual wield two, one handed melee weapons or guns then go for it, the game allows you to even use a one handed melee and gun at the same time, basically filling melee and range in one go.BE AWARE though that the mouse buttons are backwards, to use the weapon in your right hand click the left mouse button and vice versa. I haven't found a way to fix this without it affecting interactions with the world so my advice is don't change it.The only flaws are the sound and beginners confusion. I personally found the ambience quite annoying and the game is very quiet out of combat but I suppose you could call it relaxing.At the beggining of the game you follow a simple tutorial dungeon (with good voice acting) and then you get to pick one of three starter locations that tailor to how you would like to play. You have a few starter quests which thankfully come one at a time but when you leave that slice of starter land and head into town then you'll find there are lots of quests that need doing. They don't appear very cleatly on the mini map so look hard and you'll notice little hazard symbols like the desktop icon bare visible on the mini map. Those are quest icons.I did notice that the starter areas seem to follow a similar story at first, just in a different landscape.One thing that really confused me was Tradeskills. I'm sure once I devote more time to the game and decide what kind of character I want to be I'll understand it better.If you want a nice little MMO that puts the best features of WoW and Fallout into one then have a go...

												Very difficult to get your bearings set from the beginning. There isn't much of an in-game tutorial to help you ease into it. Quests seemed standard ""kill X of Y in zone Z"" or ""gather/craft X of Y"". The combat system is crazy weird to me, and I cant even begin to describe the crafting system... The fact that its Post-Apoc wasteland is about the only thing this game has in common with Fallout. I feel as though the game HAS potential, but that alone doesnt merit a good game. Implementation and execution on things seemed lacking. I uninstalled without a second thought.I didn't play it for long, so I speak on a very limited experience, but I still wouldn't suggest this mess of a game on anyone.			"

												I had several problems with this game the first being the graphics. The graphics were so bad that I had to use a graphics card and turn the settings all the way up just to be able to see anything other than my charcter. The second problem I had was with the controls they are a little odd because you have to change between 1st and 3rd person constantly. 3rd person for movement and everything else, and 1st person for using your weapon. The final problem I had was driving the vehicles, the first time I drove I barely bumbed a wall in what I think was an atv exploded and killed me. I wouldnt recommend this game but it is free so why not.			"

												Every one who gives a bad review need to lighten the ♥♥♥♥ up, this game is great and may be one of the best RPGs I have ever played every one who complains about the commands and buttons to pull up menus need to just look at the control menu, and every one saying how there isnt any story needs to read the dialouge and even though the story isnt forcefull and always there as a large thing of the game is to let you feel the world created to make you feel not special, that your  just another wastelander in the world, it gives the game more ambience and a sense of freedom it even gives an explanation for respawning instead of the usual ""oh your dead, well click here for a respawn and not wonder why your alive again as if nothing happand"" so play this game, you like Fallout? play this game, looking for a filler waiting for Fallout 4? play this game and when Fallout 4 comes out you may just see your self playing this again, so in closing okay this game.

												Very difficult to get your bearings set from the beginning. There isn't much of an in-game tutorial to help you ease into it. Quests seemed standard ""kill X of Y in zone Z"" or ""gather/craft X of Y"". The combat system is crazy weird to me, and I cant even begin to describe the crafting system... The fact that its Post-Apoc wasteland is about the only thing this game has in common with Fallout. I feel as though the game HAS potential, but that alone doesnt merit a good game. Implementation and execution on things seemed lacking. I uninstalled without a second thought.I didn't play it for long, so I speak on a very limited experience, but I still wouldn't suggest this mess of a game on anyone.			"

												Not sure why this game keeps popping up on my Steam storepage so I may as well say avoid this title if you can. The engine feels so outdated and every action you perform in the game feels so clunky. The AI is laughable at best, horribly broken at worst. The maps feel like they are competing for the world's biggest game map record to the point of absurdity, if you want to travel from sector to sector it will take forever and there will be nothing to see and if you're lucky your horse won't die. If you're unlucky and your horse ends up dying I hope you enjoy walking for hrs on end just to reach the next town. If you want to play a game set in post apocolypic wasteland just stick to Fallout New Vegas or The Wasteland 2.			"

												This game took me a little bit to get used to, I am very glad I took the extra time and didnt just stop because now I really enjoy this game. I have put in a decent amount of hours into the game, and I have really become addicted to it. Great crafting set up, decent amount of story type missions for you to do, and actually a pretty friendly community. There are a few things that could really be worked on that I will mention but for the most part a great game.I very much like the crafting, and sometimes find myself staying in the same shop crafting for hours. You could pretty much completely stay away from anything mission or town wise and be completely happy making yourself food to keep healed up, or use your wide range of healing abilities. You cant completely do that though, there are a few different items that you can not craft, that you would have to get lucky on a drop with or buy from a merchant. From what I have seen you dont get chips(credits) from loot drops though, it seems to come from missions or selling your drops.The two things that I have noticed that needs improvement are the enemy AI, you can almost walk five feet away from them and have them not notice you at all. The other thing is some of the vagueness on missions. There is not a lot of detial with some of the missions, some of them you really do need to just figure out on your own or ask the help channel for any input.All and all, I do very much like this game and see myself playing for awhile.

												If you like a Fallout/Stalker scenario and always wanted to be able to craft your own dune buggy or awsome rifles and guns.  Like dark humor from the npc's you meet here and there getting you into the regions storyline and you don't need a pastell colored disney cutey pie environment in 16:9 THX Dolby Surround format, then this game is the one your looking for.These are the reasons I gave the game a thumbs up. But, as usual, no pro without any con.Although I played this character nearly to max level I gave up in the end. One reason being I never seen a worse pvp engine in my life. If you don't mind getting melee damaged from a girl from 7-9 meters away (looks like 15 sometimes thanks to the lag) then ignore the next few sentences.Why a girl? Well, this game has different hitboxes, unlike in other games like Guild Wars 2 where you got the same chance to hit your enemy. In Fallen Earth a female character in smallest size is the way to go. Pity you chose a tall  dude in the beginning, suck it up matey! Then there the thing about rifles, well.. yea it's cool to get those (mostly) awesome looking rifles. But, you go pvp and try to hide and give fire protection for your team.. you die. This reasoned by the fact that everyone can see you on their radar. So you have a rifle, no camo, and an enemy on your butt in the next few seconds.But, lets go back to pve, when you start out in the game the graphics certainly are a turnoff but the longer you play and get into the setting the more interesting this game gets... until... you hit about level 43. Then 90 % of the missions suddenly aren't possibly solo-able and you either have a helpful clan or friends you made in the game you can level with. Even then quite a few instances you get sent into aren't possible when your 10 levels higher and go back for a revisit (useless anyway to go back actually because you get less to none experience for that now). This leaving you up to, either crafting, or, the grind...Personally these where the reasons I stopped playing in the end. Knowing there was no further content to be seen on the horizon and the pvp was not an option for me.But, as stated above... for a quick hike into the good old Radioactive Wasteland it`s worth a shot. And btw, if you love glowsticks.... definately install it!			"

												Fallen Earth was a great game six years ago and I was a paid subscriber.  Six long years ago, FE was not free to play and not published by Gamersfirst and have active devs and mods in game, the devs pushed out lots of updates and new content and worked on tweaking skill balance.Now, that has pretty much stopped.  The tier 2 quests , end game content and group centric content never really materialized.  I finally just hit the uninstall button and wiped the tears away from this classic that lost its way.Like Shadowbane, Fallen Earth will always hold a place in my heart and when someone takes the reigns and makes an emulator, I will be there.

												Okay I came to this thinking: A survival fps with a unique sci fi apocalypse which will always get me. I was dead wrong with this game. It is your standard mmorpg piece of garbage layout like warcraft. This shooters gameplay is beyond that of tank controlls. Hard to work with constantly. It should have just went with a more basic combat system then this which would make me want to play it. As you can tell I have not played much as of this moment though I will play more just to adapt the control which turns me off. Graphics are not the worst I have ever seen in my lifetime, but they still could imrpove it. Voice acting is the equivalant of 50"" movie with all the bland scenes to talk with. Also being a highwaymen, or tactical in anyway as a bandit is not recomended. You being a sniper you watch your standard patrol for people to pick off, you see two enemy groups attack each other then you pick off the few survivors. All those kills are locked to the other guys character which is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t if you want to apply any kind of stealth based strategy against enemy players. Also my anti virus, chrome, and even adblock warned me not to go on one of their sites. Which when all three things kind of pop up on you it brings a bit of worry. I am still going to get past the controlls, and see what this game is going to offer. Then if I like it, then I will change my review of this to positive. But so far, red faction is more fun than this. This supposed to be newer with big exploration stuff. Red faction one is a liner fps that is very old.			"

Oh yes! if u hav a brain and like sum crafting and sum action this game is soooooo what u need, if u have half a brain just pass coz this here is not for dumb people, ull hav loads of fun and the learning curve is easy and if ur really stuck u hav an online GM help line too :) which is helpful but dont go every 5secs n ask the same stupid SH*T coz ull get a full blast go play the game and figure it out a lil from a GM xD ( i totally agree with )So u dont ask to be the best u learn to be the best thts final, the game is ruthless and nicely planned out, dnt go and expect to just get a vehicle lol u gta build 1 which is epic too coz hey the world is busted so scavenge get stuff and start with sum tyres and a frame etc etc ull hav the full reward of it in a good couple of hours :) so the crafting system is most awesome :) Yes there is a few bugs etc but hey u ever played a bug free game that aint on console......? my point exactlyso give the game a whirl ull love it8/10			"

												Not sure why this game keeps popping up on my Steam storepage so I may as well say avoid this title if you can. The engine feels so outdated and every action you perform in the game feels so clunky. The AI is laughable at best, horribly broken at worst. The maps feel like they are competing for the world's biggest game map record to the point of absurdity, if you want to travel from sector to sector it will take forever and there will be nothing to see and if you're lucky your horse won't die. If you're unlucky and your horse ends up dying I hope you enjoy walking for hrs on end just to reach the next town. If you want to play a game set in post apocolypic wasteland just stick to Fallout New Vegas or The Wasteland 2.			"

												While Fallen Earth is an enjoyable MMO set in a Fallout universe, there are some glaring issues that impact the experience of the game.  The biggest problem I have had is to connect to the game.  As soon as you choose / create your character the game gets stuck on a loading screen.  No indication as to what the problem was, I looked online, and a huge amount of people had the same issue.  Eventually I narrowed this down to a connection issue between the game client and the servers.  The Devs refuse to be transparent about this, which says a lot, especially in a MMO.  This failure of the devs to be transparent and the 6 months of them failing to fix the issue since I became aware of and reported it, does not inspire any confidence in them being able to tend to a MMO.So for all the game's successes, it is sad that there is one failure that no amount of successes can smooth over, which is the deplorable behaviour of the development / moderation team in a MMO.

												It is with a heavy heart that I can no longer recommend this game. The developers have left it to die, and there's less than 100 people online at any given time. Even the oldest players have abandoned it.It's truly a sad day, because this game was one in a million. But it's just too dated and too difficult for today's Walk-Me-By-The-Hand Warcraft brats. __________________Old Review was good if you want to still read it.__________________I played Fallen Earth pretty extensively from their site before it moved from Steam. I downloaded this game to my steam library to write this small review.The game has a ton of content. Lots of quests and lots of items.You get a free horse. But since there are so many horses, you have to name it Horse34532 because literally every name has been registered.The map is big. And there really are a lot of places to go and to see. There's lots of guns and things to kill and to see.It was an amazing game when it came out in 2009..... But now.. In 2015? With the standard being set so high?The player base is all but dead. Mostly Non-English speaking people play this game. Even in the American servers I'd say one in five people over the course of a week spoke English. And almost NO ONE replies to you because they're too busy running around doing repetitive MMO tasks. Outside of the newbie area the game is dead. There's literally no one. I maybe ran into one person a day wandering the wastelands. The quest system is incredibly broken. And the NPCs are terrible.The Crafting system is awkward, confusing, and feels ancient.The UI feels ancient.The game is not properly optimized. And even with a good rig it won't run well. Even at 80 fps it just doesn't feel ""smooth.""The combat feels delayed, even on good Internet, and the gunplay is stale and clunky. The AI is terrible. Even six years later after the game's had plenty of time to update.So why did I recommend this game? Several reasons.It's still a lot of fun to explore the post apocalyptic world, and there are still a lot of cool places to go see. And it still feels detailed and immersive.There aren't that many post-apoc games right now.Fallout 4 isn't out, yet. lol			"

												-[fallen]- Whoa. comes to mind. Game is hella creepy and great all mixed into one big ball i hells yeah. Post end of days themed game with a strange controll and feel to it. You start of in the hoover damned to find out you're a clone. you spend the first hour figuring every thing out then once you beat the first big qeust. which is getting to the elavator E.TA from just starting to getting to the elavator 30 minutes to a hour. Dont forget you have to click on someone first then you can heal them.. That♥♥♥♥♥♥took me like 2 hours to figure out. But wow this is one of those games worth figuring out the mecanics to just because its so in depth and the story line seems to be great. AND THE WORDs OF THE DAY...

												This game could of been huge if it wanted to...But instead, we get another lame MMO in our mist on Steam congrats! Anyway the reason why I am saying no to this game is well, let's be honest...It's A peice of crap to be shared around with your friends and they get just as much crap as you do... It's just the same old MMo's looking for money like A hobbo, but A very smartish hobbo... Half of my gaming time was basicly trying to get the ♥♥♥♥ing game to even work! xD 3 hours because the updater was being A peice of Suger.Honey.Ice.Tea...  After A month crying in the corner playing games that are actaully good? I tried updating it again, because I can... IT WORKED!!! :D I looked at most of the reviews of this game but I just wanted to check for myself to see if I would like this game because some players do... I was backfired... It seem to start out good (Create A character, give him A afro, stuff like that...) But I had it coming and I seem to always find this in most MMO games, it is basicly like Face of Mankind, but it is older and when I think of it, FoM ideas come from this game but just gave it A new damn story...ish The start was like every godamn MMO, have these damn NPC's giving me A random ♥♥♥♥♥♥ quest, why can't at least 1 game just let you free instead of trapping you with NPC's that will keep you in the game for eternity until you finnish all of what they damn well givien you. Secondly the Graphics... S.H.I.T Why? because for some odd reason, when I get into A huge damn firefight... I start to lose all my damn FPS and this is only on Low graphics settings (Because my computer is crap...) But I should be able to fight without losing all my danm framerate but no... I just do... It's nice to know writing this review 2.00am in the morning to just say how bad is this game because right now, I am just wasting my life not even playing the game because I am stuck here writing this review of how crappy it is... 0.5/10 Cookies... Only because I was able to give my guy an afro and make him black ;-; EDIT: Please note, I was 'probably'... Kind of drunk when I made this. XD So ummm... If you enjoy my distorted, skillfullishness of writing this review? Give A Thumbs Up. BECAUSE WHY NOT!!! It's right there... Probably... XD			"

												I played this a while back and at first the game seemed pretty interesting, but then I tryed to get an ATV.  (I understand this may not have been the best goal ever right at the start of the game.)  Anyway, I didn't appreciate the abnoxiously large expanses of nothing.  My friends and I were roaming along for a few hours, trying to  get to the very distant places to finish the quests to get ATVs.  The questline to get the ATVs was rediculously long and it also felt like you had to pay for stuff in order to get anything good.  I don't know how it is now, but I don't particularly recommend this game due to the miles of annoyingly empty expanse that I had to traverse.P.S.  I'm sure this is a great game for those who enjoy MMORPs, please make sure to read other reviews.  (I'm not a huge MMORPg player, therefore I did not get very far in the game. I also had a bad experience with my friends running off and stuff.)			"

												Could've been a fun game, but the controls are just terrible. Having to switch back and forth from ""aiming mode"" and ""whatever not aiming mode is called"" is really clumsy and just sad. Yeah you could've taken the time to make it so that wasn't a problem and all aiming was the same (as it should be..) But why take the time to do it right. Might as well just say f*** it from the start and build your whole game around this awful mechanic. Wtf is wrong with game developers is anyone even a real person anymore...like did you even try your own game? if you did you would've realized this ""aim mode"" completely ruins your game.			"

												Its not best game and not the worst. I really enjoy playing this. If someone tells me its a P2W game, im not listening him. Yes, you have boosters to harvesting, but you can get them for RP (Reward Points). You can buy premium in-game on auctions (of course, you must have some money).			"

												i spent an hour and a half downloading the game, then i made an account, verified it.. and of course theres an update to download before i can play, even though i JUST installed the game... THEN the update takes forever to get to the actual download portion, and although its a meager 150mb download, its been 5 minutes, and it says i've downloaded 1kb and my estimated wait for it finish is 1000 days. so f**k that			"

												Just think a fallout MMORPG... or S.T.A.L.K.E.R, or any other apocalyptic game, but in an MMORPG form. Pretty self explanitory. But i guess i'll go into more detail with my ever-so-rare pros/cons list.Pros_MASSIVE open world that would take more than a full day to travel from one side to the other on foot. (but don't worry, there are horses and vehicles to help.)A bunch of cool secrets to be found.Interesting roleplaying potential.Cool story and factions.(bonus!) The low playerbase gives a good feel of isolation, really gives that extra immersion of an empty wasteland on a dead earth. Though unlike with fallout, having multiplayer makes the few players you will come across, means no two people will have the same experience, and be able to meet people with interesting stories and characters and such. Makes the dead world feel all the more alive.Cons_Intense learning curve.VERY slow paced leveling and such with a lot of ""go here, kill this stuff."" Though it does have the redeeming factor of traveling places you wouldn't go otherwise and seeing interesting scenery.Not too active playerbase, but the ones that are, luckily, are usually the ones that have been there since the beta.Old game with dated graphics and stiff controls, though it has aged somewhat decently well.Support died off ages ago, aswell as updates, for the most part.Conclusion_Its an old game, but a good one, and worth the look.

												Well i love Disgaea. But...This game is the same as Disgaea: Hour of Darkness for playstation 2Release date January 30, 2003.so being as they took off Hour of Darkness and put PC i want a refund as its not a new game and they should of simply called it a remake. This falls under false advertisement imo.As of 1:02am 02/25/16Steam:We have reviewed your refund request.We are unable to refund this purchase to your Steam Wallet at this time. Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum).This should not matter as i paid for Disgaea PC ( a new game or so i thought) I dont want Disgaea Hour of Darkness as i already own it for console.I hope this saves someone else the 19.99 You can prob get this game online for playstation 2 for around 5.00			"

												If more people gave it a chance, then it would have the level of polish it deserves, right now it's a unique game having trouble staying afloat.Those who love it, love it a lot. There is everything you remember from every mmo, crafting, quests, but one of the earliest ones to do freedom of skill selection. Your abilities and mutations are determined by your Primary Attributes (Dex, Str, etc) which are determined by the amount of AP you put into them.If you appreciate unique games, though the controls are a little clunky, and the story is awful, you should give this game a try until level 15.Sector 1 really is a hard, boring time, but in Sector 2 you will encounter PVP areas, and the quests are a lot less boring.

It's very clustered and confusing, and I found it hard to understand what was going on.Combat both looks and feels boring and repetitive, and I couldn't honestly say I had fun in the short time I played.All  in all, it could use a lot of work.But, As I said, The potential IS there.

												I get you, random Steam user- you're just scrolling through Free-2-Play games, hoping for something to humor your boredom as you wait for the money you get for Christmas or your birthday.  Perhaps you came to this game as a Fallout fan, as did I, hoping for a free, multiplayer game you could enjoy. If you're too lazy to read this review, I'll give it to you simply: keep looking, you haven't found it yet.I installed this game out of boredom. Spring break caught me by surprise, and I really had no new games to play, neither on my Xbox nor Steam. So, I do as I usually do: come on Steam and find a free to play game, looking for something to do until I find something else. So, naturally, I stumble into here: Fallen Earth. The graphics didn't look 10/10, but most small free games like this don't. I decide, eh, why not, I'll install it. Didn't take all too long, I was able to download it in about two hours, even with my potato-net, which I guess could make it one of maybe... three good things about the game.I start up the game, and I am immediately prompted to create a new character. The character creation is... meh. Not as good as Fallout 4's, but still good enough for me to continue playing. However, what did catch me surprise and quite annoy me was the lack of... well, almost any sound effects. Throughout my entire playthrough I could count... maybe 10? Not countine that one cutscene that was literally the only thing good about the game.I start up my character. I'm just prompted to kill some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, then some random chick starts talking to me out of no where. Apparently I'm some sort of clone? Whatever, I knew from the second I stepped in that the story was not going to exist... at all. Which I was kind of wrong about, as shown by the first cutscene, however I honestly doubt anyone would be able to stand the game for that long.So, I just realized that I literally wrote a ♥♥♥♥ing paragraph that no one's going to read about a game no one's going to play. Want my opinion? Do not install this. Ever. Under any condition.			"

												Decent game. This game would honestly be harder to get into if it was not free. It's a little similar to Fallout but without all the weapons, storyline or anything phsyically in Fallout. It's a post - apocalyptic wasteland with more online people! The loot drops are fair to the person who kills said enemy, which is cool. I would recommend being patient with the updating system aswell because it takes its time! Other than that a pretty decent game.			"

												I used to play this game untill I came across this creepo who would sit online doing nothing and just wait till I got on... then there is the fact that you can set up a hotkey to loot.. it makes you loot faster than mouse users.. in turn they cry to the admins like babies... not my fault you are bad.. Melee blows.. if you dont make a gun character you are useless.. found that out the hard way...  The screen shots are very decieveing... the game doesnt look that good...			"

												1. Was interested in game, because apparently GamersFirst took it over and created some controversies.2. People complained about P2W crap but I also noticed good reviews, even after the takeover.3. Downloaded and created account.4. Patcher opens and shows me this picture: http://i.imgur.com/Kgw4D5b.png5. I remember the gold sellers from other freemium crap MMORPGs.6. I cancel the patching and uninstall the game.10/10 would try out freemium crap again.			"

												   Well I don't really know how to start this off so I suppose I will dive right into it. This game is unfortunately a shotty shell of what it seemingly was meant to be. I didn't even play for very long before I got tired of it. What I don't like:Non-Intuitive Controls - Seriously, the controls in this game don't make much sense at all. This game is an MMO style game. Most MMO games use the same basic control system for things like interacting with the environment, and looting. This is fixed by spending about 5 minutes remapping the keys to what they SHOULD be for an MMO. It is almost as if the Devs had never played an MMO before to understand what the keyboard layout is. Why are Q and E mapped to ""rotate the character left and right?"" What game even has those as keys? Q should be a hotkey ability and E should access looting, same with a right click.Clunky First Person Mode - Here is the thing about making an MMO with the ability to play in first person. Either polish it to the point where it is remotely functional, or DONT HAVE A FIRST PERSON MODE.In short, don't waste your time with this game unless the devs decide to make the UI acceptable.			"

												 I have played this game on and off sense it was released. And it has and had alot of good aspects. The crafting is very involving and rewarding, the character development is good as well. Though it suffers and has suffered due to several things. The first is shortly after it's first release they practically scapped parts of the system, the mutation system, the buff system and alot of the associated mechanics. Then they went and went overboard trying to satisfy the pvp crowd and nuked the pve system.  Then they went in and later changed the character system fundamentally making stats less relevant, and related skills less relevant. So the major issue is the developers have no idea what this game is supposed to actually be, and don't actually update it anymore. It is fun but not something you can play for any extended time.			"

You will have tears in your eyes. And again folks this game came out in like 2010 or something. So it should be way,way better.Its free tho..give it a shot.Best part about it is the theme...after u get over it..you will uninstall.Uber fail game.most of those hours were spent standing in one zone farming chips.So was pretty boring overall.

												This game is probably the WORST game I have ever played, I played DOTA and Clicker Heroes. So first of all let's recognize what is good in this game. The Storyline... That is literally it. Oh wait! There is... Nope, nothing. Nothing else at all. First of all, there is absolutely no fighting audio... Not even a gun sound or a cutting through the wind sound when you swing something... BUT there is a death audio. That doesn't even make sense actually, no fight audio BUT HEY LET'S MAKE A DEATH SOUND! Literally hated this game, especially since I spent about eight hours installing this game and then another hour and a half doing the wierd thing it does when you first start up. Oh and I forgot it DOES have two good things, it runs pretty well on my brothers crappy computer but the install took forever on my alienware.... I hate this game and I unistalled it as soon as I couldn't take it anymore.			"

												I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game. I ♥♥♥♥ing hate this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle.God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION.

												Gamersfirst, just what is this company? They are a company who ""buys"" games from other companies. They are a company who believes that editing out original authors of game developers is okay. Their game known as Fallen Earth is great; however, the Game Masters of the game are corrupt. For the past few years Fallen Earth has been suffering from multiple pvp aimbotters/duplicaters and many more glitchers/exploiters, and what do they GAME MASTERS do? ""NOTHING"" They believe that banning innocent players for no reason is the key, accepting bribes from known aimbotters/cheaters and other sources in order for players who are ""legit"" get banned. It's wrong and outrageous and I believe that these Game Masters need to get what they deserve ""FIRED"". Tiggs and Dasterd both do this, sure sure, they are well known the gaming community, well maybe they should of thought about this before accepting money to ban legit gamers. Due to this, I give Fallen Earth a +1 for being a good game and a -9 for the Game Masters behavior. In conclusion, this game has received yet another ""Negative"" review and Gamersfirst should be more cautious as to who they hire.			"

I mean I would of payed for this but, the craft system is pretty difficult. I don't think I will ever come back to this game.  This game would be nice if you could get items more efficiently, instead of having to scavenge. I mean in Fallout you do have to scavenge but theres a actual efficient money system. Don't get me wrong, but this game is terrible. If this game could be more like Fallout I would play it, and it would be nice if the graphics were a bit better the first person view gives me cancer when I look at it. I mean even Fallout graphics are better then this. The graphhics look like they didn't take their time when importing it. I really dont think you should need to craft EVERYTHING. I mean you cant even find guns on the ground.			"

												I like this game, It hase own atmosphere and many of gr8 things BUT the game support and GMs are really sucks!You can be baned for no reason FOREVER! we had a situation that we spamed in chat /help just 5 masseges or so and we were NOT muted but kicked and baned, not for few hours, not for day or week but for forever! They don't care if you payed for premium account or something! And I think that it's not fear becouse much of players spam in this help chat and the don't get ban fo this, what the reason??? How the support can say somthing abot justice if they do what they want, and blocking account as they want?

												i played this in 2012, and it seemed ok, at the time. I was low level, and the game was a lot of running back and forth. Sometimes I'd see a higher ranked player in some sort of vehicle (car or motorcycle), and then they'd drive off. Its a game i would play, if there were no other games to play... maybe. Because its an MMO, the game play is extremely slow. And thats its worst downfall.			"

												I like this game, It hase own atmosphere and many of gr8 things BUT the game support and GMs are really sucks!You can be baned for no reason FOREVER! we had a situation that we spamed in chat /help just 5 masseges or so and we were NOT muted but kicked and baned, not for few hours, not for day or week but for forever! They don't care if you payed for premium account or something! And I think that it's not fear becouse much of players spam in this help chat and the don't get ban fo this, what the reason??? How the support can say somthing abot justice if they do what they want, and blocking account as they want? They don't write ruls on a website that EVERYBODY could see them just TOS and u have to find it by yourself in forums, what the hell? They don't write for what you can be banned.

I have heard from others that they have the same problem. Link is picture of what I am talking about http://i.imgur.com/z3Wc69A.pngBasically, the game is run like a spoiled kids plaything, because GMs ingame have little oversight and do not really care about keeping up the playerbase. It is rotting in its prime. And a shame, because it had really great mechanics when it first was introduced years ago.			"

												This game has pretty much everything, except the usual dragons and things like that and thats the main part of the reason i like the game, im so fed up with RPGs always being some kind of D&D spinoff.I joined FE when it was still rather new and the seamless huge world in which it takes place, really appealed to me.At some point though, this game went F2P instead of subscription based as it used to be and thats about when i stopped playing, because it became much like the channel packages u get u choose from at ur cable provider, where the basic setting contains all the crappy channels and the channels u really want, only comes in a bundle where u pay for 5 channels to get that single channel u actually do want.I liked it better when FE was subsctription based, everyone contributed the same and everyone was equally set in the world of FE, no one had special advantages and the same amount of in-game effort, would earn anyone the same amount of gain.Apart from that, the game has a ton of hrs of fun, especially if u team up with other players and maybe even join or found a clan.The crafting system is brilliant, crafting takes quite some time (unless they changed it since i played that is), i recall it taking like 2 or 3 rl minutes to make a bandage and 10 mins to craft a small batch of ammo.Crafting things like mounts, may take up to several days depending on the level of the mount and while that may seem like a lot, it soon becomes very natural in the game as u dont find urself waiting around for crafts to complete, because u actually learn to plan ur crafting and that becomes a part of the game that contributes to full experience in a very good way.There are safe areas where other players wont be able to attack u and that makes it possible to settle as a crafter/merchant with little or no fighting skills and as u can have more chrs, u can do good by building a ""money farmer"" to supply ur fighter chr with money.Missions are good and works well and u are free to complete the missions over and over again to farm special drops, xp etc.Beware that like i said, its been quite some time since i stopped playing and some things may have changed.The only change im pretty sure of that hasnt happend but has been awaited since the game came out, is player housing, that part unfortunately doesnt exist, so everything u gather in game will have to be stored in ""vaults"".The vault system works well though, its put together of different vault types where some vaults appear more often than others, so the stuff u need the most, will have to go into the standard vault in order to be easily accessed from ""anywhere"".The vaults has a fixed amount of slots and ofc u can buy more slots by paying money, but at least (afaik) its still a one time fee.When u pay real money, u can get your xp gain furthered and basically it means, if u wanna level at a descent and not too boring speed, u will have to pay and so it goes for other things as well.Id still vote that this game goes back to subscription based, so that a good handfull of the players wont have to pay for all of those who play for free.The only good thing about F2P is that u get to try before u buy, but that couldve been achieved with a normal demo, i seem to recall that when i joined FE, it had a demo that allowed u to play until u reached level 15 or so, after that u couldnt level any further.Playing until level 15 were more than enough to decide whether to buy the game or not.

												This I can honestly say without a minor fragmant of doubt, is the worst MMO I've ever played in my entire life. I say that with full knowledge of Quest64.♥♥♥♥♥♥ tutorials, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics.It wouldn't update at first no matter WHAT I did. Then after working my ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥off it finally decided ot MAYBE just download. Don't bother with this, it looks good from the pictures, but let me tell you, when a game let's you go in first person, BUT only when you back up into a wall, your game is ♥♥♥♥ed.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(Due to alot of backlash towards most of my reviews because little kids can't seem to understand what an ""opinion"" is and get angry and overreact at something sticking out of the pervervial line, I must leave a warning. Thanks kids!)This is my opinion, I make these reviews to get my opinion out there, if you disagree, I'm not saying my opinions are fact, in which case, no need to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at something as trivial as a ""review"" or ""opinion"" I have an opinion and a mind that proccesses things and I like to let them be known rather than sheltered, weather it be good or bad. I'm not trying to change anyone's opinion on anything, if you disagree, calmly, put my thoughts into perspective, and see if you agree or not. If you don't want to do that and would rather rage over my opinion, then don't look at reviews, you're not mature enough to handle them.			"

												I haven't played this game in a long time. I probably forgot my password to log in and everything but from what I remember, I had A LOT of fun. I've been playing it since before it got on steam. I had at least over 70+ hours on it until steam came along where I logged in another 28 hours. From what I hear, the game is pretty dead. I really hope this isn't true because this game holds a special place in my life. It'd be too depressing to reinstall and log in to my old account only to see a dead and empty world void of players... the true post-apocalyptic wasteland experience I guess?...			"

												Game is excellent. The Post apocaliptyc punk-set scenario that looks like Mad Max makes you wanna keep playing till you fall asleep over your keyboard. Altough the game crashed a lot at the beginning and there were a lot of bugs and a huge post download, that's not the reason i'm negativating it. Im negativating it cause the GMs are a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ing stalkers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who at the minimum joke ban your IP, yeah that's right your IP from servers making you not able to play the game again. Piece of ♥♥♥♥ing crap administration and the guy who created this clearly had no intention of spreading it out or have a serious Player basis. 1/10 for the Game Masters.			"

												I enjoyed Fallen Earth, but there is a lot to this game that makes me cringe.The crafting times get ridiculous, you don't get much help from the Help chat (if anything you just get extremely annoyed by the noobs asking how to ride a horse), the GM's act like punks as well as most other players, some enemies might be a little overpowered and may require you to bring friends, which are hard to acquire if you aren't lucky, and I guess you're not allowed to hold a ton of chips on hand...? I dunno, I had red chips in the mail and some on hand, but couldn't collect them. It's been a while since I played, so I don't remember everything, but I think I had to get premium to hold more or something like that.It's not all that bad, though. It's good for an apocolypse game that comes with good ideas for character builds and such. I like that you can craft pretty much everything you need, but some materials are extremely hard to get, and as I said beore, the crafting times are crazy.FE is basically an apocolyptic World of Warcraft. Obviously not as big, popular, or 'fixed'. 7/10 in my opinion to say the least.			"

												IT WORKED! THE UNINSTALL BUTTON ACTUALLY WORKED!I don't have to look at other reviews to see why this game is bad. I am the unlucky one who actually played it. I didnt even have to beat half he tutorial to notice wasted potential and lies from the screenshots.When i downloaded this game, I expected something like fallout 4 multiplayer. What I got was nothing like that.Here is a list of the pros and cons of the game:Pros: (God this is short)-This is F2P.-As before mentioned, the uninstall button works very well.-It has live action battles, unlike many games that are similar. (What I think of is Star Wars: The Old Republic)-I can tell you not to get it.Cons:-♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics unless you have a super computer-Restarts to change options-When it restarts, you have to close it if you log in with steam-Of the 3.2 hours I played, 3 of them were trying to get the game to log me in and let me play-Does t include a 'draw distance' option. I still don't know how to fix it.-Minimum requirements = This game will launch on your computer at lowest graphics at 1 fps (XP users be warned)-♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls (W and S are the only proper ones. The rest make me want to press mmb, select myself, and suicide)-Lag... on the tutorial-GRAPHICS GLITCHES!!!!!!!!-Lag on worse computers makes combat impossible. The point where I said no means no-Reason I have PTSDOverall opinion: this is a great game... to test that trusty uninstall button.			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.But really, this game blows now, even more than it did before which I didn't think was possible.			"

												I do not recommend this game to people who like good graphics, As they are pretty bad, But there is something that was really bugging me. I enjoyed the game Until a bug came out of nowhere and now I can't fight anything, I do not recommend this because you will play it someone out there probably one of you wont be able to fight anymore and you will be sad. Do not play this!			"

												Only played for 3 hours and already found it gay. You can only pvp if you AND the other players type /pvp command (which no one does so PVP is out of the question). And the NPC is stupid and gay.....I was standing infront of them and they didnt see me. This game is gay......gay......Any game that has Free2Play in the title is one that desperately needs players....probably because its so gay to have players in the first place....so the game is gay....<3 and peace.
