												At one point this was my fav game ive ever played and then the devs got bought by kabam and kabam made this a pay to win like no other. and pretty much all the old players quit, and you can tell kabam only wants money from this.    sad to see that happen to one of my use to be fav games.r.i.p   Realm Of the Mad God(EDIT for those who dont really understand)ok i admit its all 100% a pay to win.its more of a pay to have fun, and make any real progress.pets to heal you, regen all your stuff, and attack for you, gotta pay to make them work.theres, backpacks,potions, item drop enhancers, very powerful items right off from the start. only way you can get any of these is with money. NOW , i wouldnt mind, skins, colors, things like that you know? like the old days of this game.			"

												The game WAS amazing....back then.Before when Wild-Shadow-Studios owned the game the game was made for the players. As soon as kabam took over they completly ruined the game. To explain what they ruined: Ruined Ammys making them scammys, Making UT's untradeable, so we cant make back your ingame currency and finnaly, Making it pay to win-what do i mean by pay-to-win? they have implemented the feature to get items with real money, which makes the game no fun, as newbies will completely mistake the game and over take us long time players.if you dont pay you wont win.Over all if you think im out of my mind, im not, ive played the game for over 600 hours, Im a red star,and ive lost over 20 max stat charecters most of them where 6/8 and gave over 2000 fame. I also own a guild.Before when Wild Shadow Studios owned it- 120/10-------------Now because of Kabam- 4/10------Because of this i do not recommend this game anymore.			"

												Before you say I have no experience with this game, I have played for a good few hundred hours on the browser version.This game USED to be good. It really was. Back then, a company called Wildshadow owned the game. It was truly f2p, with skill and no money required.Then, a company called Kabam took over. They changed the game into a cashgrab. Skins? Buy gold. Vaults and characters? Buy gold. 1-life weapons or keys? Buy gold. Everything is gold gold gold. Updates are rare, and even when they come they just add more items to be purchased with gold. In fact, the way they 'celebrate' holidays is by creating cheap weapon reskins for more people to buy with.. you guessed it, gold!!You might be thinking, at least there's player interaction! No, there isn't. The game is infested with hackers, scammers, enemy draggers, spambots, etc. Kabam doesn't care at all. After all, you don't make any money from clearing away hackers, so why bother?TL;DR: Stay away.			"

												Used to play this back on Kongregate (I believe it was on there) and a bit when it came on Steam. Was probably the best perma-death RPG game you could find. Didn't have demanding PC requirements, cool and clean pixelated visuals, easy-to-pick up hard-to-master bullet hell-style gameplay. Overall, it was great fun and I enjoyed my time with it.So I thought this game had died out a while ago (some time since I had played it regularly), but it turns out the game is still going strong...really strong actually. I was pretty excited and saw that this game has the VERY POSITIVE rating on Steam. As I was strolling down to read some of the top reviews, I noticed a new publisher called Kabam in the game's description area. Interesting. So I finally make it to the reviews and what I see is a bunch of negative reviews about how pay-2-win this game is after Kabam took over.I couldn't believe it was THAT bad so I tried it out myself a few weeks ago. Downloaded it through Steam, loaded it up.....Wow. Another example of an amazing game ruined by greedy companies tainting the free-2-play model. No one wonder people are hating on free-2-play games when we got so much greedy companies these days. But Kabam really butchered this game. Everything good requires money. Skill is irrevelant. I can't believe they actually managed to take the skill factor out of a bullet-hell game. What's the world coming to....I.Rather.Have.Perfect.World.Own.This.....Hell.I.Rather.Have.Nexon.Own.This.Than.KabamNever again Kabam...never again.			"

												I used to play this game a far long time ago, back on Kongregate. It was a good game, plenty of fun to be had, and the perma-death, while annoying, only made me more determined to do better in the future, work with my friends, and pursue a higher goal.But that was a different time entirely; a golden age long since past.So, around 2 years later, being a more experienced and wisened individual, I decided to check this game out again, seeing it was on Steam. I went into the reviews, and noticed...a surprising negative reaction among a bulk of the players, even ones who've spent over hundreds of hours. I thought to myself, Well it just can't be as bad as these people say, right? People love to use hyperbole to make a point. In my lack of judgement, I decided to play this again...I regretted said decision.[GETTING STARTED]So I started up the game after a shockingly-fast install time of roughly 2 seconds. Flash games, gotta love'em. I start things up, go into my character menu, and realize that half the screen's dedicated to selling me crap. That's not a good sign...I start up my one character slot, and I go through the motions of picking my first hero, a Warrior. The tutorial's straight-forward, I blitzed through fairly quickly, and reached the point where I named the account. For review sake, I'll disclose my account username in-game was DMNTDxNem.[MY EXPERIENCE]When I first started up my warrior, in the first server I selected, things went overall decently for me. I stuck to the beach, like the game said to, and leveled up to 3 before taking on a little deeper in the forest areas. Reaching around level 5 now, fighting against not only the enemies, but the server lag, I decide a quick respite at the Nexus was in order.Now, from when I was playing this back on Kongregate, I used to love the Nexus! It was crowded pretty often, yeah, but there tended to be a lot of friendly player interaction; people helping each other, constantly working in each other's benefit to get better gear and equipment, there was always strong community there.But on my return trip to the Nexus during this refresher playthrough, I realized the game's first critical issue:Bots! Bots everywhere! I couldn't speak to any of the players, as few as there even were around, without bots running up and drowning us out. I cannot tell you how much I desperately wanted to kill some of these players; physically. In real life. I was that angry.Aside from that, though, there was also the issue of the shop items. Originally, pre-dev change, the shop items, while difficult to acquire, were completely do-able, and it was rather straight-forward; you earn coins, you go to the shop, you spend coins on an item you want (and eventually die and lose, but I digress,) and you got said item. Now, shop items range from the hundreds to the thousands in coin value! And if you came back into the game with 50 coins earned, many of the shop items that were once 50 are now 51, meaning you'd be forced to pay for one more bloody coin! Slowly, I was realizing that people's anger was rather justified.Enough about the Nexus and the broken shop, though. I went back in, enjoyed my time fighting through enemy territory, until it appeared the server I was on had a server-wide boss battle occurring. Everyone was teleported into a dangerous, high-level world dungeon: Oryx's Castle. I, among many players, was ill-equipped for the encounter, so I ended up dying along heaps of other players, who all probably experienced the same game-breaking lag spikes that I did. Congratulations, RotMG; you, a flash game, made my high-performance gaming computer buckle onto its knees...Second go, another warrior, and I was definitely getting the hang of things. I beat a few dungeon bosses, went into the ruins and killed a few mini-bosses strewn across the world, and grabbed some decent equipment. Things were going good, and the whole thing went just as I'd hoped. Barring the several passing exchanges I gave the bots advertising their crummy products, to which I had some choice opinions of them, I finally came across an actual, breathing player; they were running around like the flash, and when I strolled up, they told me about a dungeon where they could help me get some better equipment. Now, I'll say in advance that I read the reviews extensively, and knew there were players who got their kicks off of getting people with good characters killed. I thought to myself, Well, my guy's crap, so he'd be wasting his time if he just wanted to off me.How wrong I was.First off, the dungeon he dragged me into was from some candy dude that was prancing around like the Gingerbread Man. I insisted on being the one to take him down, so a little Looney Tunes-style chase went on, me using mana potions to keep up like Lance Armstrong used drugs for the Tour De France, and finally was able to dead him to death. Me and the guy go in, and before my eyes, he vanishes through a wall...and when he returned, every enemy he could alert in the area was with him. Running as far as I could, not long, considering I used up all my mana, I was eventually shot to death by a unicorn pinata barfing rainbows. And so, at level 9, Sir Gullible II was found dead due to overdose on vibrant colors. The last words he ever heard were from his once-thought ally, typing in ""#rekt"" about 7 times. Fun times were had..[GAMEPLAY]Now, the fact the game now being a botting trollfest of epic proportions notwithstanding, it's still incredibly functional. The base game works as intended, and the system hasn't changed all that much since 2 years ago. Now, I'll admit the difficulty curve's definitely become harder to cope with, especially how the higher-tier equipment is even harder to acquire than ever before, unless you throw your wallet at the screen, but by the by, it hasn't really changed all that much. You still work with other players, you still try for the best loot, and you still fight towards the ultimate goal of taking down the Mad God.You have your four slots, weapon, helmet, armor, and ring, and equipment is divided amongst different classes, rings being the only ones where any class can use anything they find for that slot. Each class has different advantages and disadvantages; warriors can buff allies and face-tank, wizards can do solid damage, archers can hit multiple enemies at once, they're all viable for different reasons.Remember, of course, about the perma-death mechanic; once a character's dead, they're dead. Anything they had, if you didn't get it sorted out or saved, is gone, so it's incredibly important to manage the equipment that you find, so that the next time someone throws a death-spewing unicorn at you, you'll have plenty of equipment for the next character that hits the ground.[SUMMARY/FINAL THOUGHTS]In all, the game's as it's always been: you play, you die, you improve, you die again, the cycle continues. Granted, there are the more-than-occasional hacking players that either screw you out of loot, or, in my experience, send sentient pinatas to murder you with rainbows, so the cycle is a bit less off a circle, and more of a triangle, where every corner is a slap to the face. You get your first slap when you boot up the game, and you're being asked to buy crap you don't even need; you get the second slap going to the Nexus, once a sanctum for player cooperation, now a den of botting inequity and a broken economy; and the final slap, rounding this merry-go-♥♥♥♥-yourself out quite nicely, is the afore-mentioned hackers, honing their trolling skills to a weaponized level in the goal of wanting you dead.I have it on word that things have changed hands, and that the game's improved somewhat. I intend to take a look at things again sometime, but for now, the review will stand until I do.			"

												Hoo, this game.  Was a lot of fun for the first 60 hours...before the company got bought out by a bigger company.  Apparently that company had big ideas in terms of monetizing the hell out of this fairly enjoyable free to play game.  I enjoyed it back when it was catching on, but I think the game has definitely taken a turn for the worse when it got bought out.  The design is more focused towards getting your money than making the game more enjoyable.  When a game does that, even if I already invested 60 hours, I walk away rather than get treated like a bag of money by the game's designers and publishers.			"

												Alright. This game. I used to play it on its website, but I downloaded it on here to review it. Realm of the Mad God used to be one of the games I played the most. However, when the company Kabam bought it, it instantly became a store. Kabam are just greedy, money grabbing rip-offs, and they are the exact reason I have stopped playing this game. The main lobby is just a store, showing off weapons, armor, pets, and other things that can only be bought with coins, which can be bought with real money, or can be earned from dieing with a decent to good character who needs good stats to actually earn the coins.Feel free to play this game, but prepare your ♥♥♥♥ for micro-transactions and updates that only benifit people who love to spend money.

												Oh god, I remember first finding out about this game while it was being made for a competition on TIGsource. It was great fun, and I suppose it still is, but after a while of not playing it and coming back to see so many changes, It has definitely taken a turn for the worst.The basic premise of the game is pretty much a multiplayer 'bullet hell' style game, most of the action (PvE) takes place on a randomly generated continent which is really big and possesses many diverse environments. This means that there's not a shortage of bosses and mooks to kill, and temples  and castles to raid for loot. The item system is pretty easy to understand, with gear being divided on tiers, a higher tier meaning rarer and more powerful items. Initially, you are made to choose a class and dropped off in a tutorial with only a basic weapon and a skill item. The game itself is pretty fun, and you can play for hours without it getting boring or repetitive. Here's where the game starts falling apart. Most of the action that happens later is just plain old grinding. Even for the hardest monsters getting item drops is really hard, as the item drop rate is extremely tiny.The worst thing that's happened to this game was the developers being bought by Kabam. It has pretty much become a pay-to-win affair. Before, you could buy cosmetic items and pets with real money to support the developers. Now you can get the rarest armours and weapons with a few bucks. Like I said before, the item drop rates are ridiculous, so selling weapons and items for real money feels kind of cheap.All in all, a good game ruined by 'freemium'. If you play it, expect to grind a lot, or pay up.			"

												tl;dr The game used to be good but the new company that owns it, Kabam transformed it into a pay to win game rather than having players rely on skill.As an experienced player of this game I cannot honestly not recomend it. Ever since Kabam took it over it has transformed the game from an awesome fantasy rogue like bullet hell, to a generic pay to win mmo. Everytime I play it I feel like it's missing a purpose, and that all I'm doing is running around with underpowered gear attempting to kill bosses, and often failing in doing so because of the way Kabam has remade the game. It is only really fun if you play it with friends, or if you play it for about 10-20 minutes, which really breaks my heart because it used to be one of my all time favorite mmo's back before I ahd a nice computer. 3/10			"

												Fun... one day it was. Not only has the new owner of this company, Kabam, has not only turned this game into a cold-hard pay-to-win, moreover it is extremely careless about anyone who plays this game. The game is infested by many 'hacked clients' of people dashing trough walls and using various other illegit tricks, sometimes just to take away your chances at phat loot, sometimes purposely drag huge mobs of enemies on you trying to get that character of yours killed. Let's not even mention people sitting on the most powerful enemies in the game, taking no damage at all, and calling people to teleport for interesting stuff - instead they teleport to an instadeath. another character wasted.If you would be able to look past all these downsides there is plenty of fun to be found, and i have found it, before this curtain of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t appeared.

Thats why all the servers are 10x emptier now. Nice job kabam... (note that I have little hours on the game because I played on Google Chrome, not steam).			"

												Realm of the Mad God (RotMG) is a great game at certain times, but then you can feel like you have wasted too much time on it. Once you get to level 20 the game is going to give you a cookie, then kick you in the shins and take the cookie back. Generally speaking in a neutral point to review, this game will most likely pull you in once you put some time into it and you will grow to hate the game when you die, and then find it creeping back on your a few weeks/months later and have a sudden desire to play again. Once you die there is no way to recover your character or any of the items, which is the most frustrating part of the game. However, you can pay real money (which I'm not a fan of, but in no way would I consider this a pay-to-win game) to get more characters slots so that you can still have the other guys when you die. Play this game if you have a lot of extra time because it will pull you in fast.			"

												I've been playing this game for 5 years now. One thing is for sure, once you get your first white bag, it's like a drug. You want to kill more and more bosses for that chance of getting a beautiful white bag. The loot aspect of this game is very well done. When you get a very rare item it makes you look super pro compared to other players. These items, event items, in particular are honestly a bit too rare. Like I said, I've been playing for 5 years. In that 5 years I've only gotten two of these items. Getting each one was one of the happiest things I've ever experienced in a game, but of course I ended up dying with them, because everyone dies in this game eventually. You invest hours and hours of grinding into one character to have it die and dissapear forever. When your characters are alive it's somewhat fun, grinding for rare items, but when you die it is literally one of the worst feelings you will ever have. After dying over and over again, and then dying with an item I grinded months for, I've decided that this game is truly not worth the time I've invested into it. The game has brought me more grief than happiness, that's for sure. If you want to grind for hours and hours on end and then have all the work dissapear in a micro-second, play this game. Oh yeah, and the community is absolute garbage. It's full of mean people and annoying kids who spam harambe and doge memes in the chat.			"

												Realm of the Mad God, one of the most addictive 2D MMORPG I've played. I've got 3 years of this game on my belt so I'd like to think I know the pro's and con's.The game publisher, Kabam. Money fiends. They take advantage of permanent death. Having the game focused around the age group of  little kids and their parents credit card details. With $20 USD you can purchase 2600 gold coins for in game. However these coins majority of the time will not last more than 2 days if not 1. If you wanted the best items from the beginning of the game (Yes you can buy the best 'tradable' items right away!) for a warrior for example, that'd cost 2360 gold. Once you have purchased anything you are more than likely going to die due to a lagspike.Through my 3 years of playing Realm I've had my fair share of seeing the occasional hacker, however occasional is a bit of an understatement. After contacting Kabam staff multiple times about hackers, I was told to video my gameplay. Staff replied with and I quote, ""Thank you for writing in with your concern. Do you have any video of these Players? If so, please send it my way. As for reporting Players, this is the best way to do it; just get some video of them violating ToS and send it our way!"" - Synistrr. Take time from our gameplay to catch hackers? That isn't our job, we are not employed by Kabam.All in all, Realm of the Mad God is definitely a pay to win game, or hack to win.			"

												Game is decent, unfortunately updates consistantly wipe progress, so expect that. Publishers are known to not give people microtransaction refunds after a character wipe.--(Dec 2015 Edit: Not sure if wipes still happen, however I'm technically locked out of my account and support has stopped responding to me, so for Steam users that never migrated to an email like me, our items are officially locked out, paid or not)--Every time there has been a character wipe, they say they will correct it next time, but they never do and it's been this way for years. It's come to the point that people just accept it and most people don't even complain about it anymore. Unfortunately it's not something you will see listed on the store page or in their microtransaction shop.Recently there is a new issue with this game. Some steam users that didn't link their account to an email are no longer allowed to access their RotMG account. I happen to be one of these users, yet another slap in the face. As far as I know this only is affecting steam users and those affected have no way to play the game through their steam account, they can't even start over.If you are absolutely certain you won't be spending a dime on this game, it might be worth a try if you like dungeon crawlers, it's about as good as dungeonland but with worse graphics. Otherwise stay away, spending cash for temporary items is no fun, losing all your hard work is even less fun still.""""""""Steam account can't connect - 02072900Thank you for contacting us.

												I played the browser version of this a lot. It was plenty fun, grinding pots with friends, maxing a char, dying, crying, vowing not to be overconfident again, then repeat. It would still be fun right now if Kabam actually puts their effort into balancing the classes and dungeons and all that, but noooo they only care about their sweet money. We haven't seen an update for months, and the game is overrun by hackers and bots. I wish I can see your glorious days again, my dear RotMG..			"

Realize that this game was founded by Satan himself so he could feast apon the sweat, blood, and tears of the many innocent souls that played this evil, dark game. Realize that you can quit, that you could go on playing better games like Counter Strike, Terraria, Skyrim, Team Fortess 2. Realize that you could just quit the game and never touch it again.

												I've been playing this game for years (even if not through Steam), and I can say that, through time, it has evolved to provide many unique and exciting features:- Severe game balancing issues! Land tons of damage with one class and steal loot from other poor useless players!- No serious updates in years! You can play the same dungeons again, and again and again! And then some more! - Rampant cheating! And if this doesn't still sell this to you, also know that the company now managing the game, the infamous Kabam, totally ignores cheater reports!- Poisonous community! Scammers? We got those! Leechers? Of course, the game actually encourages leeching! Racial and homophobic insults? Goes without saying!- Pay to win!!! You think you can max your pet without spending real money? Think again!!! And if you don't feel like buying game gold, just check out the black market spambots that make the game chat window completely unusable!- Much, much more!			"

												Realm of the Mad God is a top down free to play MMO mouse aim shooter with a simple art style. It has been around for a few years as a Flash game. You start the game easy enough, by selecting from unlocked classes such as rogue, warrior, priest, archer and so on. Each class plays the same, you fire projectiles. Have a sword? You shoot projectiles. The only difference between the classes are the stats and the equipment they can use. You can unlock more classes when you reach certain levels with the base classes. Each enemy gives you some minimal experience and leveling up will only improve your stats. There are no new spells and no choice of improvement. It all feels very dull and too simple for a MMO.The controls are like every other mouse aim shooter, arrows to move with mouse aim and click to shoot. You have a special ability and potions too, but for the most part you can just use your normal attacks. Speaking of the mouse aim, it feels very inaccurate. I can stand still, fire the projectile and the projectile will miss even when I shouldn't. Maybe there is an accuracy stat or something. It feels odd when enemies very accurate. Luckily you are quick enough to dodge projectiles. Again, maybe its a stat and I need to have better gear, but there is nothing on the equipment that shows accuracy, just range and attack power.There are a lot of enemies, each with different stats and attack patterns. For the most part they have enemies simply shoot at you. Most have single shots, others have double and triple spreading shots. Still some fire a sort of 360 degree bullet shield preventing anything from getting close. The bosses aren't that different from normal enemies. They just have larger sprites with other creatures swarmed around them.There are quests in the game, but I mean that in the vaguest sense of the word. All quests seem to be kill the big monster. No one tells you to. You just do it. The game points out the direction of the big monster when you enter the location.The maps feel a bit jumbled randomly with trees and foliage with a path drawn through the map. It just feels like lazy or quick map design and not 'randomly generated.' Some enemies will drop portals to different areas which is a fun feature, but since the areas look just thrown together its always just another randomly thrown together area. You have a mini map that will reveal more as you explore, but if you leave an area and return, you need to explore it again to show it on your mini map. At any time out in the wilderness, you can instantly warp back to the town / nexus with the click of a button. The locations might look like a jumbled mess, but the town / nexus looks great, but its all just a big store to sell you stuff. All of the stores have items visibly showing you everything so you need to walk over them instead of having an easy to use menu. Another problem is to see the stats of the item you need to hover your mouse over the 'buy it' button. Don't accidentally click that button though. You cannot sell equipment, so you're forced to drop it or trade it with other players, but for the most part the equipment feels useless when enemies drop it all. Plus players are kind enough to just give stuff for free since everything is so abundant.Normal games would have you kill enemies for gold, but in Realm of the Mad God, you need to buy gold with real money of course. Everything is right there in town / nexus for you to buy after a brief tutorial area. What do you buy with gold? Name changes, more characters, armor, weapons, rings, boxes with random items, keys, pets, extra storage, building materials and everything. Did I mention that when you die you lose all progress and items? So if you spend real life money into a free game and you die, you've just lost everything. Do you need gold to have fun? No. The town / nexus has plenty of people selling gold via their website for real money and it floods the chat for some servers drowning out any real discussion.This feels like a really dull game that is out for your money. Not just that, but it seems hastily thrown together. The quick simple art style, the slow grind for experience, the awful map design, no real quests, the laggy input, and the inaccurate aiming, all makes me not want to be in the game let alone buy anything in the game with real money.

												This weird pixel graphic action mmo dungeon crawler with rogue-like elements was created a long time ago by a small company called wildshadow. After years of awesomeness they had to sell it to kabam to keep the game going, kabam kept it going for some more years also, and now finally it's in the hands of Deca(Thankfully being revived by them after kabam's dark era). I've been with this game for so long i keep coming back to it, the 1000+ hours i have here are only with the steam account(had 2 older accounts before this one). I'm mentioning this so you get the idea that this game is very hard to kill, the people just wanna play this ****. If you're thinking about playing this game let me transfer some of my genuine info to you :). The game is extremely grind-based, so if you're not someone who likes to grind for endless hours everyday then this game should be a pass for you before i even go any further. Now for some pros and cons.+ Huge variety of enemies/bosses/events with unique variations of butt-clenching bullet hell patterns and tactics.+ More than big enough player base( very active game)+ Huge variety of items that adds to the already great replayabilty value of the game.+ The game is based alot on team play and as mentioned above there's always people to play along with.+ The game is being properly revived by Deca games and right now is the best time to start playing this game. (Month of the mad god, a special month, will run from 21 july till around the end of august).- The community(Like most gaming communities) can be very toxic at times. Not as toxic as moba communities don't worry :)- Lag in this game can punish you extremely high as it is a perma-death game. You need to take caution from both server lag and your own internet lag as not to lose a month work in a second. If you have a decently stable internet connection you should be safe from a lag related death most of the time though.-  Client users/Hacker/Dupers/Bots love to manifest this game; BUT Deca(unlike kabam) is already showing alot of promise in making this a thing of history(fingers crossed).Conclusion: Definitely a strong recommendation from me, i absoloutely love this game, and you won't have to pay a dime to try it so you should definitely do that. 9/10			"

												I have a love hate relationship with this game. After dying, you sort of chill for some time or so depending how long you spent building that character.Usually a 0/8 character is equivalent to a few days of chill, while dying as a 6/8 would be rage inducing to the point of a few weeks of chill. I know, I know, you're probably thinking it's just a game, you shouldn't even rage, yea, yea ""Git Gud"". But, because it's permadeath, you lose everything, everything you've earnt. Let me tell you, when you get attached to one character, you are one with the character, and when you die in the game, it feels like dying in real life.   It’s not a bad game, proof? Well you wouldn’t see people play this game for hundreds of hours if it was a bad game. In addition I played way more of this game on the internet version. Yea it consumed me (not as much as it did for others though). Like I said, I have a love hate relationship with this game, and you’ll begin to understand me when you at least clock up 50-100 hours of the game.			"

												It used to be a fun/addicting game, but it Kabaam (the company that bought out the game) is all about stuffing money into their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fat bloody pockets.  It was so much more fun with non soulbounded items, no insanely high tier items in the store, and no stupid pets.----EDIT---- Updated Review as of 5/9/16 12:53 AMSo I decided to go ahead and play the game once again since I flew back home for my 1.5 weeklong summer vacation after college.TL;DR: The game is fun, but holy sh*t, the gold spammers got worse and there are minimal amounts of effort to update the game.  So yeah, it's fun, go ahead and play it for a bit if your internet doesnt' suck.  However, I still can't recommend this game because Kabaam continues to demonstrate a classic example of a company that buys out another company, providing a minimal amount of effort to make any improvements to the game (because, ""why make improvements when you can do nothing at all and still make money off of the 12 year olds that fall for this pay2win scheme?"").------------------------------------------------------------------The game has gone through a laughably minimal amount of updates since I had last played this game, over a year ago.  For a 2D MMO with a lot of potential for interesting, frequent updates, I thought that perhaps some unique new gamemodes, some cool improvements to the hub world, and new classes would be released.  Did I see any of those changes in the game:no, not reallyWhat I discovered in my +25 hours of playing (while on vacation):-USWest3 Server is still just as cancerous as before.  Chat comments fill up half of your screen and text from the advertising bots just spam it so hard that comments whiz by at the speed of f*cking light.  Fortunately there is the handy star requirement filter you can apply to chat (2* seems to do the trick), but it is still incredibly annoying that some bots still manage to whisper me.-Trading still sucks a-hole...  Like honestly, how has trading not been somehow improved in this game?  We have RealmEye which is great and all, but it is still such a hastle to try and arrange trades with other players, especially when you are playing and someone pms you and you go back to the nexus and forget the username of a player that pm'd you.  Every time you go to the nexus, an annoying bot will pm you, making it impossible to reply to the person who had just pm'd you since you can only reply to the last person who sent a pm to you (so the bot overrides the last pm).  Then you get to play the fun waiting game to try and find out if the person who had pm'd you will try and pm you again or not.-Chat....   Related to the first two points I made above.   Why is there no option to add a custom filter to the chat?  If players could filter out the ""WWW"" or "".COM"" sh*t, the issue with chat going bonkers would be solved.  The star requirement filter is nice and all, but I realy don't want to force the req over 2* to filter out the annoying bot that whispers ""Visit blah blah blah.com"" (I am unsure if the star req even affects private messages).  Putting any star requirement is hiding away potential people who might be selling something that I need or players who are trying to negotiate with me.  Hell, just enforce the restriction to post WWW, W W W, COM, C0M, and all other variations by default to stop these annoying bots from ruining the game.-Daily Tasks.  This is a nice addition to the game that is actually pretty cool.  You can get skins and also loot potions which last 30 minutes.  My only complaint would be how long it takes to farm for some of these low tier weapons (T7 usually) which is honestly more difficult for me to find compared to t6 and +t8 weapons.  I am yet to complete the second stage of the daily quest.-A few new dungeons.  OK, at least something was added...  Like most dungeons in the game, these new dungeons don't feel very different from any of the old ones.  Moving along then...-New weapons, armors, items.  Most of the new weapons are situational, but it's still nice to see a variety of UT's added to the game in the last year and a half.-Armor sets.  Pretty interesting idea.  Of course you can try your luck getting these by either running a sh*t ton of dungeons (which I have no problem with) or just paying a couple bucks with a lucky box thing that can make your character completely OP at the cost of your wallet and RNG (I have a problem with this).-T13.  I don't believe this was added before, but I do like the idea of T13 items since they don't appear to be sold anywhere in the cash shop.  This is sort of meaningless though, since the armor sets sold in the cash shop have the potential to include some weapons that are on par -if not better- than t13 weapons.-Ressurection Amulets are gone.  Those things were pretty OP anyways (they had a chance to let your character be ressurected after death.  Players would have characters live indefinitely).-Custom Cursors. Finally :DAnd that honestly wraps up almost all the major changes I have seen in game.  I'll still play it till the end of my vacation.  A game worth trying, but this company is reminiscent of EA.

Bullet-Hell RPG where the wrong step (or lag spike) could end your lifeRealm of the Mad God, a very simple and easy RPG to pick up and learn, but quite hard to master. Bullet-hell like twin-stick shooter games combined with a top-down RPG mechanic where you only have one life. Team up with waves of other players to take down many of the bosses that plague the realm. First you'll learn how to level up to level 20 (the max level) reliably which for a skilled player will take about 10-30 minutes, but that won't be the end of your adventure. You're going to have to learn how to max your stats which requires you to learn many of the dungeons and where to find them which could take several hours or even days. The journey will be hard and you only have one life to do it, but fear not! There are some things available to make your adventure easy. You have a vault where you can store your awesome finds in for your later characters to use. If you're lucky enough you'll find a pet which will stick with you throughout the whole game and all your future characters. Do invest in them, unless you're MLG Pro who don't need no man... uhm sidekick. Pros: Very good replayability It's not Pay2Win. All the equipment sold can be obtained in dungeons. Paying does help you progress a bit faster at least with pets. I spent $0 and I'm an orange star who can get 6/8 stats maxed. Very easy to find other players to play and do dungeons with in-game.Cons: Storage space is very limited, though that shouldn't be a problem until you get better at the game. No PvP, if you're here for that then this isn't the game for youReccomended To:People who enjoy perma-death mechanics. You masochistPeople looking for a fun co-op game to play with their friends. Even if you have 20 of them.It's even free and a small download, so why not try it?Side Notes:If you're going to get into trading, use RealmEye.com very useful way to trade. Just put up your offer and go back to enjoying the game. No I'm not being paid by RealmEye to say this.Turn star requirements on to 2 or 3 in the settings so you won't see those spam bots.Gimme my Steam Awards Nomination Committee 2016 Badge, Steam! "

												This game has lost it's charm over the years and I wish it had it's charm but it's gone downhill now so far so that I can't even register, sign in, and even ♥♥♥♥ing so far as ♥♥♥♥ing unplayable sure I can play on the browser but what about my characters I leveled up and actually wasted ♥♥♥♥ on when it was good? If it could have its old charm and actually allow me to play then mabye just maybe i'll change my mind but now its not the game that it used to be. Not many servers are populated then it used to be (without hackers and actual players that used to play). This game has aged and now it's gone. It's time to move on and find new games.			"

												--- PLEASE READ FULL REVIEW BEFORE VOTING!! ---Realm of the Mad God is a game that is completely unique in how it actually works. I have never seen a game that is similiar to this one. All the items are really cool, all the misc. items are unique, all the dungeons are insane fun. Overall, It is a well-done RPG but I have some things that I do not like in it. Even though the game is Free-to-play, it is also ""Pay-to-win"" if you know what I mean. You can still play and enjoy the game without giving any money, but if you want to play seriously and become a ""pro"" you will have to spend some money. For example, when you start off, you can have only one vault chest, which isn't enough for anything. It holds only 8 items. You need more storage than that. So you have buy more chest, each of which costs 500 gold coins, which are worth about 2.7 Euro. That is cheap, right? Considering you need at least 10-15 chests to store all of your UT's (Ultra Tiers) and all of your Stat Potions, there is no way of that being cheap. You also need more than one character. Each character slot costs 1200 gold coins. You can color your character, which of course also costs gold coins. Dispite the fact that the game is ""Pay-to-win"", I still had an absolute HUGE ammount of fun with this game with my friends. Leveling up, killing gods, completing dungeons etc. The game is insane fun even if you do not pay any money.  I also have one more thing that annoys me. Server-side lag. My internet is really fast and I have no lag on other multiplayer games. But in RotMG sometimes because of the server-side lag I die, losing my character and all my hard-earned gear. That is something Kabam has to work on.Final Rating: 7 / 10Good			"

												Imagine your favorite movie is on TV. Now imagine someone walks into your house and wipes **** all over the screen. Your favorite movie is still on TV, but now you have to watch it with **** on it, and it stinks as well. This is what happened to ROTMG. I've logged probably about 200 hours on the browser version over the course of about 5 years. I've been playing on and off for that time. After about a year without playing the game I saw that it was on steam and since it was free I downloaded it. Like I said earlier it's pretty much the same game I used to love, but it has **** wiped all over it. In the main lobby there are a dozen spam bots all screaming for you to buy high level items from them. You walk past rows of stores with items that can only be purchased with bought in game currency (with real money of course). If you want more storage you have to pay for it, it you want extra character slots you have to pay for those as well. This wouldn't be as big a deal, but $5 will only buy you 500 gold, which will not get you very far at all. Each character slot costs 1000 gold, and the vault chests cost 1000 gold as well. On the server there are quite a few hackers. To conclude this game is P2W, but you absolutely do not have to do so, everything that can be bought can also be achieved through hard work.			"

												I had to play long and hard to decide whether to give this game a positive or negative review, and I have made up my mind. having over 1k hours into the game, I think I can make a very good review based upon my experience. This game is fantastic, it's fast paced, it's fun, and if you don't mind perma death you can have a blast, but there's one thing dragging this game down and down to rock bottom and it's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community. They hold no respect for other people, they troll, they spew unfunny and overused memes, and they are generally uptight pretentious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. This game can only be fun if you have friends. I cannot, however, and will not continue playing because the community (in an mmo) is absolutely abysmal. I wouldn't recommend you to play unless you have all chat options turned off, and are playing with friends.There are also some things other people say about this game which simply aren't true. ""It's pay to win,"" is one quote I see frequently, and it makes absolutely no sense. Paying money does almost nothing to make you ""win"" the game. You can't buy stat potions, you can only buy equips which any noob will lose. It's not pay to win, and too many idiots who are unfamiliar with the term throw it around.			"

												Hellobefore I'm writing my actual review, I just wanna say that I have over 3000 hours in this game, i can't give you an exact number but that's probably the minimum.I play this game on the website and in the flash projector (standalone for less lag)I also make videos about this game so check out my channel if you are interested, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4EZa3q2gtberPdaBW1Qa3wThis game has huge potential, and a short time ago a new company took over the game, taking it from an old moneyhungry company that took away a lot of the game's potential, meaning that it can't get worse.Right now is probably your best choice to get back into the game, since they might put in some good stuff.So for now I'd definetly reccomend joining it, that could change in the future tho, depending on how this goes.but as I said, it can only stay the same as it is or get better.

												I've played this game since the beginning. You won't see that on my profile, because I played on the browser, until I recently went to check it out again. Big mistake. All this game does is ♥♥♥♥ me off anymore, and not because I die over and over, that's part of the fun. What pisses me off is seeing a game I used to love being ruined and turned pay-to-win by Kabam. Kabam has done nothing but ♥♥♥♥ this game over completely since they bought it out. It's focused on how much money you can dump in the game, rather than how good you are, and how much time and effort you put in to FINDING your gear. You used to have to hunt forever to get a good set, now you can just slap a few bucks down, and walk out of the nexus like hot ♥♥♥♥. Not to mention how they completely screwed the loot system. Not only did they add ninja, which would be a good idea, if it weren't for the fact that they added a new weapon type, instead of using one of the ones already in the game, but I swear they also lowered the drop rate on gear. For those who don't know about the game, the ninja's unique weapon means that about 75% of weapons that drop are completely useless. Before ninjas were in the game, 66% couldn't be used by your class. This is because ninja weapons drop as commonly as the other 4 types, even though the other 4 have 2-3 classes using them.As for the lower drop rate, I can only assume that's so that they can sell more gear to people.I really wish I could still like this game. I used to play all the time, and I had 3 8/8 characters, full tops/UT, including alt weapons and abilities, and tons of ♥♥♥♥ in my vault. The sad thing is that I can't in good conscience tell anyone to play this game, because it's evolved into what I can only describe as a Facebook game.Please, Kabam, I know you must have a heart. Please give control back to WildShadowStudios, they knew how to run this game better than you guys ever will. You are ruining what used to be my favorite game.			"

												Man where do I even start with this game.. I started like 12867 years ago when it came out on Kongregate and it was awesome! Wild Shadow did everything perfect with this game.  Then Kabam bought them out and turned it into more of a pay to win.  Kabam did some good, but mostly bad.  They owned Realm for a long time, but very recently a company called DECA bought it from Kabam.  DECA has been incredible in my opinion.  They have released more updates in two months than Kabam did in 5 years.  New things and skins and map changes, it's exactly whatneeded to happen.  So, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants to play it right now.  About 6 months ago I would've said not to bother.  I just hope DECA keeps with it			"

												With so many moving parts to learn and a seemingly infinite breadth of options to explore, diving into any new MMO is a major investment of time and energy. It's exhausting, really, which is why I appreciate a game like the free-to-play Realm of the Mad God. This fantasy-themed, co-operative bullet hell MMORPG is beautifully simple, yet deep enough to keep you chained to your PC for days on end. It takes only a minute or so to get right into the action, and, once you get a taste for running around with a gaggle of your fellow pixelated-warriors raising hell and slaying beasts across the online realm, it's hard to stop. Like any of the other thousands of players populating the bustling game world, you've been summoned by Oryx the Mad God to serve as dinner for his hungry minions. Of course, you've got other plans. Venturing out beyond the safety of the hub nexus, your mission is to blast beasties, collect loot, grow more powerful, and then stick it to the evil deity. Spraying magic projectiles around the screen while dodging incoming fire from blocky sumo wrestlers, dragons, goblin wizards, and stranger creatures you encounter takes on a classic, arcade-like quality. The straightforwardness is appealing – move, shoot, collect – and when you weave in exploration, obsessive loot hunting, RPG character growth and the camaraderie of smiting evil alongside other adventurers, sessions grow intensely hypnotic. Even if you never survive long enough get reach Oryx's doom lair, there's a ton of fun to be found in collaborating with other players in battle and unlocking cool new classes to play. Each of Realm of the Mad God's 13 unique character classes are accessed by reaching certain level benchmarks in other classes. Above all, this is what kept me glued to my keyboard playing for hours at a time. You start as a mewling wizard who can fire blasts of magic in any direction, but as you play longer and level-up, you eventually open-up more interesting classes like the necromancer, huntress, mystic, and assassin. Every class has its own set of weapons and items, magic powers, special abilities, and perks. They all play differently, and I got a thrill every time I unlocked a new one to try out. This adds tremendous replay potential too, since unlocking the coolest characters requires you to spend some serious time with each class. Perma-death layers-on an intense roguelike element to the already zany large-scale bullet hell RPG slugfest unfolding on any given server, and it seriously ups the challenge and risk factor. Getting careless will get you killed and force you to re-start your current character over from level 1. As frustrating as it can be, death is sometimes a welcome opportunity to try out another class, since you can only have one character at a time without using microtransactions to purchase additional slots. But when you're committed to keeping your favorite character alive, the threat of losing all your hard-earned experience and loot gently nudges you into working together with other players and forming impromptu gang of warriors to tackle the tougher swarms of foes as a group. Realm of the Mad God's streamlined approach to MMO gaming also changes up player interaction in good ways. Since there's no PvP, everyone in the realm is after the same goals – slay, loot, and level-up. As you come across other players, the desire to tag along and pitch in for tougher fights comes intuitively. You share the experienced gained from defeating foes as long as you hit them once, and there's generally plenty of loot to go around. Typing in chat text makes a speech bubble appear over your hero, and communicating in short bursts is effective for concocting plans outside of the heat of battle. When you do find other comrades you want to stick with, you can highlight nearby players and lock their names to your menu bar, allowing you to teleport to their location instantly if you get separated. It's a simple and easy-to-use system that works well. The realm itself is surprisingly vast, with a diverse landscape that holds more dangerous and inventive foes the further you venture away from your spawn point. Weaker baddies, like scorpions and pirates, populate the sunny beachside. But push through the thick forests, crumbling ruins, and mountains beyond, and you'll find powerful god-like foes capable of slaying low-level adventurers with a single strike. It's these formidable opponents you have to defeat in order to reach Oryx. Thankfully, when you need a break from battle or a quick getaway, tapping the insert key warps you back to the safety of the nexus where you can trade, use fame points or in-game cash to purchase special items, form a guild, and heal-up. It may be vastly different from its big-league brethren, but this stylish indie MMO has loads of staying power to match its unique concept. Realm of the Mad God&#Array;s accessible arcade-style bullet hell action blends with RPG nerdiness in some truly potent ways, and the lovely pixilated world holds an abundance of adventure that&#Array;s ripe for the taking. Easy to jump into and damn near impossible to quit, this unusual free-to-play MMO hybrid is worth every second of your spare time.			"

												Don't waste your time, any fun this game had months prior to coming on steam was very methodically removed by the devs. The very over inflated cash shop prices help drive the point home that this will never become anything awesome either, just a vessel for cash scam.The original concept of the game was a simplistic fun game that allowed large groups of people to collaborate into an army to eventually topple the mad god. People would band together in very large groups to help level each other and take down bosses. A fun concept but due to the simplistic nature of the game, hardly something you want to dole out money for, especially considering the game is built largely from graphics that are open source. Cash shop perks however created the rise of the ""cashing loner"" who could do alone what 50 or so players could accomplish. That also created these loners to corner anyone getting good equipment, creating a large rift in the player base, this essentially leads to 3 options in the game: 1) hack your way to the gear. 2) be forced to cash. 3) spend ages fighting for any progression.Now these 3 routes are actually pretty typical of a free to play. Except Mad god has one more aspect that makes the taste even more sour, permadeath. Again with original concept of the game, permadeath wasn't so bad. The game was very pick up and play again, you didn't mind starting over because you never really had a lot of content to chew through so you never got too invested into any one character and there was other classes to try the game over from a new perspective. Now there is a lot more content to the game so dying for a free player even if they do as much planning as humanly possible, is a major setback, cash players can buy additional storage and even have soul bound items so they aren't exactly starting over every single time, adding to the gap between the players.In all this game was a fun concept that was bled dry for every cent they could get and it shows plain as day.

												This game has a long history with me. From Shadow to Kabam to Deca. I've seen it all. Played it in the browser and on steam. I can teel ya. It is a great game. Pay2Win? Ha! BS. Sure, You can pay for cosmetics and some useful tools. But I havent spent a single dime on this game and I have collected most items in the game. But I do warn you. Don't start playing this if you don't have a disciplined mind. This game will steal all of your time. And most people don't have the strength to pull away. Help me... Help me now...			"

												It's a top-down Bullet Hell MMO, What do you expect?The same damn song loops over and over and over again and never stops.If you die, it's permadeath, all of your loot and levels are gone unless you stored them.You can teleport to other players which 9 times out of 10 leads to your instant demise.And there's pointless microtransactions, you can buy new skins for your character, but like everything else you lose them if you die, making them completely worthless.If they fixed any of this since the last time i played, good for them, but i'm never going to play again.As a side note, no matter what class you pick and what weapon they use, they always shoot. Got a sword? it shoots bullets. Dagger? bullets. Book? bullets.			"

												This game, being one of the available free to play games on the market, looks nice on the outside as it looks like an 8bit MMORPG, but as it turns out, it's much worse than that.You start with 40 Gold, which basically means you can't do or buy anything useful. There are a lot of fancy upgrades available to the player but you need to pay for them in U$D.It's an open world adventure game like Everquest where you explore places and complete quests, but no one tells you what to do or the goal of the game.You have one of 20 choices of characters to choose from, which is only available without paying. My guess is that its main goal is to survive as long as you can. but the enemies' AI system is just horrible. In the tutorial part you are then asked to defeat enemies with godlike aimbot skills. If you die, you start all over again, with a new character.The music in this game is the very same music you hear from the beginning, and it just goes on and on like a loopbox.The chat box is full of spam messages telling you to buy Gold in order to get fance deals.My suggestions: This game needs more detailed instructions as to how the game should be played.My rating: 2/10			"

												Honestly on the outside this game just seemed like another regular 2D pixel game, but my friends insisted that I try it out. I gave it a whirl and I am glad I did. Let me advise you first this game is no short term game, If you are going to play it get yourself fully immersed in it. It has more enemies than you can count, many dungeons that you can explore, way too many items to count, and a friendly community. At first you will try your best get the best gear you can and get to lvl 20 and you will think ""this game Isn't long term I have already finished it,"" your wrong. There are things called stat potions that increase your stats by 1 - 5 depending on the stat potion. This is when you can max your character's stats although, it can be hard to get there without a pet, you will eventually get one that will help you along the way. Now that I am done just rambling on and on about how great it is, GO PLAY IT (never buy items with real money how ever tempting it might seem, it ruins the experience and the game becomes boring). Also, if you need more help I will be on the server USwest2, and I will willing to give you advice. HAVE A GOOD DAY :D !!!!			"

												To sum this game (me in a skype call); Guys i think i'm actually doing well. I'm finally able to solo this abyss and get some decent loot without putting money into it! *server lags, gets stuck into wall and gets gang banged by 6 demons, then dies and loses absolutely everything*To be more detailed, this game is fun if you survive the constant server lag and other stupid bugs. Other wise your ♥♥♥♥♥ against a wall by demons. Also, the community is almost ♥♥♥♥. It's full of children (yes this is basically a childs game) who cry to their mommy to put money into it otherwise they'll cut themselves for having a unfair life. I have picked a few out of it who are nice people and want to dungeon, but the game itself makes it impossible to give a good dungeon experience, unless you somehow  manage to what the community calls ""8/8"" which is basically playing non-stop until you finally achieve being a god yourself. But halfway through this you'll probably die from a wall. Even then, you've gone through the hell of having to rely off yourself since this games mostly Solo until your the best of the best (without dying by a wall halfway to 8/8)  you basically will be put in a guild with either children or adults who have also gone through the hell of ROTMG. So this game is addicting and a waste of time unless your like me and have nothing better to do but die by a damn wall. Also, if you have something for stronghold kingdoms, strongholds and this game share the ""Dying is apart of the game"" concept. So if your reading this and are getting ready to install, you'll regret it.-----------------------------------------------EDITED---------------------------------------------------------------------------So realm is the same after playing again for 3 more weeks, but i finally got a 6/8. What i found more disturbing is the community. Either kids who still say noob just to go jerk for the first time, or grown men who spend money on the game because why not. The real challenge realm has, is trying to ignore the community even though alot of the game is in the trade system, which btw is always changing and full of scammers.I think I'm officially done, leaving my character as a cruddy priest who actually has some decent gear, but even then, a garry's mod rp server has a better community than this game.

												A very addictive, hella fun ""bullet hell MMO"" game.  I started almost 4 years ago with this game and I just can't give it up! No matter how frustrating it can get with the ""perma death"" aspect where you lose everything you worked hard for, there'll alway be friends to chill with you/help ya out and when you get good you'll learn to stock up on potions and items that can make ""remaxing"" not such a pain.  The community is generally really nice but it's also full of those not so likeable people which is the case with any game.  Well the second owners of it, Kabam, finally sold it to DECA Games after having a good run with it themselves but eventually losing interest in it and not updating or fixing issues much.  I must say that so far DECA has done a great job with keeping things lively and updated for the players.  Can't wait to see what they'll do to improve the game and I hope they get around to fixing the many connection issues that sometimes plague this game. Highly recommended! Give it a try, you'll probably end up liking it. :)Take care all and hope to cya in-game,Lex			"

												For people thinking about trying this game: If you like RPG's where you can loot up, play with friends and get amazing items as well as drink potions till you max that class and play many classes and rank up on your journeys this is the game for you, but TAKE CAUTION for if you die, you will lose all the items on that character, you can also put items in your vault to keep for future characters. Upgrade pets and teach them to heal you and give you mana, or attack enemies. This is all around one of my most favorite games and I have played over 1,300 hours in under 2 years.			"

												Overview:Pay-to-win, not fun w/out paying, **** the company who made it this way, could be good otherwiseTo store stuff permanetly you have to use real money. Better gear? Real money. Customization? Real money. You can't farm or grind because the one chest you get to store stuff in is only 6 slots or so. There is no way to get in-game currency without paying, so without using alt accounts as chests, there is no way you can actually have fun with this game, especially if you don't want to bother signing in your alt everytime you need a different weapon. If you want to spend money on this game, then it might be more agreeable to you, to everyone else who at least wants SOME chance at getting better than slightly worse than horrible, don't play this game.

												Before you question my sanity: Yes, I have played this for almost 200 hours, as of writing this review. And I do not reccomend it. Why?Well...Realm of the Mad God is obviously a very addicting and fun game, but not for the faint of heart. Basically everything you do in this game is pointless, as eventually you'll die. It's like all the game is about is preparing for other versions of yourself. Which also will be preparing for OTHER versions of yourself.I never really feel like I make progress in the game. And in fact, I don't. Nobody does. Sure, there are new classes to unlock and get better at but it never comes to a conclusion. The only permanent items you can get are basically skins, and because of this the MMO feeling of ""Hell yeah I got a rare item and it's mine forever!"" getting destroyed, the game becomes boring as hell.Combining an MMO with a roguelike, and adding Bullet Hell to that DOES make this game hell of adrenaline rush, but eventually you start to see all the flaws of the concept. They don't fit together at all.Because of all of this, I simply can not reccomend this game. You'll think it's fun at first, but eventually it gets repetitive and boring. Despite all of this, I am probably gonna continue to play anyway. Because it's SO FRICKIN ADDICTIVE.(EDIT: Also, I should mention this game is pay to win. INCREDIBLY pay to win. Simple things, such as creating another character slot or buying storage space even costs real money. Not to mention, the ""Gold"" Currency, which is what you buy with money, can ONLY be achieved by purcashing it. Yep.)TL;DR: Nothing is permanent, you can't make progressOverall Grade(s):At a point when you feel like the game is fun: 8/10At a point when you feel like the game is boring as heck: 1/10			"

												Review from a White star if it matters to anyone :P-Quit for a couple months now-So okay I have 1000+ hours on it on steam alone and afterwards, went to adobe flash projector for a couple hundred hours, so hopefully this review will help many of you decide whether or not you will like this game.This game is permadeath, when you die you lose all your items, equipped/anything in inventory aswell. Game is very hard to pick up, consider looking up guides on YouTube or steam workshop for reference.Pros:Gameplay is extremely addictive! Dying isnt so bad and you ""usually"" learn from your mistakes! (atleast I do)If losing all your ""Precious"" items will be too much for your heart to bear, this is not the game for you. (Permadeath)All of the classes are worth playing, maybe except for a few. As for the community, its up and down. Mostly filled with children. Rare to see anyone over the age 18, so you can imagine what the chat is like. Not saying the community is bad, people will sometimes help you out, and you can make friends via guild system. But most guilds will only invite you if you are actually good at the game, which is cruel, but w.e.Getting loot is so satisfying, especially those yummy white bags.Cons:Event notifierAmount of bots (inevitable in a f2p game, but bearable with the new feature that can auto- hide the chat from low ranked players)I always have a my chat filtered so I only see ranked 10stars or above basically since I hate seeing my chat flooded from either children talking/spamming, or trolls.I don't know if this is still out there but there was this thing that was out that would notify you via realm if there is a special quest of your interest that spawned in. This-was-the-breaking point for me... The times where I would be chilling in my home realm and see (Sphinx/Hermit) I'd be so hyped, nowadays when the event spews out ""A sphinx entered the realm"" atleast 60 people from from other servers drop in to get the chance to get some awesome loot.So onto the hate for the company Kabam...They started up pets which helped alot of new players, but made veteren players very upset. It was a new system that tries to get you to spend your real money on ""feed"" to feed your pets to make them heal you more or make other abilities better. If you have the bank account, you can make this game so easy, that the only way you die is by being extremely dumb, or getting armor broken, or doing very very hard dungeons. Now I do understand the company has to make money to keep the game running so im not upset about what Kabam is doing. There are packs they release that are understandable and pretty tempting to purchase but of course you dont have to. Now If you understand how the game works this game can be played without using your precious money but the most tempting deals would be chests/character slots. Everything else can be avoided, unless you are really bad and need to get the best items to be able to play the game. (I exploit this and load up on pots to buy top items from kids who use parents credit cards to buy items)IN MY HONEST OPINION, Kabam is not a bad company...they need to make money somehow right? If they weren't releasing these items/keys/deals how would this game still be alive?Overall this game is for me was great when it didn't have the event notifiers, but since they are out, the game has been getting worse and worse. There are probably many more cons than the ones I listed but those are the two main ones that upset me.Rate: 5/10Anyone with questions can ask here, im open to all feedback good/bad.			"

												This game WAS good. Then the Kabam nation attacked. They made it severely Pay To Win. When Wild Shadow owned it and oversaw the game, it was great, there was almost no pay to win elements in the game. Now, it is almost like an IOS game that is freemium. Sure, skill is still involved, but you HAVE TO PAY $$$$ to be good. It is literally impossible to be good at this game unless you spend some money. You cannot be nearly decent at this game until you have a few character slots(you start off with one!!!!), a few vault chests(again, you start off with on!!!!), a good pet, and EXPENSIVE items that upgrade that pet. As someone who has let their wallet vomit a bit too much( >100$ spent in game), please for the love of not supporting this disgusting Pay To Win Freemium game model, don't get this game. And if you have it, dont spend $$. If you do, you are telling developers and cash grabbing companies that these kinds of games are okay to create and release to the good folk of the gaming community.			"

												I told myself that I would never not reccomend a f2p game, unless given serious reason. I've been given serious reason. This game, as it is right now, is playable and there are quite a few fun aspects of it. However, since Kabam bought RotMG, they bought crappy servers so we would die to lag, causing us to do the following:They made the game HEAVILY based on p2w, as you can buy bonus packages containing a ton of crap, the ability to buy ALL OF THE TOPS(for ridiculous amounts of money, and people do it), and then there are also the people illegally selling earned items and accounts within the game. Plus, someone came up with the brilliant idea of an event notifier so there are a ton of people around EVERY boss like the Hermit or Sphinx. They focused on adding more content instead of polishing the content that they have already put out. They added pets into the game, and if you fully level them at legendary(heal and magic heal), you become almsot invincible. Hackers are everywhere, and i havn't seen Kabam do ANYTHING to fix this problem. This game went from a real gem, to THIS. I still play it because, again, there are definitely fun aspects to the game itself. But, if I had 3 wishes to spend on games, I would use one to give Wildshadow back RotMG.			"

												I'm going to get a lot of hate for this. I'll just say that at first. but hear me out.The game is impossibly dificult to unlock other classes, and unless you buy money good gear is hard to get. You'll get torn to shreads with no hope of unlocking the next class. I'll say that if this game had a better way for better gear I would gladly play it more, but I'm not going to suport it unless it changes in some way.			"

												Okay, before I start this review I have but two things to say:-I have very little hours on this account, as this is my alt account, that was made for Csgo.-This review goes a lot off of my personal experiences with this game.Ahh, RotMG... This game kinda brings me a sense of nostalgia... This nostalgia brings on a lot of mixed feelings; I've had some of my best laughs, met new mates and plain and simple, had something to come back to when I was bored.However, I also have bad experiences with this game such as the permanent death feature - don't get me wrong this doesn't make the game it's self bad, it's just not for me personally - which has made some of the angriest and most regretful moments of my gaming life.There's also the pay to win path that I followed for a short while before realising, ""WAIT! I'm ♥♥♥♥ and keep dying, why am I spending money on crap I'm gonna lose in 2 days?"". To be fair I DID know that you could get all these items playing legit, but my low level newbie self didn't know how damned easy it was! Like seriously, $12 or something to get a dagger that one, I'm never going to use and two, would take about 1/2 hour of farming to obtain. So yeah, if you are going to play this game, avoid all the equipment shops in the nexus at all costs ;c;Heres one that I've never really seen anyone but myself complain about; the classes are extremely unbalanced. People only ever play knight, warrior, wizard and possibly a dbow archer, with higher level players - unlike myself - having maxed every class, and still choosing to play these characters. Why? WELL, let me explain...Now, I'm pretty sure the original devs of RotMG, Wild Shadow Studios, never intended the game to be like WoW with full on raids and ♥♥♥♥. However, I'm pretty sure they wanted a teamwork element. These teamwork elements do not exist for multiple reasons:-The two classes that have the highest defence in the game, also have some of the highest dps... WTF?!-Kabam added pets which attack enemies, but most importantly; heal, rendering the weaker defence healing classes USELESS!-Private loot. In other words, the classes with the highest dps - which again apart from wizard, have the HIGHEST defence in the game!? - are the only ones to get drops.-Some of the classes are utterly usless to the player, let alone a whole team.It's because of these reasons that people only play high dps classes which are practically invincible, destroying the whole concept of teamwork.Finally, there's the player base. I remember when I was a newb I had a 3/8 come up to me and give me some hydra skin armor. I didn't know what it was worth at the time and i was playing knight, so I couldn't wear it anyway, and my friend offered me a crossbow - a ♥♥♥♥♥ item - for this hydra skin - a legendary item to a newb - and being the newbie I was I accepted - the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ XD. Despite looking back fondly on stories like these, people who create stories and friendships in this game no longer exist. Ever since a RotMG YouTuber by the name of Kalle quit the game - the first real major game figure to leave - the whole veteran community left. By that time I was a mid level player, stranded in a waste land of guildless people keeping to themselves and not talking to anyone. As a result, me and my mates slowley started to quit the game.In other words - the friendly community is practically dead ;c;Overall, I did enjoy and make memories on this game, but that was back in the golden days of early 2013. It's the 3/1/2016 as I am writing this - happy late new year everyone! - and I jumped into the game a few weeks ago to see if any of my guildies still played. To my (sarcastic) surprise, the guild was disbanded. I was left a PM on the RotMG forum:""G'day Eoghann how've you been? How's school been or whatever?You know what, I'll cut to it. We've disbanded as a guild due to the sheer lack of enjoyable community. Most of us are moving onto WoW and we were wonding if you'd like to join us? If so, contact me here: *nopenopenopenopenopenope*~Regards, *nopenopenope*""3.5/10			"

This review is created for  My Curation Page.  Skip to the bottom for my Final ThoughtsRealm of the Mad God has always been one of my favorite games to play. I have to admit, I have spent money into the game. No, I didn't regret my purchase for a single second.I've played the game long before it was on Steam, before the Avatar of the Forgotten King and many, many updates before that (too many to remember).Realm of the Mad God is the type of game where you try to quit, but can't. As some people say, you can never quit Realm, it only quits you.GameplayRealm of the Mad God is a free-to-play, MMORPG, bullet hell, rogue-like (the first of it's kind!).Getting into the game is kind of tricky. It's a ""The hell is this?! The hell is that?!"" type of game to get into. But as you progress through the game, you learn your way around the game. Yes, you will die lots and lots of times on your way to the almighty level 20, and many will quit before ever reaching there. But getting to level 20 at last feels like you were destined to get there.Final ThoughtsIn conclusion, Realm of the Mad God is a game you must play, whether you buy Realm Gold or not, Realm of the Mad God is a great game overall. Pros of Realm of the Mad God:Play your wayMassively MultiplayerNew experience every playthroughGuildsPermadeathFreeRare itemsCons of Realm of the Mad God:HackersEvent NotifiersToxic CommunityLack of loreLack of real questingPay to win9.1/10IGN for those interested: PvtPuncakeEnjoy the review?

Practically everything half-decent in this game makes you do one of two things: Get stupidly good with your default class and get tons of gold, or pay stupid amounts of money.

Then i realized the full depth of the games with the godlands then the dungeons then the tier 4 dungeons and i fell in love with this game. ever since i could not get enough of this gameI would recommend this game for people who enjoy the little things in life and don't mind dieing a bit to get there			"

												I know it may seem like I have no hours, but in reality, I have at least spent 1000 hours on this game in browser. This was one of the best games at the time with variety, but now everything is corrupt. It used to be, play for a while to get good with somewhat good stuff, but now, rich noobs can just buy the highest tier weapon and armor, or even just go on a website that constantly spams to get a maxed out character. With no experience what so ever, they can ravage the community easily and destroy pretty much anything easily. After the update, I wont recommend at all.			"

												I know it may seem like I have no hours, but in reality, I have at least spent 1000 hours on this game in browser. This was one of the best games at the time with variety, but now everything is corrupt. It used to be, play for a while to get good with somewhat good stuff, but now, rich noobs can just buy the highest tier weapon and armor, or even just go on a website that constantly spams to get a maxed out character. With no experience what so ever, they can ravage the community easily and destroy pretty much anything easily. After the update, I wont recommend at all.			"

												I have spent over 300 hours on the flash version until I noticed there is a steam version. I love the game, everything about it! I strongly recommend this game if you like a challenge. There is some things that do make me annoyed, first of all a single vault chest costs 500 gold which is equvilent to 6.7 Dollars, Why would someone pay $6.7 for a single vault chest? thats ridiculous. Also the Alchemist is never there, please put him back! Overall I really enjoy this game and i am happy to spend hours and hours on it! Hope this helps.			"

												Years and years ago this was a pretty darned cool thing: a fantasy MMO that had no P2W qualities whatsover. Then Kabam got to it, and the rest is history. I am aware of the funny mental image of the fat 30-year-old in his mother's basement saying ""rooened foreber oh noe."" Well, boo sucks to you coz I'm 16.			"

												I enjoyed this game for the very short time I was able to play it.I'm giving a bad review because of a game-breaking bug leaving myself, and many other players stuck out of the game, completely unable to play.The developers are aware of the bug at this point, and after having many conversations with support about the issue, it seems that they simply don't care.The bug in question, is getting stuck on the black screen with the grey 'Loading' ribbon across the bottom. Even if left for hours, the game will never actually load. I initially contacted support about this back in February, and I've had to make multiple tickets due to previous ones automatically closing.To this day, the issue is still unresolved for me. I'll update this review if that changes, but I'll probably leave it as a negative because of what a joke the support team is.Get your ♥♥♥♥ together, Kabam, you're only harming yourself through losing potential customers.

Another reason is because the game looks like its really easy to play . . . but its not its very challenging which makes it very fun.I have been playing this game for about 4 and a half year and i have really enjoyed playing, throughout the years it has had its ups and downs however now i believe it has reaced the top. Now i believe that it is surpassing the zenith of its current stature thanks to all of the new developers at DECA game.Further more i really reccomend this game it is really fun and suprising it will make you furious at time and happy or shocked. i think that you should try the game its definately woth the time ;)P.S thank you so much to the new develops keep up the excellent workP.P.S the main account i use, he in game name in NeonRyse "

												I know people are going to call me some dumb noob complaining about the game because I'm bad at it or something.. but that's fine. They're the type of people who like this game and that's cool. This game is for a different kind of person. I personally didn't like this game because I felt the amount of time it demands is not worth the fun or sense of achievement it offers. You can play on a character for a full year without dying and the end result is still the same. The most you could hope for is getting on the leaderboards. That's the #1 end result to hope for. The rest of it is looking for loot and obsessively maxing your stats. I just don't think that's worth hundreds of hours. Not only that but the game is pretty P2W and that's kinda lame. The one positive is that this game is quite unique and its simplistic design makes it easy to pick up. Overall I give this one a 4/10. Though I'm sure others would tell you this is one of the best games ever made. These are the same people who will consider me a ragenoob.			"

												so after Kabam was done with their ♥♥♥♥ and finally left, i decided to try this game out again and rewrite my review.well first of all, the Community has changed. A LOT. when i first played this game, it was full of exploiting trolls who loved seeing people die with their 1000 fame or more characters.now theyre just ♥♥♥♥ing gone. i dont know what happened, but for once i can finally play without a troll following me with a thousand mobs behind him.random people may teleport to you when youre low-level and offer you trades, accept them. its free ♥♥♥♥ most of the time xDGuilds became much more organized, even though theres still people spamming invites in the godlands.to be completely honest, this is one of the best communities i have ever seen.if you need help all you gotta do is ask.next up, FINALLY a Friends tab was added. since people in-game have different nicknames from their Steam accounts, it wasnt too easy to find eachother on Steam if you want to play with someone again. ive met a few great people through RotMG.the new dev team is trying to make this game as less pay2win as possible, even though you can still buy OP items by donating, you can get sliiiightly weaker items just by playing normally. with the only pay2win thing being Character Slots (you only start with one) and Vault Chests (you only start with one as well, letting you keep only 6 items in the Vault.)in other words, buying gear with real money is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing useless since you have to unlock Vault Chests and Character Slots.wait wut? you dont even know this game at all?okay, let me explain.its a Perma-Death game. you lose EVERYTHING when you die. except pets, skins, unlocked Classes and gear you store in the Vault.the Gear in this game is divided by Tiers, you start from lvl 1 by killing weak mobs, getting T1/T2 stuff, then moving on further into the island where theres harded mobs that drop T3/T4 stuff, etc.theres an Ultimate Tier, which doesnt always mean that its better than the normal tiers (max normal Tier is 12). Ultimate Tier gear has special abilities with it, such as shooting Presents instead of Magic Bolts, or a ring that upgrades 2 different stats instead of 1.there is a TON of different classes, each player to their own. there are close/medium/long ranged classes. each with their own abilities, my favourite being the Rogue and Sorcerer.previously id give this game a 4/10, but now i give it an 8.5/10 for the huge improvements.look, i know the game's graphics and animations look simplistic as ♥♥♥♥, but trust me, thats one of the reasons that make it great.

												This has got to be one of my favorite free to play MMOs of all time. It has great coop gameplay which relies on skill to stay alive, and staying alive is very important because it is a PERMADEATH game. It runs in Flash, so its compatible with almost all systems. The graphics are a retro pixelated masterpiece and will definitely bring on the nostalgia. The game has no ending, making it very addictive. This game is still being updated regularly and new content is being added all the time. There are 14 classes to unlock, loads of items to be found, dungeons for all skill levels, and a guild system to help encourage cooperation.This game is also full of bugs that are difficult to fix, given the nature of the coding. The bugs aren't game-breaking but can get annoying at times. There is an unsolvable issue with memory leaks that will force you to restart the game every hour or so. Spambots advertise for websites that sell items illegally. Do not buy anything from them. The items they sell can be farmed in the game without spending any money. There is a trading system which you can use to buy, sell, trade, or gift items with other players. Do not spend money on items, it is a waste!Some people, including myself, experience a bit of lag when playing the Steam version of this game. If you have issues such as input delay, I encourage you to give it another shot by playing it at its home, www.realmofthemadgod.com.With all that in mind, I still thoroughly enjoy this game and support its development by buying extra vault space and character slots. I would recommend it to anyone who likes skill based shooters and MMORPGs. Did I mention its FREE?!Update: Since I quit playing RotMG regularly, a lot has changed. The old management is out and new people have taken their place and seem to be doing much better. They seem to make much better use of their resources and have their priorities in a much better order. The game and owners/developers are making much needed progress and deserve a little recognition.			"

												It's a fun game , it's permadeath , but you have a vault where you can put stuff for your characters if you die. Only one chest if you're F2P like me. The game itself is hard and requires some getting used to. Dying is normal in the game, every character dies eventually, even if you have the best armors and weapons and you're maxed and have a legendary pet.So buckle up for this 2d bullet-hell farmfest , where you farm for gear and potions, which you will lose eventually.

												Meh. They really need to have ""meh"" as an option. After playing this game for 6 hours I still have no strong feelings or opinions one way or the other.On the bright side this game is fast and frantic, you're not held down by all the tedious things that most games will bog you down with. There's pvp, co-op, all that stuff as well.The down side? 200% pay2win. Most games will have two forms of curreny: An in-game system and a ""special"" currency you have to buy with real-world money. There's absolutely no way of earning any money in this game, none, no monsters will ever drop so much as a single coin for you. Buy, buy, buy. That is the ONLY way of making any money in this game.Oh and just to make things more ""fun"" (for the game devs) it's perma-death pay2win. Let's say you spent $500 on your character and then die? Sucks to be you, everything is gone, buy it all over again. Whatever fun I may have by playing this is balanced out by my unwillingness to invest any real money into this game. The end result is me being perfectly neutral towards this game. I can easily just give this game a thumbs down right now, but I'm feeling generous.By the way this game has nothing to do with Legends Of Yore or Hack Slash Loot, I made that mistake too. The graphics are just public domain or something. (Probably a game making engine.)			"

												I started playing this game in 2010 (not on Steam, I guess I have less than 300 hours played). It has changed a lot since that time - sound effects have changed, content was added, already existing items and enemies were balanced and, last but not least, the game was sold to another studio. Twice. The time when RotMG belonged to first one, Wildshadow Studios, was probably the best time of the game. Game was simple and fun to play, Pay to Win almost didn't exist. In 2012 RotMG was sold to Kabam. They made it a bit Pay to Win, they also did nothing aganist hackers. Later, they decided to work on their other games instead of RotMG, but in July 2016 Deca Games bought RotMG - they keep adding new content and events and they finnaly started fighting aganist notifier hackers. Now it's really a good time for the game.RotMG is a bullet-hell, team MMORPG with A LOT of different items, monsters and dungeons. All 14 classes are available for free (you only need a bit of time to get 'em all) and are almost perfectly balanced. You can play support/dps/tank (often mixed in one character), whatever you want. There's also a possibility of joining a guild consisting of other players. Overall, the game is indrecibly fun to play despite being a bit Pay to Win - there's a perma-death, character loses all of his items upon dying. MMO Dark Souls for free.You can have a lot of fun playing RotMG, especially with a group friends, or a guild and you don't have to spend a lot of time on it.8/10 would lose everything again			"

												Realm of the Mad God is both one of the best games I've ever played and one of the worst. I first started playing the game in April of 2012 with a couple of friends. Initially, I wasn't hooked—pixel graphics, permadeath, MMO, bullethell...none of them exactly appealed to me. I drove the game from my mind completely. But a few days later, in a bout of extreme boredom, I decided to hop into the game. Gave myself a name—Nathansbud—and hopped into the fray. And by God, it was FUN! Sure, I was horrible, but that didn't stop me from having a great time running around the lowlands. After that point, I was hooked through and through. I played the game for nearly a year without really getting ""good"" in the least, until I finally maxed my first character (which can be accomplished by drinking enough stat pots to hit the max, items which drop from a variety of enemies and dungeons), an Archer. I had this character for months, and it ended up being my first character to hit 5 Stars, or 2000 fame (experience, essentially). Fast forward to now, 4.5 years into playing Realm of the Mad God (with a year break in between). The game has had its ups and downs, good times and bad, some overtly P2W features were implemented at times, but all in all, the game is certainly worth picking up and playing. And if you do end up giving it a shot (which you should, as the game is free), shoot me a PM. I'm Nathansbud in game.Overall: 9/10			"

												This game has been my favourite game for the past 5 years and still to this day has been able to keep me intertained and in love with this game. Even after losing the best charecteur you've had yet, this game can and will bring you back to it. There is never a dull moment and always has room to improve. This is a massive game that has survived for many of years and it will be obvious to see why that is. Whether you just died on your by far best charecter or have just started playing for the first time, this game will always give you the need to come back and play. This is an amazing game that I would easily recommend to all types of gamers.			"

It has different stategies and approaches such as tanking, evasion, supporting etc. There are many different classes to choose from and you can unlock more as you master the others!A great free and addictive game, and only a few MBs, worth a download!9/10			"

												Kabam rigged this like a demolitions expert.Let me elaborate. This was a nice local resturant, with a speciality meal hardly seen before.It was a mix of rogue-like and bullet hell. There were bullets everywhere and if you couldn't handle the heat, it was back to the start. But starting over isn't all bad. You got fame, a currency that could be used on goods to get yourself running hotter. You could also unlock new classes for a spin on the taste. It was a nice resturant, filled with a jovial atmosphere.But then the owner handed it over to a rather greedy man.Now it is a pit of money and shame, filled with people looking to scam and the food reminicent of a fast food resturant.Nobody was happy, but the owners.

												Of course I recommend this game, no really, join us in the game where you die, over and over. And over. And over.And over ∞Yeah.But really, for a game where you lose your character and their items on death, it's somehow a great game, and you keep playing, suffering, farming, and dying on the inside every time your pixelated character gets sent to their grave.So yeah, all that and stuff. But here's the thing I wanted to say:Realm of the Mad God went through a time when it was new and great, owned by... Wildshadow? Correct me if I'm wrong... but anyway, after that it went through stages and then wh-KABAM. (The game was bought by Kabam, literally) And so then the game went through a time when it was still 'okay' but a great deal of players were not liking the money-grabbing Kabam people, and the changes they were making, so the reviews went a bit sour.But this year (2016) it was handed over/bought (However you want to put it) to DECA GAMES, which plans on 'making RotMG great again!' and I think they just might. [Almost] Anything's better than Kabam!So yes, there are nasty reviews still left over from the Kabam age, and changes yet to be made in-game.There has never been a better time to join than now! And I know, because I started playing during the Kabam age on Kongregate. It's only getting better!#MakeThisGameGreatAgain @DECA GAMES			"

												RotMG is an MMORPG where the player is thrown into a wide world where everyone just wants to hurt you. Why? No idea. I was too lazy to read the lore that we have posted on our lovely site of RealmEye. However, the overall game is a great concept, where you slowly get better, pick up items, drink potions to increase your stats, and then.. well.. die. If permadeath games trigger your anger senses this game isn't for you. But, if you love grinding (stats that is) and watching yourself get better slowly over time, then this game is a great choice.With a new company in place, we are going to be seeing a new era as the game changes to their views. It's a great time to start playing as Month of the Mad God, a celebration of the game's release, is in place.			"

												I can make a new review for this game, considering the new owner/host of the game: Deca Games. They took charge and started working on the game again. Here's what they've done so far: 1. Spam bots are completely gone, and some of the multi-boxers and hackers are gone.2. Brought back life into the game by bringing the community together for a big celebration of Month of the Mad God.3. Gave out free rewards to those active in the community. With Events and such.Pros: 1. Very rewarding, Challenging dungeons give the better loot.2. Good community on reddit and mostly in-game too.3. A Star ranking system based off how many class challenges you've completed by hard earned, long lived characters.4. DEATHLY addictive. (sorry)Cons:1. P2W, buying (gold) will allow you to get some of the best gear.2. Difficult, hard to get used to dieing. (Even thought its part of the game)3. Until recently, the game had a bad owner, Game is recovering.I recommend this game, 7.9/10 :^)			"

												Realm of the Mad God (RotMG) is an incredibly addicting game which features perma-death. Whilst many dislike losing everything upon death, it's also a very rewarding game. When you start up it is quite difficult, but the more you play, the better you get. You eventually learn tactics and figure out the best course of action for you and your character. It's important to focus both long-term and short-term, as anything could happen at any given time. Being reckless is one of the main reasons why people lose characters, so it's important to always stay calm. Don't let your greed for loot get in the way of your character's safety. I personally enjoy RotMG because it allows me to do whatever I want. If I want to feed and upgrade my pet, I do that. If I want to max a knight or a mystic, I do that. If I want to do dungeons, I do that.			"

												be dyin' erey day yo, still ain't mad. But yeah, this is a REALLY, REALLY addicting game. It's gonna be very hard NOT to spend money on it, but it's worth it if you like the game enough.(edit: a year after i wrote this)i still die every day, my characters literally do not last for more than 5 days. my mind practically revolves around this game and i've spent around $300 on it. i've invested around 700+ hours on this piece of rainbow ♥♥♥♥ and my deaths actually do frustrate me now because i'm actually maxed. but anyway, this game is better when playing with friends, or if you have a guild. when it's late and you're the only one up, you can just relax and farm in the godlands. even if you're rich as hell, npe's with friends will help ease the boredom.this game also has its own economy, not like cs:go, tf2, or dota where you could trade via steam and steam chat, but in the game itself, and the company that owns the game will help you with all your problems but they do not care about trading itself, only bug fixes and blah blah. trading in this game isn't as profitable as godlands farming though, due to the amount of time it takes although you could always go on realmeye which is similar to tf2outpost or cs:go lounge to post trades and wait for someone to PM you while youre actually playing the game.the main goal in this game is probably to max. 6/8 is a start to new players. for players who already have all 12 characters 8/8 maxed with all the gear they want, they usually make another set of backup characters or start a collection - like all the ut's in the game or all the treasures or all the tops.i see nothing wrong with the community besides (i say nothing and besides in the same sentence ironicly) some chat spammers who could easily be ignored, and even notifers seem to be a problem but i don't mind them. the people are fine though, except for the leechers, but can you blame them?-update 8 months after i wrote the second update:i like how they fixed the notifers. i didn't understand it at first, since i thought any time you entered a realm you'd have to wait 2 minutes but it makes sense on how you could just nexus in case you almost die or store some pots in your inventory and re-enter the realm without having to wait.anyway, realm lag. it's not your internet, it's realm, it always has been realm. i haven't played in months (though i have around 1,300 hours on it including my hours on steam) and i can see that the lag is slightly better, but not all the way better. there's still only around 3-4 lucky hours of the day where there's no noticable lag. i'm sure with the hella loads of updates they did a month or two ago this summer that they tried fixing it, still i don't see why they can't add more ram to the servers with the amount of money people spend in a month of just playing the game.i think that's one of the main reasons people stop playing realm. the first reason is that realm is the gamer's heroin and you should probably only play under an hour a day, 3 days a week or you'll get sucked into the vortex of neverending gameplay and the financially broke life.

												{Rant} Game used to be one the most fun games I will ever have played but new developers have ruined it to its core. Too many micro-transactions and a lot of focus on paying to win basically. Pets are the key to survival which are insanely hard to get up to speed without farming trench's or etc. for a long time without paying money. And all new dungeons, and items, and in general game updates are focused around spending money for top tier gear whether it be the mystery box with a low chance for an extreme payout, or buying ""tops"" straight up. 8 ""8/8's"" no longer feels like I earned it since anyone can buy tops and farm fairly easily (but most likely die and give me a good laugh), UT's drop frequently and the game just feels like a massive, overpowering player base with no challenge any longer (especially with pets) and is just a waste of time to farm.{Summary}Large changes such as UT's being non-tradeable or the disappearance of amulets is not what ruined the game, it's the most recent p2w schemes, aka mystery box of profit that tear away from the core point of farming and finally having the RNG in your favor for that moment when you've achieved a great set after good work, not having exclusive items in the mystery box that won't be in a dungeon for 3 months...{Suggestion}I love Warframe and League of Legends, for some reason a LOT of RoTMG players left for league, not sure why but I was hooked also so check them out, realm is just not worth the time any longer. And Warframe gives a perfect feel for the payout for time you put in farming, very Face of Mankind esque but updated constantly and very satisfying to play unlike another great games downfall.(The Big Lebowski)Has the world gone crazy?Seen too many games go to ♥♥♥♥....

												RotMG has had something of a checkered past. From it's storied inception at the hands of indie dev Wildstorm Studios to it's dubious sale to Kabaam, and now this latest chapter as the game is once again sold to Deca Games. Let's be clear. The time with Kabaam were some dark days. But it speaks to the resiliency and devotion of the fanbase/community that so many players soldiered on through the bad times and stayed with this game for so long. Kabaam's handling of bugs and duping was poor. Really poor. One of the biggest issues when I last player the game about two years ago was that the ""Amulet of Resurrection""... the only item in the game that could save your character if it was ""killed"" was normally a very expensive and difficult to acquire item. But so many people were duping them that the in game economy was flooded with them and no one was dying. Turn and churn is a really big part of this game so when no one dies the game stagnates. Kabaam handled this complex issue with a sledgehammer turning all the amulets into ""Amulets of Zombification."" I personally felt violated. They went into my vault inventory and took items I had earned and replaced them with something far inferior without asking me or discussing it with me. I was already furious. Then they completely botched their communication with the community. Telling us that this new amulet had a 5% chance of turning your character into a Zombie and thus... failing to save it. When your character is dead in RotMG it's dead. Nothing is saved.  So when you lose a maxed character with great gear it's a big deal to a lot of players. And it turned out that the Amulet that was supposed to only have a 5% chance of letting us die was in fact about 95%. Everyone started dying and turning into zombies. I lost a maxed 8/8 Huntress that turned into a Zombie and I was furious. I walked away from the game and hardly looked back despite having three other maxed characters. Time passed. Kabaam eventually created a pet system to replace the Amulet. No your pets can't save you if you die. But by grinding and grinding you can create a pet so powerful that bosses and dungeons that were super dangerous are far less so. But other than the introduction of a lot of new dungeons and content that seems to be the end of Kabaam's major changes. And bugs and duping have persisted this entire time.For example there's a bug that if you try and drag an item into your inventory and someone else snags the item (often with the reviled ""auto pickup"" programs that many players now must use to compete with multi-boxers and hackers) before you get it all the way into your inventory it creates a ""ghost"" of that item. This ghost will not disappear. And it can block and make useless as many as four inventory slots. And with only 8 slots on the base character that can really hamper your ability to pick up items. What's worse the ""ghost"" cannot be dispelled without reloading the program entirely. Merely going to the Nexus, your vault or changing realms works. The item ""ghost"" even persists in the loading screen. And while I understand this was done to fix a duping bug a better solution SURELY should have been found in the two years that have passed since I first encountered it. But despite these issues RotMG is one of the most consistently fun and addicting games I've ever played. And with the sale to Deca games there's hope that their profession of being fans and devotees of the game themselves will lead to long needed fixes and improvements. For example, there's no way to play fullscreen. The game was originally designed to play on a small computer monitor inside a web browser and that initial design has never been improved upon. Despite the game being years old and being passed to it's 3rd developer and losing a lot of its playerbase there is still no way to play it full screen. In Steam you can stretch the window to make it bigger than the tiny default window... but beware, because if you don't keep the aspect ratio correct... and there is no way to constrain it, you can throw off the way the game is presented to you. The best case scenario is some menus will only present half their information and some ads may block your inventory. The worst case is thinking there is a monster in a certain spot when it is actually a bit closer to you and to the left. It can get you killed if you aren't careful.Another issue is the HP and Mana Pots. Not the stat pots but the blue and red potions that you use to replenish lost HP or magic power while in a fight. Initially Kabaam, in a rather blatant money grab, made it so when you ran out of these pots and hit the hot key to use one the system would automatically take five ""Gold"" (the in game currency that is purchased for real world money) and sell you the pot instead of telling you that you were out. After much furor from the community Kabaam implemented an off switch for this in the controls. However I have found that if you do shut off auto purchasing these pots and then hit the hot key when you are out of them and in a fight a large UI box pops up, covering much of your fighting area, and asking you if you want to buy the pot for 5 gold as you are out. It's horrifying. It almost got my 8/8 Knight killed twice in a five minute period. Really freaked me out and it's a really poor implementation. Additionally I'd say there are issues altogether with the way these pots are sold. Mana and HP Pots are super easy to get. A high level character is so powerful that the low level mobs that drop them get mowed down like bowling pins by maxed out characters. Yet it can be time consuming and annoying to be farming baby mobs just so you have a bit of healing and magic replacement for the dungeons and big fights you actually want to be doing as a maxed character. And purchasing these pots at 5 Gold is a ridiculous and usurious price to charge for something so easily obtained and unimportant to the game. It's like charging a person for putting air in their tires. Sure there are coin operated air compressors but I have yet to run into a service station that doesn't simply turn it on for free. Because while we all realize you need air in your tires it isn't something of great value or scarcity. The same goes for these pots. They are neither valuable nor scarce but you need them. And high level players wasting time scouring the land for them is sort of silly. My hope is that this new owner, Deca Games; in addition to making many other improvements and bug fixes, sees the wisdom in reducing the price for these items and encouraging their use at the same time. For example you can carry up to six of each of these pots for a total of twelve. Can you imagine how much more gold Deca would sell and how more often these micro purchases would be made if they simply offered to top your inventory off for one gold? Imagine... you're going out to the realm and you want to head to the god lands or someone is opening a dungeon in the Nexus. You hit a button and for one gold you get your HP and Mana pots inventory filled up. I'd do this at least once almost every time I played. Probably for multiple characters. Right now gold is roughly 100 to 1 in real world to in game value. So one dollar US is equal to 100 Gold. So at the current rate buying HP and Mana pots to fill your inventory of six each would cost a staggering sixty cents. More than half a dollar for something so unimportant. Thus I and most players have NEVER purchased them. But if it was 1 gold to fill er up. You bet your ♥♥♥ I'd use it. Deca Games is doing a lot of giveaways and has proclaimed this and the following four weeks the ""Month of the Mad God."" There's a lot of celebrating and they've done an excellent job of energizing and motivating the community on social media. Lets hope that energy carries over to improvements and new content for the game. But even if it doesn't. RotMG is crazy fun.			"

												Seeing that this game had no kind of formal review by anyone seemingly experienced. I decided I'd take it upon myself to do one. I don't know if you've noticed but I've put more than my fair share of time into this game.To start the controls are as simple as they get, they typical moving, shoot by clicking the mouse (there is an autofire button if you're lazy.) and aiming. Simple enough right? Wrong.The whole charm of this game is the fact that it is permadeath. You spend a lot of time with one character just to have him and all of your hard earned items flushed down the toilet as you look at the death screen with your jaw dropped. I cannot tell you how many times I have done this myself. Just because you made one little mistake. And in this game there are plenty of mistakes to be made. But the whole thing that makes it great it the fact that the better you are. The more time and resources you put into your character the more devastating it is. But the whole point is the game doesn't baby you. It's quite comparable to Dark Souls or Demon Souls in this aspect. You run through a quick tutorial and are put in the middle of everything where you have no idea what to do or where to go from there.People claim there are some pay to win elements in the game, which quite honestly yes is slightly true. But if you wait to get good at the game and enjoy a game that isn't babying you through it, you won't mind shelling out $10-20 for a few chests or character slots.Skins, Items, Keys, and the newly added Mystery Box are a different story however. (I typically buy these with gold laying around after I buy chests and whatnot.) Anyhow to sum it up. This is a great game. There is always something to do. Always something to challenge you. And nothing there to baby you. And please to avoid starting off bad with the veteran community. Don't beg for items. Good luck.			"

												A narrative review of such a memorable game...Realm of the Mad God or ROTMG combines a bullet hell experience with loot galore, infused with an retro 8 bit art stylew ith the soon to love repetitive theme tune... Your thrown straight into to ""realms""  of the game after a stress free tutorial. Free to roam around the games enviroment being spawned into a beach type enviroment. One either treks inland or finds the function of teleport on the map and clicks towards the center of the map. Then the first grey screen hits you. You have been killed by...(insert reason here, most likey gelatinious cube or dank oh no its a tree). Then one is probably gripped onto the fully realised experience of perma-death mechanics within the game and perhaps either addicted/hooked to the progression that one can achieve-the mighty challenge. Or straight out ""I quit"". Although the idea of returning might come apparent.After a few hours one will aqcuire the knowledge of peer to peer trading, the meeting of the varied community presented, ""beggers"" who play the game to ask for items, and the meeting of the grim reaper ;) and the surface of the ROTMG experience. Digging below that surface will come the  many dungeouns and events and of course facing Oryx-the mad god.  Or throw your wallet at the screen and buy the gold purchasable items for real money...but the satisfaction of such would be nill. Pets also fit under the pay to win section in some essence as your realise bringing up a pet is new entire game in itself. Vaults and character slots will need to be purchased with gold as well. So non-buyers may struggle. The game is frustrating, annoying and depressing after death. Yet dancing in the ""Realms of the Mad Gods"" is seen super fun, especially in those naive exploring stages. I think many past and present players will be able to relate and agree. Who knew death could be so gripping.			"

												Realm of the Mad God is a Free to play MMORPG.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  It is a 2D Bullet Hell shooter game with RPG elements.  The artwork is 8-bit pixelated.  The game has Permadeath, you die you have to start over.   There is CoOpative gameplay with other players on each server.  The theme of the artwork is Fantasy.Try it if you like arcade bullet hell shoot em up.For more info:

												To be honest if there was an option of recomending it and not, i would choose that. I mean this game is just that to me, 50/50. See, let me start off by saying i played this on Kong back in  October of 2011, loved it. A few laggy moments but that was because of an overloaded server (which is very unlikely to happen). Than summer of 2012 came. And oh boy, did it start to change. I have been noticing the monoplizing of the market place, everything was very steeply priced, and i couldn't afford it. So i played as a noob for about a year or so. Left ROTMG, left Kong. And came to steam. And then i found ROTMG, i was exstatic. It was very nostalgic for me. But then i noticed the market, it got HUGE, little portals to smaller markets, eggs, food, and dungeon keys, it was very surreal. And then i finally gave in, and bought some vaults (because i started getting good and had little to no area to put my loot). Big mistake, that was when Kabam milked my steam wallet dry. I mean it was my decision, but my back was against the wall, the game that i loved back then, or other games. And that is why i don't recomend ROTMG, it started out play to win, now its just pay to win. 4.5/10			"

												Boring top down shooter meets mmo hybrid.At least it's not a point and click hitscan game, but it feels like there's almost no design to the gameplay (either in the maps or the random enemies, whom you all fight pretty much the same). The combat doesn't even feel like a shooter, as it often rewards just staying away from enemies rather than skillfully dodging and weaving through enemy attacks.Like all MMO's it supposedly gets better, but even people who have stuck with it tell me that it's ultimately more of a WoW style loot farming game than a true action experience. So if the ""shmup mmo hybrid"" got you excited, you might want to check your enthusiasm in my oppinion.			"

												One of the most greedy companies out there, Kabam, has FINALLY sold this game to a new and much more promising one: DECA games. This is somewhat of a godsend if you ask me, as Kabam had given up on the game a while ago and weren't active at all. In the short time that DECA has been at the steering wheel, they have already made miracles happen and shown that they aren't afraid to take the game down for a day while fixing a few things. This proves that they're capable of changing things Kabam didn't care about and that they are quick to act when crisis strikes.Due to Kabams inactivity, they game had slowly began to die out and lose most of its dedicated players. With DECA, the game has been revived, and A LOT of players have returned. The future is bright for the Realm.			"

												I'm gonna make this short. I sadly can't recommend this game on the basis that it's a P2P (Pay to Play) disguised as a F2P (Free to Play). Most of the good items in this game are in the store, which you can only buy with gold. But the only way to get gold is to buy it with actual money from your account. And no, there isn't anyway to earn gold in the actual game. If you aren't the kind that's willing to spend money to get the good items, then chances are you won't enjoy this game (or at least not as much as you should).			"

												DECA Games saved my life.In the year elevnty-twelve there was a young lad who had taken on his first RPG. This wonderful game was called Realm of the Mad God. He loved the game with all his heart. By age nine he had logged 12,000 hours in to the game. RotMG was his favorite thing in the world, nothing could surpass what Kabaam had created for him. As years passed the young lad spent what felt like an eternity in the realm. He played all types of characters, and when new ones were created he welcomed them with open arms. Nothing was closer to his heart than this game. Suddenly it was the year 2015. The boy still played day in and day out. For some reason he started to notice less and less content being produced. His world was turning grey. His days were monotonous, shatters after shatters nothing would change. Sure, one day there were a couple turkeys in the realm, but that didn't interest the boy. He just wanted to make Realm great again.The boy's mind was hallow he felt empty inside. Slowly and slowly he felt less reason to continue his adventure. The lava called to him. ""Come here, it's warm in the lava. There's no need to be out there anymore."" the lava said. And so the boy walked, with his trusted speed the boy shed his armor and walked. Towards the lava, his world full of sadness he noticed the graves around him. He was following in the footsteps of his friends and guild members. He blended in with the community he followed blindly in their rage. With his first foot in already, an angel creept out from behind the clouds. The angel's name was Silex and he said, ""My son this place will be new again you mustn't throw yourself away."" The boy listened and learned about the world of DECA. DECA was unfamiliar to him, yet it felt so close. Like a gentle mother's touch, DECA showed him things he couldn't imagine.The boy stepped out of the lava. With a bright light Silex turned the boys leg to its original form. He cast out the world of Kabaam and the world regained its color. Ty DECA			"

												Okay, this is a tricky game to review, so bear with me.     The people think that the game is just ""pay to win"" now aren't exactly right.  Of course there is still buying items and you can't get some items without buying them with USD or other currency, but that doesn't mean you necessarily have to buy the items to have fun in the game.  You can have just as much fun without buying items.      Second, you can't just play this game for 5 minutes, die by a sumo wrestler and review this game bad.   You cannot be good at this game in a whiff, practice is needed       Some people seem to forget the difference between a terrible game and a really hard game.  This is not a terrible game.  Kabam has not ruined this game, they have just tried their best to make a profit on Realm of the Mad God, because they bought it, you think it's going to be cheap buying a popular game?       Anyways, it has mindless fun.  Once you become good with this game, it gets fun doing the events like the Lord of the Lost Lands, and see the new dungeons like the Ice Cave and the Puppet Master's Theater (yeah, you like those dungeons don't you guys, they were from KABAM!)  And the most satisfying moment is when you go to a dungeon hoping for something rare and   you get what you want.   It is so satisfying.    The features of the game  Vault      In this game, when you die, you die forever, and you have to make another character, and you know what that means.  Anything that your character died with, goes away,   FOREVER    The vault, is a place where you can safely store your items so when your character dies, or has a full inventory, they can put the items in the vault.  The vault is the same size as the character's inventory (8) and each account starts out with one vault.   Pets      This sometimes gets some hate.  Pets are little creatures that hatch from  Pet Eggs [www.realmeye.com]  Each pet has different abilities, some being able to heal your magic power or health points.  Some people say that it makes the character Paladin render useless.  You can feed pets, and the more feed power the weapon, the higher level abilities they gain.  Pets' tiers are common, uncommon, rare, legendary, and divine.  It is extremely hard to even get your pet to legendary without buying pet food, which has a lot of feed power for money.   Character Slots      If you're playing this game, and you're tired of playing the same character, but you don't want to kill your current one because he has good loot or he has  maxed a stat. [www.realmeye.com]  Character slots are right down your alley.  Character slots, (for realm gold, which requires money) allow you to have more than one character alive at the same time.  Each time you buy a slot, the price goes up a little bit, so don't waste all your money at once! The bottom line      Realm of the Mad God has a lot of great gameplay and features, but it has lost a lot of players due to Kabam making the game supposedly ""pay to win.""			"

												So it goes like this:Once upon a time, there was a contest for something or other, and so some people started making a game for said contest. They won, of course, and so emerged from the depths of a volcano in some land somewhere...Realm of the......MAD GOD.A good game, yes, indeed. No pay to win, no lag...When one day, a terrible thing happened to the realm! It was purchased by none other than...JACK M. CRAZYFISH! er i meanKABAM!No you imbiscle, not like the comic book guy getting punched, the game company. Stupid idiot.Lag, pay to win, and much, much, worse. A slight delay in spells, just enough to mess up the timing. Harder enemies, more (hard) events, more ways to die.Soon it became filled with trade bots, TRADE BOTS EVERYWHERE! (gasp)But what made it pay to win? Well, I lied. It's not pay to WIN. It's pay to save you MULTIPLE HOURS. I have obtained items such as T5 Cloak of Endless Twilight (one of the best cloaks currently in-game) The T10 Staff of some-fancy-word-I-can't-remember, and the T11 Robe of the ditto-from-the-staff-before.Anyone complaining that this game is P2W is wrong, wrong, and WRONG.

												I am a very old payer of this game, ever since WildShadow owned it and there was the old forums. This game used to be amazing, fun, interactive and enjoyable. You had to put time into the game to get anywhere, and even then you could lose it all in one death. Regardless of that, it hooked almost all players of this game who were willing to put 5+ hours a week. Personally, I was very addicted to this game during 2011 and 2012. Then, doomsday came: Kabam bought Realm of The Mad God. Everything was transformed into buying gold to achieve things. Back in the old days, you had to grind dungeons to get an incantation to just maybe get a tier 12 item in the wine cellar. Now, just buy realm gold and get tier 12 items in nexus. It's ♥♥♥♥ed up.Unless you're rich as ♥♥♥♥ and don't care about money, don't get this game.			"

												Now, where to begin with this game. Since the start this game, it gave a lot to its community and to the game. It thrived on people willing to accomplish tasks without dying or 'rage quitting', one can never simply 'give up' on this game, as you'll always find a spot for it.  In the past few years, there have been a few changes, for the better or not these changes have affected the RotMG community and the game directly, and as a result of this the somewhat downfall of Realms came to exist. Some things seem to mean more than others as the game gets easier and more toxic, items are no longer rare and items are more easy to obtain now that bots are about as frequent as the encounter of a real player.  All in all, this game was once wonderful and it thrived, and it still is, just not as good ;)I would reccomend you try out the game, just have fun while you play it, try to ignore the things that ruin the game as that'll only ruin your game.Have fun Realming !Tham.

												This game is one of the most rewarding games I have ever played, but it definatly burns your pocket if you don't have self control. With a massive amount of money grabbing from corprate run devs, you will be bombarded with it. However, with enough skill you can get passed the money aspect of the game, and simpily buy items with player made currency. It's beautiful if you think about it. Oh and if you die, prepare to cry.

												This game is very enjoyable, its been able to entertain me for 72hrs so far... and others more.. yet they go on about how microtransactions ruin the game; you don't even need to buy anything.  You can earn all the things that are being sold by just putting some effort in the damned game and feel better about it too.  Although, you can buy things to advance yourself without putting much effort into the game, which is, of course fine.  But anyhow, the game is very fun.  It's extremely lengthy.. you can play it for virtually forever lol.  Going around, starting over, killing, farming, getting your character to maxed level which is 20 then going and getting potions to upgrade your character is quite an experience; you have to invest lots of time into the game; and its worth it, because in the end, you feel like you accomplished something especially since some people just quit because it's ""too hard"" or ""frustrating to lose everything when I die"", when its fixed to the point you lose everything when you die.. it makes it more intruging, you actually have some insentive to not just say ""♥♥♥♥ all"" and run around like an idiot without a care and to actually play smartly and do things correct... The game isn't for all, but for the some who it is for, you'll enjoy it greatly; just as I do! :)			"

												Pros:Not to sound biased but... None I can think of.Cons:- Permadeath. In an RPG. With inventory loss.- Awful graphics, even for me - and I love pixel graphics.- It's pay to win. Enough said.- Most of it is just going around the same areas killing different enemies.- You get almost no help whatsoever.- The gameplay is so simple its just boring and repetitive.- Skill won't help you win. It's mostly relies on luck.- Hardly any content. How do I know? The entire game literally took 3 secs to download with average internet.- Much like WOW, you have to pay real money to anything. Even changing your name. - Speaking of names, you can only have a name 10 characters long.So, overall, my opinion of this game is that it's terrible. I recommend you find a good rpg instead, like Neverwinter. Even though that's pay to win too, it at least gives you a chance to actually play the game - and enjoy it.			"

												Why did I ever invest time into this game? It's as rewarding as a burnt casserole on a paper plate soaked in syrup. Disgusting. The game is pretty okay, but there are a lot better games out there than this arcade simulation. Great if you don't got money and don't feel like going outside and being active. Sick days, although drawing or reading are much more productive.			"

It's an amusing little waste of time, probably won't hold your attention for too long, but... it's fun for what it is, so go ahead and check it out if you've got a few hours to kill.			"

												I can only find two problems with this game. Unfortunately, both problems make the game virtually unplayable.1. Too much Pay 2 Win. Seriously. This is the WORST pay 2 win I have seen in ANY game. EVER! Even EA is shocked by the excessive Pay 2 Win (Fun Fact: I actually like EA.). Half the game's content needs the coins, which it's hyper hard to get any unless you're shelling out money for them. Without coins, you have a half-♥♥♥♥♥ game with very little content available.2. The controls are UN-RE-FREAKING-SPONSIVE! I disabled shadows, I set the game to windowed, I disabled text bubbles, and I even closed everything off except for this game, and the controls are still barely managable! My character, for no reason, decides to go left when I want him to go right. sometimes, he doesen't even move at all! Literally ALL of my deaths recently was because of the ♥♥♥♥-poor controls.This game isn't a bad concept. However, these two problems are both equally bad, and bad enough to turn the game into a complete mess.			"

												I played this game for more than 3 hours to get a character to max level. Upon reading some guides, I realized that the game is quite broken because of the training methods in god realms. Even a level 1 could not only survive but reach max level in less than an hour without shooting, and you even get rewarded for that. I actually enjoyed playing this game, good for short breaks.			"

												Realm Of The Mad God(RotMG) is one of my favourite games is steam right now.You willl be facinated of what classes to unlock and what items the game Has in store For YouAt First, you will feel Bored but when you get to lvl 20 your life will be change forever.This game is a retro 8-bit style game.It has Alot of classess to be unlocked and lots of items.It is a perma death game too. so if u die then u must create a new character again.But this is thetype of challenge that we want in the community and it will be rewarding after you kill Dungeon Bosses toget Soulbound bags.What are Soulbound Bags? Well they are loot that are in a specific bag color. The colors ranges fromPurple , Cyan and white. White Bags Are the hardest to get but has good stuff inside and you have pets too who has alot ofabilities which can aid you in battle. the places you should avoid unless you have better equips and at least lvl 20 which are Godlands(glands).You can die Pretty much instantly by some gods like Medusa(Snake Head Lady),Leviatan(Blue Creature) and Djinns(blue creature that shoots snowballs) and more.Whenever you feel your screen shaking, its time to meet Oryx.Oh and expect death whenever that happens because he is the hardest boss in the game and alot of players die by him.so i recommend you to nexus or die a brave person.Whenever you die, dont be sad just think about what your next character is gonna be and start over again.Remember Guys, EXPECT DEATH!!-StxofDark(RotMG Username0			"

												Here are the pros and cons of this game.Pros: It's free.Has items to purchase, but not really a pay to win.Despite only have one music theme, it's pretty good.Challenging, but not too hard. (At least for the most part)Nice pixel top down shooter overall.Cons: Despite the music being good, it can be a bit reppetitive.Not many updates. (Been a while since there's been a new dungeon added.)The community on steam. Everyone on the website version of ROTMG is more lively and communicate more. You go up to almost any wandering player and ask to team up and they'll say 'sure'. Very few players here even talk.

												Simplistic Roguelike with suprisingly large open worlds where it's easy to find yourself in challening areas. The loot in this game is very situational, with most drops containing items from other classes, which are utterly useless unless you have friends or a group with you, but with the large amount of drops, it's easy to just ignore the useless ones. The game is also flooded by spambots advertising a WoW ""pay for gold"" system, which is also easy to ignore. For the simplicity and quirkyness, it's worth the money to buy this game ($0 is quite a bargain) but it's great to pick up and play for a few minutes in your spare time.			"

												I woke up this morning to play my favorite game of all time. I logged in to my computer to find I no longer had windows XP, and that windows 10 had taken over even my delicate machine. I was infuriated, and in my rage smashed my computer into a million tiny bits. Without any way to play the best game ever made, I was distraught. I ran 3 miles to my workplace, only to find that I would not be allowed in to ""simply play a video game."" I quit at that moment, the thought of working alongside such inferior beings made me want to cut myself. Once I returned home I turned on my phone to try and call my friend and see how she was getting along in the game. I was dialing the digits for her phone number when a sudden realization came over me. I ran to the remains of my computer, impaling my feet on countless bits of machinery and legos to grab my keyboard and mouse. I plugged both the keyboard and mouse into the usb docking multisplit thing my grandma had given me for my birthday 6 years ago, and then plugged that into a usb to micro usb converter. I then proceeded to plug the micro usb converter into my phone, where I now had full access with my keyboard and mouse. Grinning at my excellence, I began to open the game in the browser of my phone. Finally logged in and ready to begin the day, the clock in the upper right reads 11:00 PM, and I regretfully realize I must sleep. Excited to begin tomorrow and continue the grind of a lifetime, I happily set my alarm and lay down to sleep. My dreams are haunted by visions of dying, lost items, and legos, but I sleep well enough. My alarm blares at 3 AM sharp and I snap to attention, already dressed in the clothes for the day, and I continue where I left off the previous night. Sitting on the floor by the remains of my once operable computer, I log in and begin playing. After a bit of warming up, I decide to venture towards the end goal of my quest. While on my journey, a message pop's into the middle of my screen - ""H0W T0 GET THE BEST L00T IN THE GAME, GAURANTEED TO WORK EVERY TIME"" - it's a message from my friend, included with a video. Excited to become the best player, I can't click the link fast enough. After 14 minutes of introduction in the video, the unthinkable happens. I got rick rolled. I couldn't think clearly anymore, and in a haze I left my house towards the address my friend had given me. I met her online, but we lived near eachother and we had told eachother our addresses in an attempt to meet up once before. I reach her apartment in record pace, and kick down the door screaming. I search every room, eventually finding a dark room with only a singular source of light. I flicker on the lights, and a fat girl in her late teens turns to face me. I recognize her instantly from the pictures she had sent me, and I steeled myself for what I was about to do. I began to sprint towards her, hand's reaching for ********************.************************************************************.********************************************************************************.********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************.************************************************************. The walk home was enjoyable, I had forgotten my shirt but the sun was bright and the breeze was cool. It took a few hours to reach my house again, I had decided to take a scenic route back home. I open the front door quietly, I didn't want to alarm my dear aunt sally. Please excuse her, she just isn't as good looking as she used to be back when I was a young teenager. I slowly approach my phone laying on the ground in the middle of my room, and notice that I have been logged out from my game. Completely reasonable, considering my time spent away, I log back in to my account. I'm very uncreative and forgetful, so my username is always my first and last name followed by a few numbers. I always make my password 'incorrect', so that when I type it in wrong it just tells me how to type it in correctly. I am very clever. Logging in, my immediate thoughts are ripped away from me, replaced my a low groan that originates in the depths of my very being. It quickly rises in pitch, into a powerful crescendo that shatters the windows in my neighbors home. I had died while I ventured on my crusade. My extremely vaulable character, with hours of work and effort, vaporized in a mere instant because somebody had the audacity to rick roll me. My dear aunt Sally joins me as I scream, and together we reach a magnifient climax. My cry of rage dies down, replaced by a powerful sense of vengeance - the one responsible for this would pay, and with my grandest battlecry I charge out the door towards the apartment of somebody I used to call my friend. I break my previous world record pace by half, and I kick my way through the remains of her door. Remembering where her room was, I move in quickly, and lock my eyes on her shivering form, huddled bare in the corner of her room. My battlecry strengthens, and begins rising back to a glorious pitch. I move in, eager to claim my revenge on her broken form, my previous efforts from earlier aiding as she lacks the resistance to refuse me. Throwing her on her back, I glare into her eyes, and notice the fear, causing my scream to raise higher than it ever has. I *****************. ****************************************. ****************************************************************. ************************************************************.****************************************************************************************************.************************************************************.************************************************************. Finished, my scream dies down to a mere grumble, and I hear a shout from outside her apartment. I realize this is probaby a bad thing, and charge towards the wall, breaking my way through. I took an interesting route home that day, I didn't change my course for anybody - or anything. As I enter my home, I hear my dear aunt Sally upstairs, her medications must not be working as I hear her moans of pain echo. Crouching in my room at my phone, I laugh to myself. I had logged into the wrong account. Sometimes I use an alternate birthday to reflect the generation I wish I was born in. Logging in, I scream happily as I notice my characters existence, and begin to play again. Glad to once again have my level 3 wizard, I continue onwards to fight the evil chicken god.Overall 8/10, would play again.			"

												Realm of the Mad God is a great Free to Play title, and the community sometimes can be very helpful in terms of experiences and your overall enjoyment of the game. But the community is also highly critical of the game. It isnt as active as it used to be years ago, but this is mostly due to lack of content being added to the game. Hopefully in the future the game may be sold to somebody who can keep up with the community, but is still a great fast paced perma-death game. You should be able to get hours of enjoyment out of it till you start to get higher up in the ranks where things seem more and more repetitive. The community overall though is very passionate about keeping the game alive and letting it blossom. Sometimes talks of its pay to win aspects discourage new players, but you can definantly survive in the current meta without dropping any money in the game.			"

												This game is great fun. Dungeon diving killing gods and taking on the mad god himself. This game takes time to get used too but once you understand how and what you need to do it is amazing. It is great to play with friends and playing it solo. Either way great game would recomend to players looking to have fun, play with a great comunity and like to have fun. 10/10			"

												This game is getting a lot of bad reviews because people see it as ""pay to win"".I'm here to fix that. In the game ""Realm of the Mad God"" there are thousands of micro transactions you can do to get better gear that would take a legit player longer. The only difference is, when you get the items from actual bosses in the game you learn the value of them, and how to use them instead of starting off with 20$+ of gear and dieing at level 15.At least they don't sell stat pots in the nexus for real money, that way someone who paid 100$ is still not better than a legit maxed character. tl:dr You can not pay and get a more rewarding experince!

												This is a very simple game which involves lots of grinding, learning through death, and losing everything in your inventory when you die, so why is it such a good game? That feeling you get when you get the loot. When you see a white bag for your first time, or get a Blue bag from a hard boss, they are what keep everybody in this game. That indescribable feeling of overwhelming excitement and happiness has kept me into this game for a long time. It's a very relaxing game, very little competition, but tons of fun!			"

												If you don't mind dying....like, a LOT, and if you like old Gauntlet-esque ""bullet-hell"" type of games, then this is the game for you. Even though you WILL die, and lose high-level stuff quite frequently, (this game has perma-death) it still has an addictiveness to it, that keeps us all coming back for more punishment. It's deceptively simple gameplay, enables a quick learning curve, while retaining difficulty, and replayability. After reaching a high level with one class, and farming the ""godlands"" for high-tier items, and stat potions, unlocking new classes to play as, that can use said items becomes the desired goal. The trading system in the game is also very addictive, and higher level players tend to give away high-tier items quite often. I've played over 80 hours, between my different accounts, and it's still quite enjoyable to me. That, couipled with the fact that it's free, makes this game a must-try for everyone.

Give it a chance from the start and you can really get into it and enjoy the full experience the game has to offer.  ROTMG is great for a small group of friends willing to take on the adventures hinden within the realm portal.  Work you way up though ROTMG's character levels to unlock more specialized charcters to help you through your adventure.  All around great game! Thanks!			"

Its a very addictive however this game does have a big learning curve, Expect to die... a lot... You can't get very far in this game without spending any money at all. You will need to spend money at some point due to the limits you have with 1 vault and more importantly 1 character slot. If you haven't played this game, go try it out. Its free! You will start this game not knowing anything (unless you've watched a lot of videos) and you will die a lot even if you do watch videos. Expect raging and jealousy if you play this for a while. Thats all i have to say. Overall amazing game. Keep realming!			"

												Permadeath game warning!  If you die, you have to start over with the lowest equipment and at level 1.Realm of the Mad God is a game of skill, if you can't develop the skills to play this, you may not enjoy this game.With all that said, RotMG is one of the most addicting games I have ever played.  It is simple yet elegant in design.  Start on the beach and work your way towards the center of Oryx's realm where the strongest monsters dwell.  Along the way you will face a constant stream of monsters, all of whom are intent on turning you into their next meal.  There are quests of varying difficulty, some you can solo but others you may need to gang up on with your fellow adventurers.The combat is point-and-click.  You aim and fire with your mouse, use spacebar for your special ability and you move with WADSQ.  There are 14 classes to choose from, each with it's own special ability and stat cap.You start at level 1, and can reach level 20 in a short amount of time.  Then the game really begins.  The gods in godlands have a chance of dropping potions which can raise one of your stats by 1 point.  The goal here is to max your stats to increase your damage output, defenses and regeneration ability.  The stat potions not found in the godlands can be found in dungeons dropped by the gods or by some of the quest events.  There are 8 stats in all, which you can potentially max.Equipment can be found everywhere.  From the lowlands to the godlands you will find gear of increasing strength.  Delving into the dungeons, you will find even more powerful equpment.  Equipment, Skill and stats are the 3 most important things when playing this game.Once certain requirements are met, Oryx(the antagonist in this game) will seal the Realm and summon all players to his castle in order to wipe you out once and for all.  Will he succeed?  That's up to you.When you first play this game, you will have 7 days to buy into a very good deal.  +2 character slots and +3 vault chests, as well as 2600 gold(+5 chests is recommended) and a penguin pet.  It is recommended that you use a spare email address to make a test account directly on the website realmofthemadgod.com (not on steam), to see if you like the game.  If you like it, either continue to play through the website or make a Steam account.  Having multiple character slots and vault chests available really helps because of the permadeath nature of this game.  You can stock up spare equipment and stat pots in the chests and you can play multiple classes when you have more character slots.  They have sales on character slots and vault chests relatively often, and those are the only things you'd want to spend money on..everything else is a waste because it is either consumable or will die with your character(backpacks are worth getting even though they die with you).  Don't bother with the Steam DLC pack, it's not worth it.I play this game almost exclusively(through the website).  It's a lot of fun and is a near-continuous adrenaline rush.  I'll reiterate, this is a game of skill and is not for everyone.  Be sure to try it before investing your time and money into it.			"

Also the pets system is amazing, you can level your pets up completely with in game currency, but if you want to get a legendary or divine pet, it is definitely easier for paying users.Overall great game, it's free so why not try it!

Where am I? Where is that? What's going on? Oh look more enemies. (WHO NEEDS A MAP?!)-Party system is horrible.-level 100 butterfly has slain you. (Not at all epic for a monster, only Monty Python can get away with this. :P )-classes locked unless you go through different tasks to unlock them.-dear god, the lag, the horrible unoptimized lag! (Look, if i can run plenty of recent games at max then it's not me)-communication is difficult.-Hope you don't like fullscreen.Neither pro or con:= Sprite art is okay.= Instant action.= Simple-------------------------Take this review as you will, it's just here to give you perspective before you hop in, not for those expert super pro players who are already at the top of the scoreboard and have 500+ hours of the game, what are you going through reviews for anyway? It's not a popularity contest and this is what i really think about it, and that's the purpose of reviews. Shoo!Hope this helped you. :3			"

												I am going to be dead honest with you: there is a reason why this is a free game on steam: there is no way you can charge anyone to play this game. It bet it ringed a bell in your head and you either got caught by it being free, the graphics(welp) or the gameplay premise of a MMO/bullet Hell hybrid, or all of them combined.the result is quite far, far from even being remotely interesting. randomly generated terrains that cause enemies to get stuck in the middle, input delay(in a bullet hell where you're meant to have precise controls) the overall CHAOS that is the enemy spawning and the utterly UGLY artwork of this game -and by ugly i mean look at that promo, and see how it doesnt reflect AT ALL what this ♥♥♥♥ is about-This piece of ♥♥♥♥ is nothing but a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of your average flash game poorly ported as a standalone, lacking elements as basic as a proper fullscreen mode, good controls or at least, something to do beyond the first tem or twenty minutes of holding M1.

												Quite possibly a one-of-a-kind-game.  That alone makes this one worth playing once (or if you're like me, for hours).  I've never played anything quite like this title and I doubt you have either.  It has simple MMORPG style character customization, fast and frantic arcade style shooting, and perma-death.  That's right, this is an MMO with perma-death.  And yes, you WILL die (many, many, many times.  I suggest you get used to the idea).  Death is a part of this game and should be expected.  Gear is largely transient(but still important in it's own right), and not hugely important as gear is trumped by skill.  What's this you ask?  An MMORPG where skill trumps gear?  Quite welcome if I do say so myself.  The game also has a very elegant solution to make 85 strangers want to play with one another.  This title is one of the few I've ever played that offers TRUE coop, that works, and works very well with each player rewarded equally.  The cash system is also ACTUALLY completely optional.			"

												Gone to complete ♥♥♥♥ shortly after Kabam acquired the game. Should have expected it, judging from all the other terrible games it published. If you decide to play and ignore all the money grab the game, then its fun enough for a while but having 1 character slot gimps you a lot, especially for new people who die a lot. It also sells you highest tier gear in the cash shop, which lures in new players who buy and then instantly lose $10+ from dying. Also, having a good pet costs tons of money, so be prepared to spend lots of time grinding out fame or paying for better pets. Its not necessary to have a pet but it makes everything so much easier and increases your survivability, which in a game of permadeath, is very important. A maxed divine pet is $500+. The game has perma death so dying is pretty devastating. If you decide to buy anything, stick to character slots and vaults.			"

You see when you die you lose all the items you had equiped but there is a vault witch keeps your stuff between characters in the chest. Witch means you always dont want to equip your best gear because your afraid of dying.i have only just finished getting to lv20 for the 3rd time and after that dont go running to gods rightaway you want to stay back do enough damage to get loot. Players in RotMG have a thing called 8/8 it means 8 out of 8 of thier sts are maxed. To max a stst you have you get sts potions witch drop from gods yet since your not 8/8 its very difficult to do. If your new to this game dont go asking people for stuff or YOU WILL BE YELLED AT.Overall this is a very good game but very difficult to ""beat"".I give this game a 8/10 for its very fun gamplay and the community that comes with it.

Paying in this game won't make you automatically win, you still have to have enough skill to survive, BUT paying for things such as extra character slots or extra storage space is super helpful.

												One of the best games I've played in a long while. You can either sit back and farm, or dive head-in and do quests leading up to higher levels. You can play with friends or alone, though it's a lot more fun with friends. I absolutely love the graphic styling, and the unique minions and bosses. I really enjoy killing miniosn to open Portals. It's actually a pretty good idea. The higher level enemies you kill, the higher level the enemies in the portal will be. And the fact that it's free to play really helped me be able to give this game a 10/10, along with very few other games.			"

												i have been playing this game for a little bit over 4 years now and i have done pretty much everything there is to do in it. and here is a little pros and cons list of this gamepros:-one of a kind (it's the only game that is a bullethell mmorpg)-a lot of different classes-great communtiy-a lot of diffrent skins and dyes-gameplay is very fun (figthing is very simmilar to a bullethell )-being bought from kabam to a new and fresh company deca games-trading items-servers are okay-drop rates are very good and dungens have a garunted drop -almost every pc can run this game good or bad depending on your view point-perma death -pixel graphics (some like it others don't)-weapon and monster sounds are beeps and boops ( like froma nes game)-it's  very haveliy based on the grinding on pots (late game)cons:-very basic to almost no story-hacker, bots and multi boxers (which they are working on and it seems it will get better)-very badly ported on steam ( it crashes 2 to 3 times on a 3-4 hours gaming session)- some items are account bound (would have really liked it if they could make them tradeble a couple of times a year)- very short leveling time (max 20 lvl which can take 5-20 mins)-very bad soundtrack  ( it's one song and it plays over and over. i'd recomend to turn it off)i like this game i have recommended it to most of my friends and i would say that it is most fun playing with friends 7.6/10even with this rating it is still one of my favorite games			"

												I have around 800++ hours on the game, but none of it is on steam, but I feel that the game could use a bit of tweaking *cough* necro buff + necro wis mod *cough*. Also, the game does have a very high percentage of people using modified clients, to either have an unfair advantage over others, or just to improve their performance in game. I personally think that one of the main problems right now in the game is performance, as even with good internet and a good pc, you will still have fps drops and internet lag.			"

												A CO-OP Bullethell-Pixel-RPG Game. Where you have to fight monsters, gods, run dungeons with varying of difficulty. The dungeons and gods can drop potions which boost your stats. These stats are eventually maxed when the player drinks enough potions. The dungeons can also drop gear which the player can either wear, store or sell to other players. To increase the difficulty, this game has perma death. This is when the player dies, he loses all the gear and stats the character had. This game is very addictive to people who like a challenge. Recently this game has been taken over from Kabam to DECA Games as Kabam were not making any progress into the game. Hopefully DECA Games would restore the game back from the dead.Personally I enjoy the game as I find it fun and I am very addicted to it.			"

												While it may not look like it, I have spent thousands of hours in this game through other platforms such as Flash Projector and Browser versions. This game has had me addicted for the better part of 3 and a half years. While this game is extremely difficult and rage inducing, it is also incredibly fun and addicting.On the other hand, this game is very P2W (Pay to win). You start off having one character slot to make 1 of 14 classes and a single vault chest that holds 8 items that will not be lost upon death. It is almost necessary to purchase more vault chests and character slots as you begin to get better at the game. Not to mention pets. Once you have leveled up your pet, (Common -> Uncommon -> Rare -> Legendary -> Divine), it is virtually impossible to get past a maxed legendary pet without dropping some cash into this game. That being said, your pet, vault chests, and character slots cannot be taken from you, and will be on your account forever.Overall, this game is hard to get into, but offers some incredible game play that can last you for years.

This is one of my favorite games and i do not plan on quitting any time soon. People are saying ""UGH this game is pay to win!!"" while it is not at all, if you know the enemy patterns and how much damage they do then it's pretty damn easy to get good!

												This is the only game I have played more than 400 hours in my life. And I don't regret it.This game has quite a lot replayability, since you don't have any actual purpose except beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of every moving thing and getting better equipment. Gameplay is simple and fun and you don't need GTX 10800 and things like that to play.And this has perma-death system, you have to start over all that fun getting good equipment so it may not get boring. It can be depressing sometimes if you lose a character with weeks spent in it, but remember that they are just pixelated things. Not your grandmom.Also the character customization is more comprehensive than you may think. It has many different skins for each class and dyes and clothes to personalize your characters looks.Overall Realm of the Mad God is fun game to play and ""waste"" hours in it.

												After reading all the negative reviews of ROTMG, I was just inspired to throw in some positive input. I've had mostly good experiences with ROTMG, but I have to admit that it does fall short in some places.Okay, so you're looking to play ROTMG? Here's a few reasons why it's one of my favorite games:PROS- Many classes to choose from- Vault with 1 chest free to store all those staffs, swords, daggers, wands, bows, armors, robes, rings, potions and pet eggs- Guild (clan) system- Awesome dungeons with epic loots (dangerous dungeons means better loot, obviously)- Nice quest system- Excellent community- Great to play with friends, or solo and meet some awesone people along the way- Rewarding- NPC companions (pets)- Permadeath gives an element of adrenaline and intensity (when you're 2 hits away from dying and you press the escape button just in time, you really do breathe a sigh of relief)- Excellent trading system- Constant changing environment in the nexus (winter = snow, halloween themes etc.)- Devs who care and listen to the community (most of the time)CONS- Permadeath means that you lose all the loot in your inventory, as well as your entire character (stats, armors, rings, you name it)- P2W, kind of.- Very, very, VERY ADDICTIVEYou start out in the nexus at level 1, with certain base stats and items (according to your class). Then you enter a realm. Starting at the beach, you kill some weak enemies until you reach a higher level, and move further inland as you level up. At level 20, it's good to move to the Godlands (found in the centre of the map, many powerful enemies called gods drop some nice loot). Items are bartered/bought with potions that increase your stats (usually defence pots/ life pots as they are the most valuable). There's no better feeling than killing a god/boss and finding epic loot, and then selling it/equipping it and looking like a badass.Yes, ROTMG is a F2P game, and yes, it is kind of P2W. But that being said, all in-game items can be found/traded without real money (Just takes a lot of time). The real money comes in when you need ""Realm Gold"" to buy more chests/ character slots, or when you're buying skins/cloth to make your character look like the badass you are. But that is NOT a necessity. If you've go the money, then sure, you'll be a legend in ROTMG in no time. But if not, then you will still become a legend in ROTMG, eventually (and with a LOT of grinding, blood, sweat, tears, heartbreak and perseverance).The worst part of ROTMG (or any permadeath game, for that matter) is DYING. Try spending a weekend grinding your favorite wizard, finding great loots and trading some for stat potions, and maxing most stats (6/8, for example [The 8 stats being defence, speed, dexterity, wisdom, vitality, attack, life and mana]), and then being charged and shotgunned in an Abyss of Demons and dying instantly without a chance to excape to the Nexus. Yeah, crappy, right? I think what makes ROTMG so addictive is the fact that if you survive, you earn awesome loot, and if you don't, well then you lose awesome loot. It's that simple.I think of ROTMG as being a 5 step never-ending cycle, if you will.1. Happy, enjoying the serenity of levelling up and finding some basic items to keep your character alive.2. Excitement. Finding great loot and trading with others for their great loot. Chilling in the godlands and finding stat potions, slowly increasing your stats.1 week later...3. Absolute thrill. Maxed some stats, rocking in the hard dungeons. Enjoying wrecking enemies within the calamity of events and hard, hard, dangerous dungeon bosses. SEXY SEXY loot.4. Dying. Hearing the DUM DUM DUUUUUUUMMMM of the death drum. Heart beating fast, in denial. Looking at your graveyard results and thinking ""No way. No way no way no way no way.""5. Shedding a tear, ragequitting ROTMG, exitting Steam and going to the library to find a new book to read. Thinking of taking up piano lessons.Repeat.After 50 hours of wrecking enemies, you really establish a close bond with your character. And to be completely honest with you, seeing your character die with good loot is like watching your cat get driven over by a car, and thinking, ""I shouldn't have let her out in the first place.""Oh yeah, and you begin to think of yourself as reckless and stupid, especially after those close death calls. Pheeeeeeew. But lucky for you, because that's when you know it's time to go take a shower or something (breaks are RARE, it's that addictive). You pretty much only take breaks after those close calls. All of that aside, ROTMG really is a great game. I would recommend this game to YOU. Yes, you. 8/10 ♥ I hope you're ready to spend your Friday nights (and Saturdays, Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and even Thursdays) playing ROTMG. See you in the realm.			"

												RotMG is a very unique MMO. It manages to combine teamwork, bullet hell, and dungeon crawling in one neat package. Hope right in and watch as you quickly level up and gain power, then suddenly be killed and lose it all, then hop in again and get it all back! Server strain is a big issue, but as long as they aren't full you should be able to manage. Maxing out your class of choice is quite a challenge, and should keep you entertained for quite a while. The aforemented Mad God is also quite satisfying when you do get to attack it. The hilarity of watching a whole server scramble through his punishing dungeon is very memorable indeed.If I had to say what this games biggest flaw is, it would be the turn towards pay-2-win it has taken. This unfortuantely was not always a problem; realm gold (the game's premium currency) used to just be good for buying cosmetic dyes and pets, or extra storage space. Now, with all sorts of high-tier gear being offered for it, the game feels more hollow and less rewarding. The adventure is still there, but it seems redundant when you can bypass it with the wave of a credit card. This is what personally keeps me from getting back into the game (along with technical difficulties with connecting to my Kongregate account), but if you're fine with it, don't let me stop you! It's still a wonderful game, and i'd recommend at least giving it a shot. It's free, after all; what have you got to lose?			"

												Lacks much variability and thus may become boring and repetitive at times. Can be unfair and ridiculously challenging at times, even with decent equipment. Tutorial only teaches you only basic controls and then throws you out into the open world with little knowledge of what to do. The amount of in-game purchases they try to force down your throat is quite frankly astonishing. These flaws aside, it's an addicting; fun little game.			"

												Personally I enjoy this game despite all the reviews of this game telling it off. Spending money in this game is not required, but they definitly want you to feel like that. Kabam does not seem to be coming back to in my opinion one of their best games, which is really saddening because this game is great. Permadeath makes you want and care not to die and I do my part of rageing in this game but still it is very enjoyable. Whenever I quit due to a rough death I feel like coming back. I am a relatively new player though and have spent money on this game and I do feel the boundraries of paying and not. Still worth the time and it is still a FREE game at the base of it.			"

												Ah yes, isn't it fun to play a bit of games and get totally freaked out when you're about to die. Well, this is the game for you. It pictures 14 different classes (for now) and each one has a different abilities and statistics. You can play as the super sneaky rogue or the super tanky knight. You get to decide which role you play. There are many different enemies and you must know when to take risks or not. Pros:""Exciting"" 8-bit formatDifferent roles to playEasier gameplay in the middle of the realm for beginnerA lot of realmsCons:Some in-app purchases are totally not worth itThe fact that you have to start a new character when you dieSometimes a bit laggy and can affect gameplay "

												I enjoyed this one way more than I was expecting to, and so did everyone else who tried that game out (that I know of)What you have is a bullet hell MMO, the max level is 20, and is easy to reach within a short amount of time, after that, instead of exp you accumilate fame instead which can be used to buy a few in game items. And leveling up characters is how you unlock other classes, so you could play for a while before unlocking them all. It's just jolly good fun, really. Also when your character died, he's dead forever. Not that it matters since you can have another one up to the same point within the hour. it's free, so give it a go.			"

												I love this game. However, it definitely falls into the love it or hate it category. It is accurate to describe it as a bullet hell RPG. Some people can't get past the art style alone, but again that's something I love about it. There are 14 character classes, which gives quite a bit of variety. You can play the game absolutely free, but you can also support the game and go the easy way by doing micro transactions within the game itself for items or customization. Part of this game is dying, especially by being a little too greedy or picking a bad teleport to some random person on the map. However, the max character level is 20 and it is easy to get back up there from level 1 in an hour. There are different levels of items and each class has its own special ability item as well. There are also pets that you can find or buy to give you in game bonuses. I don't like all the changes they've made since I first started playing it, but I still love the game. It's a rare game that you can have a lot of fun with by yourself or with a group of friends or even with random strangers.			"

												If you don't mind dying....like, a LOT, and if you like old Gauntlet-esque ""bullet-hell"" type of games, then this is the game for you. Even though you WILL die, and lose high-level stuff quite frequently, (this game has perma-death) it still has an addictiveness to it, that keeps us all coming back for more punishment. It's deceptively simple gameplay, enables a quick learning curve, while retaining difficulty, and replayability. After reaching a high level with one class, and farming the ""godlands"" for high-tier items, and stat potions, unlocking new classes to play as, that can use said items becomes the desired goal. The trading system in the game is also very addictive, and higher level players tend to give away high-tier items quite often. I've played over 80 hours, between my different accounts, and it's still quite enjoyable to me. That, couipled with the fact that it's free, makes this game a must-try for everyone.

												I highly recomend this game if you like dying a ♥♥♥♥♥on, losing all your stuff and having to replace your key board from pressing the Nexus hotkey so much. This game is enjoyable for all types of ragers. Please get this game a try it out! Before you max a character, just kill a worthless character first so you can know how it feels.			"

												After reading all the negative reviews of ROTMG, I was just inspired to throw in some positive input. I've had mostly good experiences with ROTMG, but I have to admit that it does fall short in some places.Okay, so you're looking to play ROTMG? Here's a few reasons why it's one of my favorite games:PROS- Many classes to choose from- Vault with 1 chest free to store all those staffs, swords, daggers, wands, bows, armors, robes, rings, potions and pet eggs- Guild (clan) system- Awesome dungeons with epic loots (dangerous dungeons means better loot, obviously)- Nice quest system- Excellent community- Great to play with friends, or solo and meet some awesone people along the way- Rewarding- NPC companions (pets)- Permadeath gives an element of adrenaline and intensity (when you're 2 hits away from dying and you press the escape button just in time, you really do breathe a sigh of relief)- Excellent trading system- Constant changing environment in the nexus (winter = snow, halloween themes etc.)- Devs who care and listen to the community (most of the time)CONS- Permadeath means that you lose all the loot in your inventory, as well as your entire character (stats, armors, rings, you name it)- P2W, kind of.- Very, very, VERY ADDICTIVEYou start out in the nexus at level 1, with certain base stats and items (according to your class). Then you enter a realm. Starting at the beach, you kill some weak enemies until you reach a higher level, and move further inland as you level up. At level 20, it's good to move to the Godlands (found in the centre of the map, many powerful enemies called gods drop some nice loot). Items are bartered/bought with potions that increase your stats (usually defence pots/ life pots as they are the most valuable). There's no better feeling than killing a god/boss and finding epic loot, and then selling it/equipping it and looking like a badass.Yes, ROTMG is a F2P game, and yes, it is kind of P2W. But that being said, all in-game items can be found/traded without real money (Just takes a lot of time). The real money comes in when you need ""Realm Gold"" to buy more chests/ character slots, or when you're buying skins/cloth to make your character look like the badass you are. But that is NOT a necessity. If you've go the money, then sure, you'll be a legend in ROTMG in no time. But if not, then you will still become a legend in ROTMG, eventually (and with a LOT of grinding, blood, sweat, tears, heartbreak and perseverance).The worst part of ROTMG (or any permadeath game, for that matter) is DYING. Try spending a weekend grinding your favorite wizard, finding great loots and trading some for stat potions, and maxing most stats (6/8, for example [The 8 stats being defence, speed, dexterity, wisdom, vitality, attack, life and mana]), and then being charged and shotgunned in an Abyss of Demons and dying instantly without a chance to excape to the Nexus. Yeah, crappy, right? I think what makes ROTMG so addictive is the fact that if you survive, you earn awesome loot, and if you don't, well then you lose awesome loot. It's that simple.I think of ROTMG as being a 5 step never-ending cycle, if you will.1. Happy, enjoying the serenity of levelling up and finding some basic items to keep your character alive.2. Excitement. Finding great loot and trading with others for their great loot. Chilling in the godlands and finding stat potions, slowly increasing your stats.1 week later...3. Absolute thrill. Maxed some stats, rocking in the hard dungeons. Enjoying wrecking enemies within the calamity of events and hard, hard, dangerous dungeon bosses. SEXY SEXY loot.4. Dying. Hearing the DUM DUM DUUUUUUUMMMM of the death drum. Heart beating fast, in denial. Looking at your graveyard results and thinking ""No way. No way no way no way no way.""5. Shedding a tear, ragequitting ROTMG, exitting Steam and going to the library to find a new book to read. Thinking of taking up piano lessons.Repeat.After 50 hours of wrecking enemies, you really establish a close bond with your character. And to be completely honest with you, seeing your character die with good loot is like watching your cat get driven over by a car, and thinking, ""I shouldn't have let her out in the first place.""Oh yeah, and you begin to think of yourself as reckless and stupid, especially after those close death calls. Pheeeeeeew. But lucky for you, because that's when you know it's time to go take a shower or something (breaks are RARE, it's that addictive). You pretty much only take breaks after those close calls. All of that aside, ROTMG really is a great game. I would recommend this game to YOU. Yes, you. 8/10 ♥ I hope you're ready to spend your Friday nights (and Saturdays, Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and even Thursdays) playing ROTMG. See you in the realm.			"

												Frantic, flashy and fun. This game tests your relfexes and skills as you make your way through the realm of the mad god. The aim: The aim of the game is to level up, accumulate loads of fame, and to defeat Oryx the mad god. Likes: I love this game because it's fun and a good challenge, it's also surprisingly fun to play with a friend. The guild system is well designed, and easy to use/run. Dislikes: While their are a few faults with the game there are _ main problems. Number 1: It's very flashy and in your face, especially in the Godlands, so if you've got epilepsy, I wouldn't advise going to the godlands if you want to get this game. Number 2: You have to pay to get anywhere in this game. Summary: Overall I'd reccomend this game, but only if you're willing to pay a little bit. There done.			"

You spend 20 minutes grinding to the point where it's actually kind of fun and challenging, and then sometimes within 5 minutes of that, you die, lose everything, completely reset, and you're back to having to grind with a new character. What's worse is the death is almost always do to a massive lag spike caused by the server dumping everyone into a final boss battle before resetting the map. This game takes almost zero skill, just luck and endless patience.			"

												Permadeath game warning!  If you die, you have to start over with the lowest equipment and at level 1.Realm of the Mad God is a game of skill, if you can't develop the skills to play this, you may not enjoy this game.With all that said, RotMG is one of the most addicting games I have ever played.  It is simple yet elegant in design.  Start on the beach and work your way towards the center of Oryx's realm where the strongest monsters dwell.  Along the way you will face a constant stream of monsters, all of whom are intent on turning you into their next meal.  There are quests of varying difficulty, some you can solo but others you may need to gang up on with your fellow adventurers.The combat is point-and-click.  You aim and fire with your mouse, use spacebar for your special ability and you move with WADSQ.  There are 14 classes to choose from, each with it's own special ability and stat cap.You start at level 1, and can reach level 20 in a short amount of time.  Then the game really begins.  The gods in godlands have a chance of dropping potions which can raise one of your stats by 1 point.  The goal here is to max your stats to increase your damage output, defenses and regeneration ability.  The stat potions not found in the godlands can be found in dungeons dropped by the gods or by some of the quest events.  There are 8 stats in all, which you can potentially max.Equipment can be found everywhere.  From the lowlands to the godlands you will find gear of increasing strength.  Delving into the dungeons, you will find even more powerful equpment.  Equipment, Skill and stats are the 3 most important things when playing this game.Once certain requirements are met, Oryx(the antagonist in this game) will seal the Realm and summon all players to his castle in order to wipe you out once and for all.  Will he succeed?  That's up to you.When you first play this game, you will have 7 days to buy into a very good deal.  +2 character slots and +3 vault chests, as well as 2600 gold(+5 chests is recommended) and a penguin pet.  It is recommended that you use a spare email address to make a test account directly on the website realmofthemadgod.com (not on steam), to see if you like the game.  If you like it, either continue to play through the website or make a Steam account.  Having multiple character slots and vault chests available really helps because of the permadeath nature of this game.  You can stock up spare equipment and stat pots in the chests and you can play multiple classes when you have more character slots.  They have sales on character slots and vault chests relatively often, and those are the only things you'd want to spend money on..everything else is a waste because it is either consumable or will die with your character(backpacks are worth getting even though they die with you).  Don't bother with the Steam DLC pack, it's not worth it.I play this game almost exclusively(through the website).  It's a lot of fun and is a near-continuous adrenaline rush.  I'll reiterate, this is a game of skill and is not for everyone.  Be sure to try it before investing your time and money into it.			"
