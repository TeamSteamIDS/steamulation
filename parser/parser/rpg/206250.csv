												I own this for the PSP Vita and PC, i have well over 1k+ hours dumped into the game over the years, It's an extremely replayable top-down rpg with the combat system being very akin to the 2d Zelda games, You compose your party from characters you create in the tavern, you can make them look however you want with the in game editor that is easy to use but very detailed, this editor is also available to make your own gear skins to apply to items gathered while slaying monsters or looting chest. There are Many jobs to choose from, base jobs as well as a few unlockable ones.You're allowed to Reclass after you reach a certain point in the game, when you choose another jobyou retain all abilities/magic, ''Magic circles'' and a fraction of your stats, There are 3 dungeon modes.Story mode, Ran-Geon ''Random dungeon'' and Tri-Geon ''Triple Dungeons''  (Ran/Tri are both randomised Multi Floored dungeons) Really basic summation of the game, It's worth its ''Steep'' price in my opinion IF you have the option to get it on the PSP/VITA over PC do so, But if PC is your only platform then it's no big deal, it's just as responsive as the handhelds and emulated great as well. Thank you for taking your time to read the review, and good luck!			"

												Don't let the playtime fool you- the mojority of time I spent playing this game was in offline mode, so about 100~ hours are missing there.Cladun X2 is a game made for those who love customization.  Want to smack enemies with a giant wooden spoon?  Go for it.  Want to play as one of your favorite RPG characters?  If you can sprite art it, sure.  Add along the fact that levels and dungeons go to an obscenely high number (same guys who made Disgaea, of course this is going to happen,) this is not a game you will get bored of quickly.it does have one major flaw though- this is a PSP port, and the wonky controls show that immediately.  You would think that a game that prides itself on customization would allow you to change the controls.Another flaw is this does NOT allow you to transfer any of your art or data from the PSP game itself, so if you're buying this a second time you will be starting over from scratch.All in all, if you can get past the odd controls and you're a sucker for replay/customization, this is the game for you.

												RPG with zelda combat and oodles of customization. The game is easy to learn, difficult to master with some pretty complex character customization. And of course it has the trademark NIS grind.Overall a pretty enjoyable game, though the port kind of sucks. It's at the native resolution (it's a psp game so yeah...) has some issues in controller configuration (it took me half an hour to figure why buttons weren't binding...), and is locked at 30fps. If you don't mind the graphics it'll be fun until it gets repetitve. Your mileage will vary on that; the regular dungeons mix things up pretty well, but if you do the randomly generated dungeons they seem to be quite similar most of the time and get old. Nothing like Disgaea's item world at all.			"

												Such a cool concept. Customize the visual style of every character and weapon in a pixel paintshop and explore randomly generated dungeons, constantly upgrading your skills by expanding little game boards (ala the zodiac in FFXII) that can be switched on the fly for different challenges, and where other characters you've created can be slotted in to support the one character you control at any given time. Combat is a little tight, with awkward hit boxes that don't really emulate Link to the Past or Seiken Denetsu type combat, and takes getting used to, but there's enough things that are unique that I recommend it as a action JRPG. Just probably not on PC.If you have the ability to play it on PS Vita, choose that. On PC, try the demo first and try it a few times, because this is the worst port of any game I've ever played and that includes wonky ROM translations. First, though it's a pixel art game, it gets less than 5 FPS on laptops with integrated graphics, the same laptops that can play Risk of Rain, Nuclear Throne, Hyperlight Drifter and so on without issue. Second, even on good hardware the game will suddenly seem to go off its timing so that there's a lag between your input and what's happening on screen. Sometimes it will just fail to load images and all you'll hear is music. Finally, and probably the worst of all, the game will randomly forget your controller mapping, and outright fail to recognize proper xinput from XBox controllers until you delete the settings and rebuild them, at which point it will recognize your controller again.It's unlikely the game will ever get any updates for PC, though sales are happening more frequently this last couple years and there really aren't that many games like this.

												JRPG lover? You want ACTION-Based RPG and not turn-based? Want the pixels? Love to grind? Don't care about the story? Want to customize your charater's appearance from top to bottom? Even if the story is lackluster and if you're in doubt if this game works, just give the demo a shot. A brief warning. This game is a PSP port and its' multiplayer features is not implemented fully at the moment because the PSP port's multiplayer works in ad-hoc mode (via playing locally). However, if you want a good JRPG game while your internet is screwed over, pick this game up immediately. People outside the JRPG realm?... Hard to say. There is a tutorial on it, but this game will not hold your hand once you get out of Trial Island which is more than enough for me.This game can easily fill in 20-40~ hours of gameplay AT THE LEAST. It can go more when you want to reach cap on 8~10 different characters (Level 99 is the cap)Oh, and not to forget to mention there's a Job Changer, so you can do the same grind, AGAIN! And max initial cap of any stat is 999. The universal cap is 9999. So I still got a longggggggggg way to go.The learning curve is steep when the ""Magic Circle"" system is into play. Basically, you can stack your sub-characters together with your main character (the one you physically play with), and the stats get transferred to your Main Character while special tiles like ""Growth"" will determine your Sub Character's Leveling Parameters. If this looks like rocket science to you, this may not be the game to pass up and if you want a simpler game, I will forward you to Binding of Isaac or Hack, Slash and Loot. Heck, even Desktop Dungeon (its free, and not on Steam). For a roguelike with a slightly higher learning curve, I recommend Dungeons of Dreadmor.In addition, I have a 4 1/2 hour stream of a first game impression by me if you want to check that out: http://www.twitch.tv/critical__hit/b/328931483JRPG Fans wanting a grind?

												Though just a bit too pricey for its kind in my opinion, it's one of the nicest RPGs I've seen on Steam, with nice character customization, a variety of weapons, and a lot of nice menu options, such as making a sort of ""aid"" with your other characters to increase your stats and defense.The only con, is that after a while it feels repetitive, and as such, it's hard to really get through if you feel such. But another plus, is that it always draws me back, and I always love playing it again, even if it's just a silly experience.Naturally, the controls flow well, and make it enjoyable to do everything, and with every citizen on the island, you'll have some nice dialogue, sometimes awkward, other times weird, but always nice.And all the classes are nice too.

												Overall, a pretty decent action RPG with a lot of depth to the mechanics. The game strongly rewards players who find the best ways to exploit its ""Magic Circle"" system, which allows you to line a party of helpers up to invisibly buff the player character. Being able to edit characters and equipment at the pixel-art level in-game is a fairly unusual feature that is also kind of neat.On the minus side, the translation and porting of the game lack polish. For one example, the game allows equipment to have up to four random ""titles"", but the names of those titles often bear only a passing resemblance to their functions, and no attempt is made to string them together into a name that makes sense in English -- maybe the titled names make more sense in Japanese? The occasional onomatopoeia is badly done to a baffling degree: a dog bark is written ""gow"" on several occasions. Huh?For another, the game's controller support is spotty. My XBox One controller works, but only if it's on when the game is launched. My wired 360 controller doesn't work at all.  In-game button prompts use button numbers 1-6 rather than A/B/X/Y/L/R. It's perfectly playable with a controller if you have a compatible one and translating the prompts doesn't bother you, though, and I recommend this if it works.If you can overlook the issues above, and give the game half an hour to start to open up all the mechanics, you will find a lot of RPG-mechanical depth there under the pixel-art graphics and wafer-thin plot. Unfortunately, stability issues I've run into lately on Windows 10 make it necessary to give the game a thumbs-down overall. This game is a sadly missed opportunity for the publisher IMHO.			"

												Similar to other NIS games there is a great deal of depth to the systems, and a huge amount of grinding potential. Characters are costumizable on a pixel by pixel bases as are weapons, though with limitations and it can take a considerable amount of time to perfect your chosen look as you may need to go through each sprite individually.Strangely you can also make music with the game, though it will take knowledge of how music is written...so i wasn't really able to delve into that. The in game Music is also excellent.Characters and Music can be imported, so thats neat.Combat is akin to jrpg beatemup dungeon crawlers à la Legend of Mana or Legacy of Goku.First It should be noted that I didn't like the hard edges everything in the game had, however this can be disabled in the menu and the game in my opinion becomes much much prettier, especially at fullscreen resolution. Text also can be changed to something softer, though the type setting is odd for some letters.Where I feel the game fell flat was the combat and supporting cast,Combat isn't as responsive as I'd like and the hit boxes can be a little questionable. Enemies also seem to either be too strong or stupidly weak and predictable. There are also some pacing issues I felt, and a great deal of the world and options are locked at the beginning of the game.As for the supporting characters they are written funnily enough, but they don't really grab your interest and have very little to say outside of cutscenes.  From what I got to play of the game I knew almost nothing about the world when I'd talk to villagers they'd just say ""go fight the dungeon even though we told you its pointless"" and you go do that over and over, it just felt hollow.Also because this is a port the default resolution is teeny tiny and while you can make it one setting larger the window cannot be resized by dragging it, and the fullscreen option is letter boxed and no bigger than the windowed on its second setting. I used Windows Magnifier to get a real fullscreen expirence, though I am sure there are more permenant solutions elsewhere.All and all it's decent but I won't be getting it after this free trial period ends.Have a good day and thanks for reading.

												An extremely fun little action rpg with good combat, and robust customization that allows you to not only edit your characters stats and abilities in depth, but even their appearance pixel by pixel.Control and combat wise, it's a top down action rpg, similar to Legend of Zelda visually and control wise. You can jump, you can block, you can slide, and you got a variety of abilities and weapon types at your disposal. There's even a decent amount of finesse and tricks you can do, like cancelling sword slashes into blockings and then jumping out of danger to save yourself, or buffering jumps into short jumping attacks. The enemies you face also have nice variety, and do a good job of remaining fairly unpredictable even after you've learned their fighting styles. Another thing I especially love, is that the game incorporates a subtle stealth element. Enemies won't start chasing and attacking you till they spot you, but once they do they'll chase you through the entire dungeon. Attempting to run from an enemy will cause you to rush by other enemies, who will also break into chase. This results in a frantic chase through the entire dungeon as you attempt to escape in time from the horde trying to corner you.For customization, you're allowed to create as many characters as you like, selecting jobs, weapons, and abilities. You strengthen their abilities and growth in certain areas by drawing on the strength of other characters you've created. Visually, you can edit weapons and characters (and even animation) of your characters pixel by pixel. Don't be daunted though, because the game uses a great template for creating fairly basic but still cute looking sprites. More artistic players can still create some great stuff though.The actual gameplay is basically divided into two games. You can make your way through the static progression of dungeons of the main campaign, which has decent level/dungeon design and is balanced well enough to not require any grinding. Alternatively, you can take on a massive 100 floor randomly generated dungeon, which feels more like a rogue like. I personally love the randomly generated dungeon, the way stealth, combat, traps, and preparation are balanced is fantastic. Unfortunately, enemies increase in level ridiculously fast as you proceed through the floors. Eventually your attacks will do 0 damage, so it's really quite impossible to clear the dungeon based on skill alone. While making it as far as you can and escaping with random rare loot (you lose everything if you die before making it to an exit), is plenty exciting and skillbased, it's still ultimately a long term process to clear it the entire dungeon itself.ClaDun X2 is still a fantastic game, plenty fun, and allows you to play and create your characters to suit your needs. I would highly recommend it for some hack and slash fun.			"

												This game plays VERY well for a hack and slash, theres a bazillion costumization and character advancement systems going on that give it a very familiar NIS feel, but isnt overbearing. For 20 bucks id say it heavily depends on how much you like hack and slash RPGs, as it is definitely pricey, but if you do see it go on sale do make sure to grab this gem. If it is not on sale, I would find it a bit hard to recommend, luckily for you though, there's a free demo.The music is decent, the combat feels smooth, and there are plenty of dungeon types and achievements to go for, from timed stages to more roguelike dungeons. And the idea is as classic and simple as it gets: You and dungeons with lots of monsters. Great to play in small breaks, still great to play for longer periods in one sitting. If you love retro RPGs, make sure you put this on your wishlist.			"

												THIS GAME WILL EAT YOUR SOUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! in a good way :DAnd by that, I mean it's an AMAZING RPG game!It not only has randomly generated dungeons, it also has ingame editors which allow you to make your own sprites for weapons, armors, characters and their animations, and also has a music editor so you can make your own music!Personally I LOVE the retro feel it has to it and how it feels somewhat like a super nintendo game. Did I mention randomly generated dungeons? Oh yea and there are two dungeon systems which the goal is to reach floor 99 with many twists and turns along the way to keep you entertained (watch out for Doom Gates, (you'll know what I mean when you find one))This game is a perfect PC ARPG game you can enjoy and is comparable to iOS/Android titles like Zenonia, Tales of Inotia, and Seed (at least in my opinion).

												I don't get what people are complaining about.Resolutions: PSP's native res, double the PSP's native res and Fullscreen. (Which is three times the PSP's resolution with black borders around) Double the native res is perfect, fullscreen is okay. 8bit/dot font should only be used in windowed modes.Controls: Alright, it's a bit confusing at first but it's NOWHERE near as bad as people make it out to be they work perfectly fine. Use QWE for menus, ASD for page scrolling and ZXC for the remaining stuff. Set the movement on the arrow keys. Combat controls: Q to select Magic, W to use it, E to open the Magic menu. A to attack, S for the Shield/Slide and D for running. C for Jumping.Works perfectly fine. P.S. the mouse works in menus so give it a try.Performance: Yes, it's locked at 30 FPS. There's a Vsync option but I haven't tried that yet since it's unavailable in Windowed mode. 30 FPS is what the game runs at on PSP and it plays just fine there. Some people say they're getting really low FPS for some reason. I'm on an i7 3520M (with an Intel HD 4000 integrated GPU) and the game only uses 5% of it. Never had any framerate drops. Localization: People complain about it. Seems perfectly fine. Some characters DO have an accent and such, y'know. And you should already know what a dog sounds like.Soundtrack: get the ♥♥♥♥ out sakuraba and uematsu, this is where it's at.That said, the game is extremely fun and addicting (had to test the performance, ended up playing for three hours and half) with deep and complex mechanics revolving around your characters' strengths and weaknesses. Plus you can customize the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything. You can even make your own music.Is it worth 19$/€ ? As a fan of dungeon crawlers and thus the original ClaDun.. Yes, definitely. As someone who isn't into the genre but doesn't mind trying ? Yes. For people who don't like the slightest bit of complexity or fun ? Definitely not. The game never goes on sale so don't bother waiting. Get it from ""those"" sites for like 7$/€ if you want to go cheap.			"

Not only is the action well designed for its genre but it is also complemented by the depth of the magic circle system and alternating main character gameplay.

												I love N1 games. The crazy amount that you can customize and upgrade your characters in their games is always so much fun. This game is no exception. This is basically an action based JRPG rougelike. If you enjoy dungeons, loot and fighting monsters, along with massive upgradability and customization to your characters and items check this game out.			"

												In RPG's, do you spend as much time staring at your equipment screen and min-maxing as you do grinding?In Rock Band, are you the guy spending more time making your band look like anime characters than actually playing the damn thing?If I'm right on either of those things, this game is for you like, twenty times over.Seriously, it will eat you alive.

												RPG that doesn't care about the story, all about combat, and that's actually something I like. But the skill system, for all it's depth, isn't enough to make the game fun. Combat is too dull, and no skill system, no matter how novel in concept, can keep this game from turning into a boring slog. Unless you REALLY like watching numbers get bigger, I'd pass on this.

												An extremely fun little action rpg with good combat, and robust customization that allows you to not only edit your characters stats and abilities in depth, but even their appearance pixel by pixel.Control and combat wise, it's a top down action rpg, similar to Legend of Zelda visually and control wise. You can jump, you can block, you can slide, and you got a variety of abilities and weapon types at your disposal. There's even a decent amount of finesse and tricks you can do, like cancelling sword slashes into blockings and then jumping out of danger to save yourself, or buffering jumps into short jumping attacks.The enemies you face also have nice variety, and do a good job of remaining fairly unpredictable even after you've learned their fighting styles. Another thing I especially love, is that the game incorporates a subtle stealth element. Enemies won't start chasing and attacking you till they spot you, but once they do they'll chase you through the entire dungeon. Attempting to run from an enemy will cause you to rush by other enemies, who will also break into chase. This results in a frantic chase through the entire dungeon as you attempt to escape in time from the horde trying to corner you.For customization, you're allowed to create as many characters as you like, selecting jobs, weapons, and abilities. You strengthen their abilities and growth in certain areas by drawing on the strength of other characters you've created. Visually, you can edit weapons and characters (and even animation) of your characters pixel by pixel. Don't be daunted though, because the game uses a great template for creating fairly basic but still cute looking sprites. More artistic players can still create some great stuff though.The actual gameplay is basically divided into two games. You can make your way through the static progression of dungeons of the main campaign, which has decent level/dungeon design and is balanced well enough to not require any grinding. Alternatively, you can take on a massive 100 floor randomly generated dungeon, which feels more like a rogue like.I personally love the randomly generated dungeon, the way stealth, combat, traps, and preparation are balanced is fantastic. Unfortunately, enemies increase in level ridiculously fast as you proceed through the floors. Eventually your attacks will do 0 damage, so it's really quite impossible to clear the dungeon based on skill alone. While making it as far as you can and escaping with random rare loot (you lose everything if you die before making it to an exit), is plenty exciting and skillbased, it's still ultimately a long term process to clear it the entire dungeon itself.ClaDun X2 is still a fantastic game, plenty fun, and allows you to play and create your characters to suit your needs. I would highly recommend it for some hack and slash fun.			"

												Spoiler alert- i will be going over several things about this game that you might want to just want to skip over if you wish to find out yourself.Gameplay- A solid 2D labryinth explorer with a few unique twists to it. Such as a ""Magic circle"" function which is basiclly used to give you some human sheilds that also improve specific stats based on the magic circle design.Story- This has me personally interested, although i hoped to beat this game before doing this review. Your essentially a prisoner trapped in a seperate dimension reserved for those who commit terrible crimes. The owner of this dimension enlists your help in exploring every labryinth within that dimension in order to reach a monster who dweals on the bottom floor. Spoiler alert, your the one who ends up making the creature, who can destroy the dimension your in and the world your from, wake up in the first place.Customization- This is so in depth i had to add it as a seperate category. When you start the game you have the limited options of naming yourself, picking a hair color/style, and changing skin color. However, very soon after that you will unlock your own peronal tavern. Within this tavern their are several functions including COMPLETE customization over your characters hair color, style, skin color, eye shape/color, mouth (if you want one that bad :P), and for some of the pros at it making equipment/helms. You can also have complete customization over your characters', yes characters you can make multiple characters for one save file,  weapons and armor, however until you unlock a special function further in the game you need the equipment in question to have a customization ""Title"" (Its really more like an enchantment).Overall score- 9/10I really love this game, but their are a few tweaks here and there that i personally think could make this game much better. However, i'm sure that, despite those flaws, many people will have as much enjoyment with this game as i have had.			"

												Where do I start? Well, first off the game is really really well done. There's TONS of customizations for your character, armor, weapons, and classes. I would honestly reccomend this game if it worked on the PC but, whenever I play for about 30 - 45 minutes, the game crashes on me. The game lacks an autosave feature which makes putting hours into customization or grinding pretty much pointless once the game crashes. CladunX2 is also on the PSP and also has a spiritual sucsessor called Legasista which is for the PS3 which probably works better then this pile of dissapointing mush.			"

												ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh okay look, this game ""was"" fun like idk 3 years ago when I first got steam. Now that being said its a really amazing concept to a game. You can make your own music and heros, weapons, etc. But the graphics are so out of date it feels meh. Not only that but youll find yourself playing the same dungeons over and over. Make a dang dungeon editor or something ah... I like it but I dont love it and I do recommend trying it. I just wish the game had more with the huge list of features this game could have had.			"

												I really enjoyed this game but it is hard to recommend this game at $20 because it is missing so many Steam features.  Adding Steam cloud dropping the price to $10 would make this an easy recommend.This game has a steep learning curve but once you learn how to play the game, it is a lot of fun.It is too bad NIS America used this game and Clan of Champoins to test how their games will sell on Steam.

												Create a group and play through a story or randomly generated dungeons. Interesting party system where your party members support you with increased stats or abilities while you only have to play as one character. You can level your characters and class change them anytime to create the team you want. Lots of different items to allow you to customise your character even more. The combat is quick and easy to learn allowing you to jump right in and have fun.			"

												An old school RPG with new features, Cladun X2 brings a definite retro feel in gaming. While using the tried and true method of more action-oriented RPGs (such as Secret of Mana), Cladun X2 allows you to use other created characters to bolster HP, defense, attack, or even experience gains. The ability to redraw characters faces, hair, armor and weapons gives and characters you make a personal feel, and each class offered has a unique draw. The downside is the story, leaving much to be desired. It starts well, the premise and plot not only flow well, but the characters feel unique in their own way . The major problem was I could not find one character or conversation that felt engaging in the slightest. I won't even mention the online features considering I couldn't find anyone else using it. Overall, the gameplay is fun, but don't come looking for a mind blowing story.			"
