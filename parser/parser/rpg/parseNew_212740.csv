												With unique combat system, that, with very low targetting, it's rather tempting. It's not like WoW or RIFT - where you have to click or tab on a player and cast spells, or skills, or whatever spells/skills are called in each game. Instead, you're just spamming your skills as you quest or kill some players.The graphics are awesome too. Which even doubles the ""want to play""One small downside, is the FPS drops. You won't notice it while you're questing, but while doing some max-level stuff, you'll notice the FPS drops quite alot. But heck, it's a good game afterall!			"

Game had quality, Gameforge never had anyHave been playing this game since Nightforge patch and no other game could replace it for me so far. Gameplay mechanics are extremely satisfying both in PvP and PvE and the game looks impressive graphics-wise as well. I'd Give this game a 9/10 without hesitation (one point off mostly because of optimization issues). But why a negative review? Well I rate two things in this review, the game (9/10 = 90%) and the company behind Tera EU servers (0/10 = 0%).Middle ground leaves me with no choice but to leave a negative review.I am still being very generous with my rating though, considering that the game has been slowly slipping into death row after the ""noob friendly"" gender locked classes were being thrown out one after another, useless patches with insanely high growing gear stats (+15 patch included) and at this stage PvP balance control is quite beyond the reach of Bluehole studios. I'd pay good money to play vanilla Tera, with a proper publisher of course :^)Not going to talk about ""Costumes"" and ""Elins"" because this topic triggers majority of Tera players, but I do genuinely suggest looking up images or videos regarding both keywords I mentioned so you know what kind of content you are signing up for, so you don't get disowned by your parents.So tl;dr Would I recommend playing this game? Hell yeah. But play the NA version, or at least contrast Enmasse(NA Tera) to Gameforge(EU Tera) with a little research. [It's even worth sacrificing your latency to avoid experiencing Greedforge]I stopped playing Tera half a year ago because majority of my friends whom I play with bailed and never plan to come back. But I do believe the points I mentioned are still quite relevant to current version of the game, after paying it a visit. "

												Before I say anything else, I'll say this...Stay away from GAMEFORGE!TERA used to be one of the best action MMOs out there back when it was released, but since then a lot of new games have come out that are way better in both content and quality AND the fact that they're not released by one of the worst publishers in the world. Everything else aside, only because of this reason, I do not recommend playing EU version of TERA, at least not until the publisher is changed.UPDATE: (to answer some of the comments and provide some more reasons for my opinion)First, even though my playtime on Steam shows only 2.8hrs, I actually spent about 5 months playing TERA through GF launcher, so I have a lot more insight into the game and GF wrongdoings then is visible here.Second, reason why I think people should avoid any game published by GF is because how they (don't) treat their customers and their published games. Anyone that played AION (and now TERA) knows how both games were in a much better state when they were initially launched and how GF seemed to really care about everything they're doing. However, for the past 3-5 years, something changed within GF that made them become extremely greedy and totally oblivious to both product quality and customer satisfaction. If you ever had to interact with their custommer support, forum moderators or people in their live-streams, you are basically met with either total silence or (at best) minimal generic responses that don't provide any value. Compared to NA version, TERA EU is lacking a lot, like less available and more expensive items in the shop, a lot of issues with servers, GMs having too much power (banning players for stupid reasons), their customer care is so bad that it can take up to a month for them to respond to critical issues, communication between GF and community is almost impossible, when you buy TERA Thallers in the shop there's 50% chance you won't receive them or you get less, and if you complain, there's a great chance they'll blame you for all sorts of reasons. Also, there was a scandal with so called ""gold sellers"" in both TERA and AION. Apparently there are proofs that GF themselves were doing it! Just for the record, either I personaly or my close friends experienced all of these directly.To sum this up, even though TERA (and all other games published by GF) are some of the best ones available today, I can not recommend EU version published by GameForge because of all previously stated reasons.

												STAY AWAY FROM GAMEFORGE.One of the most cancerous publishers I've ever encountered in all my gaming years. They have no trouble whatsoever with breaking the game just to make a buck and when players speak up against them they censor and ban them to prolong their shady ways as much as they can. They even changed their name back in the day because they were so burned, remember Frogster? Yeah... just google and you'll find a million stories around their bad rep.Game itself is nice, just play on NA with EnMasse, even if you're EU, ping there is not game breaking at all and its a much better game.

												It's going to be F2P next week, so there is actually no reason not to play it. It is, after all, the MMORPG with the best Combatsystem (and the most beautiful as well... especially the Castanics. If you know what I mean. ;) ). It's more like a Hack n Slash with one of the Melee Classes. lol.I can only recommend checking it out if you are into MMORPGs./edit 06.02.2017This recommendation is from January 2013, so take it with a grain of salt. I don't know how it is now, what gameforge changed and if it's good for those who play it without spending a dime. Back then, however, I couldn't really complain. I always thought that Gameforge did a decent job with the game (before and after it went F2P for the few month I kept playing before I got back into GW2). My view on the game might be a bit biased though. I always had veteran status on my account after it went F2P, hence hardly any limitations (it was more or less the same game I played the month before, just without subsciption) so I had only the usual negative stuff to say about it. That was...OptimizationThe game ran poorly when a lot was going on on screen, but that is more or less normal for MMORPGs. There is always♥♥♥♥♥♥performance even on high-end rigs. Unsurprisingly this seems to be still the case.Elin CensorshipThis always bugged me because it was done poorly. With no taste at all. In hindsight I think the changes were unnecessary. There were some other korean MMORPGs or games in general which got a western release which had childlike characters showing just as much skin and no one was crying about it.I just wanted to update this, because there were 2 comments from people who didn't see that this recommendation is 4 years old.

												Okay so... Steam is giving out the download for the GameForge company's version of TERA (Where I believe it was previously the EnMasse version - which got removed for some reason). Difference between them is that GameForge is the EU company for TERA and EnMasse is the NA company for it.Even if you live in the EU (which I do), I do not believe that the GameForge version (downloadable from steam right now) of TERA is worth the features and prices of microtransactions involved. This may be my opinion, but I have played both versions of TERA before that I downloaded from their respective websites before Steam had either of the versions in their store.What I was capable of, in going through the GameForge version of TERA is that I managed 3 characters only getting to levels 10-20 before I found out that there were no GMs and barely any support, being more of a self learning experience as there were not many veteran players who were willing to assist you for long. Something left out of the GameForge TERA is that there were supposed to be guidelines for where the sort of ""super"" attacks that enemies do after their eyes glow red, which would have helped you dodge the attack. Even though people may think that a guidline of their attack would make the game too ""easy"", it does not. If you were faced with even a normal BAM (Big A** Monsters) in the late game (for example Teraliths or Orisks) and you did not know what sort of attack they were going to do after their eyes glow red, there is a high chance that your health bar WILL deplete, possibly even from 100% to 0 with how strong BAMs get.As for the EnMasse version of TERA. Although it is my personal opinion, I believe that this is the more maintained and developed company for running TERA, with the GMs and support present from the large player base - which is especially dense in large cities). GMs and Store Costs are the main point of this review (despite the talk of damage indicators) as there are barely any GMs on in GameForge servers and there are somewhat higher store costs at the same time compared to EnMasse servers.For Ratings on GameForge Tera;Gameplay - 7/10 (still a nice gameplay as it is identical to EnMasse, excluding the damage indicators just gone)Graphics - 8/10 (really nice graphics for the anime-design style mmorpg it is)Story - 6/10 (I never really paid too much attention to the plot of the game, something about saving the world :'P)Customisability  - 10/10 (Lots of customising options for the looks of your character when creating and with costumes in-game, however not so sure if the level up prizes are given end game in GameForge servers - some presets looks are shown when creating characters)Options in-game - 9/10 (able to adjust lots of options, the exact same as the EnMasse TERA. However I found a problem instantly with it's ""Windowed (Fullscreen)"" option of how the window of TERA is portrayed where it does not take my laptop screen completely and just trails off to the left of my screen, nowhere near attaching itself to the corners of my laptop screen)Community - 3/10 (Lmao... what community)Overall - 7/10 - Decent game however, if you were play TERA, I would strongly suggest getting it off the website of EnMasse instead of off of Steam or off of the GameForge website.

												I have played TERA EU for a while, even before it landed on Steam. I have maxed 7 characters so far, and I can honestly say that this is one of top MMORPGs ATM. I will back for sure to play the latest Valkyrie class in 2 weeks!Pros:+ Beautiful scenic world;+ Decent graphics, even now;+ 7 Races, most of them are typical for MMOs, but visually are still awesome;+ Whopping 13 classes (Valkyrie included);+ Real action fighting system, this is not just about pressing 1, 2, 3, and KILL. It is refreshing. You have to dodge, run, position properly, protect, counter, hit with proper timings, etc.+ End Game became MORE convenient than before, you got daily quests, dungeons, raids, tournaments, PvP, GvG, etc.+ End Game gears, the essentials are EASY to get. You do not have to spend A LOT of time to actually reach a decent level in the game. You can get +12 gears in like a week if you know what to do.+ Mounts, you can ride, you can soar (limited for certain areas, but you can);+ Pets, they are adorable;+ Free starter pack for the Steam users (Welcome Gift)------------------------------------Cons:- Optimisation, mostly for mobile devices like laptops. Here this game hurts mostly.- If you are stylish, then you will pay... A LOT!!! OR- You will spend A LOT of time on farming gold.- Pay2Win? NAAH... but it takes MUCH MUCH longer to get TOP of the TOP (+15 gears).- Hard Mode Dungeons in most cases ONLY for TOP gears and/or skills, BUT rewarding once you reach the necessary level of EQ/skill.------------------------------------I would dare to say that I am a veteran, because I actually played the game before devs added those nowadays fancy convenient ways of getting end game gears and ways of unchanting them to +12. In my times, most people had only +9 EQ at most with poor tier as well. To get top gear you had to be a member of guild and actually conquer dungeons to get the equipment. Afterwards, you had to farm A LOT in specific dungeons to get necessary items for enchantment. When I mean A LOT, this really means A LOT. Repetative grinding for even months. Today? Couple dungeons and you get it like it is not a big deal.People cries about GameForge, about how bad they are, about how greedy they are, about how much they want to rip off some money from you by placing horrendous prices in the IS. Some people even say that this game is Pay2Win... and this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!!! If someone said that, then obviously he/she has not spent enough time in the game and even did not bother to discover PROPER ways.The IS is OPTIONAL. The IS does not have a mayor influence on the gameplay! Meanwhile I can agree that the IS sells enchantment items which may boost your EQ faster than usual from +12 to +15, but this is all you can get. Mostly the IS consists of stylish items like costumes, pets, and mounts, BUT again these you can get as well by playing the game.			"

												After waiting many years Tera is finally on steam. I started with Tera around 5 years ago and i was hoping for it to come on steam ever since.When they announced it i was super excited.They kept changing the dates for it to come on steam to a point i gave up hoping... but after like a year or 2 it finally arrived.I was loading up Tera and then..... Can't login because Gameforge....! UghI was so disappointed that i couldn't play on my own account.There are 2 of the same Tera's. Enmasse and Gameforge. And sadly enough i had the wrong one. -.-After another year i can finally play on my own Tera account.The game hasn't changed much except that Gameforge started spoiling us with gifts to get their players back to the game. However Gameforge always been the worst publishers in the world, treating their players bad, not listening to them and only wanting your money and making things extremely overpriced.Gameforge always been a very greedy company! It always been about the money and not about their players.It will take a while to fix all their mistakes and gain the trust back from their players.Unlike others that say the game is dead i personally do think it is working. Many of the old players give Tera a second chance now it's on steam again and so am i.The game is absolutely stunning, however some parts look outdated.The combat system is great and there are many things for you to do in the game.A main story-line to follow, Side quests, Instances, Dungeons, Crafting, Gathering, PvP & PvE. Your choices on what to do is almost endless.Customization works great and I personally love the classes and races.As a beginner you might get lost and think it is complicated... To be honest after playing it for years i still haven't even figured out everything lol.TERA is beautiful to see and explore, and exciting to play.If you like MMORPGs you should give it a try since it's definitely one of the best in its genre.It does have some flaws but the overall experience is great.I do recommend the game! I'm just not so sure if i recommend the Gameforge version (yet). Maybe they have changed, but it is too soon to say anything about that.So far it looks promising! This has nothing to do with the game itself.The Enmasse Tera is on steam too but it is region locked so you can't play it on steam.However you can go to their website and download it there.Tera would say: Now more than ever, They need strong defenders... Like you! Go forth soldier, and bring us victory for Valkyon! ♥ "

												If you're looking for a good mmorpg, come to TERA.The graphics, the combat and the the community, including the staff are all amazingFirst off, the graphics. They're just gorgeous; Running through the map while having a look around is quite enjoyable, the attack graphics are also quite well-done, especially on the magical classes attacks, such as the Sorcerers attacks (not going to spoil any attacks, sorry ;l )The combat is relatively easy to get into and the various classes offer a variety of different gameplay experiences, the only thing i'd say is bad regarding classes is some of them are race and/or gender locked, such as the brawler which can only be used by human females.. Aside from that though, there are a few all-race/gender classes to play as.The community is pretty cool, i've only experienced a small amount of the Yurian server (German server) population but they're pretty friendly people and english is spoken to a point where it's a prevalant language in the server. The Staff are pretty friendly people, I sent a support ticket and within 1 working day it was replied to. (A side note, monday to friday are working days, from what i've heard)The only cons in my opinion is the giant hard drive requirement of the game. I know that can turn some people away from it.. It can also be rather demanding with your PC's hardware, depending on what hardware you have installed. The TERA veteran system can be a bit of a pain too, if you're not a Veteran, you only have two character slots compared to I think 8 if you are a VeteranOverall, I would highly recommend TERA, it's a good game, albeit with some minor flaws, but as the saying goes, nothing's perfectRating: 8.7/10			"

												Don't take my 0.1 hrs into consideration, I've played 250+ hours on the old steam vatiant (no longer available, check my profile for proof) and well over 800 hours on the official EnMasse client.TL:DR is at the bottomMany here are saying that its not recommended due to gameforge and its P2W factor, and I've got to agree, I do not recommend the gameforge variant (which comes from the steam install and from the gameforge website), though the game itself is awesome and I've still yet to spend a dime on this game. I've downloaded it from the official EnMasse website and unlike gameforge, its not pay2win what so ever.The game itself is awesome with great graphics, and a nice community (from what ive encountered over the 1200+ hours ive spent on here) and classes and races are really fun to play and its up to you how you want to play it. Gear and weaponry can be obtained from drops or the broker using ingame currency (gold) and the only thing that may require in real life money is if you want to look pretty and buy outfits, but with enough gold you can buy those off of other people in the broker. so technically its not pay to win, if you get the EnMasse version.TL:DR: Download TERA from the Official EnMasse website, not from steam or gameforge.Hope this was useful			"

												I have played this game big time when it just came out and loved it because it reminded me of Lineage 2.Than they introduced the first ""Female Elin only class"" which i could live with, though class/race restrictions to only 1 class/race are stupid as hell. I stopped playing close to when the next new class was announced, which again was a female only Castanic/High Elf class. At least you could ""choose"" between 2 races for this new class, but i saw the trend and quit.As i forgot all about it, i tried it again once i saw this appear on Steam only to see they have added 2 more female only clacces, one for Elin and one for Human. So if you are ok with playing race/female restriced classes on mass, you may enjoy this game, because everything new added to the game will most certainly be female only and 1 race only, as EVERY SINGLE new class is restricted to female and a specific race.It also does not help that this game has a very unbalanced cash shop which could be labled as Pay2Win.

												Considering I've played this since CBT I must say this version of the game is a massive letdown.First of all this is run by a money grabbing company called Gameforge, now when I first started on this version of steam I was hopeful with a openmind but after maxing my level and meeting the end game commuinty I can't recommend this game. Everyone is so negitive and prefer to play solo so making a clan and progressing that way is near impossible.Moving on to the pop of the severs..Hmmm, this is a hard one.. Throughout the entire game I saw little amounts of people afk around spawn areas along with some high level **** trying to PK anyone who hit level 20+ Kinda stupid.. besides that as you progress you do mean bigger clusters of people and the game stops feeling so dead and bland, least you have 100+ NPC talking to you.. Thinnk postive.Combat is flawless.Leveling is easy.. Just need to know what your doingCrafting is deep..Loads of events and little things to keep you latched onto the game.But after fighting a group of admins/Mods and slaying them for a good 1/2 hours we logged on today to find out our accounts got banned. Hm.As everyone has said.. GO BACK TO EN!Still a dope game regardless of what company is controling it.			"

												Old player here, wanted to check if GF did change, and well, it is still the same, the three main points i would say are the worst:-Poor optimitzation, as always.-MES,Alka,spellbind (important items to progress) still very expensive in comparison to NA, which mean that they are harder to grind here (and this as the main reason i switched to NA).-Cashop is still a joke, if you want a cool skin, like the new argon hunter skin, they want you to spend hundreds of euros (not joking, it is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rng wheel, before it was called a surprise box, that has like a really low chance of dropping something close to decent, less to get a cool skin) while in NA you can get it from direct purchase without the scamrng.Overall, i would advice againts playing this game (EU servers), for me it is rather NA or just find another game, Gameforge is a crap company and i hope you don't play much at this game because from my experience, it won't be worth it.

												TL;DR, Full review beneath this.An over all good mmo with enjoyable dungeons and questing as a buffer, not too hard so can be played casually and satisfying combat that plays more dynamicly than your typical mmo clone, it has a more annoying late game with tedious travelling, slow mounts and a lack luster crafting system. For the price of FREE you can't really go wrong and kind of owe it to yourself to give the game a shot with some friends and see if you can get a few good times out of it.FULL REVIEW:Please bear with me, this is going to be a long one!I probably joined Tera a bit late in the cycle but still found myself enjoying the game, it has all the qualities of your typical MMORPG without sacrificing much for the free to play model.Pro's and cons;Pro's:- As far as I can tell the game is not pay to win.- The game is not particularly hard, many parts of the game (because I am a loser without friends) you can solo.- The game can be challenging at times, especially if you encounter a boss earlier than intended, but bosses are so far doable. (Note that this speaks of the dungeons, I have not raided yet).- Graphics aren't half bad for an mmo, rather cheery but willing to throw in dark themes.- Interesting, uniquely defined area's, in the first 3 area's in the first continent you encounter a desert a forest and a plain.- Sound is good, quiet, yet not inaudible and adds subtle atmosphere.- levelling is relatively fast so that you do not find yourself becoming bored of an area. (a week of gameplay and I am 61)- Dungeon bosses are enguaging and make frequent use of the AOE circle to signify an attack, this makes detecting aggro and dodging powerful shots easier and more fun.- Gives you a mount at level 11, I don't care if it is a bad mount, it's a mount and saves you a ton of time.- Brokerage the place where you rip o- *AHEM* sell your unwanted goods to other players.- Combat is more dynamic that games like WOW where you stand still and just press buttons, Tera expects you to react to combat.- Unique roster of races and classes.Cons;- Getting better weapons from bosses is pointless since relics make better weapons that can be enchanted +9 and early game this is not viable for found weponry.- Crafting disables any other actions what so ever other than to look at more crafting recipe's, it does not even allow you to look at the different crafting fields (crafting in alchemy while looking at armoursmithing is not allowed, why?).- Crafting is tedious and can be completed by just refining materials unless you want to go artisan or 500.- No tutorial or explanation on how to craft.- Yup, still on crafting, there isn't any 'functional' use of recipe's at lower levels since you probably won't know that crafting exists if you are new and even if you did notice it by pressing random buttons (like I did) it is likely that the gear that you could make would not be very useful or in any way 'good'.- Travelling is inconvenient. You cannot fly from the western side of the map to the eastern, we are on dragons and pegasus' but you're telling me that we can't cross continents?- Again with the inconvenient travelling, mounts are scarce to come by and appear largely in the auction or as timed exclusives. This makes travelling inconvenient as mounts have a static speed and the only way to travel quicker is to have a better mount.- Dungeon queing is questionable, its rather haphazard as to whether you will find a que or not within the next 5 minutes.- Quests are actually not bad at all. It is here because some may dislike them, there is an excess of kill quests rinse repeat for the majority of the game, the bread and butter, those who don't enjoy the combat will hate the sheer amount of it.- So much to do, so over levelled. I found myself clearing oxstagarth at the right level, yet abundantly over-levelled in pretty much every area prior.- Dungeons give a ton of experience, so much that you don't actually play dungeons much more than 3 times. This leaves a lot of cool dungeons unplayed and ignored unless its solo'd.- Levelling is really quick, to the point that if you want to join and make a few friends while you are here you will be lucky to find a few since they will most likely out level you or vica versa without a few days gameplay, even my 4 friends that jumped on to join me play Tera had issues remaining the same level, right now we are 60,60,61,62. This might not seem  a lot but is a massive difference when you realise that we have played essentially the same time for the past week.- For some, race specific classes might be an issue, for me its not but for some it will be a big thing.- No magic DPS specific class other than the sorcerer and the mystic. There is no alternative for a high dps damage over time tick sorcerer like a warlock in WOW (A personal gripe).Final thoughts;Tera is a very enjoyable game, it can take up a large chunk of your time if you have some friends who are willing to play with you and you take the time to wait for stragglers (sorry guys!) Much of the eastern continent can be completed quickly and you can level just as fast if not faster, this makes getting to the end game content that much quicker. Dungeons are enjoyable and well paced, the real meat of the game in my opinion, bosses are hard but able to be beaten and some have little tricks to finishing them faster (cannons). Travelling is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥most of the time and really boring but can act as a good time to take a break from questing and dungeoning.The biggest gripe that I have with the game is with the crafting, it's so basic and almost irrelevant by the time that you discover it, and to that end I feel sorry for it. It could have been so much more.To summarize though, the game is fun and I would recommend it with some friends, the late game crafting leaves something to be desired and parts of the game feel redundant (weapon drops).It is not a bad MMO, give it a try, if you enjoy then stick around if not at least you didn't waste your money :D .

												Recommended. If you like these kind of games, this is the game for you. Very Very big world, lots of things to do. The game mechanic, crafting etc is a little bit hard to master, but there is a lot of tips in google and youtube so you can learn most of it from there. You can reach the max lv 65 pretty fast, the game will give you every armor, wep etc which you need to do it. Little bit hard sometimes to find players to play dungeons, but if you reach 65 it will change, i almost instanly can que with people now. Graphics are amazing, but you can turn everything off, so mid-tier pc-s can run the game also.U should give the game a try, if you are a newbie as me. I started playing after the game came to steam.Pros:- Amazing graphics- amazing fighting mechanism- Max lv is 65, you can reach it as a newbie in 1-2weeks- In my opinion lv 50-55+ guest line is awesome- You can craft the first good endgame gear, just by compliting the guest line, at doing some easy dungeons- Big ♥♥♥♥ing worldCons:- I almost killed my self during the main guest line, until it reaches about lv 50. They are ♥♥♥♥ing boring- Until max lv, you are slow as ♥♥♥♥. The horse is slow af. I almost stopped playing when you had to go back and forth in the whole map, to finish a guest, and it took 20min only riding a horse- Big fps drops in some places. I cant even imagine what a event could be, when 100-200 people are in the same area.- To get better endgame gear, you need to farm for forever. Or do endgame dungeons,  A LOT.This is the point where i stopped playing, for me its not worth to do this for hours. - Dungeons are boring for me. End there is only about 10 endgame dungeon. - In my opinion there is not a lot of endgame versatility to play for hundreds of hours.I only played with archer. Thats the class i liked. So basically the 80hours of game is only with the archer. I dont care about pvp, so i cannot write about that. But its a fantastic game for 50-100 hours at least, so its worth to try it. And than when you are max lv, you found the class you whant, and you need a better gear, then you can decide, is this game worth it to do that? :DI will give you my thoughts on that. So basically i have +12 slaughter, and good gear. The next gear i need is Guile set.You can do daily guests and stuff, which you can earn about 1000 gold/day at least.  To get the guile set, you will need to enchant 4 things to at least + 12. I started to enchant my guile wep to +9, from +0. Well it took me 18 000 gold to do that, and 10000 more to faile the masterwork. So yeah, thats not worth for me, to put hundreds of hours to the game.If the game had more endgame versatily and not that much based on farming or running the same dungeons over and over again, it would be the dream game for me.

												Gameforge is still worse compared to Enmass, however, things have finally changed.Came back after 2 year and i'm already geared enough to be able to challenge every end-game instance.The NA version is probably easier but the 130-150 ping really makes the game unplayable if you want to be more than a totally casual gamer.

												+ Initial pacing in advancement is fast, or at least feels like it. You unlock new skills and options. It slows down at around lvl 40+ Combat system is active, you don't stand still during engagements+ Good transmog feature and a broad selection of vanity items. You can make some interesting looking characters in this game- Maybe a bit too easy to go solo and never talk to anybody, you can two shot minibosses during some quests. You teleport everywhere and dungeon finder finds a group for you- Doesn't seem that well done. Upon starting the client it usually either crashes or goes straight past the server selection screen, also takes an awfully long time to start the client in the first place. Your mount can get stuck in wierd places- Horrendous voice acting- Quests are the usual kill/gather X amount of something or run somewhere yada yada blabla- Some classes are race and gender locked			"

												Pros: - SO MUCH FUN TO PLAY :D - Still looking good - Imo best combat system in MMORPG history!!! - Some of instances can be hard enough to enjoy them fairly long time - Little girls with big swords :DCons: - Badly optimized engine... It's the weakest part of the game. - Too slow developing time - Lot of new things is just rework of old things. (They take out old instances, then some time later they put them back with different mechanics, and loots) - Not enough unique type bosses. (Most of the instances have same kind of bosses, just different skins and fight mechanic) - I think almost all of MMORPG have the same mistake, but I don't like the simple minded itemisation. U only have one way to optimise your gear. (u get one type of gear, u can go to the harder instance, u get the same gear with better stats, u go to harder instances etcetc...			"

												6.5-7/10 for the game. Playing 3 years now and the game has issues that could be fixed by publisher but they are not. If you are looking for casual playing of 1-2h per day you will have a hard time following up with patches if you don't p2w a bit.1.So why 6.5/10?1.1 | Publisher takes it down with their bad communication with community and not implamenting things that can be easly done by GF that don't depend on BHS1.2 | RNG Shop that is way overpriced. Just when you think you can get a nice outfit forget it. It is most likely packed in 10 items RNG box for 20euros + where items, if you wanna sell them on broker or trade, are worth from 5k gold to 250k gold.1.3 | Bad game optimization. If you do not have brutal, and i really mean BEAST MACHINE of a pc you will lag massively due to FPS drops from newely classes skills that are flashy. In dungeons it is mostly fine but in PvP where you really gotta focus on what you are doing since PvP it is very troublesome so prepare to lose some graphics for FPS1.4 | ""Free"" events are not so great since most of them are unrewarding for the time you spent doing them + it does not offer you huge amount of fun. On the other hand there are ""p2w"" events where you can buy stuff from shop and get insane amount of gold for 500euros+/- ...yes people actually do that o.O (THIS IS JUST MY OPINION SO DO NOT THINK IT IS HOW I SAY, MAYBE YOU WOULD LIKE IT). 1.5 | NO INTERACTION BETWEEN COMMUNITY AND GAME OPERATORS WITHIN THE GAME. NON EXISTANT!1.6 | Newest classes are GENDER LOCKED ON FEMALES FROM CERTIAN RACE! which leaves everyone having almost same character.1.7 | RNG game, and by this i MEAN HUGE RNG (someone can spend 10k gold and get item while you can spend 110k gold and get nothing leaving you with rage and detest for the game sometimes.1.8 | Every patch where new class is realeased they OVERPOWER that class and it lasts for 2months.1.9 | maybe i forgot something2.Things i like and the reason i play tera:2.1 | Combat style. I played quite alot of dota1>hon>dota2 (in that specific order :D) and cod4. And tera is great because it basically unites them. All the classes have skills you have to aim to hit it. In PvE it is not so troublesome since bosses are big and it is really hard to miss them :D. However in PvP you have small targets so it is a bit challenging!2.2 | Great graphics. Lucky for me i have decent configuration so i can run with 40-50 fps in mass PvP.2.3 | Character customization. I like for my players to look unique and badass and tera offers you HUGE amount of stuff (BUT !!! check 1.2 - remember i play quite long so i can afford gold more easly then new players and i buy most items with gold because im not mastercard player)2.4 | Buddy Up ""event"" where you newely players can use buddy up from player lvl 65 and get rewards while leveling.Link for the buddy up rewards (it says REBORN because they want to boost their reputation right before steam release, ofc this is just my honest opinion :D)http://board.tera.gameforge.com/board2-tera-en/board681-news-announcements/229680-buddyup-reborn/ 3.Things that are currently bad in TERA > MANY WILL ARGUE THIS like on forum for me saying stuff related to number 3 and i just want to clarify most of them spend 100+ euros on TT monthly so i leave it to your judgement to decide who is right once you enter the game.3.1 | New players will have a bit trouble gearing up. TERA is RNG game as i said before. As such you depend on luck to masterwork(MW for further use) your gear which as of this day is A MUST if you want to play dungeons with other people. Low tier gear will give you access to ""normal mode"" dungeons where you can require mid tier gear and it is there where MWing becomes painful. Also RNG is on everything and worst thing community currently hate is a scroll that allows you to reroll your jewelry which are way too expensive for common item.3.2 | If you don't play alot you will have hard time obtaining best in slot (bis) gear (however bis is not required you can run dungeons with mid tier no problem).3.3 | Bad class balances. Currently some classes are underpowered compared to others. This is not such a problem in PvE but in PvP it can create problems.3.4 | No real competition. You can compete with your friends who has ""higher dps"" but remember most classes are better then others. Same player with 2 different classes = different DPS. Ofcourse on some difference is not huge but on some it is.MY main reasons why i think this game is 6.5-7/10.Some mastercard users will argue ^_^. That said i have to mention change is happening on TERA but it is very slow and not always moving into good direction. Mostly goes into bad direction			"

												I really wanted to like this game and it definitely has it's good points such as the graphics are pretty great, there's a lot of variety in the kind of enemies you'll be fighting, the combat is decent enough, there's 8 different races (Human, elf, creepy anime children etc) and 12 different classes you can choose from and the character designs are really cool.It just feels really souless and lifeless to me though due to not being able to interact with the environments at all and enemies respawn literally 5 seconds after you kill them which takes away any sense of achievement you might get from beating them and completely kills immersion. You'll beat a boss and then walk ten feet away to talk to an NPC and see another player fighting that very same boss in the background whilst other players awkwardly clip through your character.The quests are shallow and are either fetch quests or ""Go and kill X amount of enemies then come back"" and it just feels like the only reason to play is so you can level up more, unlock really silly looking costumes and mounts for your creepy overly sexualized anime child and you're overpowered way too quickly. After about 5 hours in to the game i was killing regular enemies with 2 or 3 hits and taking almost no damage from them so i didn't even have to try and dodge their attacks anymore. Is this fun for some people?The free to play model they have going seems fair because all you have to pay for is cosmetics (Which are ridiculously overpriced) but i can't see myself playing it anymore because the whole experience is just pretty irrirating and boring.There's also boobs. Just Google ""Boobs"" if you want to see boobs.			"

Oh and i havent spent any money at all and i am getting through easy while enjoying it very much.15/02/2017 i honestly can say that this game is a must play. Still not had a single issue will update along the way with the more things i do. yes it is all  | go here,come back,do this,slay this etc but that is what an mmo is. but for now i recommend to everyone to atleast try, and if its not your cup of tea then thats your choice. i also know nothing of the publisher but i have heard some really bad things but as i said, not had a issue yet			"

 TERA So lets start from the beggining -  Bad stuff First of all - dissapointment from the fact that game became more and more easy. I can understand that to push old players to start new acc or new chars you have to let them  fast skip  fast run through old and ""borring"" parts but by that you made parts of locations unvisited. And those are nice locations.Secondly - non main quest rewards. they are soooooooooo...ooo small sometimes that you insta lose interest in doing side quests.Thirdly - certain classes beying OP than others. way to op...but now about  Good stuff First - F2P feels like reall F2PSecondly - Character design and variationThirdly - Deepth of main sotry NPC and story. Sometimes its fun to listen to them good example is  Samael with his betrayel  AND IMPORTANTLY - DRAGON MOUNTS =D over all the games is close to 78/100 for meif balance will change  and there will be more fun exploring worl my rating will change. But only time will show how it will go			"

												Tera is a nice MMO with the unreal engine, the graphic are good only you need much performance. The game is dual-core based, so I3 I5 and i7 can't use full potential. The game have nice community everybody is frendly, easy to level and nice events. You don't need to pay every month money to play the game, you can do 'Free to play' you can make 2 charters and with no limit on items,money and drop-rate. Tera is not based on repairs for gear and not really gear stated, Tera focus stats to crystals. Wen crystal breaks you need to get a newone fast for you stats, there are scrolls for unbreakable crystals time limited.

												Marvelous game that shows what the Unreal Engine can pull off in an MMO. Great combat that brings something new to the table. Improved aiming, dodging and tactical timing is a key to intense and rewarding combat. Quests can be a little Boring and badly written. Playing the game is very fun, despite the questing system. World and character models are gorgeous. Tera's soundtrack is largely forgettable epic fantasy fare.If you do the quests, leveling and acquiring gear upgrades is fun and you rarely feel like you are stuck grinding. Still leveling is quiet quick at least on start.For me if you looking for MMO where you must work/fight in real, this is it.			"

												Game seems to be horribly childish, and i played Wildstar...The classes are terrible, and the character creation makes no sense at all.Things that just ""happen"" in other games, have to be done in really weird ways here.For example, you have the quest to repair a doll. You repair the doll and bring it back. Done, right? Wrong! Now the doll appears next to the npc, and a text shows up on screen that literally says something like ""the doll has been placed on the ground, now click on it to finish the quest!""...Was it SERIOUSLY THIS HARD to just finish the quest? Why this idiotic extra step? When i bring something back to someone, why would i place it on the freaking dirty ground? This makes no sense, is not needed programming wise, and adds nothing to the game, except more needless clicking and wondering ""wtf am i doing wrong?"".Why can't we have a SINGLE damn mmo, that is not ruined by dumb developers, that magically got a working game from nowhere? I mean... do YOU seriously think that people, that are too dumb to make a lv 1 gunner do more dmg than a lv 1 healer, were EVER capable of programming ANYTHING?			"

												Been playing TERA since 2015.Likes: Awesome game with awesome graphics + lots of dungeons (for items) + instances (mini-games) for fun. Definitely recommended for old and new players. Friendly community and awesome game mechanics overall.Dislike: TERA need to use social medias (facebook, twitter, instagram, emails) more often for updates, events, free items, etc.			"

												I played this game before and after i changed my Internet Provider, i was unable to play it either on Steam or via GameForge launcher... i am very disappointed of Gameforge only having useless Supports which can't help you with your problems.I know that Gameforge makes it impossible to start Tera with a VPN, so you need a clean connection. But i don't even use a VPN and its not even my fault for my ISP to send my IP through 12 Servers before it actually reaches Gameforge which is making it impossible for me to play, because it will always pop up an error message, i've invested enough time in trying to fix this and am very disappointed...

												My computer should meet the System Requirements for this game, but even with +485% better GPU (UserBenchmark comparison) and about +250% better CPU (UserBenchmark comparison), The framerate is unstable and often goes to 20 or lower. My computer build has no bottleneck and is using a suggested operating system, but the game's optimization seems to be really bad for newer PC builds.This makes the game unplayable for me and many others, so I can't recommend it.

												Very early story quest is bugged-- you can sometimes be left with a quest item called ""Scion Records"", which is literally impossible to delete. And there's no in-game method of opening a ticket.This game has been out for six years. I can't see how the rest of the game can be any good if this very early bug's been left in tact for so long.

												Glad to see Tera on Steam! The first MMO I really spent some time on. It's not flawless, but easy to come into, which I appreciate. I don't have the time nor patience to soak thousands of hours into grinding and farming, but Tera is really easy-going IMO. The start is nice, the battles are nice, dungeons come by smooth and its overall aspects are pretty good too. Of course - don't come by expecting World of Warcraft, then you will severly dissappointed.			"

												One of the best MMORPG in the market! Amazing battle system, which requires skilll throughout the game, graphics simply stunning, long time fans know about bit old 32 bit client, which has small issues, but not game impacting.This game is very easy to reach max level, that's because ''the real'' content starts after hitting 65; Only then you start to go 20+ player dungeons and getting that epic gear. New dungeons, new gear and new stuff in general is added every few months. People are friendly as long as you are friedly with them. So take a tour in TERA!			"

												Tera Online connects the player to a world in conflict between the inhabitants of Arborea and the Argons, beings which use force and violence to cause disorder in the world. Tera has an unique narrative which utterly immerses the player in such a rich and baronial world, the combat system is real time action oriented combat, where players can aim at enemies with skills and attacks and even dodge when necessary. The combat moves feel fast and overwhelmingly fulfilling, especially when fighting against behemoth boss monsters (BAM’S).You can play as one of seven unique races (Amani, Baraka, Castanics, Elin, High Elves, Humans and Popori) which possess strengths, weaknesses, racial attributes and bonuses inherited with each race. There are 13 classes (Archer, Berserker, Brawler, Gunner, Lancer, Mystic, Ninja, Priest, Reaper, Slayer, Sorcerer, Valkyrie and Warrior) each one with its own distinctive playing style so you can rage havoc on any battlefield. Tera has an amazing setting, impressive graphics and engaging battles which trigger an impulse in players to embrace this fantasy like world, without any doubt a MMORPG that will give a buzz to any player who experiences this game, where only very few MMO’s can match. Once you dive deep into Tera’s mesmerizing world you wont be able to let go…			"

The action combat, group content, typical mmo questing, great graphics (although getting a bit old these days) , but what Gameforge (the publisher) is doing to the game is not nice... lot of microtransactions that would be considered p2w. I still recommend this game but playing on the American servers from a diffrent publisher. If your internet is crap though then this is still not totaly horrible :D			"

												Awesome visuals, chilling travel from lvl 1 to 65 through easy quest (took about 30hrs). Again awesome views during the travels, on the other hand quests could be less ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so you dont have to go back and forth to the city (there's really nothing to do in the city apart from the merchant and bank/trade broker). So it's free and you can chill and if you hate travel or quests you can always roll with some battlefields, i tried the thing with the fat fellas where you have to kill opponents mother (brutal) and the thing with the tanks, you can probably hit max lvl within one day (cuz of crazy exp rewards) but it's not my thing. Also every now and then you collect some shards or other fragments and you get free weapon, and if you just fight for the quests you get enough meterials to upgrade it to +9 almost instantly, so there should never be a problem with a good weapon to roll with the dungeons or storyline.

												Don't mind the hours: I've been a player since its transition to f2p and I played pretty much everything until the expansion hit, so while I miss the latest content I know a good chunk of it.So is the game worth? Yes, even though it is clunky at times.The game is said to be action and is partially true, as you have to physically dodge attacks by moving or using skills that lets you dodge attacks, which forces the players (especially tanks like me) to remember skill patterns in order to dodge or block at the same time (It's easier now with telegraphs, but back then I had to watch the movements with my own eyes!). So it is action but a very stiff kind of action: you can't always attack while moving for instance and many of your attacks requires you to stand still and ""aim"" before attacking: if you're a lancer and you're charging, you have to line up your shot or you'll miss it. In this case I'd say that the best action kind of playstyle remains Wildstar, where you can freely attack and move without any issues, while TERA is still similar to older mmorpgs where you still have to stand still most of the time. But hey at least there's no tab targetting!Secondly the game is still holding up with its graphics but back in the day it had quite a poor performance: even with my stronger pc I still get lags now and then, forcing me to tone down the parameters. Granted I don't have a super duper overlclocked pc BUT I can run most games at a fairly stable FPS. TERA is very sloppy on this case.The classes are well varied (especially the older ones) and the game has a trinity system with tanks (4 tanks, with berseker being one at cap level unless it got changed), healers (only 2 so far) and various dps. All classes can do one role at once (Excluding Warriors and Bersekers, who can do dps and tank) and they allow some customization in terms of Glyphs, which essentialy boosts some skills for some additional effects: they're not major but enough to help in your role, so if you're a Warrior Tank you'll most likely boost your defense stance and so on.Dungeons are fairly fun, even though at high level it's not uncommon to end up with dps who can outaggro you if you're a very weak tank, and in general tanks are used for keeping enemies at bay while dps will smash them with multi-million damaging attacks. Afterall they can all dodge attacks so it's not impossible, HOWEVER I found the later dungeons (when i played) to be so-so, while the levelling ones seemed better and overall more fun. Also they tend to have daily locks so be careful.And let's face it, I'm delaying the inevitable, which is the fact that this version I'm playing is from Gameforge and while I still play this rather than the NA version, I want to specify a few things that will encourage you to either play the EU or NA version.So is the NA version better than EU? Yes....but there are sacrifices to be made, and one of them is the latency.TERA has never been a very smooth game, even when I started playing, and lag can literally kill you if you're not very careful, as lag can delay your attacks or parry or even dodges most of the time. I played the Na version long ago and I couldn't manage to play for much longer because my attacks had at least a 1-3 seconds delay each (And I have a 100mpb connection!). In addition, the obvious issue with community (no not that it's bad, although I haven't found a single good community in any mmorpg to begin with): NA servers are obviously far behind us in terms of timezone, with nearly 6 to 9 hours of difference between us and them, which means that if you decide to play seriously you'll be forced to stay awake late at night for your endgame content OR hope for some people to raid at your time, who are early morning raids or such. This can affect the gameplay because you will alone most of the day, for only during the night to be somewhat filled with people, and be able to do most content ONLY during late night. As someone who played a few games on US servers in various games (FFXIV, WS, BNS, WoW) for various reason (Mostly in terms of roleplay, which is absent in european servers), it is really a hindrance to be unable to do most content JUST because you're hours forward.And last but not least, the cash shop is definitely better than the EU version, with cheaper prices and a tera sub that actually IS worth the price...however considering that it's mostly cosmetic, the only thing that you would even care about is the bank slots and character slots (which is account bound and will work on every character) and while expensive in the EU version ( 20 euros vs 5 dollars), after that you're pretty much ""done"": everything else isn't really required and unlike SWTOR, where even skill bars are locked, everything else is pretty much free. So yes the shop is expensive, but only a bunch of things are actually worth spending on: the rest is easily skippable (and while I can't speak for most players, since that I have the limited edition, a friend of mine said that he was fine with only 2 slots and didn't need others)So, is the game worth it? Yes, and it's free so why not trying?Is the EU version better or worse than US? It's worse, undeniably worse, however if you have issues like I did or simply don't like to swap accounts like me, then this is your only choice.But as it is, for what I experienced, the game is worth so I'm giving a thumbs up!

												HelloIve played since closed beta, and i think the game is good servers are okeyBut there are few things you need to watch out for.When gameforge took over from frogster.they changed this game to F2P but they did it with a negative tone,Aloot of the items you can buy in the shop is not aktually items you buy its a CHANCE to get the item.mounts for an example has no fixed cost and can only be purchsed by pure luck.so its very had to reccomend this game to much.but if you looking for a decent game that is fun to roam around in and try new things maybe its ok. but be careful how you spend the money ingame couse most of it is PAY TO CHANCE.

												After playing this game for roughly 4-5 years I can honestly say it's my go to MMO. My main is a reaper which I like the rotations and skills used, it's a class I find more unique then most other games online. At 1st I had a lot grps complaining about my dmg and my rotations and I actually thought I was playing my class properly. Truthfully though, I did some research, looked up the skills and rotations and found out that other players were correct and I was actually a terrible reaper.But after sometime, research and putting skills in the correct area of the tool bar, I got better, much better. The game itself in all the years it's been around has improved in some areas, considering how it used to be when I 1st started to now, you can see the developers put sometime into it and made things for the better in TERA. Admittedly it is from gameforge which a lot of gamers are not fans of and honestly neither am I, if for example you look at the differences between aion and TERA in terms of enchanting gear and weapons. In both cases if you grind dungeons and dailies for gear and once you have it, certain items are required to enchant said gear. With Aion you could enchant your gear and if unsuccessful you could either go down a level on enchanting or lose your gear altogether, which I thought was a kick in the teeth to all gamers and the frustration it brings.With Tera you can enchant gear or weapons and if you fail, you don't lose anything. It actually gives you a slight chance of improvement the next time until your successful which I feel doesn't make the gamers feel bad about failing as there is always a chance of success.From lvl 1-65 it's all about getting to know your class, the rotations, how to get better at it and learning instances along the way. Once hitting 65 the true end game starts which is a constant grind (if you like it) for items and gear to make your  character stronger and more reliable in end game instances. Everything is a learning curve even at end game, watching videos and reading guides, watching bosses for their mechanics and when to hit and dodge at the right time which is essential instead of literally going in all guns blazing. It's trial and error really. Once I got my gear to max level I only then went to instances for even better gear and drops when I felt I was ready and then constantly grinded dungeons to learn them better to become a more reliable person.No person is perfect at their class and even if they say and believe they are, there's always a possibility of a run not going smoothly but if you watch and learn any player can get good at any instance if they put the effort in. The classes are as follows if this game sounds of interest to you:Lancer (Tank)Brawler (Tank/dps)Warrior (tank/dps)ArcherBerzerkerGunnerNinjaReaperMysticPriestApart from PVE content there is also PVP if that's your prefered choice which gives the game a good balance. It's actually nice to play a game and do whatever you like to do unlike aion in comparrison in where if you wanted to do PVE there's always a chance being constantly ganked by players who can flat out kill you when all you want to do is your daily quests which believe me is frustrating, where as with TERA you actually have that option of wanting to openly pvp or not.I honestly don't pvp because I see no point to it, I suck at it and it's not what I play tera for, but if pvp is what you prefer then this game has it.Cons:Since there's a huge amount of classes to try it can get tiresome or perhaps even boring starting from lv 1 all over again, going through the storyline just to get to 65 and learning the class as you go and since I have like 8 chars it does feel kinda boring. On the flipside you've got the experience for all the dungeons you've already learnt and doing them wont be a problem if you understand each class. Cash shop: Yes there is a cash shop and most ppl have said it feels like Pay 2 win. Yes you can buy certain mounts and items and you can sell them via auction house the only downside is that for all the extra incentives and bonuses that come with the game is that if you want to play the game in it's full entirity you need a monthly subscription fee which admittedly makes the game a lot easier on players which comes with daily bonuses, a free mount, instant teleportation to any area and xp/gold buffs to help level up your character much quicker and putting items to sell in the auction house costs nothing where as without the pack, the higher the price you want to sell something for, the more ingame gold it costs you.All in all, it's not a perfect game. I do enjoy it a lot as it constantly rewards players in certain ways to keep playing where as some other games do not. The community is friendly and yes there is the occassional percentage of players that you may end up not wanting to group with again because of their attitudes or how they treat others, but thankfully there's always the option of blocking and never having to work with them again. If there was anything I would improve in this game, it would be the end game enchanting system.Normal weapons and gear go from +1-12, vision maker gear can go from +12 to +15.Vision maker is gear that you grind dungeons for items and then craft, you enchant to +12 and then after comes awakening which costs roughly 800-100 mwa which is quite a lot but the game DOES some events from time to time to make it cheaper, say roughly 200 mwa to awaken.Now the biggest gripe is getting it +13-15. From this point on it's all RNG based and yes I've seen players get it done in 3 tries, I've even talked to ppl who have spent literally thousands of MWA, for example for myself I spent literally 5k mwa before it even went to +13.If I had a choice I'd implement a system which doesnt cheat players out off all their hardwork. You could spend 2 months grinding all that mwa to have a shot to get it +13 and higher only to fail and that can cause a lot of rage and wanting players to quit because of it.So if it was me the system I'd use is this:+13 = 1k mwa+14= 2k mwa+15= 3k mwaIF this system was in place, gamers could actually have something to really work for instead of constantly farming and failing and would give players the incentive to log in daily, grind and continue to play. Not just try and hope for the best, fail and then just quit.But that's just me			"

DO NOT INSTAL IF YOU LOVE GATHERING AND CRAFTINGThis game isn't for farmers even gentle ones.This game is FREE TO LOGIN and FREE TO SEE but BUY TO PLAYThere is a points system that is shared through all the characters of an accounts.This system limits you at crafting and gathering.You'll use all these points in less than 10 minutesit's 25 minutes of waiting to gather a single lv1 resource (more lv the resource is more points you need)and 1h15 to craft a lvl1 weapon.Everything in the game will push you to wpen money.If you want fun you'll need money.mounts, skins, HL stuff, more than 2 characters and well... everything you need to be comfortable in a mmorpg.Took me 14 hours to download and took me 14 hours to play until i was to uncomfortable in that tiny ""free"" space that is the free to play account. Yes it's beautiful, Yes there is cool stuff to see and try and live through but man that cash thing and limits are killing all the fun.Remove the Points thing, And you'll have more players staying and more players buying and putting money in the game.

												It might just be the Guild Wars 2 player in me, but this plays more like a turn-based role playing game.In the beginning you just click away at the enemies until they hit back and then you have to defend or dodge. and then you hit back.Another problem with the game is that it is really laggy, all the enemies are really slow, and sometimes the game just pauses till it has loaded everything. I would have expected more from a newer MMORPG than just basic attack and defend/dodge options.			"

I have sendt inn a report so time will tell how long it's gonna take them to fix it. No I have never played the game before.EDIT: Vell I somehow got in today with no problem, but still keeping this negative. First thing I didn't like was that the UI was really big and if I scaled it just a little bit down it simply became to small. I have a 15.4"" laptop. It also seemed that they had a lot of things on screen that dosen't really need to be there...why have a radar thingy with the enemies showing AND a mini map undeneath? I dunno that's just me. It ran just fine and I had no lagg so that was good tho. But the  whole thing seemed off to me somehow, can't really pinpoint it. Not my cup of tea I guess.			"

												Personally I like TERA (the Community is one of the friendliest i have met) I started in August 2013 and have been playing ever since, the Fighting method is way better than the autolock targets in others games, just be patient with it.The randomness of getting items enchanted can be a bit annoying at times, but then if you got everything first time why would you bother trying to do.If you create A new account on Main gameforge TERA site, you can then link this into steam (allows Fulll Acces to both steam and main Gameforge TERA page where you can enter in the FREE codes that we get occasionally and also UNLOCK the Veteran account if you have bought this (normally from CDKEY SITES).Not seen anywhere on Steam that will allow you to enter codes for this game as yet (but we all live in hope)			"

												Hello newbie dude,I've been playing TERA for over 4 years now and I still think it's a great game, with beautiful graphics, various classes, attractive races, cool costumes, engaging dungeons, entertaining battlegrounds and players from lots of different backgrounds. And it's free-to-play, available in English, French and German. You can buy a CD key or subscribe to pay-monthly TERA Club but that's optional. You don't need best-in-slot gear in order to socialise and have fun in instances and fighting other people in battlegrounds. P2w is not really an issue. Pay-to-progress-faster is more accurate but surely buying costumes and mounts doesn't give you any advantage. Paying for TERA Club keeps the game alive, so whatever the benefits (double dungeon entries, double reputation credits, account-wide mount, instant open-world teleportation, no auction house listing fees and some others), it's not p2w.Check out my YouTube channel for TERA related videos - dungeons, battlegrounds and guides, including my Launcher issues guide with Steam players notes. If you're indeed new to TERA, you can also seek information or socialise on the official TERA forum[board.tera.gameforge.com]. Read also my BuddyUp system - purpose, limits and rewards[board.tera.gameforge.com] thread.Welcome to TERA (Europe) and have fun! o/			"

												As a player of Tera for several years (when max lvl was 60), game just went out on steam, so dont be confusd with this ""fake"" time played.To start with, TERA itself is beautiful RPG game running on Unreal Engine 3, amazing and stunning graphics, massive landscapes and overall perfect visuals. Gameplay is decent, increasing the game difficulty each time you level up, lots of dungeons, weapons,spells, armors, races, classes, mounts, pets, and much more (including awesome character customization and tons of nice-looking costumes).Would i recommend it? I guess so.However (longer content ahead) i must point out the important things here aswell that you should be aware of.Bluehole (game creators) horribly optimized this game, as it does not require anywhat strong graphic card, but it literally burns down RAM and CPU...resulting in terribly low FPS in crowded areas or whenever combat begins (with mediocore PC you can get stuck at 10-15 fps mid-fight)Terrible and unbalanced PvP ...even on lowest settings, the mass-pvp arenas such as Corsairs Stronghold can let you have minimal FPS, plus allies/enemies appears as a grayed figures that are moving and attacking you, without you even able to prevent it. Plus...abilities of certain new classes are out-of hand and can literally kill everyone with no difficulty at all. (3v3, 10v10 are only acceptable gamemodes in terms of being somewhat equalized and optimized)Lack of endgame content. Bluehole are adding new content not very often, a 1/2 new endgame dungeos with new gear once a year maybe. As a bonus, you will never have permanent endgame gear. Lets say there are ""Visionmaker"" gears, known to be end-game ones...they all will be obsolete one day. To get this gear, one has to keep grinding the same 2-3 dungeons over several weeks or even months (those dungeons can be entered only once a day....), and when one finally has it, it takes effort to ""enchant it"" to maximal value. This all is long and expensive process, and...one day, all this will be good for nothing, because they will add new gear, and you can shove up this old gear deep in your ar**... One can ""dismantle"" the gear, to retrieve a few enchanting components from it, but its not enough, not EVEN.Very few endgame dungeons and endgame PvP. Old repetetive dungeons with same unsurprising rewards, and same pvp maps too. (there is a grand lack on pvp maps, but im not wondering, because pvp in this game is broken....there is like 8 pvp maps ""aka gamemodes"", with 3 of them being the same, but with a different ""system"")Recap: Lack of endgame content (each endgame gear will one day be useless garbage, no matter how expensive it was to get)About the massive beautiful landscapes...............well, you will see it all just FU**ING ONCE, as you just visit them just to level in them and then never return and see their real beauty....after reaching max lvl (65 currently), you will visit just 2 particular places and sleep around there, doing buisness and pretty much ...yeah (Velika, Highwatch)Animations and voices are...disappointing.Considering the game is over dozens of GB big, it has a terrible animations, repetetive and generic. One race/gender can use only the same animations over and over (lets say Human-Female looks left, then right. Another is that she ""slaps"" her face like she is surpried....yeah...those 2 generic animations over...and over and OVER AND OVER AND OVER!!!) ...same goes for the voices, each race/gender has only very few of them, only being some screams when fighting or jumping...overall animation/voices are disappointing, for a game with such visuals, it could be better.Game sexualization, ""racism"" and discrimination.Old ""Classes"" could be played by each Race (Aman, Castanic, Human, Elf, Baraka, Popori, Elin). However, nowdays, each NEW class is ...ONLY FEMALE. (I aint no gay, but this is lame move).It all began with Reapers (Elin [Female] only), followed by Gunners (Castanic / Elf [Female] only), Brawler (Human [Female] only), Ninja (Elin [Female] only)...and (upcoming) Lunar Dancer (Castanic [Female] only)Same goes for costumes. From 90% costumes for female characters (sure, they look good, but .....this aint fair)Elin ""master race""...a ""loli"" race, flat-chested little girls...has most costumes, most accessories and costumes...im speechlessLast thing i must mention is not fail from the side of Bluehole (Korean game creatros of this game), but the ones who are taking care of this European version of tera, known as Gameforge (commonly known as Failforge)...From the nickname given by community , ""Failforge"" runs this game very poorly, with almost no events, makes nothing special, but mainly... PAY2WIN is a known thing in TERA EU, failforge makes this game not to make happy community, but to fill their pockets. They allow anyone with a full credit card to take full advantage of the game and get everything in the game without needing to bother completing even the easiest tasks.Pay2win can get you: instant levelups, instant top-tier gear (by purchasing premium items and selling them with gold [base ingame currency] for high prices, then buying the top-gear), more dungeon entries (as previously mentioned, one can visit certain dungeon only once a day, ...premium users can do it twice a day), more benefits (such as more special reputation points), best mounts, useful pets and much more.Done reading?  That is just a little taste of this game.Its good, but beware of the Failforge... "

												PVP is unbalanced. For me it is a sin equa non condition.Otherwise:- fun gameplay with the combo system and the fact that you can make so many different specs with the glyph system (you upgrade your skills instead of having a too comon talent tree)- OK graphics, i mean, can't complain considering it's a f2p (however, landscapes seem like they have no depths even though the world is quite big)- rather fast and pleasent leveling, enchanting system for the weapons and short group time for group quests keeps you with an updated gear until you reach max level, which feels so GOOOOOOOD :d- hl pve is nice.... Yeah, can't say much i'm not that kind of guy... TLDR			"

												I purchased TERA before it went F2P and added it to steam (God knows why). I'll start by saying a few things i love about TERA. 1.I'm a MMORPG fanboy, so there's that.2.Graphics, simply amazing. With a budget PC build you can enjoy the game at decent settings and not regret the decision.3. Combat System is amazing, simply amazing.4. We all know that you're here for the little girl with shiny magical huge weapons. Admit it.Problems i've encountered in TERA so far 1. Active Guilds exist, but it's hard to find a suitable guild that ""breathes"".2. New players might find it overwhelming with features sometime. I'd recommend this game without hesitation, you will fall in love with it within an hour or two, even at this MMORPG dying era.			"

												TL;DR: Great and engaging combat, super beautiful world, varied areas. Bad optimization for performance. Has its flaws but is in my opinion the best F2P MMO out there. Despite being F2P, there's no P2W.LONG VERSION:+ The combat is absolutely great. I've played tons of MMOs and most are relatively boring, yet TERA is speedy and fluid, and a game where you have to aim your abilities (no tab-targeting) and use i-frames etc.+ Plenty of classes and playable races to choose from. All of the classes are available to everyone. (Albeit with some restrictions, as I will mention later).+ Despite being F2P, there is no pay to win (P2W) to speak of. You have a cash shop for cosmetics and some things for convenience/extra goodies but that's it.+ The art style is great for characters, monsters, and building designs alike - along with the colour palette utilized throughout. (As subjective as this is).+ The world/area design is great: lots of huge zones to explore, with each of them feeling distinctive and different, but with all of them feeling really ""deep"". You feel a desire to explore.+ Enough customizability to be interesting for builds and characters, but without being too cluttered or being filled with useless skills/customizations. Gear and other secondary features are also done well.+ Decent in-game music with a lot of ambiental vibes for some appropriate areas, as well as some more triumphant, ethereal, etc. sounds. Certainly pretty good!+ Easy to get started out with generous loot drops and some parcels to help newbies out in the early game.+ Engaging hard content at the very top. (Although hit and miss with the learning curve and how everything BUT the endgame-endgame feels easy to rather easy).+ Great cosmetics. Also, eyecandy in general. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)+/- Main story line is hit and miss.+/- The usual gearing treadmill for endgame, as well as daily quests for reputation and stuff. You know what I mean, so you'll either like it or hate it - or simply live with it and do it anyway!+/- Ease of leveling. Some people hate leveling - I love it, and it makes me feel invested. TERA brings people to level cap incredibly fast, which is great for endgame and alts.+/- As great as the world is, it feels a little meaningless to have it, aside from immersion and when you level up (via quests). A lot of the absolutely beautiful zones are left to just exist with no purpose.- The optimization of the game for performance. By far the worst aspect of this game. You can optimize the game a little better by yourself which is worth it (Google). You could run this with a NASA-tier rig and still have minor issues, though. Still, runs ok at max graphics.- Race/gender locked classes. Stupid idea. (Brawler, Gunner, Ninja and Reaper are female-only - and for certain races).- Mediocre at best UI. Looks ok when tweaked to your preferences, but could use some refinement.- Laggy sound at times during cutscenes, as well as sound not matching up that well with what happens on screen (for cutscenes).- Lack of instructions in a coherent manner in the game (for new people). People might not realize crafting even exists in the game until they butterfinger some key to open a relevant menu.- Mediocre crafting system. There are profits to be had from crafting, but everything feels a little clunky and inaccessible.- Lack of meaningful and well-rounded content. Good endgame-content exists, but there are not many minigames, no open world mob hunting on a regular basis, and a lot of the open world is rendered useless.- Low skill floor (early game spoonfeeding) yet a high skill ceiling creates a weird rift between facerolling and difficulty walls. No real midcore content as of now.- Minor things such as not having Fishing in the game, or personal housing. (Subjective gripes). Also, RNG elements with upgrading gear might discourage some people (I'm ok with it).OVERALL: 8/10, would recommend for MMO-enthusiasts. Despite the very high score, I don't think this game has much cross-appeal to people who hate MMOs, but RPG-fans of action combat can still digg this a lot.			"

												I used to play this game quite a lot when it turned into F2P several years ago, and now that it's on Steam, I decided to write this review from my experiences.Gonna keep this as short as possible:TERA can be fun to play in small dosages, but on the long run it just feels empty and hollow.The only real problem I have with this game is that there are only 2 free character slots, so you have to pay huge amount of money if you want to make more that 2 characters. This leads to yet another problem, that there are no alternative specialations/roles for the classes, so you mostly have just one way to play the game on each class.The game looks okay-ish on todays standards, while the sounds could use more work, especially on the cutscenes where the sounds don't match what's happening on the screen  (laggy sounds).The most interesting part in this game is its gameplay mechanics.The game's combat uses a real-time battle system that incorporates third-person camera view. The player targets an enemy with a cross-hair cursor rather than clicking or tabbing an individual opponent, which is called the ""Non-Target battle system"" by the developer. The Players need to actively dodge enemy attacks.[8] A keyboard and mouse or a control pad can be used to control the character.There are total of 7 races that you can play as and total of 12 different classes (though 4 of the newest classes are race and gender locked classes, which is kinda lame). Pros:+ Free to Play+ Leveling new characters is much more faster than it used to be+ Interesting gameplay mechanics+ 12 different classes (but again, you can only play 2 of them for free)+ Lots and lots of Cosmetic items to make your character look unique+ Fun dungeons and raids+ Fun to play on small dosages(+ Lots of eye candy)Cons:- Free to play. Only 2 free character slots- No alternative specs/roles for classes, so there's no variation to your gameplay unless you don't try out different classes (but again, you can only make 2 free characters)- Race and gender locked classes  (only the 4 newest classes though)- Enormous but empty world- Weak and unbalanced PvP  (just my opinion though, I never liked doing PvP in MMORPGs)- Low playerbase- Performance/stuttering issues even on high end PC- Cosmetic items are really, really expensive on both real money and in-game money- Idiotic cosmetic Smart boxes (rng boxes), so even with that high price they have, you cannot even buy those specific cosmetic items that you want, so you have to trust in your luck. My advise is: dont waste your real money on them.Do I recommend:It's an free MMORPG game, so if you're into those, you could give it a try. Otherwise, don't waste your time (or money) on this. In my opinion, TERA is one of the best ""F2P MMORPGs"" out there.Verdict: 5.5 / 10 - Slightly above average game(1 = do-not-buy game5 = average game10 = must own game)			"

												This game has a lot of good and bad things, but I can recommend it because it's free and you can have a lot of fun.About the game and me:I've found the game with my friends when we wanted to play an MMORPG together and we decided to give TERA a try. It was awesome, we had a lot of fun, but I missed a lot of things which was solved in another game (no matters which one is that, the game itself is good, and absolutely worth a try). I have more than 800 hrs in the game which isn't counted on Steam.PROS:- Beautiful environment: It changes always when you go to a new place, so it won't be the same boring while you play, it's absolutely beautiful.- Trade broker: You can sell and buy a lot of needed stuffs and if you're doin' it well, you can even earn money with it. Just buy stuffs with lower asking price than a normal merchant price and you can get money with it. Not too much, but in the most games I've never seen this possibility and it's good. :) You can try to buy stuffs on lower price with negotiation, and you can buy without the broker fees, which is definitely a nice stuff, and only works when the seller is online.- Steam version's login system: I hate to enter my password at every single login, but with Steam integration it will log you in without asking password, which is really nice for me. (You can link your account to Steam, so no need to create a new one, your existing account will be able to use.)- Leveling: It's really nice and funny with friends even if sometimes it's boring to run and talk with NPCs 10x to get the quest finished. The environment makes it nice and the dungeons are various too, so if you're playing the game first, the leveling won't be boring.- Real money features are buyable with gold: You can find them on trade broker or ask in chat if someone wanna get gold and can buy it for you for real money and change it for gold. This is like new character slots, bank tabs, mounts, pets, skins, etc., you can find them on trade broker too, so if you have enough gold no need to ask just buy it.CONS:- Loot and party system together: If you wanna hit a mob/boss, you need to be in party with the others because only one person will get the loot. I've played a lot of other MMOs and noticed this only in TERA. Maybe there are more games, but for me it's much better if you can get loot with everyone even if you're not in the party. And why? Because you have to ask for party always, and if you're fighting with a mob and would be nice to have some help, others will skip the mob and you, because they can't get anything for it, and most of them won't help you for nothing.- Crystals: It needs money to always use the right crystals and they broke if you die, basically it wouldn't be a bad idea if it wouldn't broke after die. It won't kill the game and you can get enough crystals, but personally I hate this part.- Travelling system: You can buy scrolls, but if you don't have them the travelling is boring after a while. If you're in a town and wanna go to another one which is in another region you have to go to the capital of your region, travel to the other region's capital and after that travel to the other town. And you have to watch the pegasus flying animation which is nice and beautiful but after a while will be boring. You can skip that with scrolls but would be cool to have a system to travel from town to town (for the same price) with just clicking on the map and no need to buy scrolls or fly by pegasus. With Tera Club system you can use Village Atlas to travel faster, but it costs money of course to be a Club Member. :)AFTER LVL 65In the engame you can enchant your equipment and go to dungeons for better ones. The game has some battlegrounds, wich are solo or team pvp games, my favorite is Corsairs' Stronghold where you need to attack and defend 20v20. The dungeon system will pair you with the right classes so you will have healer, tank, dps, and you can farm the stuffs. You can earn gold from daily quests and zone quest, and if you wanna earn achievements you need to repeat dungeons and battlegrounds a lot.This isn't pro or con, but I don't like the achievement and unlock system, because you need to unlock then on every single characters. I know it's in other MMOs too, so not TERA's own system, but you need to buy mounts, or unlock them for every single characters. It makes you to play with your main character the most because there you will have the most unlocked stuffs and mounts. Again, it's not a pro or con, I just write down what I think about the game, and you can think about it otherwise. :)And finally I miss the Steam achievements which could make the whole thing funnier, because you can unlock the achievements with any character and wouldn't neccessary to unlock them with all characters.

Only 2 free character slots- No alternative specs/roles for classes, so there's no variation to your gameplay unless you don't try out different classes (but again, you can only make 2 free characters)- Race and gender locked classes  (only the 4 newest classes though)- Enormous but empty world- Weak and unbalanced PvP  (just my opinion though, I never liked doing PvP in MMORPGs)- Low playerbase- Performance/stuttering issues even on high end PC- Cosmetic items are really, really expensive on both real money and in-game money- Idiotic cosmetic Smart boxes (rng boxes), so even with that high price they have, you cannot even buy those specific cosmetic items that you want, so you have to trust in your luck. My advise is: dont waste your real money on them.Do I recommend:It's an free MMORPG game, so if you're into those, you could give it a try. Otherwise, don't waste your time (or money) on this. In my opinion, TERA is one of the best ""F2P MMORPGs"" out there.Verdict: 5.5 / 10 - Slightly above average game(1 = do-not-buy game5 = average game10 = must own game)			"

												TL;DR: Great and engaging combat, super beautiful world, varied areas. Bad optimization for performance. Has its flaws but is in my opinion the best F2P MMO out there. Despite being F2P, there's no P2W.LONG VERSION:+ The combat is absolutely great. I've played tons of MMOs and most are relatively boring, yet TERA is speedy and fluid, and a game where you have to aim your abilities (no tab-targeting) and use i-frames etc.+ Plenty of classes and playable races to choose from. All of the classes are available to everyone. (Albeit with some restrictions, as I will mention later).+ Despite being F2P, there is no pay to win (P2W) to speak of. You have a cash shop for cosmetics and some things for convenience/extra goodies but that's it.+ The art style is great for characters, monsters, and building designs alike - along with the colour palette utilized throughout. (As subjective as this is).+ The world/area design is great: lots of huge zones to explore, with each of them feeling distinctive and different, but with all of them feeling really ""deep"". You feel a desire to explore.+ Enough customizability to be interesting for builds and characters, but without being too cluttered or being filled with useless skills/customizations. Gear and other secondary features are also done well.+ Decent in-game music with a lot of ambiental vibes for some appropriate areas, as well as some more triumphant, ethereal, etc. sounds. Certainly pretty good!+ Easy to get started out with generous loot drops and some parcels to help newbies out in the early game.+ Engaging hard content at the very top. (Although hit and miss with the learning curve and how everything BUT the endgame-endgame feels easy to rather easy).+ Great cosmetics. Also, eyecandy in general. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)+/- Main story line is hit and miss.+/- The usual gearing treadmill for endgame, as well as daily quests for reputation and stuff. You know what I mean, so you'll either like it or hate it - or simply live with it and do it anyway!+/- Ease of leveling. Some people hate leveling - I love it, and it makes me feel invested. TERA brings people to level cap incredibly fast, which is great for endgame and alts.+/- As great as the world is, it feels a little meaningless to have it, aside from immersion and when you level up (via quests). A lot of the absolutely beautiful zones are left to just exist with no purpose.- The optimization of the game for performance. By far the worst aspect of this game. You can optimize the game a little better by yourself which is worth it (Google). You could run this with a NASA-tier rig and still have minor issues, though. Still, runs ok at max graphics.- Race/gender locked classes. Stupid idea. (Brawler, Gunner, Ninja and Reaper are female-only - and for certain races).- Mediocre at best UI. Looks ok when tweaked to your preferences, but could use some refinement.- Laggy sound at times during cutscenes, as well as sound not matching up that well with what happens on screen (for cutscenes).- Lack of instructions in a coherent manner in the game (for new people). People might not realize crafting even exists in the game until they butterfinger some key to open a relevant menu.- Mediocre crafting system. There are profits to be had from crafting, but everything feels a little clunky and inaccessible.- Lack of meaningful and well-rounded content. Good endgame-content exists, but there are not many minigames, no open world mob hunting on a regular basis, and a lot of the open world is rendered useless.- Low skill floor (early game spoonfeeding) yet a high skill ceiling creates a weird rift between facerolling and difficulty walls. No real midcore content as of now.- Minor things such as not having Fishing in the game, or personal housing. (Subjective gripes). Also, RNG elements with upgrading gear might discourage some people (I'm ok with it).OVERALL: 8/10, would recommend for MMO-enthusiasts. Despite the very high score, I don't think this game has much cross-appeal to people who hate MMOs, but RPG-fans of action combat can still digg this a lot.			"
