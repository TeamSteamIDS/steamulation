												Oh boy, this game.Well, it's fun, the combat is very fast paced and fun, you can do a lot of moves with you skills and magic and abilities, you can combine them or charge them for a more powerful attack. This game is HUGE, the map is VERY HUGE, there is a lot of dungeons and there is like 300 or 400 side quests to be done, but  it is very unlikely that you will want to do every single one, you see, some of them, some of the quests are like the generic MMO quests (grab question with NPC > kill x things > collect x things > go back to NPC), but there is a lot of side quests very well done and with a nice story. Play this game on HARD, because even on HARD it will be kinda easy, seriously, you will only face a challenge if you decide to fight more than 6 enemies (of your LVL - the ones with the name in YELLOW) at once or an enemy with an ORANGE or RED name.There is a lot of things to say about this game, but let me give you some tips that won't ruin your fun.If you want to kill enemies with one or two hits, pick  BLACKSMITH and JEWELCRAFTING skill to level up, you will be able to craft your own gear, but you can make some GODLY gear, like, you can gain +60% DMG with FIRE DMG and LIFE LEECH and a insane amount of ARMOR, you will never die, really, it will look like GOD MODE. If you wanna some challenge in the fights and if you wanna use the nice sets and unique gear that you will find in the game (the uniques and set items are way more nice than the crafted ones, they are very stylish and have some nice stats and their own lore/description, but they don't have stats so powerful like the crafted gear), don't level up BLACKSMITHING, go for JEWELCRAFTING (to sell the jewels) and MERCANTILE so you can make a lot of money (i end up with 12 millions GOLD and wasn't even in the end of the game, i had like 25 hours or more till the final boss).Try to acquire the DLCs, Ded Kel and Teeth of Naros, they are very nice and the Ded Kel can grant you some nice things, like, you can acquire the best items for crafting (the FLAWLESS components, they grant insane stats for crafted gear) and a lot of uniques and set items (set gear) for FREE (the components are not free, but the gear that one NPC search for you is free), a NPC will get them for you.Choose well the color of the eye of your character, you won't be able to change this after, only hair and jewels and tattoos once you gain your own house (there is like 3 or 4 houses only for your character in the game).Try to do all the faction quests, they give you nice rewards and you end up meeting new NPCs and enjoying the stories.Try to level up the DETECT HIDDEN skill, it will help you a lot. Don't bother, seriously, don't bother with LOCKPICKING and PERSUASION (PERSUASION can be nice if you really want some more dialogues, but it is not necessary), LOCKPICKING is useless, really, you will find some hard chests to lockpick, but after 3 or 4 lockpicks (and you will find and will be able to afford a lot of those lockpicks) you will end up opening the chests without problem. Try to level up DISPELLING, it will help you on magic chests and will prevent you for being cursed (curses can't be removed without a HEALER, and you will be forced to travel to a city or village to lift the curse, otherwise you can continue exploring, but some curses can make your character very vulnerable, very weak).Try to read all the books you find, really, they can give you a nice understanding of the lore and they have some very interesting information, also, some of them are hilarious.***If you want more challenge, you can try to use the YSA mod, it is a mod to be used with the Cheat Engine program, it changes the game to be way more challenging, i've never used but a lot of people said that it is very well done and you can choose what to use (like, you can disable the way your character receives damage [with the mod your character receives 2x or 3x more damage from the enemies] or the XP gain [experience is reduced by default with the mod]). ***There is lot of more i would like to say, but i don't remember everything now. I hope this review help you.Thanks for reading.			"

Personal rating: 8/10DLC: Worth it. They add more to the game with new equipment and quests. The Weapon Bundle gives a nice helping hand for beginners, but NOT overpowered stuff.First thoughts on Kingdoms of AmalurI bought Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning on a 70% Sale and left the game while I played other things and wasn't feeling like giving it a try yet. I wasn't expecting anything spectacular, something Torchlight-Diablo-esque perhaps.Turned out I was wrong.The gameplayKingdoms of Amalur Reckoning has a moderately paced action packed battle where you can roll (or blink if you're a Sorcery user) to dodge and block or parry incoming attacks as long as you have the reflexes.Every type of weapon feels unique and finding one that suits you the best might be a decisive point when you're aiming for a class (or rather, destiny). From swords to scepters, hammer to staves, bows to daggers and even chakrams, nothing is useless here. It may take some getting use to, but every weapon has its charm, its pros and cons. Every weapon has its gimmick and is impressive how different they feel, most of times a different type of weapon requires a different approach in combat.The camera while fighting is somewhat weird, not unbearable but it can get more in your way than the enemies themselves sometimes. The game will focus on whatever hit you and sometimes if the enemy is past behind you the camera may follow him instead of keeping focus on the one you are trying to kill. This show how important is to have a lock-on option in games with such combat system.Terminate with extreme prejudiceOne of the most memorable features of Kingdoms of Amalur is something introduced early for you: Fateshift. Fateshift is the usual ""super mode"" you activate once you gauge is completely filled.Why is it so memorable? The finishing moves, oh dear, the finishing moves.Few games make you feel so powerful like Kingdoms of Amalur does. When you see the first Fateshift finisher, which probably will be on a creature that is times bigger than you, you'll feel like you are unstoppable. And then you'll do it on a human sized enemy and it'll just scream OVERKILL. Nevertheless you probably won't be saving Fateshift too much because you'll want to see every last of the finisher moves, they are THAT awesome.Class building is fun, having unlimited re-specs (for a price) is betterThe game offers a lot of variety with classes and mix-ups every possible combination and you can build your character as you see fit, and if you don't like it you can re-spec as many times as you want. But keep in mind the re-specs WILL get pricey fairly quick (after the 4th re-spec you'll notice). While gold may be easy to come later on, at the beginning it surely isn't.The usual combat approachWant to get in the face of enemy and take everything head on with heavy armor and huge melee weapons? Might is your path.Maybe you like to kill enemies at a safe distance with flashy spells? Sorcery it is then.Or do you prefer backstabs and bows? Finesse is perfect for you.However...Might, Finesse or Sorcery? Why choose only one?Really. Why should you become just a brutish Warrior? Why become a squishy Archer/Assassin? Why become a frail Wizard? Why when you can become a Warrior with magic, an Archer that's as deadly at long range as it is up close, or a Wizard that can use sneaky tricks if magic fails him.Not satisfied? Mix EVERYTHING. Become an Universalist.The best of Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning is how it is possible to mix up EVERY class in the game. There are no boundaries in this game: you can mix Warrior, Thief and Wizard in any way you find better, nothing is stopping you. Doing this will often give you amusing results.Of course that ""pure breed"" classes will have its unique advantages and some powers that only they can access, but mixed classes often have their own bonuses that, with the right gear, will more than make up for those last skills you can't afford.Still about class buildingOne of the aspects I like the most in Kingdoms of Amalur: the complete LACK of status points. No Strenght, no Dexterity, no Intelligence to worry about, no ""status puzzle"" of sorts, just skill points that should be invested in the three skill three which will grant different amounts of HP and MP.A world to explore, quests to doFrom simple quests like ""Kill this"" to ""Bring me that"" to ""Deliver this"" to ""Keep me alive"" to ""Save the damn world"", you'll have your hands full everywhere you go.There are long questlines from specific factions that will grant you a special reward in the end. But with a twist: most of times you have the option to join the ""hero"" or the ""villain"" (opinions may vary) of said questline, and whoever you take the side will grant a different, permanent bonus. Some choices may have a deep impact in your game.Colorful, ""brightful"" and beautifulI normally avoid talking about graphics since opinions about it are arbitrary, but like Just Cause 2, Kingdoms of Amalur has incredible graphics and effects even on its lowest setting.Spell effects are impressive and for once the often overlooked warriors and thieves gains extremely flashy and beautiful skills and attacks to watch, which I must say, is immensely refreshing to see.Complaints, because though great, the game is very far from perfectFirst, look at any review from Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning and you'll find out that everyone says the game is too easy even on Hard. They are not exaggerating, if you pick a Might class and become a tank it won't be long until you realize enemies are barely doing a scratch on you and only the most dangerous, most powerful enemies will pose a threat to you. On the other hand playing as Finesse and Sorcery characters will require care and proper dodge/parry skills as while they can dish, they can't take as well.Indoor scenarios will seem repetitive after a while, especially cave and castle/fortresses ones, they may have different coloring, but that's about it. To make this worse the game has a tendency to grow quiet, musicless, on these areas.Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning has a decent repertory of enemies, but they are not enough. You'll encounter the same kind of enemies in several different areas from the start to the end of the game, some of the human opponents are mere re-skins of other enemies and there are even bosses who are simply overpowered enemies you'll find around, maybe with a gimmick or two, but that's about it.The game also suffers with a problem that will show up for completionists: doing all sidequests will make you level up faster and you might end up reaching the level cap even before you travel to the last country (which is big on its own accord) which can easily frustrate people.Another common complaint is how forgettable the main storyline is. Side quests are much more enjoyable and have many more noteworthy characters with more interesting back stories that most characters from the main story barely seems to have at all. Wrapping upEven with its flaws and problems Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning is a memorable game with a lot of nice characters, nice combat system and interesting quests with a maybe not-so-great main story, but it never fails to deliver what intends to.In the end the saddest thing is that the developer (Big Huge Games) bankrupted and we will never get newer stuff for the game like spears or even bug fixes or a new level cap. And a sequel probably will never come to a light either.			"

												Not a very popular game but I like it very much. One of the best RPG's I have ever played. It deserved to but a greater sucess than it was. Seems it was knocked off the radar with the release of Skyrim, but in many ways I find it a better game to sink time into. Combat is great fun in this game. The world is vast, beatiful and creative with lots of side quests to keep you exploring. The story line is a bit meh and could have been better.  I've put all my skill points into Sorcery which is awesome to play, and can't wait to try the others. I recomend Blacksmithing, Sagecraft, a little stealth (unless you are a Rogue, then lot's), detect hidden and persuasion. Gold is very easy to acculate in the game. Two thumbs for Kingdom of Amalur Reckoning.			"

												This is truly a gem in the rpg genre. Its got everything a rpg should have like:- A open world with, like skyrim guilds to join en other sidequest as you explore- A fun and simple crafting system- Some funny humor and dialog.- Awesome combat, let's you choose what you will become, and you can become alot. Like a mix between a mage and a rogue. - Some clever bossfights- Lots and lots of loot and dungeonsEven the two dlc packs are awesome. But this does have some lame-♥♥♥ fetch this, kill this, retrieve that missions. But most of them are sidequest and can be easly ignored. It takes alot of time to finsh this game and the plentyfull sidequest/guild missions keeps you occupied for some time. So looking for a good action rpg, then picks this game up.			"

												KoA: Reconing is a fantastic, underrated 3rd person, open world RPG.  The game features an excellent plot, huge world, combined with truly customizable character classes.   For those of you who don't know the story behind this game's development, it was founded by Curt Schilling (former MLB pitcher) who was a fan of games when he wasn't playing baseball.  He sunk a ton of his own money into trying to make this game (and franchise) great but in the end it was a bit too ambitious for a startup company and they went bankrupt after releasing the game.  What does this all mean?  Well, it means the game has AAA quality production values but is often overlooked.  In short, it's a hidden gem that most likely will never get a sequel, but is a really well done game. The game's plot and setting are quite good overall.  As part of the world building, bestselling fantasy author RA Salvatore (the creator of Drizzt) wrote over 1000 pages of plot and backstory to make this world come alive.  The result is not your typical generic fantasy world, but a world with a rich history that isn't just the same old elves and orcs all over again.   I enjoyed the plot and setting of the game.  The main plot reveals rather slowly, but the last few chapters of the main plot are quite interesting.  Of course, there are TONS of sidequests and 4 full factions to explore as well, as well as two full expansions that are worth getting. Graphically, the world is very beautiful and some of the cities and outdoor settings are quite unique.   My favorite was the city of Ysa, which was built into the trees.  It's hard to get a sense of the game's graphics due to the 3rd person nature of the game.  Just looking at screenshots doesn't do it justice because your character is always standing in the middle of the screen, but when you can pan the camera around and explore the worlds, it's beautiful.  Level design is also very solid.  There's tons of areas to explore, lots of secrets, and the world map and quest system keeps you from getting lost.   My one complaint about the level design is that your character cannot jump in most places, but can only jump from certain spots.  The game's soundtrack is memorable and sound effects are also high quality, as to be expected.Combat is the main part of the game and luckily, it's very fun.  Unlike most RPGs, you truly are free to design a character that is exactly how you want to play.  You're not penalized for being a hybrid character, in fact you can prettymuch use whatever main and secondary weapons you like along with fighting styles, stealth, and magic skills.  Want to play a mage that wears robes and fights with a big hammer?  Sure, there's spells to boost your armor, heal, and a summons to help distract enemies in combat.  Want to play a stealthy assassin that uses magery to stun from afar.  Go for it!  You can also play a pure fighter, mage, or rogue and enjoy the game that way as well.  It's easy to respec your character when you want to try something different.  There's also a deep crafting system for potions, armor, and magic gems that you can get into or completely ignore.  The game also keeps the crafting skills separate from the combat skills, so you're not forced into going into blacksmithy as a warrior or gemcrafting as a mage, for instance.Fighting enemies themselves is quite fun.  Most regular enemies are pretty easy to destroy, so your character feels quite powerful.  Luckily, the boss fights can be pretty difficult and are very epic!  Be prepared to mow over most weak enemies and have some challenges with the various boss fights.  The game features achievements as well and all of them work.  You can 100% the game in about 70ish hours, in one playthrough.  Luckily, there's a lack of super grindy achievements and a lot of them are fun to get.  You'll need both expansions to 100% the game, but I would highly recommend both expansions as well.  The bundle for the game goes on sale quite often, so pick up the deluxe edition!  There are a few negatives that I must mention.  The number 1 complaint about this game is that it is too easy.  If you do every faction, sidequest, and area in the main game and both expansions, you will reach the level cap far before the end of the plot.  To remedy this, I recommend playing the game on hard mode.  It does not make the game too difficult, it merely balances it out to be about the average difficulty for most games.  Even if you are someone who normally plays games on normal or even easy mode, I highly recommend playing on hard mode so that it's simply not a pushover.   I ended up playing the game for about 13 hours on medium difficulty before deciding it was too easy and starting over.  Just play it on hard to begin with.  There's also an achievment for beating the game on hard mode and if you find the game to be too challenging, you can always just level up or even lower the difficulty if you have to.The game does feature a huge amount of optional sidequests along with 4 factions.  If you do every optional sidequest and kill every enemy that crosses your path, you will be overleveled before the end.  Therefore, I recommend doing   the main plot, all 4 factions, both DLC and a just a few sidequests.  Doing this will keep the game challenging to the end of the main story.  Also, after the main story ends you are still free to continue the game and play all of those sidequests.  The game actually has so much content that you could probably replay a second time doing only sidequests and level up to max.   It is also very easy to outmanuver enemies and run past them, which cuts down on the tedium of killing monsters that respawn after a day or two.  Another complaint I had was that the game tends to reuse enemy graphics quite a bit.  The enemies are well animated, but the game could use a bit more variety.   Finally, the last few areas of the game are pretty difficult and sort of turn into a potion swilling festival.  However, despite these drawbacks, the game is extremely solid overall and highly recommended.  If you enjoy open world style games, this is certainly one to pickup and play.  It has a detailed plot, a well developed world, beautiful graphics, fun combat, epic and challenging bosses, a complex but optional crafting system, truly customizable classes, a variety of powerful weapon choices, and is a huge kingdom to explore for many hours.   Just play on hard mode and don't do every sidequest and you're sure to enjoy this hidden gem of a 3rd person rpg!  If you enjoyed Skyrim, chances are you will like this game.  I would even go as far to say that the combat and boss battles are better in KoA!  Give this game a chance and you'll be glad you did.			"

												Underrated story-driven RPG (console port)Pros: Fun rogue/mage hybrid, good stealth. Good map and dungeon design. Loot feels worthwhile. Every quest is part of a story arc. Good world-building, plenty of details. Decisions have an effect on the game.Cons: Block/stagger mechanic is over-used. Poor PC controls (much better with a controller) Cannot zoom out (can use WideScreenFixer) Only supports XBox controllers (can use x360ce)Game-breaking stuff: Play the game on Hard, otherwise it's too easy. There's an achievement for it, too. Don't enter new areas (loading screen) too early; new zones are locked to your current level. Avoid bonus XP, since it will over-level you too quickly. Don't max out Blacksmithing, it will quickly make all loot redundant. Limit the number of health potions you carry :PIf you're a PC gamer, you might be inclined to try to dodge everything.This can work in late-game, but early on you will need to block more than you dodge.Things you need to know: Block early, block often. It's a console thing. This alone will make the game 50% easier. Be aggressive. The more you hit enemies, the less they hit you (because they are staggered) Don't try to dodge small melee attacks. If you can see the attack, it's too late to dodge in most cases. Dodge is for boss attacks and blinking through enemies. Especially trolls. You can block (or riposte) later than you can dodge. You can block magic, and wolves. Chakrams don't interrupt attacks. Use daggers for that, or stay mid-range. Daggers are awesome. "

												(Played over 300+ hours non-Steam)This game belong in the pantheon of the greatest RPGs ever created!The combat is pretty much Fable, Skyrim & God of War put into 1 game with a wonderful execution, the most enjoyable combat system that I have ever come across.The world is huge and encourages you to explore it - there is a lot of lore present & quite a lot of interesting characters too. Also, the characters have a LOT to say, and it seems that every voice (which are a lot) are all different & it brings out a lot of immersion. A lot of variety in the areas you can visit too, you have deserts, plains, marshes, canyons and what not.Almost nothing bad about this game, perhaps sometimes a bit texture pop-in, some boring fetch quests & characters that look-a-like, but the story is thick & it has literally 1000s of side-quests. You can buy houses, explore big cities, craft & more! Everything you want in a RPG!It has a great ton of customization that allows you to change your skills & magic abilities on the fly, always be able to go with per example a Templar - using Magic & Heavy armor, or a Sorcerer, fully magic specced with robes & chakrams (Xena's weapons!) or a Thief, wielding light weapons with hints of magic - it is literally ALL possible!There are many weapons too, Daggers, Bows, Fae Blades, Greatswords, Hammers, Sceptres, Staffs, Chakrams, and more that I cannot remember. It has any weapon you could think of in an  - and I did not even mention the magical abilites which are very numerous & work well together.It also has a GREAT crafting mechanic that will have you searching all corners of the world for things to use, and as I said, it encourages it. Combined with the crafting mechanic itself is also sagecrafting - that allows you to create gems to use with equipment to enhance stats.All in all, this is probably one of the best RPGs that I have ever played. It's a truly, really commendable game that every RPG lover should play!Personal score: 9/10Best regards,Dukhat			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: RPG; Action; Story-Rich; Epic Fantasy; Adventure My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 50-150 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Fantasy buffs REVIEWKingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™ is a highly underrated, and truly epic, action-RPG.  Boasting hours and hours of content, it is loaded with a rich narrative and plenty of lore aspects to intrigue the fantasy buff in you.  It also has great RPG elements that will keep you striving to evolve your character. So if you enjoy that type of thing, and want to get immersed in a humongous game, then you should give this some consideration.  The graphics are absolutely charming; and the gameworld is massive, variable, and captivating. It is very fun to explore the environments in search of loot and lore.  The controls are fluid and intuitive, and the combat is exciting and flexible. And the whole experience flows very naturally, so it is the type of game that is easy to get caught up in for hours on end.There are tons of things to do and places to explore.  There is also a myriad of lore in the game and many NPCs to have extensive dialogues with. If you enjoy delving deep into the worlds of fantasy games, you’ll have plenty to work with.  There is also a huge variety of different enemies to vanquish, so your bloodlust should be satiated as well.  There are plenty of levels to be gained, abilities to be learned, items to loot, and armor sets to (try to) complete.  And there are over 200 quests, or far more if you pick up the DLC.  In short: it is undeniably an RPG of epic proportions. Moreover, considering it can easily last 100+ hours, the developers did a good job diversifying the content so it doesn’t grow too stale towards the end.One exceptionally cool feature of the game is that you can freely respec as often as you want and change between mage, warrior, and rouge classes (or cross-class combinations thereof).  This helps keep things fresh through the lengthy campaign, and prevents you from having to pick a single playstyle for the entire game.There are also a couple of DLC campaigns available for Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™. They are both quite lengthy and add a very large amount of content to the experience. I definitely recommend picking up the whole package, however be prepared for a game that will take about 150 hours for completionists.So Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™ is undeniably epic, massive, and downright fun.  If you enjoy huge RPGs like Skyrim or Dragon Age: Origins then you will probably enjoy this, perhaps lesser known, but similar, game.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE: Despite my game time, I actually finished this game on the Xbox360INTRODUCTION:Kingdoms of Amalur is a single player RPG developed by Big Huge Games with 38 Studios for both Console and the PC. One of the notable personalities involved in its development is former Major League Baseball player and known avid World of Warcraft subscriber Curt Schilling, the founder of 38 Studios.The game places you in the role of the “Fateless One”, a mysterious character who was recently resurrected back from the dead and discovers a new found power to change destiny itself. Travel the land of Amalur in search of answers on why you were recalled back into the land of the living and at the same time, learn more about a great war in the east against an immortal race called the Tuatha Deohn and why they want you dead...again.PROS:+ Beautiful Graphics, models, animation and special effects+ Stunning scenery, levels and environment+ Healthy game time that doesn't get too boring+ Expansive world which rewards exploration with...+ Good loot, item and weapon variety+ Fun combat regardless of the class you're playing+ Crafting system is deep but easy to understand+ Class System is VERY extensive (want to make a warhammer wielding wizard that's good with stealth? Then why not? This game lets your cross-class as much as you want.)+ Good enemy design and variety+ Lots of fun side quests (Also a CON)+ Fun and relatively long DLC story (Legend of Dead Kel was fun for me)+ Nice, straight forward story that is complicated enough to not get boring, but simple enough to follow.CONS:- Way too EASY, even on the hardest difficulty. This is possibly the BIGGEST CON of the game (There is a mod to fix this and I have provided it in the comment section below)- Player customization is very limited- Some forgettable npc characters- Too many side quest (Also a PRO) that levels you up too quickly even before you reach the end of the game, this results in...- Boredom will set in after max level, specially if you max out before the final stage- Money becomes irrelevant really quickly- Generic world and story- Massive map with NO MOUNT (Jogging Simulator 2011)CONCLUSION:It's a NICE RPG game that provides several hours of entertainment. If you have an itch for an MMORPG but can't be bothered with the complications of playing with other people, then this game is right up your alley.The game boast a very beautiful and colorful art style, enjoyable levels and scenery with a fun combat mechanic. The game play gets boring at times because the difficulty curve is too easy and provides no challenge. It has a big expansive map with lots of places to explore, but gets tedious because of the lack of mount. Still, all in all, I can easily RECOMMEND this game while on sale.  If MMORPG games are Cigarettes, then Kingdoms of Amalur is the Nicotine Patch.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Pros: So many quests, side quests, never ending tasks, and faction quests.  The amount of stuff to do and travel in this game is massive.  Beautiful level designs, scenery, and colors create a visual fantasy experience.  Works well for a game controller.  Voice acting is decent.  The music is pretty good, too.  The Battle of Mel Senshir was the some of the most awesomeish boss battle ever in game history.Cons: Crazy camera angles that will leave you. Game difficulty, even on hard, is moderate to easy.  I don't think some tasks end.  The menus could be easier to navigate through. Repetitive dungeon levels.Major Con: Terrible, run of the mill main story line (You're the chosen one, must save the worlf from invading army storyline) wrapped in a burrito of everyone has a fate except you, the fateless one.  The side quests had more interesting plots than the main storyline.			"

												Got this game the one time when it was a daily deal in March 2013. This was the only time it was on a discount other than it was first released on Steam. I would prefer the Steam version than the Origin version because of Steam Achievies and Steam Cloud. An easy underatted game because of the the lack of discounts. Don't let that stop you though. Fun gameplay in terms of action and RPGness. Along the same lines of Fable where you create and customize your character throughout the game. Do yourself a favor and not overlook this game because of the price. I would say wait for a sale but for this game, it doesn't appear to happen often.			"

												Pros 'n Cons style.Pros:Great graphics.Great combat.Neat skill system.Good item system.Lots of dungeons.Good engine. (Exceptional performance on good to moderate hardware.)Looks great at 3840x2160.LOTS of content.Good voice acting.(Personally, I think it's beautiful, and has grrrreat animation quality.)Cons:No classical targeting system.No jump except at certain spots.Tons of invisible cockblock walls.Developer company and IP are effectively dead, mostly due to financial mismangement and a couple Rhode Island politicians that  are apparently soapy baby weiners. (Google ""Curt Shilling Rhode Island and the fall of 38 studios"" it's the NYTimes article.)Due to the massive content it tends to run a bit shallow.Graphical style is very good, but stylized, so may not be everyone's cup of tea.No reasonable mod support.Camera and general camera controls are both fully ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.A few bugs here and there that'll NEVER be fixed. (E.g quest log disappearing due to font scaling and 4k res.)Ultimately, it's a solid game, and really COULD have been ""The Next Big Thing"" but...yeah, read the article.Regardless, I recommend it. You'll know if you'll like it within the first hour or so.			"

												Kingdoms of Amalur: ReckoningI have previously played a fair amount of this on Xbox, I am pleased to confirm this is not a bad port for the PC but would be better using a controller. Overall it's good enough, and shouldn't be over-looked beacuse of the native console settings.This game deserves the attention of any & all RPG fans, especially those who enjoy well versed fan-fiction & character art. The experience throughout the game delivers those elements not only consistently, but excellently; as well as any other I’ve played that never removed the presence of inquisition and curiosity. Delving dungeons, collecting loot – slaying mobs & basking shamelessly in NPC related debauchery. KoA:R strikes each node of the game’s fabric as a finely hit note under a bard’s fingers. KoA:R was unfortunately somewhat of a casualty, only in the sense that it did not rise above some other unnamed releases at the same time of its own decent onto the shelves. That said, those who have played the game will no doubt recommend it faster than they would other titles played in the same genre. There is a wealth of lore, items & art in the game that is unmeasurable against some of those other games you may list out next to KoA. The type that comes from the most experienced & creativity proficient in the business – combining the talents of R.A Salvatore (One of my most influential and favourite authors) & Todd McFarlane (needs no introduction) the story and the world that holds it has been extruded into an exquisite universe contained onto this game. Game developers usually spend decades writing & elevating this amount of content and lore into a functioning, well balanced & infinitely fun game. There are few areas where KoA flounders; fortunately, these areas do not impact so far as to deter the player away at any time. The inventory system There are 3 schools of fighting that your hero can choose to be disciplined in; Might, Finesse & Sorcery – you are not bound to any one skill line at any time, but may want to be more heavily balanced towards one for equipment requirements. That said, a mix of 2 or even all 3 really makes the combat new and doesn’t go stale from using the same abilities and slaying enemies in a linear, uniform pattern. Each tree will grant you 3 points per level to spend freely in either tree. There’s even a respec feature in the game where you can ‘re-write’ your fate and change your play style if you grow bored or have a change of heart with your skill.The campaign offers 10-12 hours of gameplay if you’re strictly ignoring the heaps of side-quests. Add those and DLC, there is well over 100+ hours for you to get your ample fill. Some parts become tedious as there is no great way to get around the massive map so playing systematically, almost like an MMO can wear you down as the player or give you a real grind element to the game. This will sate an itch for a lot of gamers but create black holes for others and can alter the players overall experience. On sale, this game is a steal given it has more content than many new AAA titles and belongs in a lot of gamer’s library with all the features & replay-ability.7.5/10 "

												To be honest, when I bought the game I wasn't expecting much from this game. The screenshots looked nice and I am a huge RPG fan. So I bought it when it was on one of those typical Valve Season Sales.This game is just great. It entertained me over 80 hours (well perhaps about 75 hours, the rest of my gameplay is menu idleing while reading guides or wiki). I saw many reviews comparing this with Skyrim, but be honest, they are very different.Soundtrack is very nice. Background music gives great atmosphere, but sadly there are a lot of soundbugs. I didn't hear any background music in the last 20 hours of gameplay. Sometimes sound of my characters battle voices and those of my weapons disappear. Only fix I managed to think about was restarting the game.The voice acting was nice. Although there are not that many voice actors, but they were doing a good job.You can develop your character in different ways. You can chose between three different skill trees, basicly that is the decision between Knight, Rogue and Sorcerer. But you can play any combination of those as well. Your skill tree will determine what weapons you will use. I played with the Rogue skill tree because I like stealthy approaches, and the dagger and faeblades you find are really nice and very fast. Great in combination with a bow for range attacks.You can make tons of side quests and task. After completing the game and both DLCs I managed to complete over 200 quests (including the main quest). Combat is very repetitive. When you know how it works, it gets very very easy and you will fight almost the same every time. I played the game on hard. The first 10 levels were hard, because of bad equipment and stupidity ;) But after that it was very easy. Maybe I died 20 times during the remaing 30 levels. Very nice was the fact, that NPCs you have to follow or are your companions don't run slower than you. They run at least as fast as you, sometimes even a little faster, but they are waiting if you get too far away. The only thing I really hated in this game was the camera. You cannot control the FOV. It adjust automatically to your current situation. Zooms out when there is an enemy far away. Gets closer if not. But sometimes this stupid camera drops below earth and all you see is dirt.Or in cutscenes you will see just a wall or a shoulder of a total different NPCsAll in all a very nice RPG. Go get it when it is on sale. Take your time doing all side quests and you will be entertained for a long time.			"

												This is a review that's going to make me very sad. A sad tiger is not a sight people should have to witness, but nonetheless, hear the tale of the tigers' lament. Hear the tale of the RPG that once was, and will never be. The tale of Amalur.Kingdoms of Amalur was pitched as a wide, sprawling, epic world. Written by R. A. Salvatore and artwork by Todd McFarlane, this was a world where big names came together to produce an impressive, colourful vista. One where grand battles were fought, where the history of races was told in rich tapestries and stories of lore. Where gnomes were no longer the comedy option (World of Warcraft, yes, you, stop hiding in the back there, this is you I speak to at this point!). A world where the strings of fate invisibly guided everything and everyone around them, and those who could read the weave could fortell glimpses of the future.The story revolves around the antagonist, one who has managed to unpick the very threads of fate, and the protaganist, you, similarly freed from fate, and your journey from the rags on your back (and the start which sees you unceremoniously dumped in a pile or corpses), to eventual confrontation with the evil that threatens to consume the world. The story has been told many times in many other games, but it is presented with a style and sheen that carries itself well here, the core plot quests keep a coherency and pace that maintain your interest through the rather lengthy world. Not to mention the absolute *ton* of side quests and factions you can involve yourself in, and their own stories and backgrounds, all of which are intricately details and have their own little plot twists. This is a game that prides itself on depth.... Right up until you step into it and realise that this was probably intended as an MMO. It... takes a bit of a mental adjustment to begin with, because the world, and everything in and around it, feels at first -like- an MMO made singleplayer, there's the vendors, the towns, the crafting system, in fact, so little of it feels single player tailored you'd be forgiven for asking ""Where are all the other players?"". Once you begin the combat however, that slowly fades into the background, combat in the game is intuitive, flashy, and visceral, with a wide variety of weapons, and a constant encouragement to alternate between magic and weapon attacks, this is a game that rewards variety and creative use of your toolset.Get over that initial mental bump however, and you'll quickly settle into a large, expansive game, with a wide and diverse world, which okay, will oft remind you that it does feel like an MMO minus the other players, but then equally it will take you places and on journeys that a lot of Roleplaying games have almost forgotten how to manage these days. It's a wonderful thing.This unfortunately is why I am a sad tiger. The company that made this game is now bankrupt, and the assets have been sold off and everything connected to it, scattered to the four winds. There will not be a sequel, or an MMO, or any further patches or adjustments. The final product is what you get here, with a few idiosyncracies and all. It is a flawed gem, but a gem nonetheless. If you wish to get lost in a world for a few days and embark on a properly epic journey, visiting Amalur is definitely a place to consider.			"

												In 25 hours of gameplay time, I cleared out 8 regions out of 30 odd total regions. I don't feel like I'm progressing at all even though I'm at level 20. Game's original design being a MMORPG shows a lot and makes the game a huge timesink.Let's proceed to the pros and cons:Pros:-Good combat with interesting skills.-Artsyle is pretty good and immersive.-Lorestones are lovely with those pretty good ballads.-Character faces, bodies and animations are pretty good when compared to the something like Skyrim, but it's a result of game's aesthetic design.-Wonderfully crafted lore by R.A Salvatore.-Unique items actually mean something and finding one of them is very rewarding again unlike Skyrim.-Skill system is intriguing and allows many versatile gameplay choices. (Although I went with full might because Amalur belongs to the Nords!)-A good variety of combos.Cons:-Towns are huge immersion breakers. They consist of three buildings and people sleeping on the inn halls. Also filler NPC's that give generic answers don't sleep at all.-There aren't enough dialogue options and having a high persuasion skill usually means better loot for the quest. (But one time, I managed to end a quest with it. NPC said ""But you had to die"" I said ""But I don't want to die"" then he went ""Oh, ok then."" that was great and hilarious.)-Too many shallow side quests with little variety. Gets very very repetitive and that's one of the major reasons I'm done playing KoA:R.-Regions are connected through narrow roads and you can't discover the sides of these roads. Instead of feeling like an open world game as it aimed, it becomes a network of regions.-No horses, no way to go through one end of the map to the other quickly. You're dependant on fast travel.-Enemies that you kill on the roads spawn back too quickly and it rather becomes a tedious task.-Not much diversity on enemy types.-Enemies do not have origins. Why Kobolds are Kobolds? Why Ettin are Ettin? Is their sole purpose of being in the game is getting killed by the player?Grand Finale:Game is good, I can't bring myself to play to the end but for these 25 hours was pretty fun and I never felt so engaged to a game since Skyrim. But seeing that I'm at 25 hours and only completed 8 regions, I thought that I should stop. This was not a decision taken by boredom, in fact never felt boredom playing this game but it seemed like the logical thing to do. If you have time and like RPG games it's a must play. Even if you don't have enough time to complete the game you should play it for the atmosphere until you feel it becomes repetitive. For this kind of experience, this game is dirt cheap.I feel like if the dev team had time, money and it wasn't built upon a failed MMO project, it could have been a great game. Unfortunately Big Huge Games bankrupted after low sales of this game, so we're not getting any kind of sequel. It's a damn shame because the world of Amalur is so immersive and has enormous potential as an universe.			"

Had to start rushing just to see what happens in the main story. Sidequests and guild quests are ending up the most boring thing. It's nice to have a huge quanity. But varietion start feeling way too poor very early. Invisible walls in an open world design. It's not too bad, but it's a bit stupid some times.It's recommended. Especially during special offers.

												You will hear many bad things about this game - That it's mediocre, that it's a singleplayer MMO, so on and so on.Well, they might not be wrong, but the good outweights the bad by the landslide.You play as a ""Fatemancer"" of sorts, in addition to your own class of choosing (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, etc)The combat is simply amazing. Satisfying. Fluid. Especially the aforementioned ""Fate"" attacks which include stunning visuals.The weapons are awesome as well, even normal weapons can be imbued with elements, not to mention some rare and awesome items like that spooky organic sword i got one time.Speaking of visuals, graphically the game is gorgeous and colorful  - especially the magic.You can also craft items and purchase housing with further upgrades.The ""MMO"" parts comes from the ""fetch quests"", but i don't dislike those. As for other quests, there are many of them, including ""Guild"" questlines.I rate the game Two E's out of Two.			"

												Good old-school Action/RPGPROs- Huge world: it is a MMO turned Single Player, so you get huge areas and countless quest hubs- Class system allows lots and lots of different Character builds- Fast travel to avoid running too much around- Longevity: 60-70 hours needed to complete it- DLCs are worth the money (do not forget it is EA!)- Awesome actions/skills- Crafting allows a lot of customization of gearCONs- Repetitive dungeon design: after you have visited 5, you've seen them all- Recycled enemy design: same mobs in all areas- Too many sidequests: you will end up overlevelled pretty soon- Main quest is quite boring, expected better from R.A. Salvatore- Too many item drops vs. small inventory = lots of travelling to sell trash- Menu design- Too easy, even on Hard modeA word of advice: if you are looking for a RPG experience stay away from crafting. Crafting (Blacksmith + Sagecraft) allows to create EXTREMELY powerful items, which will make you Char hit with skills for hundreds of thousands of dmg, while mobs have probably 3000hp to say the most. You can easily oneshot every boss in the game too, all while having 99.9% damage reduction, making it trivial			"

												I really enjoyed this game. It feels like it was designed for people who like RPG's, but want more involved action type combat. I would definitely recommend this game if you enjoy action RPG's and exploring new worlds. It's a shame that the studio went down the way they did, but this game I felt was definitely worth my time.Pros:CombatLootInteresting Sidequests and StoriesLeveling SystemArtController support (if you like that, I played with both, it was better with PC just because of more binds I could use)Deep fleshed out world. I really liked the Lore in this game.Lots of Quests ( I did every quest except for the ""Collect XYZ"" quests, and that took me about 60 hours.Choice (It's not as deep as some games, but you can make choices that have different outcomes in the world)Bosses (Had some interesting boss fights, including the last one, although not too difficult on normal setting)Voice Acting (I liked the voices of the characters, although your character has no voice, I prefer it this way)Cons:Character Creation/Customization (not a big deal for me personally but bare bones here)Bugs (There are some serious bugs that ruined quest lines for me. They occur rarely, but it didn't take too much away from the experience for me)Main Quest Story is OK (I enjoyed it, even the end boss is pretty fun, but the epilogue after feels short and unpolished)Can be grindy (Lots of the quests are the same, but the stories for the side quests were often interesting and kept me wanting to get to the next town/area to find new quests and solve problems)Combat (Although the combat is fun, it's easy to become over powered if you figure out ways to spam certain attacks. It's not a HUGE flaw, but the balance could be better)Voices (Although the acting is good, you hear the same voices over and over again.)All in all I would recommend if you're looking for an RPG to play while waiting for something else. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.			"

												To sum it up: I paid 9.99 for this game,  and I felt I've gotten my money's worth, easily.  Overall Impressions: For looks and general feel - in one sentence, I'd describe it as the b**tard child of Torchlight and Skyrim.  It feels like it has borrowed something from both.  It feels like a game that was, at one point, to be grander and bigger than it ended up being; potentially interesting lore feels a bit stilted and half-told  (or, oddly sometimes OVERtold) at times, the music is occasionally good but most often forgettable.  If you've ever been really taken somewhere else by an amazing track - some of the Skyrim music, or the Nagrand themes from Warcraft, if I name two personal favourites -  you will not find that experience replicated here musically.  I found the starting area the worst as it seemed to be very limited in tracks - once I moved out into the world more, things seemed to improve.While it's less cartoon-like and lighthearted than Torchlight, it is far more static, less vibrant and fluid than Skyrim - but there are aspects to both that came to mind while playing this.Cinematics are limited, as are camera angles, and movement over the map in general - designated ""jump down spots"", inability to climb over/around objects, etc. will be obvious to you if you're the kind of person who killed mounts in Skyrim until you modded them to be invulnerable, because you're going to go over the mountain YOUR way, and that's that.In fact, you won't be on a mount at all - but in compensation, the fast travel feature is made available very early on, and the map fills up with quite a few waypoints. As a single-player game, it's MMO roots - while generally hidden - do show from time to time, if only in the vague sense of feeling like the world feels a bit -emptier- than one might expect.   There's thankfully a dearth of overly ""grindy"" quests (kill 100 of this to get 50 of that), but there's also skills that feel fairly usless (crafting gems, more on that below), and make you wonder if, had this been an MMO, had there been high-end/group content, they'd have become more beneficial.More specific comments/aspects:General gameplay - the game is stable enough, but I have found more than a handful of buggy quest issues - quests that don't complete correctly and can't be fixed without a rollback to an earlier save. Items that when used, don't spawn the map point related to them, little things like that.However, unless you're dead set on a particular item or quest, you will find levelling in this game so fast that you WILL outlevel quests and gear very easily.  Particularly if you tend to build up your fate bar quickly, for XP gains, and/or drink experience potions - it's going to fly by.Combat - for me it's PRO OR CON, depending on what you want: combat is fun - flashy, satisfying - but I definitely would not call it challenging. The visuals are entertaining, and at times funny, and while I appreciate a game that makes you AIM attacks and spells properly, I also feel you pretty much hit the ground overpowered (at least on normal).  On the upside, being able to respec and play with talent combos is a no-brainer, and only a minor investment even fairly early on in the levels.  Improvements to the character and various perks are generously offered through quest lines, challenges, discoveries, etc.Loot - You'll end up with so many epics and set pieces that you will be bored with it after a point.  However, said loot is not all it's cracked up to be (see notes below on talents).  Weapon choices are many, loot is generous, and with the freewheeling respec potential via the fateweavers, you can easily change the entire path your character is taking anytime you see fit, just to try out something cool that's dropped.Talents -  To some extent, the talents you choose can cause the loot aspect to really fall short, because if you choose to skill up blacksmithing and gemcrafting as early as I did, it only takes a few lucky salvages for components before you're going to make gear for yourself that far, far outshines the very best drops you get, the vast majority of the time, and since there's no point in the game where you can disenchant purple/epic or yellow/set items, much of that ends up in your stash, or vendored.   You can name the gear you craft, which is occasionally entertaining.Socketing gems is something they obviously intended the player to do, as beyond a certain level, socketed items drop regularly, but even there, no item that's dropped with open sockets has come close to crafted gear, since - once skilled up - you can use gems as part of the blacksmithing process. Detect hidden is surprisingly lucrative, leading to extra gold - but also stashes of loot, secret doors, and ultimately opening up items on the map that would take time to hunt down otherwise.One aspect that I DID find fun, and a bit more interesting (having played a rogue-type character in multiple games for years), is the stealth ability - without resorting to invisibility potions, you are forced - especially until you're skilled up - to pay real attention to the direction in which your target is facing, the patterns in which they move or change direction, etc. In short - it's easy to learn, easy to play, generally smooth, fun to look at, and (in a good way), easy to put down. I've no regrets about buying it on sale, and while I'm not sure it screams ""second playthrough"", I can only give it a thumbs up for a generally entertaining - if imperfect - rpg experience.I hope that's useful to someone. Recommended, yes.			"

												A Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™ Personal Rating - ( 12/10 ) Must buy Classic!!! Great storyline, lots of quests, very very big and beautiful world to explore, great graphics !I will still continue my Journey until i achieve everything :)So another 80+ hours on 'HARD'. (Just for one achievment lol)CONS? (have any? well unfortunetly yes)Lack of Multiplayer - Game made for Multiplayer / CO-OP...but you won't find this in game menu....( [/i]SHAME ON YOU DEVS[/i]Music/Soundtrack... - Tragically, the music/soundtrack was far less polished. Maybe they ran out of funds? The sound just isn’t relevant to the rest of this great game, and doesn’t compare to the rest of the entertainment production. Tons of side-quests... - The side-quests....Yessss..Ohhhh YESSSS.....You will find tons of them in Amalur....Good? depends on how you want to go through the game, in this case, performing all the side-quests ( tons of them out there ) will make you 0verpower3d Mut4nt and the game will be just too easy and boring, even on “hard” ( Basically... you will enter the opponents as the Bee Gees in leggings ). Other way ( I think is better one ). Other way is sticking to the main tasks and the three ""main"" storylines, (House of Ballads / Scholia Arcana / Travelers)  to have some challenge from our enemies, and to enjoy the game as long as possible! You will feel pleasure slowly developing your character, and the satisfaction of gaining experience after a difficult battle... ( what else do you need )I hope that all Action RPGs will be like this one in future :)			"

												(most of my hours in this game are on Origin, not Steam)A lot of users compare this game to Skyrim, when really it is more like a single-player mix of Torchlight II and Guild Wars 2. Tons of missions, deep crafting, combo-friendly combat, a huge game-world and genuinely interesting lore means a lot of time can be spent in Amalur. Installed size on hard drive (with all DLC): 11.6 GBReckoning is rather like a single-player MMO, if that makes any sense. Looting, crafting and leveling are the primary attractions. There is a ton of loot; putting points into the “detect hidden” skill reveals secret rooms and passageways that have even more loot. You'll want to loot as much as you can, even armor sets that you won't use – put points into blacksmithing, disassemble the armor and weapons you don't want to get the parts, and craft something truly epic. Leveling up provides new abilities, new special moves for weapons. At the end of each leveling session, you get to choose a “Fate Card” with special bonuses. Fate Cards are not class-specific, meaning you can use them to create a warrior mage who equips heavy armor, or an archer can wield heavy weapons, or a thief / rogue who also has some magic. There are dozens of hybrid “Fate Cards.” And if you're not happy with how your build has turned out, visit a Fateweaver to “Remix your Fate” and reset your build so you can level up again with your existing points.The world is huge. There are a lot of places to explore with side-missions hidden everywhere. The graphics are 2012 era DirectX 9: Colorful, bright, and occasionally low-res. The general comic-book style of the artwork hides some graphical shortcomings. And on the plus side, if you have a less-than-stellar gaming PC, the game will probably run just fine. (Back in the day, I ran it on a 1GB Radeon 6670 without issues). The soundtrack by Grant Kirkhope catches the ambiance nicely. The voice acting is generally good (though your hero is silent, a la Dragon Age Origins).Not everything is excellent, unfortunately. Combat flows well, encouraging the use of different moves. Despite the many different skills and abilities at my disposal, once I found a way to dispose of mobs, I just stuck to that, and never really tried to change up my attacks. I won't say combat is easy – if you go into an area under-leveled, you'll die fast (even with potions). But once you're comfortable in the system, combat becomes just another chore. Fetch quests are repetitive. All exploration is done on foot – no horses. The dungeons are NOT copy / pasted; there's a lot of variety here. But the missions that use the dungeon and cave levels tend to follow similar patterns. If you try to do a completionist run of Reckoning, you'll need a titanic level of patience and dedication. Inventory management, frankly, s*cks. Oh, and jumping. You can't jump, except at prescribed places (“press F to jump”).Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a great game if you love messing about in an open world while worrying about plot later. If you're looking for a go-anywhere, do-anything adventure (with the freedom to jump wherever you want), you'll probably be happier with Skyrim. Or online with friends in Guild Wars 2. Sometimes, though, a solitary, easy grind for loot is exactly what you want - and exactly what Reckoning provides.On DLC:The Weapons and Armor DLC provides three complete weapons sets that are accessible at the start of the game. While great to have, the things you craft will quickly surpass them in quality and effectiveness. The Teeth of Naros and The Legend of Dead Kel are both large additions to an already massive game. Each provides a new campaign and entirely new areas to explore. Naros in particular is a great piece of DLC. Both have a lot of content in an industry where content-laden DLC are rare. Definitely worth it to get both.Notes:An EA account is NOT required. Though the game asks for an EA login on startup, you can simply click the X in the corner to skip the login. The game will play and save normally.The company that developed Reckoning, 38 Studios, went bankrupt in 2013. The only support for the game is what you will find when trawling the forums.			"

												A great fantasy RPG to invest your time. It's not on the same level as Skyrim but it's still fun and worth playing.Pros:+ Great story: It's sort of a multitude of stories mashed together to create the background of the world you're playing in.+ Character freedom: Develop your character as the game proceeds with attributes from the following classes (mage, rogue, warrior) by spending points at every level.+ Lots of side quests to choose from.+ Wide selection of weapons and armor to forge and enhance.Cons:- Horrible camera angles at times especially during some scenes that leaves you wondering ""wth just happened"".

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is by far one of the best RPG's I have ever played. For me it's a solid 9/10, i really enjoyed the main quests and character development through out the story. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RPG's similar to Fable. The thing that makes this game stand out from the crowd is the combat which blew me away. I still have hundreds of hours of side quests and things to do haha so there is plenty of content to go through.What makes it a 9/10+The combat is amazing +Huge variety of armour and weapons+Large amount of content+The gameplay feels fluid and smooth+No frame rate issues on my low end laptop+Bugs are rare+Amalur is huge and the scenery is amazing+So many skills and abilities +Character customisation+Animations are so badassThe reason why it's not a 10-The game becomes too easy when you have good gear-No relationships, no wife to polish your armour -Can only jump in areas with a button promt-Invisible walls			"

												One of the best games I've ever played.I bought this during winter sale, without any expectations. Installed, started and played for about half an hour. Loved the art style and startup. Ran into an (almost) game breaking bug. Applied for a refund. Heart said to try it out again. Tried with KB/M and it worked flawlessly. Took the chance and cancelled the refund request. That my friends, was the best decision I made.This game has changed me. With engaging story (Looking at  you, Skyrim), Interesting characters and beautiful world, I was hooked. The soundtrack is really good and the world feels alive (kind of). Not a good writer so I'll keep this short. Pros:+ Really good Story+ Interesting and annoyingly good characters+ Many Boss and Mini-Boss fights+ Unique art style+ Good controls for both KB/M and Controller+ Will teach you about life (really)+ Crafting+ Multiple classes, which you can change anytime via skill reset OR merge two of them (recommended)+ Funny dialogues+ Really Easy even on Hard (Depends on you)+ Different type of environments+ Huge Open World+ So many side quests (Many are too good)+ Choice based dialogue system (doesn't affect ending though)+ Really Good DLCsCons:- Slightly un-optimized - Does have some game breaking bugs (I never encountered one)- Easy (Again depends on you)Overall, I whole heartily recommend this game. Buy the complete collection with DLC and you won't regret this. I'm sad that we won't see a sequel, but with the size of the world, we may not need it. I rank this game in my top 3 games, with Half Life 2 and STALKER.Finally, I have to say this. Better then Skyrim in many aspects. 10/10. "

												What can I say about Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning?  It is an absolute and criminal shame that the company who put this game together dissolved before they could make a sequel.  The story line is decadent and entertaining, and the world has been robbed of a beautiful and engaging series by virtue of developers' bankruptcy.  Still, the only extant offering in the Kingdoms of Amalur series is definitely worth the price to play.  The game devs did not reinvent the wheel with regards to the RPG genre, but their ascendency comes from the wholly customizable class system.  Ever feel limited by the restrictive class system of other games?  Ever feel like your plate-wearing badass would also have access to sneaky, sneaky rogue tactics unavailable to your class?  Ever wonder if your mage would be just as adept at wielding a swords as at wielding magicks?  KoA allows you that opportunity and more with an imaginative and unique system that rewards your playstyle, whatever that might be, and if at anytime you regret your choice, just visit one of the many fateweavers in the game and change it all, for a token sum of coin of course.  Equally inventive are the skills, which are accessible regardless what ""class"" you've rolled.  All skills have utility: Alchemy makes potions ranging from health and mana to enchancing various types of damage done or reducing that received, blacksmithing creates armor and weaponry for every build, sagecrafting shapes gems to enhance your gear further, and those are just the tip of the iceburg.  Persuasion is decidedly worth the investment, but lockpicking is not, as only a skill point or two will carry you through the game, particularly as lockpicks are plentiful and the minigame is not difficult.  Speaking of difficulty, anyone just picking up the game would be well served to play it on the hardest difficulty setting; I was advised by a review to do so and never regretted it, as few of the encounters will shred your nerves, even on the hard.  If you want hard, go play Dark Souls.  If you want a fun take that shows the potential of what role playing games truly could be, try KoA.  This game is vast, with tons of quests and things to do in Amalur, helping the good people (or not, if you so choose).  I've spent over 200 hours in the game thus far, and there's plenty to indulge your completionist side.  Right now I'm seeking out the few remaining achievements after my first full play through.  The ending was a little lackluster, as though they ran out of time and money to finish the game properly, but the journey itself was rewarding.  Bottom line, for what it's likely to cost you to acquire this game, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a steal, but the real theft is that it's the only one of its line.			"

												It's one of my favorite games(this review is based on base game without DLC)+ graphics+ story and lore+ fighting is a blast+ plenty of different enemies+ huge open world (nearly 100 hours and I haven't even beat the whole game or seen the whole map)+ character customization+ impressive looking weapons (especially the greatswords)+ haven't played the DLC but I hear they are good+ tons of quests (you think you've done every quest? doubt it)+/- so much to do and some people might say TOO much to do- there are a few bugs throughout the game that might hinder your progress (save often with F5)- no targeting.  there will be plenty of times where you are swinging at nothing.  not a big deal, though- the camera is wonky (try Widescreen Fixer if the camera bugs you)The biggest downside is the fact that there is little possibility for a sequel, which makes a lot of people sad :(			"

												The very definition of a hidden gem. The premise behind this game is that it's an offline MMORPG, you wouldn't think it could work but ,boy, it does. Its story is nothing new and fetch quests abound but the lore brings everything to life. The world is interesting and every map-space is unique. The combat system is amazingly fluid. Plus, the game allows you to essentially rebuild your character mid-playthrough, thus saving the trouble of multiple playthroughs to try all the character builds. The difficulty is funny though, you can get pretty broken pretty quickly in this game. Then again, you're the chosen one after-all, why shouldn't you face-melt everything you meet? lol. If that's not your thing though, there's the YSA mod that will fix the difficulty issue, making it more fair. The 2 DLCs [Dead Kel + Naros, let's pretend the armor bundle doesn't exist] are worth getting as well, both introduce a new world-space to explore that are equally unique in their own rights. To sum up, would have been the next Skyrim if not for the existence of Skyrim.			"

												The most awesome flawed RPG gem of all times. It could have been one of the most successful franchises ever but well... The real bad - the infamous running bug started at approx. 50h of gameplay. The good - the game is so great that I kept playing like this for 100h more. This bug won't be fixed because the original team is gone long time ago. At first, it was ruining my game experience until I got used to it. (Some claim that if you reload a previous save you could fix this movement bug but I had no luck with this). Regardless this, it's one of the best A-RPGs I played - fighting combos, superb story with little stories with catchy dialogues, gorgeous visuals, crafting, mini games, tons of loot, it has it all and it never gets boring. There was never - and it won't be - a broken game that I will play till the end, and then some. All in all, don't hesitate picking it up for a bargain price - you will at least have 50h of fun			"

												First and foremost, this game is MASSIVE. The main questline itself is somewhat on the short side, but when you combine it with the sheer number of side stories and quests that are available, well... I think looking at the number of hours I've spent playing it speaks for itself. It's worth noting that though this is a strictly single-player game, it has a very MMO-like feel to it.Gameplay-wise, there's a LOT going on here. Firstly, you have a massive number of weapons that all offer unique styles of gameplay. Then you have a multitude of classes you can choose from, from warrior, to rogue, to mage, to any combination therof, and you can respect yourself as often as you like. One minute you can be cutting down your foes with a broadsword while hurling fireballs into their face, to sneaking up from behind and stealth-killing everyone in your path. There's so much variety and versitility offered that it's pretty much impossible to get bored. You're also offered a crafting system that is in-depth but easy to master.Story-wise, the main story is somewhat interesting but pretty generic. You play a chosen one - a hero killed from the start and brought back to life, are now unbound from fate, and has the powers of a god who can break the fates of those around them and fight against a bunch of fae who've been courrupted by demons. While the main storyline is somewhat bland, that isn't to say there isn't a lot of depth to be found.  Along the way you'll be able to take part in many optional side stories, from from becoming a member of a court of fae and learning about their culture, to unraveling the secrets of a school of magic. There's a lot of additional lore too for those who wish to dig deeper; in-game books to read, and many NPCs offer their individual thoughts and opinions on a variety of subjects. Graphics-wise, everything is beautifully rendered. Unfortunately  the world itself, while gorgeous at first, is pretty generic and gets old fast. Forests, dessert, plains, etc. Dungeons especially become visually boring and repetative. As for the audio, the voice acting is very well done and the music is very nice.If you're a fan of action RPGs and MMOs, I highly recommend this game. If you choose to pick it up, be sure to grab its DLC as well. It's just as worth it as the main game.			"

												First time i played KOA i say to myself :""Shiiiit it looks like world of warcraft !!!""BUT- With High quality textures- Without the thousands retaaards running around- Art Design : Todd  McFarlane[en.wikipedia.org] (co-founder of image comics)- Lead Designer : Ken Rolston[en.wikipedia.org] (game design on morrowind and oblivion)- Game universe and Lore : R. A. Salvatore [en.wikipedia.org] (Forgotten Realms)Thanks Azura this game got nothin common with the mmo for rude and slow minded kids.It's a very interesting and poetic rpg with dynamic epic fights and an amazingly appealing world.Pros :+ The crafting, skill & respec systems+ The main storyline and the sidequests (no feeling like working for fedex)+ The Ancient stones spread over the world who tell you a ""faery"" tale when you activate them+ The Zelda Hommage+ It's really beautiful, colorful, not realistic at all, a bit cartoon like, well made+ A world handcrafted with love+ It's a good port and just for that it's worth to seeCons : - Music is not very diversified.- Not a lot of choices to build the face of your character.- Some weapons way too much massive, a bit manga.- It's blurry and pale without a  Sweet FX [sfx.thelazy.net]- There are Gnomes, I hate Gnomes. (one of my ex girl friend left me for a gnome)==AND THE MORE IMPORTANT FLAW OF THE GAME==- Even in high difficulty the game is cake and it turns quickly really boring. You must use YSA to fix that===>  HERE[www.dropbox.com] Don't use the standalone.exe, make your own choice to fit the game to your wishesFor example :I don't use the XP gain reduction cause it's buggy (the shortcuts are shiitty after that)I don't use the health regen and mana regen modifications neither cause it screws some spellsI don't use the gold gain reduction cause i love to be rich as a pigBUT except these buggy things it's a MUST HAVE !!!In conclusion i would say i've been totally charmed by this rpg different from the Elder Scrolls, or the Risen or even the Dragon Age...But like i said it's very appealing, it seems to be a long game and the more i play the more i fall in love.

												It's got its fair share of issues with story, difficulty, and general pacing.  I also think the level design is boring.  But Kingdoms of Amalur does the important stuff really well.  For one, fighting anything in this game is an incredible experience.  I actually want to kill things in this game.  This is a big plus, because Western RPGs with combat systems this fun are hard to come by.  I feel like a total badass fighting off hordes of monsters in real time, with real hitboxes and sword swings.  On top of that, the world building is rock solid.  I skipped through all of the dialogue and cutscenes in the beginning to get to the gameplay, thanks to the devs for giving me the option to do that.  After getting immersed in the world for a few hours and actually caring about the game world, I found myself talking to NPCs and quests givers for info, and saw that the developers actually wrote up a ton of thought-out lore and history for this game.  Props to them again, for that.  And to top it all off, there is a metric buttload of content in this game.  There are new towns, dungeons, forests, and all sorts of locales everywhere, and dozens of quests to go with each.  This game can keep you busy for a while.If you're a fan of Action RPGs or Western RPGs in general, this game is worth your time to check out.  You'll have to overlook a few big flaws, but Kingdoms of Amalur is undeniably fun and engaging.  It's a lot like The Elder Scrolls or Dragon's Dogma, if you want an easy comparison.  Those are some of my personal favorites, so this game is getting a full recommendation from me.			"

I have a few different profiles and I have never ever seen the same thing on here twice. Sometimes I walk up on NPC's fighting on one profile, and on a different profile in the same situation nothing happens.

For me Skyrim felt like you have no purpose to just wonder around and do a few missions, but Kingdoms of Amalur had more of a feel like - Get mission -> Get lvls -> play side and main missions, this has more of a RPG feel to me (once again this is all personal opinions)This is a great game.

												WHAT FABLE 2 & 3 should have been!I started playing KOAR after modding Skyrim to death and found it quite hard to get into as the games are quite different in style. However I'm now really enjoying KOAR as it feels more like what Fable 2 and 3 should have been!!!In contrast KOAR is more fantasty orientated whereas I found Skyrim to be more bleak and brutal. There are some cool magic effects & attacks and the game works fine with Xbox 360 controller, I also downloaded a widescreen fixer and post process injector from the web  to change the default view and colour settings. Widescreen fixer works great if you dont like the default view, I stopped using the PPI as I found it simpler to adjust my tv settings to get the colour balance that I liked best. Overrall KOAR has heaps of quests, armor, weapons and different environments that all look great on a big screen. if you enjoyed the original Fable or Sudeki I think you should enjoy this.			"

Pity what happened to the Dev company, I would have liked to see more from them.The plot is interesting, your character die and comes back to life and start changing people's fates, while being hunted by those wishing to destroy you. Combat is so satisfying, the weapons and armor is good, the leveling system is ok could have been better, alchemy system is one of the best I've seen in an rpg, voice acting is tolerable.There are factions you can join, quests to do, locks to pick, treasure to find and lore to learn.

												KoA is a very unique kind of game with an interesting story for its development. We can partially blame our boy Lincoln Chafee (failed 2016 Democratic Presidential candidate. It was his first day) for us never seeing the MMO this franchise was set to be. Anybody can Google the story, or point out the parallels between other games.PROS:- This game has a really expansive story. You can't hit the game for leaving a lot to be desired in backstory as this game was solely a test game with the higher hopes of expanding the narative into a MMO. - The Crafting system is pretty solid. I have never really done Alchemy, but Smithing and Gem Crafting is pretty slick.- The Combat is fun, engaging, and requires a small amount of skill.- I liked the talent and skill trees. Though, some might not. It reminds me of WoW back before this 3 choices every 15 levels business.- Fully Voiced (Hero Exlcuded). Ralof from Skyrim's voice actor does a lot of voices.  CONS:- If you actually pick up and do all the quests in areas, you will cap out on level just about 75% of the way through the game. Very bad level pacing.- Not enough gear sets in the game. It's basically material teired (Leather, Studded Leather, etc.), and then effects can be added through Smithing and Gems.- Glitches out the wazzou. In the House of Ballads quest line if you loot a second set of the special quest armor, one is removed at turn in; one is permanently bound to your character taking up inventory slots. Forever. My end game char has them now.- The combat IS fun, but horribly repetitive. In the case of my Finesse character its rolling and stabbing. End game I just killed everything with a bow because it required much less work. I don't really care for most of the combo moves. They typically end up setting you up to be attacked, and the damage output was hardly worth it. So I would have to count exactly how many clicks most of the time to avoid using a combo that is too slow.- With the proper time put into Smithing, your gear is insanely powerful. You hardly take damage even from Boss' mega attacks. Also smithing is obselete after you cap out 75% of the way through the main storyline... so, I hope you really dig your armor's look.- The game NEVER SEEMS TO END. I am a completionist. I like to do everything I can. But damn... its just drags on and on, and maybe this is made worse by no new gear, skills, or anything since you capped out a LONG time ago. I beat this game on sheer willpower alone, and it was a friggin' chore. They just keep giving you quests, and the end is never the end. I, seriously, had to quadruple check that the bad guy I was chasing the whole game was really, truly the end of the game.Despite the Cons to Pros, I recommend this game. Its fun, engrossing, requires quick reflexes, combat is smooth as silk. The female models are stacked (if you're into that). Most of the game's problems could be fixed with a single patch (if the devs could have afforded to keep the lights on). The glithes I ran across were mostly inventory stealers or quest related. This game copied WoW and, maybe, The Witcher/Fable. BIG TIME! This game had Garissons in the Expansion pack long before WoW added them, just saying. It's just a badass game. It IS way too long and drawn out. Especially when you can't become anymore powerful shortly after the fight with the Balor. I loved this game so much I bought it for PC, when I had previously purchased it for XBox 360. Get the game, but don't expect perfection. For a one-and-done game developer, they made a much better game than some big name companies put out everyday.			"

												I'm not very much into reviewing games and such, but I feel like opening some exceptions occasionally, for games that I really enjoyed and particularly for those that I feel are under appreciated. That is the case of Kingdoms of Amalur. Played it for over 230 hours and I remember thinking a while back, around mid-game, ""this game is so awesome, have already 100+ hours played and still feels fresh!"".The gameplay is the secret. With its huge map and option to roam around or fast travel, you can dedicate yourself strictly to the quests, or you can explore and engage in combat whenever you like. And let me tell you, the combat is amazing, with its melee fluidity, mixed with magic powers and potions of all sorts and kinds, all very nicely implemented and presented.Adding to the variety, you can also dedicate yourself to blacksmithing, alchemy and crafting gems from shards to make even more powerful weapons, you can evolve your character adding points to a set of skills as you level up, like persuasion, lockpicking, detect hidden, stealth, and so on.Really, there's lots to do, it's a beautiful game, even considering the a bit outdated graphics (but still very nice), and the gameplay is top notch. Being a rather long game, you can feel tired and find it repetitive at times, especially in the dungeons. But even so, overall, it's a very enjoyable game.The story, context and background are supplied through books and lorestones placed all over Amalur, as well as through contact with the NPCs. You can read it or you can skip it. Myself, I give much importance to the setting in a game and the way the story unfolds, which must be engaging. I use Bioshock and Mass Effect as benchmarks for this. In Amalur, the story is not the most important thing. The setting is rather nice, but the story sometimes unfolds too slowly and a bit confusing. The books and lore bits are often too big and boring. So, some I read, some I didn't. But this didn't hindered me from having a great experience with this game, which I did, including enjoying the story and the lore.On the downside, like I already wrote, one can feel some repetition as the game goes, especially in the dungeons and also with the NPCs. These are very often variations of the same models. They do have different voices and behavior, which balances the look repetitiveness. Also, the boss battles that sometimes occurs are many times against more powerful variations of the NPCs and this I think could have been better, introducing a few more epic proportion battles, instead of only 2 epic bosses.Finally, you can feel overpowered very soon in the game, so, I advise playing it on hard from the beginning (with the added bonus of getting an achievement only accomplishable when starting the game on hard - doesn't work when changing difficult midgame). And even on hard, it's not a very difficult game to master.But hey, nothing is perfect, and kingdoms of Amalur, not being perfect, is a great game and well worth your time.			"

												This is one of those games that you either love or hate.  Gameplay-wise, it's quite reminiscent of the Elder Scrolls series with a Fable style feel to the graphics.  Yeah, the landscapes and denizens are remarkably clean for an agrarian based society and it's a pig to mod but there's something inherently fun about running around a huge, open landscape weilding weapons that, in many cases, are bigger than you are.As a lower level character there are plenty of loot drops to enable you to afford the healing, training and equipment that you're going to need to progress through the game and the merchants have unlimited funds to buy the plethora of weapons, armour and potions that are simply beneath you to use.  The real challenge is in levelling your character to the point where the abilities and skills you choose complement your gameplay style rather than feel like an adjunct.  The ability to visit a fateweaver and pay them to be able to reset all your skill & ability points is a plus...if you're unhappy with the skill trees you've chosen or if they're just not working for you...change 'em.  It's all about experimenting to find the style of combat (might, finesse, sorcery or a mixture of two or all three) that provides you with the most enjoyable playing experience.There are plenty of dialogue options that allow you to choose the essential nature of your character...good, evil or indifferent although the opportunites to be a really nasty Dark Lord style world destroyer are too few and far between for my liking...what's the point of making a pact with a Niskaru Lord when it doesn't give you any visible benefits other than having Warsworn mercenaries trying to kill you at every turn?The world itself is open - always a plus - and the addition of the two DLCs will allow you to run around like a headless chicken for weeks, slaughtering anything you come across that's weaker than you and getting squashed like a bug by trolls and niskaru...at least until you've got to level 20 or above at which point, you'll want to move to hard difficulty if you haven't already because it starts to get a little too easy.Side quests are plentiful and, in many cases, are more fun than the main mission.  Plenty of faction quests too, most of which are advanced tutorials in the different styles of gameplay and the careful choice of abilities & skills which is where a visit to the fateweaver to change your point allocations is a must.All in all this game is fun to play and is one you can happily drop for a couple of weeks and then come back to without having to remember how to play it again.  It's challenging enough to keep you engrossed yet not difficult enough to be frustrating and the control and combat systems are simple to understand and use.  Voice acting is good, graphics are bright, colourful and well rendered and, despite some truly ugly or stupid looking armour sets there's not really anything negative to say about this game.  Buy it, play it, enjoy it...but tackle the DLCs after you finish the main game - you'll need a higher level character to stay alive.			"

												It took me 125 hours to complete this game (all side quests and DLCs included)! Well, that perhaps is no match for Elder Scrolls, but, still, it's a lot of content!What looks and starts as just another ARPG, soon turns into immersive and beautiful open-world experience with overwhelming number of quests. And the cartoonish style is actually very beautiful, when you give it a closer look! The variety of landscapes and details – just exploring the game's world is rewarding on its own. (Take a look at my screenshots and you'll know what I'm talking about).I believe it would be fair to say that, ""Kingdoms of Amalur"" is ""Skyrim meets Mass Effect""... just without sexy lesbian shower scenes... and without choices that actually matter. Well, about that... Choices - this aspect is actually one of the minor faults of this game. It gives the impression that you have to make moral choices that will affect your future, but (apart from few barely significant exceptions in some of the side quests) all those choices change is, whether you accept a sidequest and how the NPCs answer you. They don't affect the main storyline and don't lead to alternative endings - there are no alternative endings. On the other hand, you won't be regretting anything and wishing that you had done something differently.Especially because you can change your class (!) at any point in the game and redistribute your skills and abilities (""skills"" are boosts to your stats in this game and ""abilities"" are your class-specific skills). And, in this aspect, KoAR is rather unique. There are 3 traditional classes in this game: rogue, warrior and mage. Also, you can combine any two of them or all three of them. This system reminds me that of Mass Effect. The only difference is that your choice is not fixed in the beginning, but you specialise your character in one of the three directions with each next level.What else? Loot. There's a lot of it! But only few items are actually worth something - as always in this type of games! But, contrary to Borderlands, for example, you won't be spending as much time sorting your inventory. Just put everything you don't need to junk right away. Then you can sell it or salvage to craft new items.Crafting, exploring, potion brewing, lore stone searching (they grant stat boosts), side quests, faction quests (they grant valuable rewards in the form of cards), appearance customisation, improvement of your headquarters – there is really a lot of content in this game. And that might feel overwhelming sometimes. You just grow tired of this game, especially because at one point this game stops being challenging even on the hardest difficulty. And the enemies and battles start to feel the same. You just want to find out how everything ends. But it just doesn't. This game takes for what feels like an eternity.My suggestion is to take breaks from time to time. Thus, when you return to it, it will still feel fresh.Don't ruin the experience for yourself! Because the story is rich and interesting, the combat system is versatile, the skill trees are complex, the numerous kingdoms of Amalur are beautiful, the sidequests are unique (well, most of them), there are various factions of enemies and the game itself offers immersive fantasy adventure experience that will take you hours to complete.If only the graphics were more realistic, the enemies were more challenging towards the end and there was no level cap (=40), this would have been the perfect game for me.Nevertheless, 10 EUR well spent.My overall rating: 9/10			"

												Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning is perhaps one of the most underestimated games on the market. From a glance it boasts nice graphics, decent amount of content and a well-crafted combat system. However, I can assure you it’s also offers a beautiful fantasy world that has completely engrossing likeable characters with tonnes of side quest (With all DLC).  I’ll admit playing with PC controls can be somewhat challenging, however the controller settings are an utter breeze. The game has a vast range of unique weaponry and armour available, which makes every task, every hidden object, and every enemy slain feel greatly more rewarding. The only complaint I have in relation to this game, is the item limit, it can be a royal pain when you’re collecting different sets to switch between. Aside from your abilities and destinies there are various skills to upgrade:  Alchemy, blacksmithing, detect hidden, dispelling, lock picking, mercantile, persuasion, sagecraft and stealth, which are upgradable from basic to master. These enable you to interact better within quests or be worse off depending on which you focus on. Persuasion can make all the difference when getting caught out in committing an offence against the town, as can lock picking as you’d probably guess why.  With the availability of the Fate Weaver it is easy to respec at any given time to get a different experience from the game which holds ones interest for longer than a one route only game. I wouldn’t go as far as to compare Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning to Skyrim, however, it’d definitely be my next choice from it. 8/10 Incredibly solid game. "

												Two things when playing this game: Stick with main and faction quests, treat sidequests / tasks as filler content to help you level. And play it on hard because that seems to be the base difficulty of the game, with normal and easy being merely watered down. It's a good RPG, with an enjoyable combat system (even without controller) and gorgious graphics but it's selling point of having TONS of quests is also what shoots it down. They're mostly copy / paste of the same concepts and feel like they'd belong in a MMO. Not suprising considering this game was going to be an MMO at first, but a shame that this is what ultimately dragged down the ratings and enjoyment of a world that seemed so full of promise. The two story DLCs are great value for your money, recommend getting those for more story and less sidequest grind.			"

												Before its release to Steam, I played hours upon hours of Kingdoms of Amalur for the Xbox 360, and I can tell you my experiences with this game had me loving it more and more each time I played it. KoA is a fresh take on the RPG Adventure games we're so used to playing, this one in particular giving us a very unique character that develops based upon your choices and decisions. Instead of listing the pro's and con's of this game in a bullet layered format, I'll instead give an in-depth analysis of what this game has to offer for you potential buyers!Main Story:Right off the bat, the main story line leaves you in suspense as you traverse further to figure out 'Who you really are', and 'What really happened.' I will refrain from giving out spoilers, but the entirety of the main quest line has an interesting plot, in which the character has many ways of going about, all leading up until that moment where you fulfill your goals and get your questions answered! The questline is not generic in any way, other than the fact that you find yourself broken, defeated, and lost in a world in which you have to learn, once again, about where you came from, and what it is you're meant to do. All of this becomes apparent as you meet new key characters along the way that help guide you on your path without giving you too much to lean on in the beginning of the game. That being said, delving into the questline in order to find the truth was truly captivating to me, and I enjoyed each and every quest from start to finish. Side Quests:While the side quests are always completely optional, I can't stress it enough that actually taking the time to do them is both fun and rewarding! Several factions are mapped out across The Faelands that have their own unique and interesting questlines, not to mention the incredible rewards each has to give! These Factions are not the only side quests given within the game, as there are other civilian and non-dynamic character quests that are given throughout the entire game. Some quests can be tedious, but unlike other games, these tedious quests truly do reap great rewards for the character. Not only will completing a quest leave you with a bit more gold in your pocket, or an extra item to equip, but completing these side quests will increase your relationship with other npc's, sometimes so much so that they will be willing to share a few items of their own with you. All in all, the side quests are incredibly refreshing, and add a bit more flavor to the game when you're not so interested in just following the main story line. Dungeons:This is something that I can't really express much love or hate for, as the dungeons in Kingdoms of Amalur were honestly satisfactory, for me at least. Each dungeon, while very different, had extremely generic layouts and areas that had no unique flavor setting them apart, other than perhaps the loot acquired from each of them. Don't get me wrong, the layout is beautiful and it does give you that dungeonesque feeling, but when it comes down to it, I just don't feel like they added enough diversity. Other than the aesthetics, the rewards given in each dungeon speak of their own value, as you'll never be left empty-handed for completing one. Combat system: I've finally reached my favorite aspect of the game... the combat. I absolutely love the combat to this game, possibly due to the fact that, well, its insanely unique! There are no set combos or time frames that it takes for your character to swing or attack. YOU attack when YOU want to attack, and this aspect of combat really gives you a sense of control and realism with your character. The different weapons and unique patterns of attacks offered for each type of weapon is absolutely awestriking. My first time using the chakrams and seeing how flashy and insane the moveset was really set that weapon apart from the rest. Not only do you have the ability to create your own combinations, you can tie your combination in with two different weapons, making the number of combinations unexhaustable. A staff and a sword, or a chakram and a great hammer, a wand, a greatsword, faeblades, a bow, so on and so forth! This all ties in well with the fact that you are not limited by your imagination to throw magic, or any spells in the mix. This truly gives your character a sense of value, as you are, within reason, your own, indistinguishable person. Gear/Crafting:I really enjoyed some of the gear sets in the game, and you always have that excited feeling when you pick up a piece that has better stats, and just looks plain awesome! Starting out, your gear will obviously be mediocre, but that doesn't take away the fact that these sets 'get the job done.' Each new piece of gear is unique in its own way, and when we add gem sockets and enchants to the mix, you will find an entirely different craft all together. The crafting system works in a systematic way where you'll need to acquire several pieces of equipment that have 'matching qualities' before you can create your new weapon or armor piece. Of course, this goes without saying, the better equipment you have and the higher your skill, the better your gear will be when you make that fresh new piece. Adding gems to gear in order to give your character some type of buff, whether it be increased mana, or extra burn damage, etc, is always satisfying, and lets not forget to mention... You can name a piece after you craft it. I don't know about you, but I love giving names to gear of my craft to give it that unique and one of a kind feeling. All in all, the gear in the game is not sorely lacking, but I will say that there was room for improvement on the aestheitc aspect of it, such as maybe adding more flair to a crafted piece or unique piece, but that aside, the gear in the game, as well as the crafting system, is rather balanced.Skill Tree/Perks:Could I go ON about how I love the skill tree in this game... While there are not an infinite number of talents, there sure seems to be an infinite number of ways you can build your character. With the three main skill trees, (Might, Finesse, and Sorcery) you can literally build your character any way you want. There are multiple different fate cards for each type of build, so there is never a scenario where you'll feel unrewarded for going into this tree, that tree, and the other. You will always be compensated for the way you spec, so much so that you'll recieve your own unique buff while you traverse farther down your own unique spec. The perks, too, have very rewarding qualities to them, giving you a plethora of options for how you want to build your character so they fit to your liking. Whether it be increased chance to lock pick, or finding hidden treasures with ease, all of these different perks really are rewarding in their own way. There are many other aspects of this game that can be talked about, but I believe that the true value of this games comes within the eye of the beholder, so I'll stop this review here. If you're looking for a fun, refreshing game, Kingdoms of Amalur brings the package to the table. The cartoonish graphics and unique gameplay give this game its own unique flair, and the story only becomes more exciting with the DLC content as you explore different and unique areas to the game with their own interesting storylines and rewards! I hope this basic review helps you decide whether or not you want to take a peek at KoA: Reckoning. With that being said, I wish you luck, fateless ones!			"

												Had this game back on 360 when I was a peasent. Had to buy it again because it's that good, also own the PS3 version, easily already sunk hundreds of hours in and looking to get more clocked in on PC. I like it over Skyrim honestly. Great visuals, high fantasy, great voice work, art style, world lore, not to mention how amazing and satisfying combat is. (Especially with the difficulty mod). If I could change 2 things about this game, 1: I would make it more open in sense of players can do/craft more. Just more little misc things for people to do, would have been nice but doesn't make it any less enjoyable just a personal thing. 2: Open source it, this game would have been perfect for modders and would have added (I feel) a much larger community/life span to the game. All in all, get this game. Enjoyable from beginning to end, can feel tedious at times, but that's not even a bad thing in the grand scheme of it.			"

												Before playing KoA, I had read reviews that tried to pit it against Skyrim for some reason, an odd choice considering that the gameplay and ""feel"" are at opposite ends with both of these games. One thing you really need to ask yourself before you purchase this game is "" Do I have a lot of time to invest in another long drawn out RPG"". I asked myself that before I bought KoA and just ignored how much time I do actually have to commit. Though I havn't finished KoA and I bored of it at about the 70 hour mark, I did enjoy the exploration and the way the game felt to play. It's not exactly open world or a sandbox but there is a lot to see, lot's to explore. I found myself swapping out specs because playing the one style got tedious and my time got taken up with a lot of travell. Otherwise, I'm actually glad a bought this, I may finish it when I have more time, up to the point I've played was enjoyable, just a little burned out. If you do buy this, be prepared to commit with small amounts at a time.  "

												I haven't played enough of the game yet but I cannot wait to write the review since this game is simply fantastic. I wish they would have created a sequel and this time fix a few of the issues that people didn't like with the original game. +MASSIVE World, especially with DLC. I cannot stress this enough.+Quests, quests, quests, quests, and even more quests. Too many quests honestly.+You can make your character look bada**. And I mean real bada**. Not from the middle or near the end, no, right from the beginning itself. You can make him/her look batshit crazy.+Complete customisation. You aren't bound by any rules. You can play your character the way you want to play him. You can even change your class midway through the game if you didn't like the class you're playing with and are too lazy to restart.-Darn repair system. This ruins it for me, although some might like how it helps keep the player looking for new gear. It gets real annoying when you have to keep repairing your armor/weapons and find new repair kits over and over again.-Scaling. The game has a really weird enemy level system. Supposing I enter an area at level 2, all enemies in that area, every single one, will be level 2 for the rest of the game. This is why it gets extremely easy in higher levels when you return to old areas. -Invisible walls. If you're going in expecting complete freedom to roam everywhere in any way you want, you will find other games more appealing than KoAR. There's always that one invisible wall that doesn't let you jump down stairs, ledges, clear open spaces etc.			"

												What a disappointment. I wanted to like this game, I really did. I read that it was a decent RPG with good game mechanics and pretty graphics. However, in my experience, the most the game could muster from me is one giant ""meh.""To start, the good points: Combat in Kingdoms of Amalur is by far it's best feature. Combat is fast, acrobatic, and exciting. Taking down mobs of enemies with a variety of weapons while dodging and firing off magic spells is an absolute highlight of this game. Controls are responsive and intuitive. Boss fights can be thrilling. The voice acting in the game is definitely above average, if not very good. The main story quest (from what I got through) seems interesting. And the game definitely looks pretty, albeit more on the cartoony side than the likes of The Witcher or Skyrim (although that's not necessarily a bad thing.) Overall, what I read initially is not untrue; this is a decent RPG, good game mechanics, and looks pretty good.Unfortunately, that's where the positives end and the disappointments begin.Most glaring is, lest you be fooled, Kingdoms of Amalur IS NOT AN OPEN WORLD ENVIRONMENT. It is a series of corridors arranged in such a way as to give the illusion of one. Resource placement within this corridored environment is lazy, with resource generating plants conveniently located periodically along the periphery of said corridors. The side quests are similarly lazy and primarily consist of fetch quests (go and kill these guys, bring me back my ring. Collect a bunch of ingredients for potions to save the town, bring them back to me.)Also, if KoA came any closer to straight ripping off elements of Skyrim and the Elder Scrolls series of games, I think we would have had a lawsuit on our hands. Equivalents of the Fighter's Guild, Mage's Guild, and Theives Guild? Check, check, and check, Strikingly similar lockpicking mechanism/mini-game? Oh, you betcha. Alchemy, Blacksmithing, and Enchanting requiring specific workstations of each? Bingo. Hidden traps represented BY BEAR TRAPS, actuated spike tiles, and trip wires which set off various nasties. Yup. (I mean, the bear traps might have been the last straw for me).KoA also suffers from trying to cram way too much weapon and item variety into the game than is necessary. The result is the player being positively overwhelmed by the sheer volume of useless crap you pick up during play. Luckily, it provides a convenient and free fast travel mechanism to travel back to nearest towns to unload your useless junk. Oh, and that reminds me, all the towns I visited were essentially carbon copies of each other, with the various crafting stations, a pub, and a couple of random houses in each.While KoA definitely has it's high points -- with combat being at the absolute top -- it relies too heavily on overused RPG tropes coupled with a very heavy ""borrowing"" of mechanics and game elements from other titles. It suffers from the developers trying to cram WAY too much content, instead of focusing on providing a smaller, truer open world environment, innovative mechanics and quests, and overall immersive experience. In the end, as pretty as the game can look at times, what the game is lacking is originality. The leads to most quests and the search for crafting materials to feel more like chores, than fun. At only 8 hours into the game, I found myself overwhelmingly bored. And it's a shame.(IF YOU DID NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is something of a mixed bag. The combat system is fluid and fun, and Amalur itself can be gorgeous looking (with a little post-processing such as SweetFX). Unfortunately, the story, characters, and crafting mechanic is somewhat generic. I found myself losing steam two thirds of the way through the main quest. I am glad I finished the game, but I don’t see any compelling reason to return to finish the side quests.			"

												This game was such a beautiful let- down. the scenery was gorgeous, the side quests were more befitting a hero than Elder- scrolls side quests (""Go slay these giant spiders."" vs. ""Hey, would you mind carrying this bag up those stairs? kthx.""). and all the classes started with unique abilities and weaponry. But about midway through the game, you start realizing how lop- sided the class options are. Stealth is nice for killing one dude, but there will always be 15 other ""hive- minded"" dudes in the area ready to swarm you. The mage is flashy and interesting, but you only get four real attack spells, and only one of those deserves constant use. To make matters worse, despite you having the ability to be the grand archmage of everything ever, you dont get access to any of the spells that enemies use. like teleportation across the battlefield, and auto- targeting tornadoes.  The only class ready to stand against anything is the might class. Anything close to you gets pulverized by your hammer (the only weapon option with a decent speed vs. damage output trade), and anything out of its short range gets yanked in by a hookshot. It is a powerful combo that breaks down targets that will always laugh off magic or stealth approaches. Now  for the ability sets. lock picking and spell breaking protected chests is a matter of probablility, so quick saving and loading makes points into that moot, same for stealing, so putting points into these is worthless. the only decent options are sagecraft and smithing to make decent gear, a point in persuasion ( to gain access to yet another probability game) and detect hidden to find better gear and more money. TL;DR- Get this game when it's 50- 75% off. Gameplay gets boring, but exploring the environments will be worth while, and it's pretty long, to boot.			"

												This is very likely the most underrated game i know. For whatever reason it's not as famous as it should be.  Good story, huge world, good quests.Stable for me and it looks pretty good.  Biggest and only technical problem is the small field of view which can't really be changed.Everyone who likes an action-focussed RPG (though much more Story depth then simple Action RPGs like Diablo)  should definitely give it a go.

												This is a really tough one. I so want to love this game. It's huge, with ton's of quests, tons of loot, tons of places to explore, looks good, sounds good... but it just feels so average and generic.The outdoor areas look very much alike with just varying amounts of grass and trees, the exceptions are few. The caves, tombs and dungeons get old very quickly. Even though you get a fast travel system I have often felt like I wanted a horse. The side quests are simple and mostly boring. The world doesn't react to you at all, you don't ever change it or affect it, which is really sad for a single-player game, it often feels like an MMORPG in this regard.I kinda hoped for a Gothic game with a better combat and maybe in raw technical sense I got one, but it never managed to grab me and make me want to play it and I've given it an ample amount of chances. It just completely failed to make me ""care"" about anything at all. The world, the story, the people, my own character... I don't know why. I really want to like it, it's not exactly lacking anything major that I'd want from it, but what it delivers just doesn't feel exciting and/or fun.			"

												Average - with both good and poor features, showing a lack of cohesion in design. Incredibly simple Combat, Horrendous choices that do nothing in the profession system, superb voice acting completly at odds with the character appearances, laughable npc animations and a maguffin story that can be said in 4 words. This game ""boasts"" 200 hours of gameplay but doing any % of sidequests means you'll one shot most enimies on the hardest difficulty. The Main Quest is about 15-20 hours. I think considering the amount of enemy types (9) it's still strecthing it a bit long. The redeeming features are phenominal music, lovely backdrops and varied sidequests. If you like Tolkien-esque fantasy in a Fable clone, pick it up - if it's on sale.			"

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a fully voiced action RPG with an open world and vibrant Fable/WoW-style visuals that aim for character over realism. Combat, magic and animations are top-notch, completely decimating Skyrim, but the soundtrack, story, dungeons, atmosphere and even quests are inferior.Size and scope of the game are on an MMO scale with fast travel, a wonderful map system and a seemingly endless supply of side quests. There's no feeling of grinding but much of the content does feel like filler and, if you stray from the storyline too long, the repetitiveness and single-player MMO feeling will hit.With loot that feels like Diablo-lite, with randomized stats, set pieces and uniques to be found; skills such as lockpicking, persuasion, stealth and detect hidden, all with perks at certain points; warrior, rogue and mage ability trees a la WoW talents; and crafting systems of alchemy, gems/sockets and blacksmithing, Kingdoms of Amalur is an RPG through and through.Overall, a wonderful game if you like being set free to do your own thing but can accept the pitfalls that tend to come with open-world RPGs.

												Forget about the fiasco with 38 Studios and how it's not Skyrim and bluh bluh bluh you should play this game.The combat in this game is awesome, and I say this as someone who spent all of Skyrim sneak-sniping and refusing to get into melee. Mouse and keyboard works incredibly well after you get the hang of the camera, both weapon combos and dodging feels fluid and responsive, and melee combat is both satisfyingly visceral and very flexible. Wthin the three archetype skill trees and supporting ""perks""/destinies, you can pick pretty much any playstyle you want and change it up on the fly, since respecs only cost in-game gold. I've spent at least two battles killing enemies without using any spells or weapons, but instead by dash teleporting through them - and THEN I found the teleport-slash dagger critical attack that lets you enact your favorite shameful anime samurai fantasies. It's pretty great, is what I'm saying.Story-wise, Amalur is solid but not precisely innovative; you have a lot of medieval-era peasants trying to make a living but there's a big bad and a bigger bad who want to destroy the world as you know it, and you're the Special One who'll etc etc. it gets less annoying as you get deeper into the story and find that most people don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about how special you are. However, the Scottish-Roman gnomes are fun, and there's a few interesting twists in the (tons of) sidequests and main quests available. You shouldn't try to do them all, but you won't need to anyway since there's plenty of EXP to go around.Also, this game is pretty as hell. Very high fantasy. Much bloom. But pretty.			"

												I got this game from my girlfriend because she wanted me to try it out, I was complaining about games not meeting my standards/expectations and that I got bored of them so quickly. All I can say is that it was the right choice from her, gifting me this awesome game!Graphics might look ""outdated"" compared to many new games coming, but it has the charm that so many games lack. I continue to hop into it and not even to follow the story line - I enjoy all the things you can do, been doing so many side quests that I was in a whole completely different place than where my main story line played.I have an emotional connection with the game, which almost no game has been able to give me besides ""Jade Empire"". KoA has the same combat style as Jade Empire, really fastpaced the only difference being KoA is way more brutal. I love the sneak take downs, always different and always very rogue-like. I remember sneaking up on this enemy and actually patiently waiting for him to turn around for 5ish minutes, sneaked up right behind him and executed a sneak attack. My character covered the mouth of the enemy, stabbed him three times in the chest while pulling him back downwards, layed him softly down on the ground while crouching, slit his throat and then looked around to observe the surroundings - if her attack was noticed by the other mobs in the area. This game has so high immersion that I completely forget to check the time, it isn't the easiest when you are trying to fix your sleeping pattern, haha! Pros:- Immersive gameplay- Story rich, the story grabs a hold of you from the start and it has a high sense of importance (we all know those games trying to force you to do stuff for the ""story"" and you hate it because it is so tedious and you are not interested in it, because poorly written/executed/makes no sense/makes little sense or it is just plain stupid and boring, this game has no such thing as any of the above, the story is rich and interesting)- Your character looks badass!- Fastpaced combat, it gives satisfaction with killing blows, sneak attacks, random badassery with any other weapons than daggers for example.- Brutal combat!- Awesome cutscenes, I have watched every single one!- Good/evil choice settings (gotta love that!)- Big world - not huge, not tiny!- Unique characters/enemies, even talking to random NPCs is satisfying!
Cons: - No romance almost (every RPG needs a romance option, even if you will not play it). There are like three minor options for romance and it feels like the concept is very overlooked- Spiders (not as much as a con as it is a personal problem). Imagine running freely towards any destination, then suddenly you hear a loud rumbling, your camera spans out and out comes a huge spider! While the minor cinematic goes on, spiders have surrounded you... it isn't a dealbreaker, the loud noise makes me jump everytime.
That was a small list for cons, I know!			"

												There are no other games like this.It is futile to argue whether this game is good or bad. Lets say this game is bad. What alternaive do you plan to suggest? Witcher 3? Dark Souls? Baldur's Gate? Dragon Age 3? All of these alternatives are great, and you should definitely get them, but none of them can fill the niche that KoA:R belongs to.KoA:R was the only action RPG with decent combat system before Witcher 3 came, and because Witcher 3 pretty much carves its own very specific niche, KoA:R holds its position still. KoA:R excels in one other area where almost all other games in its genre falls flat: it has a vibrant and varied art style. Unfortunately the same can't be said about its story and AI.In retrospect, if you divide the soul of RPG into four determining factors, they will be:1. Combat2. AI3. Art style4. StoryThere are few RPG games that are good at one or two of these, but none that is good at at least three of them. KoA:R is special becaue it is the only one that shines in the combo { Combat, Art style }. It also tops { Combat } alongside Witcher 3 and Shadow of Mordor. Incidentally, Witcher 3 tops { Combat, Story }.KoA:R's art style might be great, but the Big Huge Engine does not live up to its name. Zones are segmented and the cities are pretty small. The battles are also not really that big. However, the world is vibrant and has a majestic feel to it. You can see when the developers ran out of budget to keep paying Todd McFarlane because Klurikorn and Alabastra are trash, and the DLCs switch to realistic art style.There are also many minor factors like freedom of choice, crafting and potions, quality of open world, degree of role playing, etc.If you can resist comparison with Witcher 3 and Dishonored, KoA:R has some degree of freedom of choice, but it is straightforward. Potions are boring, but crafting is awesome in this game. Every item can be dismantled into its core components, so you only grind for effect drop. Dashboarding is involved, but after finishing the Gravehal Keep, you don't even need to do that.It is combat where this game excels. Magic, might, and stealth each is played in its own different way. Within each, every weapon type has its own set of awesome skills. You can also mix and match to your heart's content. My first playthrough had a magic build, with some rogue elements mixed into it. My second playthrough was with a pure rogue build, and it played like a totally different game. I am planning to have a third playthrough with a pure might build. Each of the three primary builds has its own faction, and for the sake of variety I suggest sticking to only your specific faction in each playthrough, (because the faction missions bring out the real fun of each playstyle).

												If you liked Skyrim, Fable and alike this has some elements of those like lock picking, committing crimes,massacring villages,crafting of armor,weapons, potions, and a few other things. Combat is the funnest thing, but it can be kinda repetitive, but still good, and very fluid. Its also open world, so you can explorer wherever. Story is not bad, not the best in my opinion, but not the worst, it just feels a little generic at times, it does have some interesting parts tho. Lots of side quest if your into that stuff. They have a good art style, the world looks beautiful and have a lot of interesting designs to the map, music sounds good, weapons and such look good. I haven't ran any into any bugs or crashing issues, but that might change or not, plus might crash for you, maybe not. A issue I dislike in the game is the camera, sometimes it doesn't want to zoom in when your surrounded by a million enemies. The skill system, could use a little work for how its presented. Fortunately you can reset your skills. There also a tree system for abilities, might,sorcery and finesse, which determine you're play style. You can mix up points into each one of those, or spend it all in one aspect, like in the borderlands game.Anyways, its a fun game. You have different play styles, like stealth,range, up close, magic stuff. Things might seem to start slow, but they start to pick up the speed as you progress in the game. Their a lot of story stuff if you're interested in that stuff. Most of all, the combat just fun, mainly brought it for the combat, anyways worth trying out.			"

												Perhaps one of the best Medieval Fantasy RPGs I've played in a while. The graphics are amazing, almost World of Warcraft-like. Each region is stylized differently, but follows what I think is the standard MMO style, which I don't mind, but I find it quite predictable. Gameplay, wise, the combat is really fun. Being able to transition between using a gigantic hammer and the smallest daggers is something rarely used in a few video games. The monsters are fun... for a little while. After a little while, you start noticing there's only a handful of monsters... used over... and over... and over again. Soon enough you'll find them everywhere you go. You'd probably grow tired of seeing Leanashe constantly, I know I do. The Fate powers is extremely badass, I loved using it from the start. But as you get more and more powerful weapons and spells, you may realize that the Fate powers are really only used for Bosses, not really for anything else. So chances are, you'll be playing through the game with a full Fate bar most of the time, and you won't even bother to use it. Though one thing that may ♥♥♥♥ you off the most in the game is the out-of-nowhere cutscenes that the game just pushes on you. And in the beginning, especially with the spiders, those cutscenes will scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of you. As for the story, it's pretty decent, but it can become dull over time. When you realize you have badass powers to alter Fate, you feel (appropriately) like a badass. Having everyone tell you that throughout the story, it gets to the point where you just tune the story out instead of enjoying it. Thankfully, there is something that can save you from ultimately giving up on the game's story, and that would be sidequests. There's a TON of sidequests to do. Almost wherever you go, there's a handful of sidequests that needs to be done. Sure, some people don't like doing so many sidequests, but it gives me something to do when I grow bored of the storyline.The game does have it's bugs, and I have encountered a few that have messed up a few quests for me. I haven't gone back to them, so I'm not entirely certain there's any way for them to be fixed. There are moments in the game where sound on weapons just cuts out completely, and the only thing you can hear are the after-effects of slicing at something or casting a spell. During a cutscene, the textures/models would take a moment to render as well. The last 2 bugs weren't exactly a problem for me, but they were slightly immersion breaking.Time to review the DLC! The Teeth of Naros is the shining star of the pack. An interesting land with interesting collosae people with a beautiful Greek-themed city. The story is great, and the final boss fight was truly amazing, albeit EXTREMELY difficult earlier on. The Legend of Dead Kel was a little bit less impressive. You were forced to stay on the island until later on in the DLC, so you were stuck on that same island for a while. The monsters introduced in this DLC were actually really well done. But that's the only good thing I can say about it. The story sucked. Pretty bad. Ooh, look, you're special... again. I don't want to ♥♥♥♥ on the fact that the game has you play the most important role in the main story AND the DLC stories, but really they make you so many different things, it gets confusing. But, it's not as bad as having the ""You can change fate"" plot point be the main thing everywhere you go. As for the armour DLC, it just gives you some starter armour. It WILL get replaced after a short while, so it's not worth having around, unless you're having a hard time finding any armour at the start.Overall, even though this game is fairly buggy, and it does get dull after a while, I still absolutely love it, for several reasons, but the biggest one would be that they made the mages INCREDIBLY badass. In most games like Skyrim, I would oftentimes have problems playing as a mage, because I feel their attacks are incredibly underpowered. But I was truly blown away at how the Mages were designed in this game. The Mage NPCs are extremely powerful, even slightly difficult to deal with since a lot of their attacks are homing. The mage abilities that you get in-game are beautiful as well. The more you progress, the more powerful your attacks actually look, and that's the most relevant in the Chakrams. So if you haven't purchased the game, and are a fan of Medieval Fantasy RPGs, I strongly urge you to pick this game up. You'll have a ton of fun!			"

												I've had a bunch of fun with this game. The world is really interesting, the combat is a ton of fun, and it's beautiful. I don't think I can overstate this. There are tons of dark, grungy, washed out worlds out there. I love Skyrim, (250+ Hours and counting) but it's colors are grey, brown, and blah.  Amalur is gorgeous, colorful, vibrant, living. The combat has a decent amount of variety, and once you get in the upper levels of power, especially as a mage, you really do feel like a tiny god, stomping on those who displease you. It's also super easy to respec a character, don't like the thief powers/attacks? Respec to a warrior and aim pointy end towards other man. Not a fan of hitting things with sharp objects? Go mage and bring down the pain. I also really do enjoy the story of this game. It's got it's share of cliche bits, but overall, it really drew me in, and kept me interested. There are a few problems with this game that I have to face, even as a booster. It's pretty damn easy. Like, I normally play stuff on easy, maybe normal, and I didn't feel overly pressed when I played on hard. It's also easy to level past the game if you're a sidequest sort of person. There are a lot of quests of the MMO variety (fetch 10 wingdings, kill 10 grobnarks, etc, etc.)Overall, however, I really do recommend this; it's a blast.			"

												This game is the pure essence of ""Fantasy Action Adventure"".Set in the fairytale-style world of Amalur (obviously), you are thrown into a conflict between mortal Humans and Immortal Fae.The story isn't too inovative but neither is it boring. No one aspect of the game is truly amazing, but they all work really well together to make a solid adventure that will have you hooked for many many hours. The best way to describe it quickly would be to imagine World of Warcraft, but with single player, a more direct combat system and a more involved crafting system. There are many areas in a pre-scripted world. Some things are persistent while others respawn. It really pays to explore every nook and cranny, as the next corner could hold an interesting quest or even a dungeon.Pros:+ fast-paced combat system where your reaction times and movement matter just as much as tailoring your stats to your playstyle.+ lots of game time. I played it for 50+ hours and aren't close to the end yet.+ a good crafting system. It isn't overly complicated but still allows you to make a large array of items that you can tailor to your specific play style. (also, custom names which I personally love.)+ respeccing is possible, so you don't have to worry about building your character into a corner.+ clear separation of battle skills and crafting skills, so you never wonder ""is this going to help me kill things better?""+ Fully voiced, high quality dialogue with a diverse range of voices. This is actually really impressive because of the sheer number of characters and interactions. + Player owned realestate which can also be customized to your liking to aid you with crafting and storage.+ no DLC ads in-game, no struck content, no micro-transactions. Just buy the game and play it till you get bored.Cons:- no multiplayer whatsoever.- no mods or add-ons as far as I can tell.- pre-scripted world. Much like in most MMOs, once you explore 100% of the game once, you won't be surprised again.The game really doesn't have many negative aspects. Anything you think is bad will probably come down to personal preference. Do you want to go on a big adventure in a vast fantasy world? Then this game is definately for you!			"

 Overview   9.5/10I know that Steam shows that I only have 2.9 hours on record in this game.  However, that is because it's my third PC playthrough.  I had bought it a while ago from some site, I can't even remember the name of the site anymore - and I played it through... Twice.  Then, I bought it on my Xbox 360 and played through it.  Then once I sold my 360 and bought a PS3, I bought this game and played through it AGAIN.  Now I have purchased it through Steam and am playing through it again for the 5th time.  I've also been willing to purchase this game 4 times, if that is any clue as to how great this game is.  I am so sad that the company closed after the release of this game.  Poor marketing, honestly, is the only reason it happened.  They released around the same time as Skyrim, which, is not the same gameplay or style of game at all, however, both are Fantasy RPGs, and Skyrim is the fifth game in a lineage of Elder Scrolls - one of the most popular Fantasy RPG series of our time.  That mixed with the fact that ""Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning"" is a very long, hard to remember name for a game - this company unfortunately fell.  Story: [/b]   This story is not just some basic action story.  Sure it has it's cheesy moments, but honestly, what game doesn't?  Also, the story in this game was written by R.A. Salvatore, arguably one of the best fantasy authors of all time, certainly one of the most renowned.  Quests: [/b]  Some quests do seem fairly tedious, however the amount of quests in this game, and the amount of work that went into creating all the quests is incredible.  Especially with the size of the world being what it is.   All of the characters have their own personality, and that is great.  I am a game designer myself, and just seeing all the work that was put into this game amazes me every time I play it.    Gameplay: [/b]  The combat in this game is unparalleled.  I have never seen a Fantasy RPG that utilizes rolling to dodge, as well as the different weights and feels of each weapon, and with essentially a ""clip"" of arrows for a bow, and magic, all able to be used interchangeably in the same battle blows my mind.  And the stealth kills with daggers and faeblades? Come on.  Those are probably the coolest execution kills I've seen in any game ever, save for maybe Shadow of Mordor.  But that game came out two years after (and as we all know, technology and games improve SO much in the course of even a single year).  I also love the way you twist fate in order to gain additional EXP from your kills.  The crafting in this game is incredible as well.  I love the way you can break down weapons and armor for their different pieces, and use those to craft (and name!) an entirely new weapon or armor piece.  I do wish that there was not as much level-scaling as there is, however.  And the camera angle in this game is horrendous.  Even though the world is giant, the camera angle makes you feel cramped for space throughout the whole game.  Aside from those two small things, this game is one of the most wonderful gaming experiences I have ever had. Pros:  Smooth CombatGreat StoryFun MagicIncredible executionsFun QuestsAmazing Crafting Cons: Bad Camera AngleLevel-Scaling (personal dislike)Overall Rating: 9.5/10 "

												Play now, thank me later.Seriously. Just play it. Never mind technical reviews and detailed descriptions. They are invalid when it comes to games like this. It will suck you in its world like a vortex and dominate your life until you complete it (I won't share any more details regarding the game's finale).It's a real shame we'll probably never see another game based on this amazing and captivating universe.A real gem of a game.

												NOTE: update after finishing the gameOk... all quests done... expect the ""endless ones"" of course!I've played this fantasy RPG game only... ONLY for over 60 hours!So... let's say it simply... this HUGE game have a TONS of quests, sidequests, grinds, monsters, items, towns, NPC, etc.Also a very simple yet effective system of abilities and skills + combo fight systems... and pretty bloody fatalities (X). You'll see!But surprisingly, the story is also pretty good. I don't want to tell too much, but... imagine... the story is starting with your death. Good one, isn't it?Another interesting thing is, that You can choose your fate in a game (well it is more like a BIG perk, but still... good!)There are only two cons:1) max level is 40... it is enough... but... I'd prefere ""endless"" mode (NG++++++, etc.)!SPOILER WARINING!2) bosses are easy if You make enough Fate potionsBut...For now, I highly recommend this game!			"

												Now I actually played this originally on the Xbox 360, but lets make this a positive because I loved the game so much I wanted to buy it again on the PC. This game was something I bought on the used shelf at a game store, and it was a hidden gem. While there are some small things that could be altered (Ex. the camera mod), this game does things right. It's main story is fantastic, it has a slow incline of interest at the beggining, but before long it had me sucked into the univers of Amular. Now that the game is older and cheaper I would reccommend this to any rpg fantasy fan. With a unique class system, combat system, and weapons you can't go wrong!			"

												This game here is a double-edged sword really. On one hand, you have:- Some absolutely insane and breathtaking scenery- Great art style, creature designs and a lot of eye-candy- Fun and dynamic combat- Very in-depth lore- Rich character building- Non-linear(ish), massive open world with fast travelBut then on the other hand, there are some pretty annoying cons, such as:- Next to no memorable characters, and if there are any, they are hardly likable- Terrible dialogue, talking to NPC becomes a chore you'd want to avoid- Limited character creator with presets instead of sliders, chances are you'll be running into twins throughout the game- Some skills like lockpicking are utterly useless- No enemy level scalingLast thing to mention, game has quite a fairytale vibe to it, though it's still much darker than, say, Fable. It's a game that you'll either like or you won't. The game is nevertheless very much worth purchasing if you're fond of DA, Fable, Divinity, GW2, and alike.			"

												Playthrough length of main world: 115 hours THE BAD...-Bugs-Crashes-(Beautifully) Overpowered crafting system-World barely changes through your actions.-Sound system cannot handle too many sounds in certain areas. An epic, sweeping music track starts to play in a city, only for it to suddenly be cut off by the burning of braziers. (e.g. Mel Senshir)-Stealth kinda sucks. Both ways. In the sense that you can be caught pilfering through a chest by someone who's sleeping, and in the sense that you can totally avoid being detected by someone walking right past you.THE MIXED...-It's easy, even on Hard.-Epicness of art style, environments, and story/lore is marred by technical limits and desire for smoother gameplay.-One of the few times the epic scale of the world is shown unimpeded, the pre-final stretch ended up a repetitive chore of killing numerous squads of enemies in an overly large location.-Ending is... ehhhh. Without spoiling much, it's okay, but I hate keeping secrets. At least I can tell the secret-keeper-wanter-fella to SOD OFF.THE GREAT...-Despite the limitations, the epicness of the art style and lore still shine. Mostly.-Music-Fluid combat-Easy multiclassing and stat resetting-The journey of going through the world and questing, the ADVENTURE, was really fun for me. Like someone on vacation, I had many opportunities to take a picture and just admire at how far I had come.OVERALLA good game that could have been made great with patches and fine-tuning, were it not for the demise of the company that made it.8.3/10			"

												I'm bored, so why not write a review.

Every lvl up u get to choose multiple things.-The bosses, most of them are pretty fun.-Graphics, they're pretty good for a game from 2012.-Facial expressions, lmao.-(Combat)Cons:-Quests, most of them are boring, since it was meant to be an MMO, so just imagine the ""go there, get that, and get back here"" kinda quests.-Camera, some may dislike the camera angle and movement, I actually like it but u know...-Open world but not really, first of all: you cant jump, sounds like it's no problem at all but trust me, it is. Second: hidden walls, can't jump off edges, so u gotta walk all the way back to get down.-Likely no sequel, updates or new dlc's, the company is dead.			"

												This is a really good Fantasy RPG.The character progression, both in equipment and in skills, is very well designed, you constantly have a significant goal in sight that motivates you. One feature worth explaining is your chosen destiny card, depicted as similar to tarot cards (""The Warrior"", ""The Seer"" etc.), that do not only give you specific stat bonusses, but also help you identify with your role for the time being. I put it like this because after every level-up, you can choose a new destiny card. Those are unlocked with higher levels and perk points in one of the three classical RPG playstyles (Might, Finesse and Sorcery), and as you can respec at any time (by visitting a Fateweaver), one and the same character can be a soldier, a magician, a thief or even a hybrid class during his playthrough. As far as I know, this version of a flexible class system is unique to Kingdoms of Amalur, and I find it to be very creative.Main questline(s), faction questlines, sidequests, exploration are all written and scripted according to high standards of quality and never feel like a dull grind. Some are a bit stereotypical, some voice actors sound a little boring (e.g. the final enemy in the Warsworn questline), your dialogue options are typically quite limited - but this only takes away very little from the epicness and entertainment potential of your adventures.The world is enormous and colourful, many natural sights are real beauties. People and structures look a little too cartoonish for my taste, reminding you that this game is half a decade old - but you get used to it. Magical objects and plants glow and sparkle, which creates the vibe of a fairy tale. Immortal Faes (Elves) left ruins in the ""enchanted forest"" (that's not its name, but it feels like it) that impress by their style and their size, castles and dungeons are very spacious as well. If I am not mistaken, this world is much larger than Skyrim. The combat system is definitely better than Skyrim's. It is very fluent and tactically varied, due to dodging, parrying, swift standard attacks, special moves and abilities you learn by spending skill points (which means that your fighting technique, as opposed to mere stats, developes while levelling up). Even my heavily armoured warrior rolled and killed like a Ninja swordsman, it just felt awesome. A very small annoying thing are the constant reminders of the option to ""fateshift"" (a special killing ability), something that was OK in the tutorial, but becomes really unnecessary after you have done it a few dozen times - and it covers an important part of the screen while the combat continues. I believe that this could have been fixed very easily, but then, nothing is perfect.A weak point of this game is the lore. I  am not able to put my finger on a certain reason, but it does not appeal to me. Perhaps it is the way in which the lore is presented: ""Lorestones"" are inexplicably distributed throughout the land, and after you activate them, a part of a myth is narrated in voices that tend to be as weird as the worst of the NPC voice actors. After you activated all Lorestones in a region, you receive a stat bonus...very technical and quite unimmersive in my opinion.Nevertheless, this game was absolutely worth the full price, and now that you can have it on sale, it is definitely a must-buy. It receives a solid 8/10 from me!			"

												This is a sprawling, epic action RPG. There are three classes to choose from, might (fighter), finesse (rogue) and sorcery (wizard). It is extremely easy to create a pure character or a hybrid. Respec'ing your character is easy and you will find yourself doing this several times, if not for anything but to be able to purchase skills from an earlier trainer. I started with a pure melee character and took him to level 36. I played around with a hybrid melee/sorcerer/rogue, but didn't have fun. In the end I settled with a powerful rogue/melee hybrid that could barrage enemies with arrows from afar and mop up with blades afterward.Combat is a mixed bag. It is essentially a click fest like many action RPGs. Even still it is rewarding. Loot is the end game and trying to find the right equipment will keep you going. Unfortunately, as with most ARPGs by the time you get a complete set of armor you have better non-set stuff. However, sometimes the bonuses gained with a full set overrides the slight decrease in protection.Side quests can be annoying. Many are of the FedEx variety. It can be extremely frustrating to move from place to place delivering goods, or killing X number of beasts to collect your reward. There is a fast travel system that allows you to move from location to location as long as you have been there on foot at least once. This does cut down on travel time, but these FedEx quests are tedious. Since this is likely the only time I will play, I finished the majority of side quests. I did get bugged out of two and couldn't complete them. And a couple others I didn't do early and never went back to finish them. The quest system is easy to navigate and helpful markers show up pointing the way to your next objective.In the end, I was finally glad to get through the game. The last levels are mobs after mobs standing in your way of the final battle. I did enjoy this game and can recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good action RPG. There isn't a lot of depth in character development, but what is here is good.			"

												I've tried several times to get into this game but it just isn't happening.Pros: Looks gorgeous. Runs smoothly at (or close to) 60 FPS. Colorful, imaginative designs. You can reroll your character on the fly and try out multiple builds on one character. Combat is simple, but not awful. Reminds me of a combination of the good parts of Fable and an Elder Scrolls game. Lots of side quests and dialog options (if you want that). Fast travel AND a decent run speed make exploring not a chore.Cons: Story is incredibly bland. Yet another ""chosen one with no memories please save the world"" snooze-fest. Every quest is a fetch quest or a ""go here and activate 4 different towers and come back, thanks"" deal. Random battles, as in enemies will just appear out of nowhere and attack you. That last one would be bad, but there are a lot of enemies that can fly and cast magic, so they spend most of the time hovering just outside your attack range spaming magic blasts. The menus are a slog to get through. Lore books everywhere filled with really boring, needless notes. Some of the worst fantasy names this side of Dungeon Siege 3.If you can grab the complete edition for ~$5 and you really, really want to play another Elder Scrolls inspired game it's not a bad deal, but be warned that it is aggressivly dull underneath the pretty paintjob.

												I bought the game even though I've never even heard about it. It was on sale, I like RPGs so I thought I'd give it a shot. The first thing I've noticed or rather heard were the familiar voices from other RPGs. It was great to hear Canderous Ordo from SW: Knights of the Old Republic who gave voice to Agarth. Also you can hear Cullen's voice from DA: Origins. I've figured out more names when I was playing it but I've forgotten most of them now, it was a nice surprise though.I like the open world, and man it's huge! I've played ~100h and I still haven't discovered every location. Also, each location has different environment which is good because it doesn't get boring (well maybe except caves which are all similar). The story isn't the best point in the game, the beginning is enough to get you intrigued about it but when I found out the truth I was a bit disappointed. However, a good thing was that I enjoyed every moment that led me to finishing the story. The gameplay is very good, I found it easier to play using controller, but sometimes I found it frustrating that you can only map 4 skills. However, if  you have a good feel of your character and combat it shouldn't be a big problem. Another thing that I absolutely loved about it is the possibility of mixing the skills from all trees which allows to make some interesting hybrids. It's a feature that isn't very common in RPGs. I've found some things that were frustrating for me, for example sometimes when you have a boss fight the camera behaves weirdly, and you don't see the enemy. You just have to move your character to an open space but it's annoying if it happens often. Another things is that, you have to go everywhere on foot. Yes, there is fast travel, but the areas are pretty big and sometimes I wish they've added some mounts. Sometimes it seemed to me I've spent more time walking than fighting...And, one other thing - MORE ALYN SHIR!!! I mean seriously, she was the most interesting character out of all of them and you only interact with her a few times...such a shame. Don't get me wrong, Agarth was quite cool too but...ALYN SHIR!! What can I say, I just love her voice. When it's on sale again, don't think twice about it, just buy it!Edit (June 2015): I've just started to play this game again and man, the camera really sucks. You'll die more times because of it than because of your skill, it can get really annoying.			"

												Kingdoms of Amalur confuses me.It is a game I couldn't imagine *anyone* asking for. Not in 2012, anyway, it is not a game to enter the Dragon Age and Skyrim league: Its art design is tepid and barely par for course, the story is not really that good, the UI is a consolized mess, there is no stat sheet (!!!), mod support is ZERO, there is very few skills and combat can be overly easy at times.Now, with that out of the way, this is one of the best action RPGs I've ever played, and one I've certainly played way, way past the point where I should have stopped. The best comparison I could draw with a similar game would be Fable, really, since there's a lot of elements in common with it: Quick, flashy combat, three skilltrees you can invest points in (finesse, might, sorcery), two weapons you can switch between on the fly, a few magic spells (2, until a bit further on), you'll be on your own most of the time, and combat is strictly real time. The only part the game looks a bit more developed is on the skills category, where you can find several ways to improve your adventuring and crafting abilities. The greatest achievement of this game over Fable however, is that while Fable lost itself dillydallying over customization and tattoos and farting in the face of villagers, Kingdoms of Amalur disregards all that in favor of an incredibly tight gameplay and a very flexible, if not perfect, skill tree and progression, which provides an open-ended freeform progression to the player while at the same time opening new abilities and overall feeling way meatier than Skyrim's, whose progression was more of a polite indicator that you were getting better at shooting with a bow by way of shooting more with a bow.Now, this review will be based on my 50-odd ingame hours so far. I have played with a ranged/daggers rogue complemented with some magic spells and Might talents. As you can see, I'm a kinda indecisive player, and chosen a class that's been historically looked down upon on RPGs. One, or both of those choices would have made it very difficult for me in other games: being spread too thin in Skyrim, or playing an archer on Dragon Age would make things exceedingly difficult for me. Not with KoA. There is a class that favors all-rounding. Specializing in bows doesn't mean you can't put points in swords. Or magic. And if you choose straight combat, you can utterly annihilate anything with basic combat. You can respec a pretty good number of times, too, and clever players will be able to squeeze every profession in order to get the most of them and the best equipment. But I must admit, reaching that conclusion required a bit of patience from me. The game starts very insipid and generic, and as I said, none of the first impressions I got was really that enticing, but if one can look past that, beneath the apparent simplicity and half-assedness there is an incredibly strong and extense base material: graphics are more than competent, the soundtrack is perfectly functional with moments of greatness, quests are pretty interesting if you decide to listen to them and finally, at the center of it all, the delicious, chocolatey core of it and its main driving force for me: the gameplay, and specifically, the combat.Combat is fast and flowing, camera never gets in the way and animations and attacks are very well done. All abilities have a place on it, and a lot of approaches are viable. They might say it's a game designed with a controller in mind, but I've found the keyboard layout extremely confortable (unlike in, say, Devil May Cry), and since it's way more actiony and mobile than other games', it is also extremely satisfying: even if you are decimating groups of wolves in 5 seconds flat, you'll feel like a badass doing so instead of getting bored because it's too easy. Yes, my character has 4 active offensive skills and 2 sustained ones, but I can kick so much ♥♥♥ in so many different ways between them and my ultra-powerful handcrafted equipment that it never feels old or boring. And besides, it's better to never let your guard down: it's as easy to lose half your life as leaving your guard down for a moment.To sum it up, if you are a fan of exploring places and killing monsters I'm not just going to ask you to buy it, but to get all its DLC (especially on sale) and to be a bit patient with it. Empty your mind, shed your preconceptions and have a bit of fun with it, start doing the first missions, you don't even need to pay a lot of attention to it. Play the game for a bit, and you most assuredly will get a satisfying experience out of it. If you ever got excited about Fable, or if you are in the mood for having a good time whacking critters over the head with weapons of incredible power, pick it up without a doubt.8.5/10			"

I mean, 150 hours, you want to try it all. I found that towards the end, I had not a lot of options to spec anymore. It lacked upper level diversity. But the story line was good, the combat system rocked and reminded me of a ""controller"" type consule combat than most MMO's which was refreshing. The world is gigantic and beautiful.

												I think it's time I finally gave this gem of a game a review. Unfortunately this game didn't do well on its release because games like Mass Effect 3, and Black Ops 2 were stealing the hype of players, and Skyrim had just come out four months before - thus this game went unnoticed. 38 Studios went bankrupt shortly after the game was released completely destroying any hope for a sequel.   So, why should you buy this game?  It's definitely not an Elder Scrolls game, which is why I have enjoyed it so much. The game offers:200+ hours of gameplay. (Excluding DLC) Extremely comfortable and convenient fighting and spell casting controls. (100% Controller Compatible)Countless armor and weapons to build, collect, and upgrade.Stunning visuals and graphics and so much more!Todd McFarlane was the graphic artist on the game, which gives it a breathtaking and also somewhat cartoonish feel of the game. Each area of the game is distinctly different and absolutely beautiful, whereas with other RPGs you get the feeling you are in the same area the entire game. If you're still skeptical of purchasing, go ahead and download the demo and see for yourself. The game is more than worth its full price of $20, so if it's on sale go ahead and grab it.

												Possibly one of the greastest RPGs I've played but not for the story reason.The game itself is very fluid, everything feels so casual yet serious at the sametime, it's very easy to pick up and put down and comeback to it later and still get a great experiance if you like games that are a bit grindy at times but if you enjoy lots of quests and items then you'd love this game. Seriously there is so much to do.The areas that the game introduces I think are very for lack of a better word: Pretty, it's not like jaw dropping but it's very pleasing to the eye at least and fits in nicely with the games setting. Combat is very enjoyable, you can build whatever class you want to fit your combat playstyle and it's fairly easy to change it again if you don't like it, each class you build  gain a set of bonuses too which can affect the way you dodge along with certain stats too. there are also plenty of intreasting weapon types to get to grips with as well. I think it really offers a lot on the ways of customization one of it's high points to be sure! However there are some downsides The main story itself feels a bit... forced. I'm sure a lot of people enjoyed it but me it just felt... thrusted onto me. I really didn't like the main enemy much although I really enjoyed the concept of it all! it just felt... rushed.  I think it really comes down to taste on that one and it certainly wasn't mine. Another thing to consider is that this game uses a EA account to log in and play! I've had a bit of trouble with it before not accepting my email before for no reason to the point I had to go to the EA Origin support to correct this. (Kingdom Of Amalur Support is done through Origin support!!) thankfully it was corrected and I gotta admit the Origin support team were amazing. "

												TL;DR: It's an alright game if you're just looking for something to scratch a third-person action itch for twenty hours or so, but there's really nothing that makes it stand out as anything special.Combat itself is entertaining enough, but there's absolutely no depth to it - you have one basic attack per weapon type that can be chained together to a limited extent, and a couple of active abilities that scale so terribly you'll hardly bother using them. And since unlocking additional weapon moves is locked in to progress down the ability trees, you spend half the game without access to the more varied attacks, meaning that most of the time you'll just be hitting your attack button and blocking/dodging occasionally.The combat balance is almost non-existent, enemies are almost universally completely trivial other than the occasional one who is an annoying damage sponge and does hilariously disproportionate damage, and there's only about a dozen different enemies who are palette swapped and recycled throughout the course of the game. The most challenging part of the combat is dealing with the abysmal camera, which has a mind of its own and loves to zoom right in on you when you're surrounded by enemies, only stopping to clip through the scenery and get stuck under the floor occasionally.There's a variety of non-combat skills to choose from (lockpicking, stealth, persuasion and so on) which are generally either absolutely bloody useless, or hilariously overpowered. Depending on which ones you choose you can end up completely trivialising the game without even trying, but with a little care you can max out almost all of the skills anyway which makes any sense of choice completely redundant.The ability trees are probably the highlight of the game, there's a lot of different abilities to choose from, and thankfully you can respec your character at any time to try different things out. Depending on how you want to play, you can either go deep into one of the trees (magic, might, or finesse, which broadly correspond to the standard mage/warrior/rogue archetypes) or split your points across two or even all three trees. Putting enough points into one tree or a combination of trees unlocks ""destinies"" which give you added stats and bonus abilities and can make different ability builds feel very different from each other. Ultimately, however, it's still limited by the shallow nature of the combat system, and however you build your character you'll inevitably end up spamming the same basic attacks over and over again.The real issue is with the pacing of the game. Every single town you come across is chock full of completely forgettable NPCs who will bury you up to your eyeballs in fetch quests and kill quests which give no real rewards but make you slog all over the place anyway. Either you try and do everything out of an obsessive sense of completionism, or you get bored of that by the second or third town, rush through the main quests, and realise there's really not that much game under all that padding. There are half a dozen factions with their own sidequest chains that have a bit more structure to them, but none of them really add much to the game, and aside from some minor stat boosts it makes absolutely no difference to anything whether you do them or not.Overall it's a thoroughly mediocre experience through and through, which never manages to be amazingly good or offensively bad. If you like third-person action RPG games it ticks pretty much all of the boxes, it does everything more or less adequately without ever really impressing, it all looks nice enough and there's a whole bunch of lore if you can be bothered to pay attention to it. Pick it up in a sale and it'll give you a good thirty hours or so of moderate entertainment, but it's a mostly unremarkable experience with next to no replay value.			"

												One of the most underrated games of all time. It has all the great elements of a great Action RPG.First really colorful and smooth graphics (which are designed by Todd McFarlane, creator of Spawn). World is really beautiful, characters and enemies are well animated. Graphics are well-combined with the action. You feel like you are in a feary tale. It has a big world with lots of exploring to do. Various things to collect, many side quest to complete. So world never gets boring. Different kinds of enemies, also each town has different touches. RPG elements are satisfying and not too complicated to give you a headache. There are lots of combinations you can do with your character. Weapons and armors are fun and nice to look at. Crafting is easy to understand and your options are really wide. Especially naming your weapons are fun and makes you feel like a real hero. Combat system is brilliant, which takes you in to action. What are the cons? Well main story is not the greatest. Game is not that hard (it is not a con for me but seems like it is for the most people :) ). There are not mounts so travelling gets a little boring after awhile. In the end; if you are looking for a great, rich world with colorful enemies, cool action with great graphics, this game is for you. It is basicly a great MMORPG but single player (just as I like). It is a shame developer bankrupted. Wish they could make a sequel..			"

												This is everything I want in an RPG. Diverse ability, profession and weapon options, armors, and characters. Great story. If the map size is any judge the game size/length will be rather long. Controls are smooth enough, and the interface is nice and unintrusive. I'll be playing this one for a while. Only negative is the fetch quests can get repetitive, but the skills, weapons and armor kept me entertained till the end 9.5/10			"

												If Fable and Elder Scrolls had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child together, with EA as an evil uncle, it would be this game.  I'm supremely in love with it.  Not as customizeable as Skyrim, but with the colours like Fable, set in an interesting world with an intriguing story of the Fae/Sidhe.  The fact that EA was involved is only noticeable with the obnoxious ""contacting EA Servers"" screen and the occasional weird camera glitch which, let's face it, is pretty minor.  Can't recommend hard enough, especially if it goes on sale for a measly $11 again			"

												Kingdoms of Amalur:  Reckoning  is a western rpg, meaning when you get out of the tutorial area, the game goes ""okay, the main plot is over there, sidequests are over here... go nuts.""Overall, the game starts out with you dying, and you're brought back by the Well of Souls, an experimental form of resurrection.  So far, you're the only success.  You have no knowledge of your past life, and you seem to be unbound from the threads of Fate, meaning all your actions will have unknown effects on everyone else, for good or ill.  People destined to fail may succeed, those who were supposed to live may die, etc.The game has a fair number of good points for it - you get a good range of emotions from quests and character dialog; even minor characters have been fleshed out and given personality.  The combat system is fairly simple but engaging, so it doesn't take too long to learn, but for the most part remains interesting throughout the game.  Most enemies who die in motion will drop a treasure bag, so if the body falls off the edge of a cliff or becomes inaccessible, you can still get the loot.  There are a number of quests which your decisions will actually have an overall effect on the area, as well.  More than once, someone you're sent after will go ""uh hey, I have no beef with you, just those guys.  How about you leave me alone?"" and you can actually work for them instead, or leave them alone.  Most of the escort quests aren't too much of a pain in the ♥♥♥, either.  The graphics are quite nice as well; the game is very beautiful, and the character models are done well.The game definitely has its flaws, however.  A number of fluff items are tagged as essential, meaning if you pick them up, you cannot get rid of them or even leave them in your stash.  A number of quest items also remain after their use is expended, making them clog up your inventory list (or in rare cases, take up actual carrying space ).  There's no way to drop quests, and some quests are repeatable, so you'll always have their markers on your map after you've stopped caring about it.  The questflow is a bit odd as well - one branch of the main questline, and all of the faction questlines (along with a fair number of regular quests) point you to a city called Rathir fairly early (a place which marked somewhere around two-thirds to three-quarters of the game through for me), while only the other branch of the main questline went to an area called Detyre, which is much lower level than Rathir.  This wouldn't be as much of a problem is you received the Detyre quest first, but you receive it the same time as the one pointing you to Rathir, and if you've been working on any of the faction quests, you're going to be getting a huge push to go there as well.  The crafting and skill system could have used some more work as well; the lockpicking is a joke as most of the time you don't even need to move the pick, money becomes a nonissue quickly, making mercantile pointless; sagecrafting, alchemy, and blacksmithing all feel kinda useless until you max out their points.  Also, after a certain point in the game, all of the health and mana potions seem to drop back to lesser for some reason, even though the others are at the correct level... until even later in the game, when any non-health or mana potion drops are all just greater damaging.Sadly, given what... happened to the company, most of the bugs will never be patched, and no sequels will be made, which is a shame 'cause despite its flaws it really is a good game.  It's definitely worth $20, and any sale price it goes to is an absolute steal.			"

												Important HINT: Use widescreenfixer(google it) to fix the camera for this game, set FOV to 60-70, this will greatly improve your experience.This game is really good, but you should play it only on hard difficulty. Really underrated game, on par with skyrim but better combat. In skyrim I play an archer or an mage and get bored pretty quickly because I just spam on spell or just shoot arrows, but here I get to combo with one weapon, combo with the second weapon, throw some spells, retreat if I get surrounded - an engaging combat system. And the loot is way better than Skyrim.Pros:- The world: Variety in landscapes and cities( Compare that to the landscape and cities of skyrim: It's winter, and that's all  >_> )- Fluid combat system.- Quests: Some of them are good.Cons:- Quests: There are to many. A lot of them boring. If someone says ""I just need reagents for my potions"" - skip it. Accept only quests that sound interesting.- Difficulty: It's to easy. The game should be played only on hard. If an area gets to easy - move on.			"

												I wanted to love it, I really did but it's just so boring. It's not all bad though the game is very pretty and ran very well on my machine. The combat is good, there's better combat out there it's not compelling enough to be entertaining more than a few hours. This is where the bad starts to come in. The plot was very bland and unremarkable for such a well crafted world they should have had a much more compelling plot but they didn't manage to make me care in 7 or so hours and at that point I am never going to care. The never ending fetch quests got boring very quickly, it helps move you along to new locations but it all starts to feel stale after awhile. I feel like there is some promise here and maybe when the franchise is sold to another company they can pare away all of the unnecessary nonsense, but for now there are better rpg experiences out there that you should consider way before this one. Overall I would not recommend this.Rating: 2/5 Stars			"

												Essentially a single-player RPG with the contents of a MMO-rpg (expect the social aspect)Some of the games artwork can at times be appealing, but personally I prefer a somewhat more toned down and realistic style. In this game, the characters have overly sized hands and weapons etc all showered with all the brightest colours the designers could think of.The game consist of a few faction quest lines, which at times can be interesting, but all too often quest are ""go to certain point, fetch/kill, and return). Real choicemaking is non-existent.The main story line is bland and generic, even with the ""10 000 years"" of background history the develpoers brag about. Magic elves, technical dwarfes, in-between humans... .  The lack of good voiceacting only contributes to the game's inability to immerse, with probably as few as 10 voice-actors trying to the best of their ability to voice all characters in the game.The combat-system is quite nice. Quite easy, but a lot of ways for the player to adapt underway to the way they want to play. And unlike more classic RPGs all character developments can be changed for a small fee, so that the player don't have to think ahead. Nice, for some... . Almost all ingame quest-rewards and looting is scaled it seems, so the player seldom experience any sense of joy or positive surprise when overcoming obstacles. Many enemies are scaled too it seems.Personally I had to stop playing this game after encountering a game-breaking bug (Her righteous fury-quest), of which there is no official fix to 4 years after release (due to the developers bankruptcy, I guess). Therefore I could not fully explore the main idea of this game - fate. I find the idea of fate troubling on a logical level, and the game as far as I played it, did only contribute to this with all its logical fallacies.Nice enough game if you are looking for mind-numbing, button-mashing action-rpg, with little need for investment on the player's part. Stay clear (even on sale), if you are looking for immersion, challenge and a sense of accomplishment. This game will suck the marrow out of your bones if you are a true RPG fan.5/10			"

Plot Summary: Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is an open-world, action RPG set in a fantasy world controlled by fate and destiny.  When you first begin the game you are...dead.  But a mysterious object known as the Well of Souls brings you back to life.  When you return to the land of the living, you find yourself on a quest to discover who you are and what your destiny is.  Want to know the best part?  Unlike the complacent citizens of Amalur, you have no destiny.  As soon as you finish the tutorial/intro, you are free to explore the open world of Amalur as you please.Combat: One of Kingdoms of Amalur's strongest points is its combat system.  It is always a pleasing experience to incinerate a spider with your flaming staff or slaughter marauding bandits by impaling them on magical spikes.  Animations are very well-done and flow very smoothly.  The weapons that you can find in Amalur, while interesting, are not necessarily revolutionary.  Many times you will come across the same kind of weapons, the only difference being the perks and damage (i.e. Smoldering Longsword/Freezing Longsword/Longsword of Enhanced Sharpness).  While each weapon has its appropriate uses and does come in handy in different circumstances, the variety is somewhat lacking.Graphics: Kingdoms of Amalur has a bright, fantasy feel to it giving it a very World of Warcraft type look.  While many locations are beautiful and awe-inspiring, there are certain places that have a dull, boring look that I don't believe the developers intended.  Also, Amalur is a console port to PC, thus, many of the settings have been tweaked in order to optimize for console performance.  This means that many of the settings which could be improved on the PC (such as the foreshortened view distance) remain untouched with no way to make them look better.  However, as it is, I get a stable 60 FPS in pretty much every area with only rare spikes when loading large locations.  Overall, Amalur is quite the looker and you will not be disappointed with the atmosphere or the artistic style of the game.Storyline: The world of Amalur is vast and has many varied locations, therefore you can expect to meet many interesting, quest-giving NPCs.  From monks to a fisherman looking for his ""nymph"" fiancé, the variety in NPCs is incredible and I found myself too occupied by side-quests to really focus on the main story.  There are simply hours of quests to complete, each one unique and with its own purpose.  DISCLAIMER: If you do not like side-quests or non-linear storylines, then this game is NOT for you.Sound: Amalur has an amazing orchestral soundtrack from upbeat combat themes to serene forest ambients to eerie dungeon music.  The music really adds to the immersion and adds to the mood of each scene.  NPC voice acting is also very well done and varied enough that I haven't found any duplicate lines in my eight hours of play so far.  The only repetitive voice-overs I have heard are the town guards which can be tiresome and annoying with their generic greetings (I'm looking at you, Skyrim >_>).Conclusion: Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a masterpiece and I would recommend it whole-heartedly to you.  With 10 hours into the game so far, I am completely impressed and this game greatly exceeded my expectations (which weren't very high with the EA logo).  Kudos to the devs for making such a great game.			"

												Pretty fun game. I bought it because someone told me it has a massive game world and is fun to play - both of those things are true but the game world is split into pathways, so not quite as open as you'd think. A lot of the areas in the game just feel like hubs with different strands and pathways leading out into other hub areas. It's pretty weak to be honest and not a patch on something like Skyrim which feels like a vast, breathing world. The world here is dull, lifeless, populated by NPC's that are only really there to serve you. A shame, as the visual look of the environment is really lovely, but because of the design of the paths you never really get to appreciate the vast cliffs or forrests or deserts or anything. The game boasts a metric tonne of quests, which is good, but really this just lends itself to feeling even more lifeless as it just feels like NPC's are kinda waiting around to have a chat with you about the rats in their house. Most quests are a bit of a waste of time and only the main quest line has anything worth paying attention to. I just skipped past most quest dialogue, sadly.The combat is really fun. It operates on a combo/button combination basis and I thought it was a blast. Levelling up makes you feel genunely powerful as levelling up your different powers adds visual effects to your attacks and even special moves - it sounds gimmicky when I describe it to you here but somehow it kinda works. I had a pure mage and managed to level her to the point where I felt pretty godly. A lot of RPG's these days miss this feeling of superiority so it's nice to see a modern action RPG do this again.I guess I really enjoyed the game - I did play it for 15 hours after all but also, it kinda felt more like a 3rd person Torchlight than anything close to Skyrim or any other RPG's you like. But to be fair I just thought it was quite mediocre in places. If there was a ""meh"" rating i'd put that but i guess a thumbs up will have to do.			"

												Let me start with my minor gripes with the game, just to get them out of the way. If they ever remake this game or create a 2nd one, they need to clean up the loot system a bit and add less, but stronger dialogue. That being said...Everything about this game is pretty damn good. The graphics are solid and unique, enemy AI is responsive, and the enemies themselves are also a lot of fun to kill. There are a variety of character builds, and the farther you go into the game, you can either specialize deeper or become a hybrid (personally went warrior-mage, you get a blink teleport). The story is interesting, with the meat of it coming from the characters around you rather than the storyline itself. The DLC is pretty solid and worth it if you really enjoyed the game, and would like to play more. The main selling point of this game that I have left for last is just how humongous the game world is. There are around 4 or 5 continents if I remember, each with up to 15 or so subzones, with different environments, quests, etc. It is reminiscent of WoW in the way that they created the map (in a very good way). One could say this game took elements from many different games and combined them, to which I would agree. But this is not a negative thing... the end result is that this game really doesn't have a weakness. It definitely has replay value (though I passed on that, too many games to still play...) For $19... cmon, you really can't go wrong with this one  "

												OLD REVIEW WAS A THUMBS DOWNIn one word""Convoluted""NEW REVIEW BELOWOk i recomend this game based mainly on the incredible length and number of quests, decent storylines and dlc. But before you grab it and get bombarded with so many skills and abilites there are some things you should know.First your skills, more then half are worthless and should be ignored till you have an excess to drop your endgame poitns into.IGNORE Lockpicking, mercantile, and stealth.The Most important skill from the start is the FIND HIDDEN skill, get that to 5. Dispell is the next skill, get that to 6 or higher, dispelling is the hardest thing about opening magicaly locked chests.Persuasion is a mixed bag, it won't change any major storylines, but it can lead to a few extra rewards. It's not game breaking,CRAFTING COMES LASTCrafting won't make a ♥♥♥♥ of difference till the very end end end of the game, the gear you find will be better until the very end,Sage Crafting and Blacksmityh go hand in hand. SageCrafting can get to 6 or 8Alhemy can realy be ingored, up to the user but it really can be. you'll be so rich you can buy the potions you need easily,  and plenty drop.CLASSES, Ask yourself, do you want to blaze through the game or slowly go through the game?Mages are FAST DEMOLITIOSHERS, WARRIORS are unkillable slow dps, you have to TRY to die as a warrior. Stealth seems nice but it's so slow you often ignore stealth kills and just go into combat, also the finesse/stea;th tree is majorly focused on bows.You can mix and match any 2 or 3 trees for hybrid classes, but it keeps you from getting the top tier abilities in each.Suggestion, don't make your first guy a warrior, don't try to craft till your lvl 25+ Get your Find Hidden to 5 ASAPIf you don't follow those basic suggestions this game is going to be tedious and so slow in the first 8 hours you'll hate it like I first did. i went to gamefaqs and read some guides to learn what was crap and what wasn't.7.5/10Better then most RPG's LOTS of play time, many ways to play, ability to fully espec into something else entirely is great, the DLC is super long. Adds 10-20 hours each on top of a 35-50 hour game. If you're a lore reader (which I am no) expec to drop 100+hours for a full completion			"

												Kingdoms of Amalur begins with an appealing, even charming veneer that quickly and dramatically tarnishes. At its best, it's a generic, ""safe"" fantasy game more reminisicent of an MMO than a single player WRPG. -------------------------------------------Combat is broken down into the typical RPG trio of Warrior (Might), Rogue (Finesses), and Mage (Sorcery), or a Jack of All Trades, with the option to respec whenever you want, as often as you want. From the beginning to the end, Sorcery goes from significantly stronger to hilariously overpowered, and the classes ultimately play the same, the only difference being in what particle effects you throw at the enemy.The game plays more like an MMO than a traditional single player RPG. You drift from zone to zone, awaiting the inevitable explosion of yellow exclamation points, and there are indeed many. Too many, as a matter of fact. While one can argue that this adds more gampeplay time, it's more padding than lengthening. There's no substance to any of them, and they all play out essentially the same.A random loot system adds another serious deficit. Fighting your way to the bottom of an ancient ruin, behind a hidden door you may find a few mushrooms and a healing potion, while looting a random household rewards you with the ancient Deathaxe of MurderLord. It's worth noting that this randomization applies to the Blacksmithing system too, in which you salvage items for parts (Which are also completely randomzied. Epic weapons are as likely to give you worthless parts as junk weapons)to craft new ones. In theory you should be able to create weapons better than what you'd find, but you'll more likely than not find trash parts, and anything you do craft will be beaten by something you find on the side of the road.There's little to say about the system itself. It's a very simple click-based, skill-hotbar system of combat. It's not functionally bad, it's just not very interesting, and lacks any sort of depth.The game's Inventory system has to be one of the worst i've ever seen. Although there are attempts to provide organization, they are token. You are unable to sort your list-based inventory, which seems to organize itself completely at random. Items sharing the same set name may be dozens of slots away from each other. Also of note is a serious problem with many, many quest items that never lose their flagging, leaving them trapped in your inventory for the entire game. As they still take up space, this can be a serious issue. By the end of the game, over 50 of the 110 items in my inventory were quest flagged and unremoveable. In terms of art and sound direction, again they hit every switch to be as generic and forgettable as possible, cycling through the usual array of fantasy zones and unenergetic voice acting.The game is rife with bugs and glitches, some of which can be gamebreaking, and many of which will impact your gaming experience in other ways, such as the above mentioned Inventory issue.-----------------------------------------------------------------------If I had to sum up Amalur in 5 words, I'd only need to give you two. ""Generic. Pass.""			"

												Try the (rather generous) demo. Get out of the intro and go explore the region, do some quests, try out the combat with whatever weapons and powers look good. If you can foresee enjoying the gameplay and writing on offer for the next hundred hours or so (if you're completely nuts and insist on doing every quest you find, like me), then go ahead and grab it, at least when it's on sale. For the sale price, it's a decently fun action RPG that accommodates almost any character build.It's not very hard, and the writing isn't very deep, but that makes it easy to dip in and out when you've only got a little time and want to go smack around some monsters or race through a short dungeon. This let it last a good while as my ""screwin' around"" game for when I just wanted something to kill time, while still making progress in the game.			"

												Excellent game overall.  Here is a short overview:+  Excellent combat system:  Game is very fluid, rewards proper timing and position.+  Optimization:  Runs very well on pretty much any computer.+  Customization:  As a proper RPG, this game allows you to customize the ♥♥♥♥ out of your toon(with the ability to respec for a fee).-  Graphics:  Game looks a little cartoony but i'd imagine this was part of keeping the game as accessible as possible.-  Overpowering:  You quickly feel incredibly strong depending on how you specialize your character.So overall, the game is definitely worth the investment if you're a fan of Action-RPG's.

												I'd recomend this game to anyone who likes open world RPG's and the freedom that comes with them. The strong points of this game is the amount of content it has to offer from a large selection of non-story related quests, an enormous world to experience and the huge amount of explorable dungeon like areas on offer.The story for this game is good enough to keep you interested in the main plot, the art style and level of detail is quite lovely and the character customisation is also quite expansive from your standard crafting of equipment, enchants, potions and more to the actual skill system itself which is quite unique in the way it goes about it with fate cards. While the game does not allow you to obtain every skill and maximise it like Skyrim it does allow you to still build a unique character mixing melee/magic/ranged and stealth in interesting ways.There is also a variety of interesting weapons available allowing you to have 2 sets equipped at all times allowing for you to adapt to certain combat needs.The downsides of this game are that the sidequests can feel repetitive if you don't take a break from them time to time (or at least mix it up by doing different types) and the crafting can make this game feel to easy if you focus on making overpowered gear from the start.For the price i'd recomend it, especially the DLC that introduces some interesting features/story to th game.

												SCORE: 90/100Hell yeah do I recommend this game. Want a better game than Fable but with the beautiful artstyle Fable had? Check. Want a game like Skyrim, but with better combat? Huge Check. Great music? Check. Big world to explore? Check. This is one of the most underrated games of all time. I'm having a blast playing this game. The only reason it is not more popular is because it came out the same time Skyrim did. But honestly, I've had more fun with Amalur than with Skyrim mainly because of the combat. I'm not saying it's a better game than Skyrim, just that the combat is MUCH better. Seriously, the combat system is probably the best in the open world, MMO-style, western RPGs you can play. It's fun, lots of combos, a lot of versatility, awesome abilities, cool weapons, an over-powered crafting system, cool looking armor, etc. You can easily sink over 100 hours into this game, and there's a lot to it. Lorestones with stat buffing, the crafting system is fun and easy to understand, the skill tree and the ability to combine classes adds for interesting and different combat styles, and the Threads of Fate is very satisfying to unleash on your opponent. You feel like a total badass with the seamless combat. I use a controller because it's easier to combo your main and secondary weapon, but there is a mod that allows to have your 1-8 keys set to Active Cast on your keyboard, that way pushing a key automatically casts the ability, instead of just equipping it. Whereas with a controller, you're limited to equipping a total of 4 abilties to the A,B,X,Y buttons. The one problem people keep mentioning, which I haven't run into yet, is the game becomes very very easy. But I think that's only if you start crafting super powerful weapons, which will take time leveling up your Blacksmith ability, and getting lucky enough to find the rare components and gems to make these items. HOWEVER, there is a mod that allows you to increase the difficulty, like smaller gains in experience, enemies hit harder, less gold found, health and mana regen is much slower, etc. I might use this because the level cap is very low. I'm already at level 21 with 44 hours put into this game. But I really love to play this game. The story is interesting, but it lacks main, memorable characters. It's a lot of NPCs with missions. I haven't been doing the main storyline yet. Just been doing sidequests because I love exploring the world and collecting items.			"

												This game is my pride and joy ! I love it too much because there isn't anything like it when it comes to PC RPGs. You can play it with an XBOX controller for an immersive experience. The graphics are beautiful without being demanding so it should run flawlessly even on older PC's.              The story is intriguing but there is space for more.             Yes it's inspired from Fable or Witcher but hey those are awesome games and it's not just a crappy clone ; it somehow manages to be unique and fascinating. You can get lots of hours of fun by playing this game (probably hundreds of hours) so it deserves all the attention. Too bad the studios who created this little gem are now closed. They deserved more than that.             It kinda reminds me of MMORPG genre but that is not a bad thing.  It's a shame that MMO's are populated by jerks and kids - that's why i prefer anytime a single player experience. Call me crazy but that is how i see things - i just want to game in peace. The price is big on Steam but you get more than you pay - i got the game for free from a friend but i would have bought it without even thinking. it's A NO BRAINER!             Kingdoms of Amalur features five distinct regions, four playable races, and three class trees with 22 abilities per tree.The four playable races are the Almain (Civilized Humans), the Dokkalfar (Dark Elves), the Ljosalfar (Light Elves), and the Varani (Nomadic Humans).The player starts off as a ""blank slate"", but can afterwards choose a class among the three available in the game, which are called Might, Finesse, and Sorcery; they correspond to the fighter, rogue, and mage classes respectively. As the player fights and gains experience, additional levels are unlocked. With each level gained, the player gains three ability points which can be invested in the skill-tree system to unlock or augment the 22 abilities. By completing Faction quests and investing ability points, the player can also unlock various ""destinies"", which add positive buffs to the player.Combat is based on the timing of button presses, similar to an action role-playing game, with occasional quick time event cutscenes. The combat includes a 'fate' system which allows players to accumulate 'fate points' and ultimately enter 'Reckoning Mode', a slow motion mode that allows the player to quickly dispatch enemies. The Reckoning Mode may end on player's command, with the depletion of the fate bar or by the act of 'Fateshifting' an enemy. Fateshifting involves performing a brutal finishing move on a single enemy. During the cosmetic Fateshifting phase, the player may rapidly tap a random button (chosen and displayed by the game) to increase the experience yield up to 100%. After the Fateshifting, all weakened enemies also die.            The player can travel on land, jump down from predesignated spots and swim in the water. The player has the ability to communicate with, rob or kill NPCs; each of these actions have their own consequences. Lead combat designer Joe Quadara emphasized that ""twitch skill is only going to get you so far. Strategy and proper RPG playing is going to get you farther.""[5] 38 Studios founder Curt Schilling said that the style of the game would be a marriage between God of War and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

												Kingdoms of Amalur sure feels like a refreshing wind after trying out a bunch of different mmorpgs and rpgs.This game combines the combat of many console-esque titles like God of War and Darksiders, with the lore and rpg-aspect of games like Dragon Age and Vampire the Masquerade (roughly speaking).LoreAfter playing around 12 hours I was feeling fairly immersed in the world of Amalur. Bit for bit you learn more and more about the lore, machinations of the world and all the colourful characters that inhabit it. You can go further by looking for ""lorestones"" across maps and reading books/scrolls that will teach you more about the Kingdom of Amalurs history, alas it is not mandatory for those who prefer to avoid lore alltogether and focus on the other aspects of the game.But for those who love lore like me, you'll notice that there has been placed a lot of thought into the this aspect of the game. I'm not aware if it's R.A. Salvatore or someone else who wrote the story, but it seems well thought out in overall.Size of game-worldThe game itself seems to be fairly large - the worldmap is quite grand & you travel between subzones on it. ""Clearing"" each area can sometimes take a couple of hours - so this game isn't really lacking content as to say. This game has easily 100+ hours of content to go through.QuestsSome people voice concern that the game is too ""grindy"" and compare it to games like World of Warcraft where you kill x amount of wild boars, and then move on to kill x amount of kobolds, etc. Amalur has these kind of quests too, but they are well mixed among very different and personalized quests which in my opinion makes the former ones bearable to a larger extent.VisualsThe visuals look good, even if you find odd low-res textures here and there which isn't as bad as it might sound as long as you don't expect ultra setting Skyrim ENB with high res textures-quality. Kingdoms of Amalur can also utilize the ENB-injector technology and give the world a more vivid look which I recommend for everyone who aren't satisfied with the default visuals of the game. You can grab it off the Skyrim Nexus site.ClassesOne of the games absolute strongpoints is the ""class""-system that Kingdom of Amalur has. You have a lot of options to combine and customize your own ""class"" - mix and match skills of different kinds. The game has the classic ""Warrior, rogue and sorcerer""-theme, but you can create hybrids of all combinations - and the ability to respecc for a sum of gold gives you a chance to try out different kinds of gameplay without having to create a new character every time.CombatThe combat is fast paced and fun. You unlock and learn new kinds of attacks and ""combos"" as the game progresses and you level up your character. The many kind of enemies and their behaviour means that you can't just spam attacks all the time (if you play on hard-difficulty), but you actually need to stop and block, or dodge attacks to be able to win. Thinking ahead is key, for example when positioning yourself so that all the enemies get in a big line infront of you, prior to using that powerful sword-attack that hits everything in a line up front.Minor flaws of the gameMy only gripe so far with this game has been minor annoyances like the FoV (which you can modify using a widescreen modification - google it!) and things like weapons sheathing too fast, both in and out of combat. I'd like to see more RP-aspects and abilities for the character, but seeing it being a single-player game - it's forgivable. The game is also not open-world, but rather ""instanced"". Still the ""instanced"" areas are often pretty large, way larger than what Dragon Age had for instance - thus making it forgivable too.ConclusionIn overall this game is fairly good if you're looking for decent story, engaging combat and many hours of gameplay. A little polish wouldn't hurt here and there though as I earlier mentioned. Unfortunately since the studio behind this game went into bankruptcy we can't be expecting any more updates, which is sad since the title has potential and I would personally be interested in purchasing a sequel if there ever was one.RatingGiving this game a 8 out of 10.

												Kingdoms of amalur: Reckoning is an open world action rpg with emphasis on combat.The game's plot is interesting in concept, but flawed in execution (more on that in a minute). The world is filled with powerful magic and watched over by a powerful race, the fae, split between the winter and summer court. They have lived in relative peace with the mortal races of humans and elves, until one day the winter fae attacked the mortal races. Unlike mortals though, the fae ressurect after a while, for no fae truly dies, or stays dead forever, while mortals do. You are the recently ressurected hunk of meat that takes whatever form you customised it to look like, dragged out of the well of souls, a magic item capable of bringing the dead back to life in massive numbers, except that you are its first and only success. You learn that on the day of rebirth, the winter fae have attacked the facility you are in just as you wake up, you are told about the well, what you are to a basic extent, and then told to flee the place before it caves down on your head, not before you learn you have weird powers, somehow connected to fate...Now, it turns out that everything and everyone has a fate, dictacted by the tapestry of fate, you however, are not connected to it, and can change it however you like, in theory. This is leads to one big problem. how linar the game actually is. You can do all the side quests in any order you like and follow a number of faction quests in whichever order you like as well, but, even if you have literally nothing binding you to a set path, no choices you make have that big of an impact, save for a handful. You are stuck following this same basic path up until the points where the game says you can make a choice, do you side with A, or B? Sometimes, if you are lucky, C. A good example is when a soldier who wants to sell everything he owns to the people of a town asks you to do it instead. You can buy all the items off him instead, but i wanted to give him way more money, maybe an OP sword i forged and make him feel better about life. I couldn't, i just had to follow the quest line mindlessly. the majority of quests can be summed up similarly. Most of the side quests are fetch quests, or ""go kill this"" quests, or delivery boy quests (where you go back and forth between two characters exchanging messages and items). You can ignore them, but even the major quest lines feel weak, the only entertaining ones were those to do with the fae, but i, at no point, was able to just do whatever i wanted. I can't explain how restricted i felt doing some of these quests, and how many of them felt extremely boring.The lore of the game is suprisingly well put together in some parts, i really loved the fae and how the winter and summer fae acted within the world. Both of the fae quest lines were the highlights of the game for me. That was the only bit of the story i found actually praise worthy.The game, apart from the dull quests and plot full of holes, is really fun. The combat system in this is very satisfying, you have a total selection of nine weapon types, each one with a few combos each, and a slew of special moves. The enemy variety isn't great, but its just good enough to stop the game from getting stale. In the early game, combat is a bit tough, especially against niskaru, but, by the mid to end game, its dreadfully easy, especially if you ever get health regen above 4 points per second and max out smithing and sagecraft, effectively allowing you to mass produce gear that outshines every other piece in the game. The game never felt truly challanging, except for a few bosses here and there, and the only time i was fully involved and entertained was when i was surrounded by a pack of niskaru and i was out of health potions, then it was challanging.Character progression is pretty in depth as well, you have three skill trees, magic, strength and stealth. You put points into various aspects to unlock and power up abilities, and if you put enough points into trees, you unlock classes, allowing you to gain bonuses to certain aspects of your character. I did however manage to break the game by unlocking the thunder storm ability, which was a mass AoE attack that also stunned and knock back, from there, it was down hill the moment i got chakrams, which were AoE melee weapons with high damage output.The art style is, overall, vibrant. Everything is saturated in a rich color scheme, and alot of the designs for the enemies are pretty interesting. Though, every last bit of armour and weaponry looks like it was pulled directly from an MMO (which this was originally meant to be, or at least, meant to be a pre-quel of if i recall). As such, its all rather over sized and silly looking. Your character looks like a goof, mainly because half the time you'll be running around with pieces of different armour sets that just do not blend together. Not to mention the rather limited character creation menu.This game isn't terrible, I would never talk anyone out of buying it unless they are specifically looking for great plot. Everything it does, it does to a decent standard and only in storytelling does it fail. It not an all time great, its not a hidden gem and its not a classic. Its more of a cult classic than anything. If you are looking for a standard, decent rpg with good combat and have some time to kill before you move onto something else, or just want an rpg who's entire focus is fae. Then this is a game for you. If you are looking for a strong plot or an rpg where every action you take directly influences the overall story for better or worse, avoid this.I personally found this to be...acceptable, I don't regret my time with it, nor do i think i'll recall this game with any amount of deep fondness. In truth, i tried to beat this twice as a console pleb back when i had a PS3. The game glitched and broke twice on me, around the 40 hour mark. So the main reason i bought it again and beat it was for closure. Having finished it, i can cry to the heavens ""Eh, it was alright"".			"

												Both debut and swan song of 38 Studios, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a sadly overlooked diamond in the modern action RPG world that serves as both a great introduction for newbies to the RPG thing and a stretch of the normal boundaries to which veterans are acclimated.If not the most shining example of originality in story, Amalur's pedigree is exceptionally notable in that its tale is penned by R. A. Salvatore, whose work boasts a quality and depth which turns peculiar and magnetic when framed by Amalur's Irish-inspired mythos. The game's yarnweaving is comparable in its strengths to those displayed in Bioware's stories, and at times is more of a draw than the gameplay itself.On the RPG side of things, many RPG titles have tried to allow players the ability to cross the traditional combat archetype boundaries of mage-rogue-warrior before. Amalur does this and goes further by offering special incentives for what other games might consider ill-advised: a player deciding to stick with classic warrior traits is perfectly tenable, but so is a rogue-warrior hybrid - or even a perfect split of mage, rogue, and warrior - and each gets completely unique benefits. The mixing and matching of skill and ability characteristics is unusually compelling.As a game, Amalur consistently provides a canvas across which the player can paint with their enemies as both the instrument and the color medium. Suffice it to say that control in the battlefield is wrought with enough precision that it rings in sympathy with any tuning fork, and goes beyond ""fun"" and well into ""gripping"" whenever an engagement lasts longer than five seconds. Unfortunately, the challenge of the game's combat is one of the author's only significant complaints - experienced RPG players may find themselves in want of a more demanding difficulty as time goes on, even after selecting the maximum setting.The author would recommend that, if a person were to own no more than five games in total, this be one of them. The departure of 38 Studios is a sad loss, but their legacy does them great credit.			"

												I knew nothing about this game before playing. I picked it up from my friend's library and after a few hours into it I knew I had to see the end. The game drew me into the role play straight away, so I bought my own copy. The variety of loot, freedom to choose how your character progresses, many options to craft weapons, armor and potions, beautiful graphics, and much more made this game very, very enjoyable. I think it should be recommended especially to those who aren't much experienced with RPG type games and want to try it. I'd also recommend getting the DLC's as there's more interesting content to play.			"

												I'm writing this review after 120 hours of gameplay because that's how much time it took for me to make sure I left no stone unturned. Although I'm 100% sure I'll find new things when I eventually replay it, I might have missed a few quests by the end because I wanted to beat the final boss.+ Beautiful and diverse environment. Dalentarth and plains of Erathel looked similar, but Detyre was entirely different. I spent a lot of time taking screenshots because I wanted to show my friends what a beautiful game I'm playing.+ Rast Brattigan. I wish there were more NPCs like her.+ Great combat system. Reminded me of The Witcher 2.+ Mixed classes. By this I mean: everything goes. You want to be a 100% warrior? No problem. A battlemage? Gotchu. Equal parts of Might/Finesse/Sorcery? There's a destiny for that. I was playing a warrior-rogue hybrid charging into everything headfirst with a greatsword. Go crazy.+ Gathering ingredients is similar to how it was in Oblivion, meaning you can fail gathering a plant if you don't have enough points invested in alchemy. Also, the starting area is peppered with ingredients required for health potions, which is always nice, especially when you're new and don't know how to play.+ Voice Acting is superb. I'm sure half of NPCs were voiced by a 100 different people. If not, I'm still impressed. However, being a hardcore Dragon Age fan I couldn't help but hear Cullen in half of male NPCs and Loghain reciting me lore bits.+ Character customization. Especially the tattoo which at right settings could look like a scar.+ Chickens. Finally, nobody throws me in jail for accidentally killing a chicken or ten. There's even a ""Chickens slain"" count on your stats page.- Hard is normal, normal is easy, haven't tried easy difficulty but you get my meaning.- Stealth system is kinda weird? I was wearing heavy armor but with enough points invested in stealth I could sneak up on enemies and execute them, at least in the beginning of the game.- Some abilities in your preferred ability tree are kinda useless but you have to invest points in them anyway because the next level requires a certain amount of points.- Some items stay in your inventory after the quest is finished and you can't sell them. This becomes less of a problem halfway through the game when you have maxed out inventory space and don't need more money than you can find on your travels, but scrolling through 30 unwanted items while looking for a repair kit was kinda off-putting.- There little incentive to buy anything other than backpacks. By checking every corner I already had good weapons and armor and I didn't need to buy them. Had 5 Million gold by the end of the game, most of that from enemy drops and quest rewards.- Some bugs are game-breaking. I recommend making a hard save before every main quest. Some bugs make it unable to continue with it thus preventing access to other areas.- Man Boss can be defeated in about 5 minutes if you stock up on a certain potion, making it easier than common trolls.

												Despite the company going bankrupt after the launch of this game, this is actually a really solid, involved, RPG.  I downloaded it years ago and finally decided to give it a shot, and I'm glad I did.  +Pros-Immense character customization-Incredible variety of equipment-Fleshed-out, interesting characters-TONS of side quests-Innovative, easy to learn/difficult to master combat-A huge, expansive, living world-Lots of lore and background into the world-Interesting, forward-moving story-Crafting/alchemy-Solid DLC-Good enemy varietyCons:-Level cap of 40, which I hit at about 3/4 of the way through the game-It gets EASY towards the end.  The final boss was hilariously simple to beat.-Silent protagonist.-Occasional camera issues-A few bugged questsAs a completionist, doing all side quests, I beat the entire game in about 70 hours.  If you are a fantasy RPG fan, you should check this game out when it's on sale.   "

												I think this game is amazing, I sunk 25 or so hours in before even touching the main story line. To me, it feels like everything Skyrim could have been. The graphics are quite good, the look and feel is great, the voice acting is decent, quests are varied in a number of ways and the combat is amazing. Althoguh it doesn't do anything insanely special, it does a lot of stuff really, really well, making it a very polished game.The one thing that annoyed me quite a bit, as I frequently used reskilling as a way to keep the game and combat fresh and exciting, was that there were always a number of skill points that were wasted on things I didn't need or use but were required to unlock the next tier of skills.Very good game all around though, I hope more games come out with well rounded quality like this.

I heard about this game from a friend and when i watched him play it i thought it looked dull and unoriginal....I've never been so wrong in my life. Let me start off by saying this is one of the most underated RPG games in history, this game is overflowing in content that you can easily sink hours of your life into. The best features must be the gameplay and the atmosphere. Combat is fluid and visually appealing, and the atmosphere is jaw dropping in ALL locations, absolutly beautiful environment.

												Why have I waited so long to recommend this game? Why? I know why, because I thought, 'When I get to the end of the game, I'll have a true appreciation of it, thereby writing something from my extensive knowledge.'  Yeah, sure. At level eighteen and about sixty some odd hours in, I'm no where close to finishing. So onto my actual review:This game is actually really good and I feel it's been overlooked. I honestly feel it is a diamond in the rough. It -is- similar to Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, but let me tell you something fascinating. I bought ES:Skyrim before I bought KOAR (Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning) and when I bought it and played it, I did -not- care for it. I was lambasted, cast out and disowned but there it is. I didn't like it. Now flash forward to spending time in Reckoning, I want to go back and play Skyrim. That's how much enjoyment I've gotten from this game. It takes me back to a place when I started playing World of Warcraft. There were these amazing characters, this fascinating storyline, beautiful artwork. This, that and the other. Eventually I fell out of love with World of Warcraft, but this game takes me back to that feeling of rolling my first character. The combat is very user friendly. I would akin it to hack and slash, but I feel that simplifies it far too much. You have abilities, the way you unravel the fate of a foe is cinematic and enjoyable, somehow savagely satisfying.  The talent trees are easy enough to navigate. Much in the spirit of Skyrim, you can choose what you want to be and whether you want to go, might, finesse or mage, or all three or two or...you get where I'm going.The skills are pretty neat, you have options on alchemy, a sort of jewelcrafting, blacksmithing, lockpicking, dispelling...and on and on. I wouldn't recommend lockpicking as the lockpicks are cheap, cheap and even the 'hard' chests are done simply enough.The quests are pretty fascinating, especially the main quests. There are some side quests that will have you fetch and step bear butts but its to be expected with any sort of RPG, in my opinion. Character creation is neat, not overly detailed but enough where you get your input in. If you're expecting to spend 3 hours lost in faces, noses, ears and hair style, you will be let down. This game is not linear. You can put off the main quest indefinitely if you so wish, there are factions to join and quest for, increasing your reputations with them. There are choices to be made to decide the moral ambitions of your character, there are persuasions to attempt, assassinations to be had and endless monsters to slay until your heart is bursting with contentment.TL;DR? Does it revolutionize the RPG genre with it's intuitive and mind-blowing format? Not so much. Does it bring out some of the -best- of what we love in RPG's? I firmly say, yes. Is it worth purchasing? Absolutely. I think if you're a fan of RPG's you will find hours and hours worth of enjoyment, plus replayablitiy. 8/10			"

												good story with a very detailed world. This game will keep you occupied for at least  100 hours if intend to finish all the sidequests ( and boi there are a lot of these with questionable worthwile rewards...)the fighting (and there's a lot of it) is nice and fast.. and it's not entirely all about gear. You can even prevail with inferior gear because the dodge/block system is well balanced. The loot is in fact what i didn't liked about the game. there was just too much chests to loot. Enemies also respawn if you use fast travel too frequently. On the other hand every respawned enemey has the chance of a new awesome item.. but as i said.. even if your gear is ♥♥♥♥♥♥.. you can still have the upper hand in fights if you have the right skills or time you blocks&dodges properly. (biased) downsides: - too much loot imho ( yeah.. it's not a diablo.. and it shouldn't try to be)- respawning enemies- low fov (use widescreen fixer (google it))- play the game on hard or you won't have a challenge)the gameworld is really beatiful  and eyecatchy and the game does not end when you finish the main storyline. also it has a lot of the little things you miss in other games or only get them if you buy a dlc. (changing appearance, re-roll your skills, housing (to some extend...),...)all in all def worth the money if you have the time to embrace the story and beatiful world it takes place in.			"

												Awesome game. It's like the artistic style of Fable and Oblivion got blended together with the playstyle of open worldness of Skyrim and, to some degree, combat mechanics capturing the essence of God of War. The story is enthralling and the gameplay completely open for you to choose how you wish to approach it. Not to mention that it looks completely amazing, and the load screens are seconds long, never having one longer than 10 seconds, even with the settings maxed out on my somewhat dated machine.Something I wasn't expecting when I got this game, was how mature the story and some of the kills are, though tastefully done. If anything, I'd call it a positive that they made this game more adult oriented.I really love this game, thus far, and it has tons of replay pottential. The only thing I find that could detract my love for this game is the apparent time it takes to complete, which I've seen many say is about 200 hours of gameplay. Be warned of that.			"

To Keep this review short and simple let me first state that this game is a open-world singleplayer RPG with a hint of MMORPG feeling to it. The graphics are outstanding and considering Todd McFarlane did the artwork you just know your gonna see some pretty unique landscapes and characters. The musical score is done by Grant Kirkhope and he has crafted a collection of pleasant and delightful pieces in this game. The story telling and voice acting are rock solid. Gameplay is similar to Fable and combat at times feels a bit like God of War. This game is simply amazing and should be played by any true RPG fans.			"

												In Amalur there is a war between motals and immortals, and guess who's loosing. Everyone's destiny is already known and there's nothing they can do, until a hero is awakened from the dead, the only mortal who lives again. The only one without fate, only you can change the fate of the whole world. You are limitless, what are you going to do? The game offers you three playstyles or mix of them. Rogue, mage or warrior. I tried to play as a rogue, but it still ended as me running everywhere and shooting everyone with powerful arrows, much more useful, quicker and funnier than sneaking and backstabbing, what a shame. My only ability was always active boost on attacks. In game there are also some crafting options like blacksmithing, jewerlycrafting, alchemy and so on, but it also won't help you. I ended looting and buying everything instead of using profesion skills. The best part of the game is the story which is a little confusing I tried hard but I couln't remember all those names so I just focused on the main line and what happened in Amalur without details. If you are looking somthing easy and casual I think this is for you. I think this game is a little overrated.6.5 /10			"

												This game is a real hidden gem. It's not perfect, but it is very good. Combat is fun and interesting. You can mix up your playstyles as and when you wish. Got bored of being a stealthy assassin? Become a mage and blow everything up.The storyline is interesting and well told with lots of lore sprinkled around the game. The maps won't boggle your brain and few overly complicated puzzles to solve, but to many that's a good thing. Pros - Truely beautiful backdrops and sceneryGreat combat that feels fluidThe ability to change playstyle easily, totally changing your character if you feel like it.Well told storyLots of items, lore and things to find.Cons -Even on hard, the game felt easy (or maybe my mage was just grossly over powered)Master crafted gear made with good parts will make you godly beyond what any Unique will make you and it can get very silly. As a mage I could tankt he final boss of the DLCs and let my Summon finish them off for me, while not wearing my robes or using block.Overall a great game, and one I would very much recommend spending time and money on.

												I got this game while it was on sale for $4.99 or so, and by that measure, it was a great game.  The graphics were clean and nice but nothing spectacular, the progressing moves are visually impressive and fun, and the quests are plentiful; but there are a few things that I found disappointing that others may like to know before buying.1) Repetative - Like most RPGs, the repetitive nature is unavoidable, but in the case of Reckoning it was exhausting.  Every quest was the same (Kill/harvest __# of enemies/objects, find and rescue this person) so much so that I found myself avoiding side quests about 40 hours into the game.  2) Scaled leveling - while some enjoy this, I like to feel a bit of power as I progress through a game.  The fact that boggarts (low level creatures which are succeptible to fire) took increasing amounts of swings/spells to kill was annoying, and while easy, fights seemed to drag on for insane amounts of time.3) Immersion - I'm a big morrowind fan, and I tend to like RPGs that are as immersive as that game was to me in 2003.  That being said I still like to hold each game in it's own light but found myself wanting more immersion with Reckoning.  Part of this I feel is due to the boundaries imposed by the designers...most games that lack a jump button or prohibit movement outside of predetermined area tend to feel less inviting for some reason - even if that inviting feeling leads to my death by gravity.  4) Quest Tracking - You are only able to track 1 quest at a time. This forced fast a lot of fast travel for me because the next quest was across the huge map.  I hate to reference WoW, but their quest tracker is heavily missed in a world this large.  The problem with fast travel for me is that I stop paying attention to the surroundings and start feeling like I'm doing a chore.  This may just be a personal thing but I feel it's worth mentioning.5) Customization - The options menu is disparaging.  You can't upgrade graphics options, you can't remap some movements (going in and out of quest, inventory, map menus) required hitting ""esc"" key), the game is stuck in its out of the box condition.6) Story - combined with the quest issue, this kind of ties in with immersion, and made the story feel forced and generally bland.  There were a few moments where I was intruiged but for the most part it was lackluster.I would liken this game to Fable in its mechanics and feel, though Fable (the original) was designed and paced much better.  The game is enjoyable and fun, simply not astounding.  If there were a star rating on Steam, I would rate it 3/5, and it wouldn't surprise me if a 3.5/5 rating was the norm			"

												Overall, the game is pretty good. The main problem is that it's too easy. With Lorestones and unlockable Destinies, there are no shortages of permanent bonuses. If by the end of the game you have fewer than 30 bonus mods not related to your equipment, you must be doing a speed run.Each area apparently has a level range, and the levels of enemies get locked to your level within that range the first time you visit the area. There are no areas where the minimum level is 40+, meaning after you get to a certain point, leveling further becomes impossible. Luckily, 40 is more than enough to become totally invincible, especially with the Dead Kel DLC. With some clever blacksmithing, you can end up one-shotting many foes, and bosses will take no more than 4 hits. Also, the map you have is magic. For most quests, they ask you to go somewhere and find something or kill something, and the map knows exactly where it is, even if you haven't been there before. The Lost Treasure Of Meropis is a quest to find a bunch of relics sunken in various bodies of water. Surprise, surprise, it's not a ""lost"" treasure for long because your map knows exactly where all the relics are. This happens in 95% of quests. NPC's will be totally amazed that you found the lost journal of a long-dead scholar or the bandit-in-hiding.This aside, The world is pretty large and decently well-rounded. Some of the quests are pretty interesting on their own, but most will seem silly. With a little work, your character will soon be the undefeated champion gladiator, the archsage of the largest group of mages, the king of a bunch of immortals, etc. Sadly, no NPC will know you are more than one of these at a time.The fighting system is pretty good overall but again very biased in your favor. With the exception of certain bosses, no regular enemy has more than 2 or 3 attacks, many of which are staggered so you have time to react. The variety of enemies is lacking considering the size of the world so you can quickly learn how to deal with them all and then demolish everything standing in your way.The storyline is alright once you properly understand how literal the characters are when they talk about fate. The Fae are pretty much stuck in an eternal loop of rebirth and redoing the same thing as last time, and knowing that they are doing it. The other races have fate issues too and your character seems to be the only exception. All things stem from this.From what I've seen of Skyrim, this game seems very similar to it, except this version seems to be more rushed in it's development and a little buggy.			"

												This game is often compared to Skyrim, for a reason. Both present a huge, open fantasy world with hundreds of quest which can be taken in no particular order. This is, however, where any similarities with Skyrim end. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning has stunning and very colorful visuals that had me hooked in an instant. I pay a LOT of attention to scenarios in RPGs, and Amalur probably has the most beautiful I've ever seen. The forests, ruins and towns really give you the impression of a world full of things to explore. That being said, there are a bunch of things that feel ""off"" in this game. The gameplay is just fine: not brilliant but not bad either. It is not a challenging game and most of the time I just found easier to hack and slash my way to victory than to use spells or rogue abilites. The way your casting is interrupted by literally any attack is really annoying and counterintuitive. The most powerful AoE spells take a long time to cast, and should be more useful against several enemies, but chances of being interrupted are huge and therefore said spells become useless. Like I said, the melee strategy was the most efficient by far for me, which is a little underwhelming since I really like using magic. Another problem with Amalur: questing. 90% of quests will reward you with gold and experience. The quests have some cool stories and lore behing them, but being rewarded with the same things over and over agains becomes tiresome, especially considering you won't need that amuch gold. There's also no reason NOT to use the ""fast travel"" ability, which makes exploring the world less interesting as well. You won't get cool random events like in Skyrim, ever. 90% of the experience you get comes from quests as well, so fighting monsters is not a reason to backtrack ON FOOT (because there are no mounts).To be honest I think Amalur should have inspired itself in Skyrim even more. Maybe it didn't had the budget to do so, I don't know. I highly recommend this game for anyone who is crazy about fantasy and cool scenarios (like me), but be mindful that most of it's problems are glaringly obvious for players who are used to play lots of RPG games.

												I've played the crap out of this game and it is awesome. The storyline is rich, the character creation wasn't too in-depth, the skills are freakin awesome, and the quests are numerous. Definitely has replay value since you can choose different skills to level and options to take in conversation. I wouldn't call it revolutionary but it's certainly fun to play. Good mechanics with very little bugs, even though I can't recall any at the moment. The voice acting is not cheesy so it doesn't ruin the game. I'm a fan of single player rpg's and this one got me. Epic battles.			"

												WOW, Another MUST have game IMHO !!!I waited a Long time to play this game & get a price drop on STEAM compared to retail/Etail editions due to some problems with the dev going under.This game has EVERYTHING i Love in a Arpg, looks great, plays silky smooth (on a old system gtx285/q9550/8gb ram), more then enuff replay value with tonnes of good loot to be found.The game has lots of depth, decisions you make actually make a difference in the game.If you like to explore & want to get everything out of the game be prepared to sink hundreds of hrs into this lovely game.The music & atmosphere help to project you further into this realm of Amalur, it really is a joy just listening & watching all that is going on.Unlock abilities & truelly have a say in what u can craft/disasemble as U lvl Up in the game.Some will say you waste time with side quests but i find it all adds up for those that love to dig deep & explore the world.I love all the abilities this game has, something i just found out today is pickpocketing, i was like DANG, wish i knew that from the start, oh well....i can't read manuals, i just ""GAME"".This game has an artistic feel to some other rpg's i really like like torchlight, some will argue it but each to their own evaluation.For me, i Know a game is Golden when initially i i play it 18hrs+ & can't stop playing it till i finish.This game is possessing me to finish it like the Batman series did, it Truelly is an addictive game.P.S:  BUY this game if u love Arpg's or ""1st person view"" rpg's in general !Is it worth FULL PRICE for the base game ? HELL YEAH, is the DLC package worth it ? i don't know but if it's like the base game i say YES.Obviously to those wanting to save $ on a sale of 50% min it's a NO brainer !!!Another note: the ""Weapons & Armor Bundle"" seemed to be WEAK, if you use it right away then it may be ""OK"" but if u sit on the fence before using it after many hrs of play it seems like a ripoff. (IMHO)PLEASE DO BUY skills for $ from NPC trainers lvl1-3Good day & DO pick up this wonderful game, i hope the IP wasn't lost & that there will be another edition, but it seems like that won't be the case:(WIN 7 64x works without issue on my system !!!specs are:q9550gtx285 (SLI) Not used8gb ram2tb hdd..... 256gb ssd			"

												Often after completing an RPG I feel the need to immediately start again with a new character to explore alternative paths or skills. That did not happen with this game. It’s pretty good but not great. There were good parts and bad parts and overall the good won out. The world is interesting and the graphics are nice enough. After a while though you start to notice caves repeating themselves. But this was nowhere near as bad as Dragon Age 2, there were a lot more combinations. The combat flows well and feels like you’re in control although it took a little getting used to after hours of Skyrim.  I was playing as a warrior/rogue combo so I don’t have much experience with the spell system. For the size of the world there was not quite enough enemy variety. At higher levels you just fought the same foes but with more strength and armour. Also by the time I’d reached the max level (way before I was close to the end of the story thanks to DLC areas) I was way overpowered. Combat no longer had any risk. The main quest was great but it felt very spread out. In order to fill the large world there were just so many side quests. At times it felt endless and the problem was they were very generic compared to the main storyline. Go here, kill this. Save this person. Bring me 10 things. By the end I wasn’t really listening to what people were saying anymore, just waiting for the map marker to show up letting me know what I needed to kill. I’m glad I played through it but once was enough. If you’re an RPG fan with a gap to fill it might be worth a look.			"

												A very fun blend of action and RPG.Pros:- Great combat system. Involves reflexes, timing and combining your skills.- Nice character development with 3 directions you can mix freely: strength, wizardry and dexterity.- Various abilities you can invest in that make you better in different things.- You can change your skill choice in game.- Huge world to explore.Cons:- In battle, it takes too long after delivering or getting a hit, until your next action. It can be annoying sometimes.- Abilities are not balanced and you will definitely be weaker if you invest in the wrong ones. Fortunately you can always change your ability point allocation in game.- Races are pointless because they differ in their initial ability scores, so there is a clearly best race.- Plot is boring.

												Rating: 7/10Overview: Third Person Action RPGThe Good:+ Character development is really the highlight of the game. By investing skill points across three different skill trees; might, finesse and magic you can develop a play style to your liking. Depending on where you spend your skill points you can unlock passive bonuses in the form of fate cards. The good thing about this is that you can spend skill points across all three skill trees and unlock some really cool bonus perks or you can focus all your skills on a single tree and unlock another set of perks. Its a really good system because it allows for so much flexibility. While most action rpgs require you to focus on a few skills, amalur allows the option for spreading your skill points over multiple skill trees without it hurting you.   + Combat is fun and fluid and fit the skill trees perfectly. The combat is very accessible and easy to learn right from the start. The only downside is that you can only assign skills to 4 slots on the controller making it very hard to make a build with more than 4 skills. + Tons of weapons and armor that make you look incredibly cool. Every type of weapon set has their own unique move set.  + The environments are bright and colorful. Most areas feel distinct from one another. + For a game this size and this much content it is incredibly well polished, very few glitches or bugs to be found.+ Although the UI is clearly designed around controller support, the UI is surprisingly well done. Accepting any side quests will automatically show every waypoint on your minimap. Finding items in the game world, you can compare, take, equip or place it directly in your junk pile without ever having to open a menu. Little things like this really help the game and provide a much smoother experience.   + SoundtrackThe Average:The game features a ton of content; lots of locations, dungeons to explore, side quests to tackle, characters to meet, cities to travel to etc. It is everything you would expect from a large scale RPG. The problem however is that non of this is really interesting. The dungeons are linear hallways with little to no exploration, all the character are boring and say the same things, all the Sid quests devolve into kill x number of enemies, collect x number of items, gather x number of ingredients etc... The game features so much content but very little depth. Of course this is a matter of opinion, and if you find the main story and side quests to your liking then you are going to love everything this game has to offer.  Exploration feels limited. You can not jump nor can you fall off ledges. Level design seems to be very flat. The Field of view (FOV) is a bit to close to the character making combat a bit weird sometimes. Luckily there is a third party program that can fix this, however you should never have to use a program for an option that should be in the game. Bosses feel under utilized, feels like wasted potential.  The Bad:- This game is not balanced at all, even at the hardest setting you can quickly kill enemies early on. If you craft or socket any high level gear the game becomes even more broken to the point of one shot killing enemies. Completing too many side quest will cause you to over level too early on. If you want any challenge you have to purposefully hinder yourself. The lack of difficulty really hurts the game because it makes an otherwise fun combat system, trivial. - Gold is also meaningless. You will quickly have more gold than you know what to do with, buying items/weapons is useless as you will usually find better gear just by killing or looting treasure chests. Conclusion:When I first heard about Kingdoms of Amalur I thought it would be one of my favorite games. I loved the idea behind the character creation, sadly everything surrounding that concept turned out to be average. I had high hopes for the game that never materialized.			"

Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning has all the trappings of a traditional action RPG along with a few unique claims to fame.  One of those claims is the development agenda and post-production of this game, a very interesting story in itself, but that has little bearing on the game as is, which offers some good Fantasy fun.  It helps to understand KoA:R in the context of Big Huge Games, 38 Studios, Project Copernicus and the game owners bankruptcy and default on a $75 million loan from the state of Rhode Island.  If the experience feels like an mmorpg in single player mode, that's because the game was more or less a template for the planned but never completed Copernicus.  Despite having strong opinions about this whole business, I won't say more since it's been covered well in the news, and at this point it's old news.  The story was crafted in large part by one of my favorite Fantasy novelists, R.A. Salvatore, and the quality shows.  Plentiful lore and background is there to find if you bother listening to dialogue, reading books and paying attention to quests.  In particular I enjoyed the Fae (Elves) Houses.  Their social traditions, internal politics and perceptions of the mortal races reflect the Fae's immortality/reincarnation in interesting ways.  Gameplay is rock solid.  It is slightly reminiscent of Fable.  Options for stealth, hack n'slash, melee, ranged, martial or magic devastation all stem from a clever class/skill mechanic seated in the game's lore about fate.  Essentially there are three archetypes: Warrior, Rogue, Mage - and three types that are hybrids of those.  The combat is engaging however you choose, with various combos and skills to mix it up.  The monsters are diverse and will keep you on your toes, although it is possible to skill and gear up to a point where the player is virtually unkillable, rendering tactics irrelevant and thus diminishing the satisfaction of well executed fights.  That only happens in late game though; plus, you can always increase the difficulty!  I played the entire game on the standard difficulty setting.  Design overall isn't all that innovative save for a few aspects.  It feels a little bit generic and safe as fantasy RPG's go.  One issue I had was that pacing seemed a little off.  I explored side areas and finished every faction questline in addition to many side quests, but still wasn't quite able to unlock the highest tier of the Fate system (classes) until the very end of the campaign.  Also, towards the halfway point and onwards, some side quests felt like derivative, cliche filler content for the level grind.  It felt like an mmo.  This wasn't a huge problem, just an annoyance.  Backpack expansions should be slightly more frequent and the inventory should have more categories for crafting materials in the trade interface.  The technical issues are few.  One rare but recurring problem is that the camera - during and immediately following combat - likes to get fancy and zoom out or chase the player at certain distances.  The camera gets stuck sometimes, or shows a bad angle that hinders combat.  Quest and lore items shouldn't count towards the inventory item limit.  For some odd reason, you can't switch from the journal to the map without first closing the journal.  Like so many RPG's, this one has recycled voice actors even for primary characters.  While the world is huge and varied, certain areas feel strangely boxed in when they shouldn't.    The music and the voice acting are brilliant here.  I was especially pleased with how high quality and well fleshed out the dialogue was.  The visuals are beautifully realized and have some fun fantasy art concepts behind them.  On the other hand, given the budget of this game it doesn't reflect the money spent in my opinion.    I did not play the two content DLC's, Legend of Dead Kel and Teeth of Naros.  I recommend Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning to any fantasy aficionado.  If you check this out, you'll probably be glad you did.  I cannot necessarily recommend it to players with no patience or time for branching out from the main quest to see side content, or for players who are utterly uninterested in seeing more of the same from the fantasy genre.TIP: Use Reckoning as often as your fate bar fills up, since it rewards bonus experience for kills.TIP: The gear obtained via crafting (Blacksmithing plus Sagecrafting) tends to be the most powerful.  Crafting is greatly facilitated by diligent gathering of materials in the world and the salvaging of looted armor & weapons.TIP: Finish all of the faction quest lines at least, since those are among the more interesting content.

												This game is a hidden gem! Got this game during a weekend sale and boy was i amazed! Great gameplay, beautiful visuals, huge number of quests, nice dialogs, it gives you a feeling of progression as you keep discovering new upgrades for your weapons/armors. The world map is absolutely huge (skyrim style), each area has it's own specific mobs. At the moment i'm writing this i have around 35 hours of gameplay and i'm not even in half of the game with over 100quests finished, and around 100 more started.This game is a must play for any RPG fan, and you might find it even better than Skyrim. For sure i do.			"

												After playing it so long, i have finnaly decided to put a review in. Now, first off, this is the first game i have ever felt compelled to write a review for, so that means its something special. Now after looking at the reviews that have 180 or so hours on record, that is pretty impresive, but at the same time its not. On The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, i have about 500 hours on record, so doing the math, that would be playing for about 20 days straight without sleep. The reason why that is is the fact that you want to try out all of the different classes and combinations, and this game is very similar. The whole game is centered on fate, and that you are not effected by it (you will see why within 20 minutes of the game). Just like skyrim, you basicly choose your race, then get dropped off in a huge world and your class forges as you play. There are three ability categories: Might, Sorcery, and Finesse. wWhen you level up, you get three points to put into whatever you want. You also have destinies. When you get a certian amount of points in a single ability, or in two abiilities if you are doing a combo, you can select a destiny which will grant you addtional bonuses. You can combine destinies, (Finesse, Finesse/Sorcery, Sorcery/Might, All Three, etc...) into what every you want, and there are 6 levels of destinies for every one. There is a very helpful element to the game, and that is unbinding fate. It basicly (for a cost) resets and refunds all skill points, ability points, and destinies. This lets you make yourself the best mage in the universe to the best warrior in the universe in about 2 minutes. Unfortunatly, at the point in the game when you do this, you will have probably gotten far and there is not as much point (since you done have as much time left to play with it). You can reset your fate within 10 minutes of the game, although i went pure stealthy thief and have not unbound my fate once. I recently beat the game, at 35 hours, and am trying to unlock the last finesse destiny (you will understand when you play the game), and plan to continue with that character until i do. Speaking of the thief class, the game is hard on you closer to the end with it. You are UNSTOPABLE against a single enemy, even the final boss, the semi-final boss, and every other boss like thing was absolutely no trouble, but anytime there is more then one enemy, it gets pretty hard. Alot of the finesse (rouge/thief) class requires you to charge up your attck by holding the button down for a extra second or two, but with more then one enemy, they attck before you can do that. I have yet to play anything else, so i do not know if it is the same for the other classes or not. If you are playing just the story, you could probably beat the game within about 7 hours, but it would be incredibly hard since you would not get to a very high level. Just like other free-roam games like skyrim and far cry 3, you will be lost in the side quests before you know it. I recently showed it two one of my school friends (im in 9th grade), and after about a week of pushing, convinced her to buy it. She is only like level 5, but she said it is amazing. She described it is a skyrim like game, looking like World of Warcraft (in some ways, but i dissagree. The pictures you see above are a little better). Ultimantly, it is an amazing game definetly worth twenty dollars (i would buy it for $60), that you need to play. Even if you just play the demo to see some of the stuff i am talking about, you will probably want to buy it. It has amazing faction quests, some very fun side quests, and probably one of my favorite (if not thee favorite) story questlines. If you are still reading this, that means that this review was interesting enough, which means the game if better. There is alot of the stuff that i left out, that you just need to play to understand. I will defenetly be playing a new game of this again, and possibly even make a walkthrough, just because i love it so much. To close, i am going to say that this is my favorite game i have every played (and i have 167 games on steam, and about 40 more on the xbox) and i really hope that this review convinced you to purchase it. It is a shame that 38 Studios closed down, but i loved the game enough to really dig deep in the internet to see if there is a sequel, and there is a possibility, and buying and promotion the game will definetly increase that chance. I ask that you please buy this, and then write your own review and tell your friends. I have just spent about 1 hour and 45 minutes writing this, and it has not gone to waste. Please, buy this game and tell your friends, your will be glad you did.			"

												Summary:  I highly recommend Amalur for anyone looking to scratch that high fantasy RPG itch until the next great title comes along.  For the full purchase price of $20, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a solid purchase.  For $6 when the game goes on sale like it is now, it's a ridiculous bargain.  Background (or why my hours played is so low but the review remains relevant :P ):  I originally bought this game a month ago through Origin (don't hate, back then it was seven dollars there vs twenty here) where I clocked in over 90 hours of game time and finished the game.  Well, currently Steam has the Amalur Collection on sale for $12 that includes the core game, both DLCs and a weapon/armor bundle.  Back on Origin the DLCs cost $10 a piece so I just went ahead and bought the entire collection here.  So on to the review!Pros:  (1)  This game is massive.  And I mean MASSIVE.  I stopped doing side quests about 1/3 - 1/2 way through the game because I wanted to see how the main quest line would end, and it still took me 90 hours to finish the game.  So if you're a completionist and you decide to explore the entire map and do every single quest my guess is the game offers around 200 hours of game time.  For six dollars that's... kind of crazy.  And yes, you can continue adventuring and discover/finish side quests after completing the main story line.  :)(2)  Combat is fun and fast paced, with fluid animations, nice particle effects, and charge ups/combos galore.  There are three schools of combat skills available (basically mage, warrior, thief), but you can explore any and all of them without restriction and for a price you can respec your character any time you want through a number of vendors in the game. (3)  The voice acting is solid.  One of the worst sins a RPG can commit to kill immersion is to populate their world with terrible voice actors.  Luckily they avoid that problem here.  You might still meet the random side quest character who could have put in a little more emotion here or a bit less ham there, but all the main characters do a fine job carrying out their roles as do most of the secondary cast.(4)  The game world is well developed.  A good RPG needs an immersive game world to lose oneself in, and Amalur does a good job on this front.  First, the world lore is well fleshed out with books and lorestones (think audio books) scattered throughout the world providing history, context and even humour.  Second, the game world looks nice, especially for a two year old title.  The stylistic approach they took is very high fantasy, with colorful and vibrant settings, so if you're looking for an overall darker/perpetual winter type environment you might be disappointed.  (5)  The game is stable and bug free.  In 90 hours of game play, I've only come across one bug.  Unfortunately that bug did force me to load up a previous save game to proceed in that side quest, but 1 bug in 90 hours of game play is pretty darn good.  For those who buy this game and are curious, the bug takes place right before your conversation with Sir Sagrell on the House of Ballads quest line, so just save before then and you should be golden.(6)  You get to support the state of Rhode Island!  After Steam takes its cut, proceeds from Steam sales of Amalur goes to RI, not EA.  Well, okay, if you hate the state of RI I guess this would be a con.  I've never visited RI, but as the tiniest state in the US I have a soft spot for them.  Guess it's just me rooting for the little guy.  :DCons:(1)  No more support.  The company that developed Amalur is bankrupt, and its assets scattered to the four winds (or RI in this case which was the company's largest creditor).  So there aren't going to be any sequels, or patches, for this game.  Ever.  (2)  The camera is too zoomed in and you can't manually zoom out.  This REALLY bugged me when I first started playing this game.  The camera automatically zooms out in combat to fit all the people on the screen as well as during special attack animations, so the game is fully capable of zooming in and out.  They just decided to be lazy and not implement a manul zoom function for the PC.  -.-  After a few hours, I got used to it but chances are it's going to bug you too if you're a regular PC player (apparently this is a console port issue?).  I've read you can fix this by using Widescreen Fixer, but I haven't tried this so YMMV. (3)  The story is just adequate when it could have been so much more.  At its core, the main story itself is derivative of many other fantasy tales.  Their focus on the interplay of Desinty vs Free Will offers it a refreshing change of pace, but the game never takes that extra push to make its stories truly emotionally gripping.  For example, one of the more interesting and sympathetic characters I ran across was an antagonist who has been condemned to play the part of a villain in a never-ending, repeating fairy tale for all eternity.  So yes, she's a villain, but she's a villain who is doing these things to break the cycle where she is condemned to play the villain forever, and forever.  And while the game lets you choose her side in the end, the resolution just never reaches any kind of deeper emotional crescendo or pathos like they could have if they dug just a little deeper.(4)  The depth of your relationship with other characters are just adequate.  This, similar to the story, is an issue of wasted potential.  Like the story, the personality of the people you meet and their relationship to your character is portrayed in a perfectly adequate matter, but it never progresses beyond that.  We learn that our character had a past relationship with some of these people, but the relationships never really evolve in the here and now.  Sure some of them greet you differently after you've helped them, praise you, even call you their lord, but a true emotional connection or investment just isn't there.  Contrast this to titles like Dragon Age or Mass Effect where it was your relationships that basically made the game so great and.. well... so... much... potential... :((5)  Some of the dungeon layouts are not very optimized for fun.  Barring its many flaws on release, one of the things Skyrim did very well was their intelligent dungeon map layouts.  Every dungeon was set out so that it would either loop in itself or end at another exit so you didn't have to track through an already cleared dungeon to leave.  Amalur does this for its main dungeons and most of the side quest ones, but they neglect to do this for a noticeable number as well which, well, is just dumb.  This might not seem like a big deal, but when you're talking about a 200 hour game with countless dungeons, it gets very annoying having to backtrack through an empty dungeon just to exit.  Conclusion:  All in all, this is a solid RPG romp through a well developed and entertaining land of magic and adventure.  And at six dollars, or even twenty, I would give it a solid recommendation.  So get out there, craft your own Destiny, and happy questing!  :)			"

Fun gameplay although it could be quite quircky at times. The best part of this game is content for the price. So much to do! Over 244 quests I think and so many other things to distract you on your epic journey. While the story telling isn't grand its the world that you are released into that is....vibrant colors and beautiful landscapes are around every corner. If your a fan or fantasy and need something to distract you. You certainily cant do much better than this gem. 7/10			"

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is fantastic. It's one of the best action RPGs to date and still better than most newer games coming out today. It's an incredibly large, open world with a rich storyline and fast, fun gameplay.Pros+ Fast paced action+ Great animations and special effects+ Hundreds of quests to do+ Huge, intricate areas+ Beautiful graphics+ Interesting Ability and Destiny system+ Can make whatever kind of fighter you want with many different skills and traits. You can respec easily, too.+ Wide variety of weapons, armor, and their respective customizations+ Crafting is simple and efficient+ Very smooth gameplayCons- Bad lip syncronizations and weird facial expressions- Shifting polygons on distant terrain as you approach- Camera is too close and that's bad during combat. It also has a mind of it's own at times.- ""Stale air"" in the towns. They don't feel like towns to me. It's wierd.- Can only map 4 spells on the controller- MANY different terms, people, and locations mentioned throughout the game but no in-game glossary for referencing- I personally don't like the map-  Very annoying sound controls. Sound Effect volume affects dialogue, instead of Dialogue Volume doing it. Poor sound equalization.8.5/10			"

												Fantastic open world single player game with mmo characteristic elements. The combat grips comprehensive flexibility you'll able to learn easily where the npc dialogue is vast ultimately with choices, also come with pending consequences. Not a complete sandbox world like Elder Scrolls or has deep imparative choices as Mass Effect-it makes up for it between the two. I highly recommend the collection edition too ;3			"

												Kingdoms is one of those hidden gem games. With gameplay and a questing system similar to World of Warcraft, an incredibly rich and detailed lore and an absolutely massive world to explore, Kingdoms should have enough in it to keep you occupied for hours. Unfortunately, the company behind the game has since collapsed, so don't expect any support or future DLCs.Still, overall an 8/10.			"

												Not bad at all.  I was actually pleasantly surprised by this game.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but what I got was a well-fleshed out single player RPG with a very Blizzard-esque art style.  The combat is active and lively, the progression is deep, and exploration is rich.  Story is a weak point, but otherwise it's hard to find fault in this one.  I'd give it a go if you're in the market to sink a fair amount of time into an active combat RPG.			"

												I'm fairly deep into the game so far.  It's very addicting.  There are some cons in terms of some of the graphics, but these honestly don't detract from the game at all.  It's very immersing and it's easy to play for hours without realizing it.  Unlike most RPGs with multiple races (Skyrim and the like, for example), whatever race you select at the beginning doesn't impact your development in the long run; they're all at an even playing field to start out.  None have any real strengths or obvious weaknesses; you can select whichever one of the four you want and not have to worry if they're going to be weaker in melee style or stealth style or whatever your preferred style is.  Using kb&m works just fine, so I have no comments as to whether a controller is any better or worse.  One other possible downside is that you need to keep a close eye on your weaponry and armor.  Depending on what you're fighting or how much fighting you're doing, your weapons (and armor to a lesser degree) will get damaged pretty quickly.  The system warns you when your weapon is close to breaking (permanently), so you'll have to use a repair kit or switch it out before it shatters.  Armor (including your shield, robes, etc) holds up pretty well.  There are a variety of destinites to choose from and you don't have to stay with one in particular; I actually recommend that you change around as more get unlocked as you level-up.  The game allows for a variety of styles without difficulty; you're not stuck with what you have and so you don't have to start over to change something.  You can see a Fateweaver to change your fate, but I've yet to see the necessity in doing that.I will say this about the difficulty levels of the game: hard/difficult mode is the way to go.  I'll admit to having some trouble with the normal mode in most other RPGs, but even KOA's difficult mode isn't overly challenging.  I rarely fateshift unless I'm coming up against a foe I just can't figure out how to beat, or if I don't have enough health potions.  Levelling up is pretty easy compared to other games.  It's a very entertaining game and it being a little easier in terms of foes allows for better exploration, in my opinion.  I have been doing the side quests and faction quests as I go rather than coming back to them, but it doesn't seem to matter how you do it.  That being said, I'm sure I'm progressing slower than others might, and I've got a ways to go before actually completing the game (I've put the main quests on hold for the moment to do some exploring in areas I've not been to).

												One of the best RPG design I have seen. The best is the combat with the evolution of the character, very impressive and with good control. Very very big but easy to learn. I also like the history and the setting. Very good graphics and better if you use SweetFX and Nvidia inspector.Just one thing, is too easy so PLEASE use the Ysa mod, search in the forums, it makes the game HARD. Read about the mod, is very customizable, if you don't want a overhelming difficulty, to me the most important thing are:  - Reduced EXP - Reduced Fate Points - Reduced Gold; They don't add a real difficulty, just the thing is to not overlevel everything, not use everytime the fate easy mode and make gold have an actual value.Is the thing most close I have found to Dark Souls, and you know, Dark Souls is one of the best game I have played.

												Kingdoms of Amalur is an amazing open world RPG with a wonderful story.  There are dozens of side quests across the game which propel you out into the world and encourage you to explore its extremely rich lore.  The game itself has a huge draw with its very personal customization of your characters skills through the ability to pull from more than one skill type.  On top of that the smithing, alchemy, and sagecrafting allow you to make armor, weapons, potions and gems to enhance your playstyle.  All in all this game is a must play for anyone interested in story driven RPG with countless hours of play time, and huge amounts of replay ability.			"

I mean i really wanted to put this as a pro, and I REALLY TRYED to listen to all the conversations and not skip them. But I mean come on, at maybe 25% game completion I was falling asleep during the conversations. Then when you get to a new town and you see all the NPCs with about 8 dialogues a piece my reaction was like OH $*** here we go again...All in all a great game would recommend and for the price of $5 or less you can't beat it.10/10 ...

												Have you ever played an MMORPG and felt, ""oh gosh, I wish there was no once else but me and the NPC's around here""? Then this game is right up your alley.  This game is right down to the core an offline MMORPG. You get tons of trash armor, there's something that reminds of dungeons, kill and fetch quests everywhere and as much action in the gameplay as you would expect of an MMORPG. While the overworld have some pretty places to look at, you rarely get much of a chance to do so since you spend most of your time inside somewhere.Positive:+ Combat is responsive when dodging and there's nice hit detection when hitting an enemy+ The armor is the game looks good+ Overworld is pretty and there's a lot to look at+ If you dig deep there's can be some fun character buildsNegative:- Using shields in combat is absolutely unresponive and awful- The amount of trash equipment you get makes it a chore to find anything. You spend more time going through trash than you do comparing which weapon to use- Questing is VERY overwhelming in this game. You get quest, on quest, on quest, on quest.- Questing is completely uninspired. If you've ever played an MMORPG you probably have experience with the kinds of quest you get in this game.- They don't put much effort into getting you interested in the story, which is needed in this game since you get so many story side-quests. Sometimes you end up doing a quest and out nowhere find out it was apparently a huge part to the main story, but unless you're really reading and listening to every single NPC on the way you won't get anything from it.- I played over 10 hours and not a single hint of a mount of any kind. Wouldn't even be a little surprised if at least 5 hours of my gameplay time has been just running from dungeon to dungeon and city to city just to get filled with quests. Some cities only exists to give you quests.- Overworld, while pretty, feels very empty. You get the feeling of playing a dead MMORPG everywhere and it just stops the world from feeling alive at all.With all of this said, you might find some enjoyment if you really enjoy making original character builds and mess around with that. But if you're anything like me and just enjoy some classic warrior action this game is going to bore you to tears and you're better off with Guild Wars 2, which actually is an MMORPG with an alive world and have fluid combat as well.Only buy this game if you're starving for some wRPG action.

												It's a pretty standard Fantasy Action Game experience - you pick from a couple of Totally Unique Racial Categories, make some basic cosmetic changes (hair, skin tone, etc.) and then you go smash the crap out of things.Character progression is somewhat reminiscent of Torchlight with a bit of The Witcher for good measure.  You can ""multiclass"" between Tough Smashy Style, Sneaky Stabby Style, and Explody Magic Style.The lore is more-or-less your standard fantasy novel business - there's good (not-)elves and bad (not-)elves and the bad (not-)elves are going HAM on your homeland.  Good thing you're a Chosen One and can stand up to those naughty naughty (not-)elves!  Did we mention that you have a Mysterious Past that you have to uncover?  Of course you do.It's going to be tainted by comparison to Skyrim, as they're both Epic Fantasy Smashy Smash games.  Skyrim excels in having a truly open world (much of KOA is pretty much linear - the old invisible fence is full in effect here) and near-limitless modification capacity.  KOA excels at having a much more enjoyable combat system - lots of fancy combos and trick moves.  There's a ""rage meter"" mechanic that's kind of neat in a silly ""Mortal Kombat"" way - you charge up your murders and then you go into Super Murder Mode, where you get, of all things, a quicktime event where you have to mash buttons to Extra Super Duper Murder someone for bonus XP.It's silly, even for Epic Fantasy Gaming, but it's probably worth snagging on sale.

												Impression after an hour:  Wow, why hadn't I heard about this?  It kidna has a stupid name.  At least, it's not catchy.  Apparently it didnt' sell well enough and the companies involved went under.  Controller friendly, interesting art style, polished, good lore, kinda action combat that seems fun so far.  I got it on sale.  Looking forward to finishing it.FIVE HOURS: I still like it.  I'll see how much staying power it has, still like the art style and the combat.  Aside from the stupid name, I'm thinking what killed the company is it's not an exceptional game.  It's standard high fantasty, but it's not gritty or enthalling in a way like the Witcher or Dragon Age is.  The writing is a big part of those, this does feel more like FedEx quests.  But I paid about a tenth fo this of what I paid for Dragon Age.  So far I still think I got my money's worth, and it doesn't have the addictive quality of some othe rgames it's still fun so far.

												Great little gem I had never heard anything about. Bought it on a whim and it was worth every dollar. Nothing revolutionary but I love how you can fine tune the combat to your style considering I love being a Jack-of-all-Trades player and often times a player is penalized for it. The world is large enough that it was occasionally a bother to get from one place to another but for me it adds to the immersion, but not too large that you'll waste all your time wandering it or having to fast travel from one place to the other exclusively. The writing, quests and options available to you are all well done with relatively few bugs. Only bug I found was a quest where you had to get an item from a character and rather than kill him I stole it, game didn't like that so I killed him, then it didn't count the item in my inventory but I couldn't grab something he didn't have at that point. Slightly annoying but if that's the only issue I had I'll give it two big thumbs up.			"

												While many seem to think Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning as a poor game (Just google its name and prepare for the hate!) it has a great storyline with a lot of action, quite a few twists and a truly unique setting.In the world of Amalur, all living thing has a destiny, a fate. And all follow it, even if they don't know they do. Fateweavers, people who study fate for years, can see its threads and as such can tell someone else's, or their own, fate. Wether anouncing to a prisoner his imminent and unexpected release or telling a young man he will die in his prime due to an accident, what a fateweaver sees always holds true. For no one is above fate itself. No one but you. Yep, you read that right! The player character in Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a recently diseased person brought back to life through certain experiments and their recent return to the land of the living makes them fateless. Supposed to be dead, fate holds nothing more for you. Soon, and without knowing this, you are sent to see a fateweaver. Not remembering your past life, you hope he can bring you answers. What a shock when you get there to discover that not only does fate not affect you, but YOU in fact affect fate itself! Your actions, as they are fateless, are purely up to you, and nobody can predict them. Because of this, you can change anything: Kill someone and the fate of their whole family, or even of the whole land, might change. Save someone else and a family supposed to disapear might survive and go on to do great things. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is truly a great game which I found myself getting lost in for hours on end, trying different types of characters and gameplay, having fun simply wandering around. And if you think combat is a little boring, try to sneak-kill everything you can, I can promise that up the difficulty! And I haven't even talked about the DLCs, which brings even more fun to this party!All in all, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a great game, filled to the brim with fun and free roaming, loads of side quests which are all interesting, and characters whom have their own lives, relations and problems. Definetly worth every penny... Now what are you waiting for? Play the game and write your own fate!			"

It's challenging without being artifically difficult, and the DLC adds a lot of content.  Pretty standard plot, you're a special guy/gal that needs to save the world from ancient evil.

												So, my first taste of this game was back on the Xbox 360 as a demo. At the time, I believed it to be what Fable should have been. I continue this sentiment. This game is atrociously underrated, and it's a tragedy that it will never receive a sequel (the company that made it went bankrupt shortly after its release). It isn't a perfect game. Like most RPGs, it has some less-than-inspired quests. Moreover, the combat system can be a bit repetitive, and the character models are recycled to no end. However, it is filled with some surprisingly deep lore, and I had a grand time playing it over the summer. It is also surprisingly long for an original IP.

												Had to get used to the camera angle and interface at first, but now that's no longer in the way I'm loving this game more and more. Good:- Great main story - lots of interesting side quests- good voice acting on every npc you meet- lots of crafting options. armor, weapons, potions, gems. - plenty of loot, lots of different weapon types- great combat system for melee, very interactive with lots of combo moves- lots of skills and abilities. the skills remind me of Dragon Age with the persuasion, lockpicking, herblore and such. the abilities are much like vanilla wow's 3 tabs skill trees. great replayablity - huge world to exploreBad:- sometimes enemies cheat when you try to dodge and hit you anyway- character creation/customization options are a bit limited- ranged combat felt a bit weak/wrong to me. Not so much damage, I didn't focus on ranged to know how well the damage scales, but the auto targeting, the sound, the bow drawing, it just didn't feel right.- no camera zoom afaik, I wish I was able to zoom out more.I'm glad I finally picked up this game. I highly recommend trying it out if you are into action rpg's or rpg's in general really.			"

												A tiny bit of it is unpolished but if you can see past that, you will find an amazingly fun and addictive game. It's like god of war mixed with a really fun RPG that allows you to pick your upgrades from 3 trees (Stealth, Fighter, Mage) and allows you to mix the trees up, the only limit is the number of points you have to spend and the level requirement for that tier, as well as the occassional pre-requisite to have an upgrade from an earlier tier to be in your repitoire before you can unlock a later tier upgrade in that tree. There is a main storyline, but the side quests are a blast and are littered throughout each map. You'll want to hit up the DLC content around level 9 or 10 due to the gear that drops being for level 1 through 18. The enemies are gorgeous to look at while you come up with awesome new combos or ways to kill them, and the view of your surroundings is beautiful in most levels. One of the most beautiful places to visit are the caverns with the all the glowing effects and magical sprites floating about, really nice to look at.  Don't forget to check out the arena in the desert and battle your way to new gear and other rewards. So many things to do and see in this game, it will keep you enthralled for a good 50 hours at least. Add in a couple of playthroughs to explore each area fully and see the different reactions to another race choice and you have well over 100 hours of hard core RPG/action to fall in love with. Each enemy is crafted with such tiny details, my favorite is the one with the wood mask facade for a face that opens up to reveal some really sharp and evil looking teeth and glowing eyes atop a gaping mouth. So many details in the architecture make each area you visit a wonder to behold as you walk around just soaking in the view that the extremely talented artists rendered. I really wish there were more games like this. Just like with the Elder Scrolls and Fallout worlds, i could spend months in here and never feel bored.			"

												Linear RPG with a great fighting mechanic, many dialogues and tons of quests. It's fantastic ripping the enemies apart with twohand-greatswords, assassin blades or hammers. Especially the chakhrams do just ROCK! You can feel the impact of the weapons. The character advancement  with skill points and ablities is great, too. Loots of loot, lots of quests, lots of fights.

												This is an amazing game. The combat is satisfying and fantastic, the story is interesting, and the universe is intriguing once you get into it. The downsides to the game include less good character models, and the graphics aren't Skyrim level. I would, however, put this game above Skyrim in the categories of combat and stability. The game world is huge, but the game itself runs extremely smoothly and I have yet to run into a glitch.My friends who enjoy a good RPG gaming experience, this should be on your list.			"

												Six hours into the game and I really like it so far. Playing it feels like having an adventure in the Warcraft universe with Fable gameplay. The world and the range of quests is big enough to get your money's worth - you just have to overlook the MMO-like style of the majority of missions (go there, get that, fight this, come back) and the tubular area design. I really enjoy the graphic style - as I said, it really reminds me of the Warcraft franchise. The game's environmental design is full of variety (unfortunately, the enemies are not) and really nice to look at. You just have to look up to see the game's beauty, because the standard camera angle is somewhat pointed downwards for some reason. I can't say too much about the story yet, but even though it is that classic ""chosen one saves kingdom against all odds"" scenario, you realise pretty soon that it is rather well written and in accord with the atmospheric world.The game's difficulty can be adjusted at any time. I started on ""hard"" since a friend told me that it was too easy. I had a fairly challanging run until I got some better gear, which made most fights beside boss-battles pretty redundant. On the other side,I think the difficulty really depends on the zone you are in, so don't let this repel you too much.I play it with a controller and it works fine. The camera is a little tardy but that is all I can complain about right now.All in all, you notice really soon that, even though this is a whole new franchise, experienced minds were working on this title.It is a worthwhile, light fantasy experience (having the three classic classes to choose from, or just fusion two/three of them) with a really nice graphical style (in my opinion at least). Recommended for fans of the Fable series or people that are looking for a game of this kind in a Warcraft-like setting. Worth the price if you put some time in to it, and definitely worth the money when on sale. 7.5/10 "

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is an outstanding game, I was never a fan of the elder scrolls series(And I gave em all fair chances), but just couldn't get into them. This game I feel is better in many ways. Good 1) When you die you don't have to start all the way back at the last town you were at or where you last saved.2) You don't have to save before going into a dungeon or going off to explore.3) The grapics are outstanding along with the music.4) Also you don't have to take 1 whole hour to adjust your toon.The list can go on! Bad 1) The camera can get a bit glitchy and can sometimes be covered up by stuff like grass and plants.2) The sound can get glitchy / cutoff depending on region. There's a solution in the guides.3) Enemies can get repetitive Overall Outstanding music and graphics but can be glitchy, no need for many save files, Enemies can get repetivite. 4/5			"

												This is an amazing little gem, it has all of the characteristics of an early Skyrim but it is simple enough to play, I would recommend this game because of the playability which is second to none.  Its really easy to pick up and you can play to how you prefer to play it in terms of fighting style, there are 3 base classes to choose from, which in turn, each have a complex tree of varying combinations of classes.  The world you play in is a very vibrant one, full of colour and texture.  There is alchemy, blacksmithing, you can upgrade certain weapons and armor and best of all, for all lovers of RPG's, there's plenty of loot.  Money is scarce at first but after a dozens missions or so under your belt and you will see how quickly your money can build up.  You can level up your character, choose as you will because you can always change completely at anytime by visiting Fateweavers who will, for price, reset your levels so that you can rebuild to a different style.

												I will openly admit that I had absolutely no intention originally of ever picking this game up... until it went on sale majorly discounted (Thank you, Steam!) and a friend told me to just give it a shot. I have to say, I rather enjoy it very much and I am kicking myself for not giving it a shot before. The artstyle for this is what hit me first. It has such a bright and colorful atmosphere while still being able to be dark when it needs to be. I find myself looking around each and every new area I visit rather thuroughly and not being disappointed in the least. The designs of the characters, items and equipment are also very unique and the fact that Todd McFarlane had his hands in it really shows.It has a story that really draws you in and it has such an ambiguous morality meter that you really feel your impacts on the world. the gameplay is just as fun and addictive as well adding a unique combo and weapon swap ability that just works and the magic use itself is spectacular. It is not without it's faults though as I found the quests themselves rather repetative. Other than that, it is definitely worth the full price that it is. :) 8.5/10			"

												So far, I've only played about 2-3hrs~ worth, but I can guarantee that this is an amazing game. It is a more robust 'Fable-esque' RPG with MMO canon combined with it. From gathering materials to dungeon crawling combat, Studio 38 was able to combine all the innovative features, mechanics and aspects of most Fantasy-franchises while still holding true to an original concept.I must say I had no expectations of this game nor did I hear anything about it when it was released, but I look forward to playing it some more. I also didn't get the DLC, but I'm sure that it's just as good as the base-game. Plus, I managed to make a character look like Jennifer Lawrence, 10/10.			"

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning delivers exactly what it promises: a pitch-perfect fantasy RPG, with visceral, intuitive gameplay that is easy to pick up, difficult to master, wildly flexible and just plain fun, in a way that has yet to be seen in the genre. The world is accessible and vast, offering genre fans plenty to sink their teeth into. One gets the sense that they are watching an entire world unfold before them, one rich with history and lore and life. Amalur opens itself up to the player in a way that is both familiar and refreshing, then empowers the player to do incredible things. 38 Studios and Big Huge Games have created a world worth saving, and they have given us some pretty damn cool tools with which to get the job done.

												This game is really good. The graphics have that sort of fantasy vibe to it, although it's not really at a good resolution. I'm not sure how you change the resolution either. There doesn't seem to be any graphics options that let you change it. That's very bad. Very very bad. My monitor is a 1680x1050 and it looks a bit washed out with this resolution. I can still play it, but I just wish I could change some of the graphics options.Edit: Upon further inspection, the only time you can change the graphics options are in the main menu. The gameplay is pure hack-and-slash fun. Think of games like Darksiders. That is kind of this game (minus the epic areial combos). This game is also a loot-fest. You get new equipment very frequently (if you take the time to explore). All the weapons are really fun to use and have different strengths and weaknesses to them, like the daggers being the fast and low-damage type, hammers which are the slow but hard-hitting type, typical etc. etc.. You also can do numerous special moves that you unlock with each weapon type. You also have this fate weaving ability (forgot what it was called) where you press and hold the triggers (or the keyboard equivalent) to slow down time and kill your enemies faster and impale them to death with large energy spears...Hmm. Yes. Overall, very fun and engaging combat.The story is alright, it's not cliche, but it's nothing to write home about. You are basically the vitcim of a war, and you have died. Yes, you heard me right. You died. But don't fret, something called the well of life resurrected you. I don't really know anything else because I most likely have forgotten. The voice acting is also quite good. Not Skyrim levels, but still it's not gut wrenchingly bad.The only thing that I would have had improved is the user interface. The inventory system feels very cluttered and since your items are featured on one page in a sort of list structure, albiet seperated in categories, it's hard to navigate. I wish they would've shown all of your items on the single screen instead of having to scroll down to see which new items you have acquired, or want to equip, etc. Also the camera kind of sucks, it's very close sometimes, and then sometimes it's further away.Overall, I like this game and would reccommend anyone who likes games like Skyrim or Darksiders to pick this up. Though not at full price.			"

												Much to my surprise, I'm rather enjoying this game so far (I'm about 2 hours in). First off, I have to point out that this game is heavly focused on combat and less so on story and epic adventures which is why I was surprised as I tend to lean more towards those games.The combat in this game is very good, in fact its among the best I've come across in an action RPG. This games biggest pro's are the entertaining combat sequences, the rather large selection of spells and abilities and the selection of weapons / armour.

You can switch up your character at will when you find better loot - and better loot you will find - in a ton of different ways, with all kinds of different hybrid playstyles being viable and fun alternatives to ther norm.The takedowns in Reckoning mode are flashy, the executions from stealth are super satisfying...

												A good game with tons of content.  If you're a completionist like me, you'll put 100 hours into this easily.  The art style is kind of WoW-ey but that has allowed it to age well.  It's challenging without being artifically difficult, and the DLC adds a lot of content.  Pretty standard plot, you're a special guy/gal that needs to save the world from ancient evil.  But if you like exploring a (mostly) non-linear world and killing baddies for loot, it's a good game and certainly worth the time.			"

												I am still trying to figure out why I hadn't heard of this game. Upon further study, I realize it's because I was too busy with Skyrim... However, this game is on-par with skyrim when it comes to playability and fun and I'm sad I missed it. I would have payed full price for it. Ended up getting it during the 2014 winter sale.The visual style and combat is nothing like skyrim. In my opinion, the combat in skyrim is more fun only because you can make it as challenging as you want. People say this game is easy, and they're not lying. If you're looking for a harder experience start out pure mage. If the combat was harder, it would far surpass skyrims system. The flow of it is very fun and worth it even despite it's easiness, which should say alot about it. The quests are fun and rewarding, and the loot/equipment system is more akin to Diablo than Elder Scrolls. Some people will like that, and some people won't. I love it. The alchemy and blacksmithing system is awesome, and it gives you a reason to go around collecting raegents and tools. In fact, I can't think of an RPG Alchemy system that did it more right. I'd say they even have the Witcher beat when it comes to that. All in all, highly recommended if you're a fan of RPGs. I didn't want to spend too much time comparing this game to skyrim and failed heavily, but Elder Scrolls are one of my favorite game series on the planet and this game is right up there. Looking forward to more playtime!			"

A cohesive narrative and vibrant visuals bring the world of Amalur to life.As I glance through some other user reviews I see a lot of positive comparisons to some of the leaders of the RPG genre: Skyrim, Guild Wars 2, Fable, Diablo and Torchlight. Personally I saw the closest resemblance to World of Warcraft with its visuals and questing system. However, this is no clone of a game. It has a unique identity that, in part, is made from borrowing successful traits from these other titles. What stands out most strongly to me about Kingdoms of Amalur is its narrative and world lore. It presents fresh ideas and throughout my 95+ hours (including 210 quests completed) with the game it always felt consistent, like the developers shared a unified vision of what they wanted this world to be.Without discussing any specific plot points, I'll say that things begin on a high note and intrigued me right off the bat with a mystery surrounding who this character you are playing as is. It is a special feat in my mind to be able to have a personalized, voiceless protagonist that you are expected to project yourself into also have a predetermined, very interesting back story of their own. Too often these types of characters are just a boring blank slate. My sense of progression through this world was wonderful. Your journey begins far from a major warzone and consequently you merely hear stories about it. As you advance closer you begin to see more immediate effects like sons and daughters gone off to fight or altered local economies. Eventually you'll see large refugee camps causing overcrowding problems and burned down towns before reaching the warfront itself. By and large, the settings you visit along the way stand apart from each other both visually and in local story. The exceptions to this are some of the dungeons that look and play very similarly, just with different layouts and quest objectives to fulfill. For a game already so big I think it would have benefited from cutting some of them out.All dialogue is voice acted and of good quality. There is some noticeable reuse of voice actors among NPCs, but that is excusable for a game of this size. I would rather see good voice actors reused than bad voice actors brought in in greater numbers.Combat, unfortunately, is just adequate. There isn't enough depth here to stay compelling throughout. There is a nice mix of weapon types that all control very differently, but you're likely to pick one or two early on and stick with them. Magic brings some cool spells to the fray but are very limited in number. Leveling up is a good, customizable system that does gradually add new abilities, but not enough to keep things from going stale. To be clear, I never got to a point of hating battles. However, a combination of things getting too easy by the end, the long length of the game and repetition of enemy types eventually sucked a lot of the enjoyment out of it. I will warn you that it is possible to become over leveled if you do all side quests as you find them. Google ""Amalur Wiki overlevel"" to find a guide for avoiding this.I'll wrap things up with a few more minor critiques. Loot is dealt out in such volume that inventory management becomes a chore (similar to many Diabloesque games). Despite this abundance of gear it was surprisingly infrequent how often I found something better than what I was wearing. Also, before long I had more money than things to do with it. I play most games on Normal difficulty, including this one, but didn't find enough challenge here so I suggest playing on Hard to most players. The orchestral score was competently produced but lacked the artistry to make it memorable.Overall, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a fantastic, expansive experience that could have benefited from seeing its great length reined in a little bit.

												If you think this game like Skyrim. You come to the wrong place.Why everyone tell this game like skyrim? Just because Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion lead designer Ken Rolston is a developer of this game. After that? Nothing similar to skyrim.If you come here to play game that similar to skyrim. Don't buy this game. You can buy another games that similar to Skyrim.Open World in this game is suck. Not a sandbox game like skyrim.Quest is suck too. It's like MMORPG but offline.But, i recommend this game because the Combat. Well.. The combat in this game is fun.Well.. This is my opinion. Sorry for bad english(:			"

												Game feels like a MMORPG but single player. The gameplay is nice, never get tired of it. Graphic isn't the best but understandable, however the landscape are something you can really look at and be like wow. But as we all know the feel of a MMORPG game with ""Kill and Collect X items"" quest gets boring over time when it's repetitive. The main storyline is short, but there are tons of side/faction quest that you can do which will add more hours of gameplay.Overall Rating: 8/10Hit: GameplayMiss: Quest (too repetitive)			"

												So I heard this game was a massive flop, and that made me dubious about picking it up, but the sale this weekend was too much to pass on, and I grabbed it. 10 hours or so in now and I honestly can't see why this wasn't game of the year 2012. It's like someone took the combat from Fable, made it actually good and moderately challenging, and then took the idea of massive open environments to explore, chucked some sick Briton mythology in there for giggles and then wrapped it up with some top tier writing and dialogue. The best way I can think of describing it would be if The Elder Scrolls and Fable had a baby, and it was ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, with the sick quests of Oblivion and Morrowind combined with the combat style of Fable, but made way deeper and with enemies that aren't completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Basically if you took all the disappointment from Skyrim and Fable 3, and made the opposite.I mean sure, it ain't Dark Souls if you're looking for something super hard, but many of the fights I've already encountered would wreck you if you did them wrong.

GREAT GAME! It's a sad thing that the company that made this masterpiece was put into bankruptcy because of poor planning. They should have gotten more hype on it because it's such a well-done game despite what you might hear from some people.The combat is 8/10.Why? The camera angles, dear god, but the combat itself is amazing. The movements are smooth, not jerky, and can get really fast paced if you play right.The lore is 10/10.Why? It's so developed, that there's no obvious problems with it. You would have to do some serious research to find contradictions and plot-holes.The UI is 9.9/10.Why? Because you can't zoom the minimap in or out, I'd really love to see that change, but it will never come.Should you buy this game? HELL YEAH!There's about 300 HOURS... H-O-U-R-S... of gameplay and story. You will never get bored as easy as you would get bored with other games in the same genre.If you want to know something cool, this game WAS going to be an MMO, but it shut down before that. If ANY professional video game development teams every find themselves lacking a project, TAKE THIS UP!You can buy the IP from Rhode Island and get to work immediately and possibly create a well-deserved sequel.Don't let me down, this game shouldn't have been left to rot.

												Fantastic game. Not as polished as some other RPG's out there, but I believe this is due to lack of funding. If you enjoy RPG's at all, I highly recommend this one. Tons of content. I pretty much skipped 90% of the side/faction quests and proceeded along the main storyline, took ~40hr to complete. There are supposedly an additional 400 or so side/faction quests in the game. The map is huge as well. Larger than some MMO maps. The storyline is decent. The fighting mechanics are a blast. Protip: do NOT start pure sorcery. It gets boring quick. My advice is to start with might or finesse and then play around with sorcery later on if it strikes your fancy. You can respec on a whim.			"

												A lot of people passed this game up on launch, and it's a shame they did. Because this game is very good. The combat is relatively simple at first, but as you keep playing, you quickly gain new skills. And the ability to mix things up with class mixing easily allows the player to try out new things. While the gameplay becomes much easier as you keep playing, it still manages to maintain a degree of challenge, often forcing the player to mix up their stratagies and spells. Even magic, which is broken in most other games, is just as balanced as an assassin or warrior. Furthermore, the story is wonderful. I won't spoil it, but it's great.

A RPG with surprises!The Story is simple but not linear.You, a soldier, died in a battle against the Tuatha (bad guys). Some gnomes revived you... and you start your journey. Kill the bad guys and find your fate. Of course there are much more details in the story, but I don't want to go into it.++ huge map++ many sidequests which increase your playtime++ nice skill trees and weapon system++ about 30 hours playtime (with some sidequests)+ lovely soundtrack (important for a RPG, in my opinion)+ loads of special moves+ the control is simple and no big problem+ sidequests are build like this: grab question from NPC > kill x things > collect x things > go back to NPC ---> but I have no problem with that!- baddest inventory in history, I don't lie.- for a ""2012-game"" the graphics aren't that good- the camera movement is amazing bad- DLC's are expensive- story is to simple...for me, but good.- no big variety of enemies- it is also on hard way to easy (with little exceptions)- sometimes (really rare) the enemies are just too hard- little amount of bugs (which are not a big problem)- I really, really, really don't know, why this game is USK 18. 16, yes. 18, gtfo.The contra points are only little things, so don't be to much influenced by this.I would wait for a discount to buy this.

												Great combat. I found some mage thrown weapons and now I'm in love with chakrams, they are beautful and are amazing when actually in combat. They have great range and good damage. I'm going to hold onto my shock chakrams even though I love the fae-blades and whirling around like a lunatic in battle. Wee!~Character creation is quite nice. Different races, jewely/ acessories, hair, gender, ect.~Art style feels a bit reminisent of TorchLight and Fable. While the game play feels like a mix of Fable and Skyrim. Lots of freedom of choice for quests and morality. I typically go chaotic-good if I can. ~Main and secondary weapon slots, with ease of access and use, and a nice hide helm option in options.~Different armor types for different classes/ play styles. Heavey, medium, light. Lots of different item types and item looks/ designs. ~I heard about being able to buy a house and upgrade it, much like in Skyrim (sorry, really getting into and playing Skyrim recently).~Story is turning out to be quite interesting. Not too strong of a pull to do main questline though, because of how open and free choice the game is.~Different crafting types (poitions, smithing, shards) and you can learn potions by randomly combining ingredients. You can dismantle non magical gear for crafting mats, but I'm not sure about doing the same with magical gear and I would love to be able to dismantle magical/ higher tier gear and get magical crafting mats.~Multi-classing is quite in depth, but not too complex from what I've seen so far.~Nice voice acting and artworkMy only complaint right now is the sign into EA servers nonsense when loading up the game.

												I went into this game after being very frustrated by aspects of Divinity 2. Kingdoms of Amalur turned out to be a far more satisfying experience, albeit in unexpected ways.A major selling point is that it was written by R.A. Salvatore, one of my favourite authors. However, the game's story is very forgettable. I mean that literally - I've played 60 hours, am nearly at the end, and can barely remember anything that's happened. There is a great set piece battle and a few clever side quests, but the rest just blurs together - something something ""fate"", something something ""mortal"". There's few choices and little reason to even read the dialogue most of the time - just follow the quest markers and do what the pop-up text tells you to do.What it really gets right is the gameplay. Combat is varied enough to keep things interesting, despite making up the bulk of the gameplay. Enemies flail around when set on fire, dodge arrows, resist some forms of damage and have some neat skills and spells. The player character can be built in several different ways , and the paths are distinct enough to encourage re-specing (which is quite easy to do). Controls are straightforward, although the camera can be bothersome at times.The inability to jump, with the resulting unpassable ankle-high obstacles, is irritating at first, but moving around the world is simple enough through a generous fast-travel system, and there's plenty to do as you walk around.There's no shortage of loot, both from enemy drops and in numerous chests and hidden locations. The inventory fills up annoyingly quickly, with no option to screen items by quality, but there's no shortage of merchants around.The crafting system is great, allowing all sorts of equipment, potions and gems to be made.The game loads quickly, and looks lovely even on a mid-range system.There's certainly plenty of gameplay - expect 60 or more hours to complete most of the sidequests.It's a shame the game will never be followed up, because there is an excellent core game here.

												Large, enjoyable, underrated action-rpg. Fun, button-mashy combat that still requires some attention/strategy (esp. on hard); pretty good amount of loot; interesting skill trees and character advancement options; semi-sorta-open-world (new chunks of world unlock as you progress deeper into the game). Gameplay is smooth, responsive, and satisfying, though I recommend using a gamepad for this one. Graphics aren't cutting edge, but they're decent. The world, on the whole, is nicely varied and fun to just roam about and button-mash in. On the downside, the world is pretty superficial compared to something like a Bethesda game. There's plenty of lore and subquests and dialogue trees and all of that, but none of it is very involving -- just kind of par for the course, more of a console-game feel to the progression and atmosphere. I can't really fault the game much beyond that, though. It's a really solid game, just don't expect quite the level of depth you'd get from a hardcore open-world PC rpg. At the time I'm writing this it's on sale for under $10, and it's a great get for that price.			"

												Yes, I currently don't have many hours logged on this yet, but on the Xbone I do. Anyways, this game is really under-rated. I say it would give you a good 50+ hours of enjoyable gameplay. I like the combat system and I like the story and quest. I love games that likes to let you explore and this game captures that perfectly. I constantly find myself wandering through caves, forests, and cities. The only con I have with this game is the lack of difficulty. When you hit levle 25-30 every boss become really easy to kill. So by then you should just crank up your difficulty level and keep moving. Of course there are tiny little flaws, but I can't even remember them so they are nothing to worry about. KOA: Reckoning is a playful, exciting, fresh RPG which deserves much more attention.9.5/10 Sloanster Stars			"

												This is one of those underrated games that got overshadowed by Skyrim because they came out around the same time, and the company was pretty new and unknown. But there are major differences between Kingdoms and Skyrim most noteably, Kingdoms doesn't freeze, get lost, or crash like Skyrim does, especially the xbox version. HOWEVER this game was made for Windows 7, and the company didn't survive, which stinks btw... so there are crashes on Windows 10. Every time I tried to play this game on W10 it did crash after about 15 minutes of play, and others have said the same...so if you don't run Windows 7...you may want to pass on this one, even though it is a really great game.Kingdoms is really well written, engaging, and fun to explore. The map is huge, AND most importantly, its easy to follow. There are a lot of cool features like  dispel chests which are challenging to unlock but hold a lot of valuable stuff in them. Although learning to open them can be a real pain in the fanny because if you fail, you suffer health loss, but they will still be unlocked. There are chests to find, tons of them...and lore stones that when you find and activate them, they reveal narration of the backstory. There is a lot going for this game, it's visually beautiful, reminiscent of Fable, but also holds its own original story and style, and great music, and so is the voice acting. The combat is fun with lots of weapons, spells, etc, to aid you. But the best feature of this game is the combat because it doesn't require the player to be at a high level before they get powerful weapons and spells. You get that pretty darn early so that is a plus in my book. There are 3 game difficulty levels, and several races to choose and build your character from male and female. Human and other.I have logged about 90 hours on this game  (mostly offline not recorded by Steam)... and I still haven't finished everything. There are a ton of side quests but not necessary for leveling up , but can be over-whelming if you start too many at once, which is very easy to do. Basically it is open-world, however the story is linear. The character design and environments were created by Todd McFarlane (creator of Spawn) so ...you know it's great.This really is an overlooked game...but it plays very well, and you should check it out IF you run Windows 7.

												The gameplay of KoA is fantastic. A strong world of warcraft feel to the graphics allows for a smooth gameplay on a poor spec machine.On the world of warcraft note, I would like to add that the entire game feels like it was based off it. The graphocs, quests, locations and characters are all very similar to wow. That aside, there is a lot of orginality in the game, with decent voice acting, the combat system and the smithing concept.My ratings for the game:Audio: 9/10 - Ambient soundtrack was done well, allowing for smooth transitions between combat and adventuring. The voice acting was done really well. No faults in my opinion, didn't get 10/10 because I wouldn't purchase the soundtrack just to listen to it.Visual: 9/10 - As mentioned above, the visuals are smooth and familiar.Gameplay and Content: 10/10 - There is enough in game that I feel that I definately got my money's worth. I was lucky enough to catch KoA and all of it's DLC during a sale at a bargain price.Replayability: 6/10 - The different classes within the game allow for a HUGE amount of replayability. If you want to mix stealth and magic, there are classes and bonuses to suit. If you want to mix all three aspects, there are classes and bonuses for that too. If you want to focus purely on one aspect, then obviously, there are classes and bonuses for them too. The only problem is, even though I had a great time playing through once, I get bored with it quite quickly when I go to start the game again.All in all, I would definately suggest the game to other people, and have done. I would really like to see 2 player co-op brought into the game, if I'd seen that come through, I don't think I would have to buy another game on steam ever again!			"

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a colossal and deep RPG with a beautiful atmosphere.The world you can explore is huge, even though it is parted into many little regions which are designed rather linear. However, this makes it easier to find every quest and not to miss something important. There are tons of caves, cities, castles and forests  that are enjoyable to explore. Besides, you can fast-travel to any location you have visited so far, which is a great tool.There are three skilltrees in which you can invest , you do not have to limit your points to one of them. You can mix them up in any way you want to. You will encounter several fateweavers in the game which can reset your skill points for a bit some money, depending on your level. The level cap in this game is 40.The story itself is pretty cool and presented very well but gets a bit lengthy towards the end, yet the ending itself is spectacular again. There are several moments where you can influence certain outcomes with your decisions.There is a extremely large number of available side-quests in this game,  I ended up having completed around 300 of them (with both DLC’s). Some of them go with the standard pattern like finding some reagents or killing some mobs while on the other hand there are some pretty big side-quests that bring a little story on their own which are very entertaining to follow.The game has 3 difficulty-settings and I recommend you to play it on hard since it’s still pretty easy on medium as long as you’re not fighting large groups of enemies, especially towards the end when you got the best kinds of armor and weapons.There is a variety of different enemies that behave different in battle which leads to entertaining fights. The Gameplay itself is pretty good in my eyes,  especially the combats are very dynamic. The graphics are quite good for early 2012 and the world is designed with a love for detail. You’ll find many different environments that feel alive. The great music of this game strengthens the atmosphere even more.On the downside, there are some bugs in this game which will never get fixed because the studio that produced this game went bankrupt. However, most of these bugs just make some quest items being stuck in your inventory after you completed the quest or other minor things that one can oversee.In Amalur, you can acquire various houses in which you can store your items, you can even earn an own arena and a mining company which gain you money over time.There are various weapon types with different advantages and downsides which brings some additional diversity.Regarding the DLC’s, I can greatly recommend you “The Legend of Dead Kel” and “Teeth of Naros”, which both have a great storyline and add another big map part to the already huge map each. However, the “Weapons & Armor Bundle” just adds a bit of loot that falls off quite quick and in my opinion is not worth the money.All in All, I truly recommend giving Kingdoms of Amalur a try, for it a large and beautiful game with a wonderful atmosphere.P.S.: Sorry for my bad English, it’s not my native language.

												I really love this game. It's one of my favorites to play.When I first started playing it, my very first impressions were, 'ok this is nice, kind of like Skyrims poorer cousin', but the more I played the more I realized how unfair that initial thought was.The combat is very fluid, with a great feeling of impact to the hits. All the moves and spells are beautifully animated.I've gone pure warrior on my first character and can't wait to try out the pure caster role as I think it will be different and interesting to play. Rogue types are normally my least fave to play, but the combat is so enjoyable I'm even looking forward to trying that out too.Loads of side quests (I'm aiming to do all of them on my first character.)The world is huge and very nicely done. There are invisible walls but the world is very open and I don't find they get in the way so they're not something to worry about and they've included jump off points at locations where you'd need/want them.The dungeons are great fun too. Loads of loot drops and chests in dungeons and around the world. The weapons and armor are all really nicely meshed and textured as well.The only negative thing I'd say about the world is that there's something not quite right with the ...ambience? When your outside it feels like you're inside, I haven't been able to put my finger on why that is though, maybe the sounds or something. It's not game breaking, just a little weird when you first start playing, it doesn't bother me at all now.The herbing animations are beautiful, which I think shows a really nice attention to detail.The professions in general are all really good and all worth having. The only thing is when your salvaging armor and weapons it can be a bit awkward. It's fine if you only carry round stuff you have equipped and are going to salvage or sell everything else, but I 'collect' stuff, so I'm constantly having to flick back to my inventory and then back to the salvage screen to make sure I'm not salvaging anything I intended to keep. I feel if you could have salvaged directly from your junk inventory that would have been much better. But that's the only negative thing I have to say about this game at all, and overall and compared to everything else they got right, it's not at all important, just inconvenient......for me :PI enjoy this game so much that I did a search to see what other games the company had made, and was really sad to see that they went bust shortly after this game was released. This game seems to have flown 'under the radar' which is ashame since it should have kept the company in business. I'm surprised KoA is not better known than it is. I bought KoA and all the dlcs when it was on sale here at steam, but it's definitely worth it's full asking price. "

												Holy crap this game is fun!  Dont compare it to Skyrim or similar games and you'll be pleased...that is if you like fast paced and intense combat, deep storyline, alchemy, crafting, and great voice acting/diversion. Has a nice spread of all the RPG elements so your not doing too much of any one thing.  Reckoning is simplified in ways that makes it easy to play without getting bogged down by realistic elements such as arrow counts (which I actually like...as in Skyrim), but is very well suited for this type of game.  It was designed for simplicity and even though its open world still feels linear, but again..keeps a smooth flow and makes it easy to play without having to over think or worry about getting lost (for example). All the other reviews are true!...they did wonders for the inventory organization.  SO NICE!   Very nice story and voice acting...but does tend (for me) to feel like just one task after another, but THATS the game and means MORE XP!   Im not one for flashy combat like in Final Fantasy series, but Reckoning has a fast paced combat tied with awesome cinematics that will surely keep your blood flowing.  Breaking down the 3 core rpg classes into warrior, rogue, and mage...you are able to focus on one or multiclass into any combination...and you get bonuses based on your choosing which can change as you do.  The addition to a 'power up' state called 'reckoning' is awesome.  Once you build this charge you truly do feel like a bada$$ and enemies beware!    FUN FUN FUN....going to play it right now...cya!BUY THIS GAME WHILE STILL ON SALE!    or not....either way its worth getting!!!			"

												I went into this game after being very frustrated by aspects of Divinity 2. Kingdoms of Amalur turned out to be a far more satisfying experience, albeit in unexpected ways.A major selling point is that it was written by R.A. Salvatore, one of my favourite authors. However, the game's story is very forgettable. I mean that literally - I've played 60 hours, am nearly at the end, and can barely remember anything that's happened. There is a great set piece battle and a few clever side quests, but the rest just blurs together - something something ""fate"", something something ""mortal"". There's few choices and little reason to even read the dialogue most of the time - just follow the quest markers and do what the pop-up text tells you to do.What it really gets right is the gameplay. Combat is varied enough to keep things interesting, despite making up the bulk of the gameplay. Enemies flail around when set on fire, dodge arrows, resist some forms of damage and have some neat skills and spells. The player character can be built in several different ways , and the paths are distinct enough to encourage re-specing (which is quite easy to do). Controls are straightforward, although the camera can be bothersome at times.The inability to jump, with the resulting unpassable ankle-high obstacles, is irritating at first, but moving around the world is simple enough through a generous fast-travel system, and there's plenty to do as you walk around.There's no shortage of loot, both from enemy drops and in numerous chests and hidden locations. The inventory fills up annoyingly quickly, with no option to screen items by quality, but there's no shortage of merchants around.The crafting system is great, allowing all sorts of equipment, potions and gems to be made.The game loads quickly, and looks lovely even on a mid-range system.There's certainly plenty of gameplay - expect 60 or more hours to complete most of the sidequests.It's a shame the game will never be followed up, because there is an excellent core game here.

												KoA: TR is a classic action / RPG in the style of Dungeon Seige III.  As such, its appeal is mostly for fans of the console based RPG who enjoy the simplistic interface and sophisticated button mashing combat.  I come strictly from the PC world so I tend to prefer things like Skyrim, Baldur's Gate, and the like.  However this game managed to keep my attention because of its ""charm"" and great combat.I assume that you are familiar with the basics of an ARPG title, so I'll skip right to the pros:> The world is absolutely huge.  I have 40 hours logged so far and have completed about half the game in terms of exploring the map.> The number of quests and side quests is equally enormous.  Given this, the means for managing them all works quite well... any quest can be designated ""primary"" and tracked easily through the kingdom.  Secondary quests appear only on the detailed map which shows the immediate area.> The voice acting is excellent, and ALL NPC dialog is spoken.  I recognized one of the voice actors from Skyrim!  I wouldn't be surprised if there are others from the school of Bethesda.>  The combat, which is the meat and potatoes of the game really, is fantastic.  This is the primary reason to play this game.  The controls are easy to learn (I recommend an XBOX controller) and the unlocks as you progress are interesting and powerful.> Although there are basic classes (ranged/mage/tank) the level of customization available allows you to combine classes in interesting ways or focus on a specific branch within the class.> Crafting is available (create gems/blacksmithing/alchemy)... and exploring any one of those paths yeilds GREAT rewards mid-late game.> The pacing is excellent, and largely under your control.> AWESOME support for 3D Vision... you will want to patch the game using helixmods.  Google it.> Great weapon effects, such as flame, electricity, ice etc.> The story is interesting.> The camera is generally well managed by the game, particularly in combat.> It is possible to completely ""respec"" your character at any time!And the CONS:> Graphically the game reminds me of world of warcraft... rather cartoonish.  Not necessarily a deal killer but I prefer a more realistic look.> The character animations are limited, in particular when speaking dialog.  You will see the same animations repeated hundreds of times, to the point where you begin to notice them... a bit distracting.> Occasionally there are some wild camera glitches.> The difficulty can be uneven, especially early in the game.  You will be sailing along beating up baddies with abandon and then be unable to complete a boss fight without reducing the difficulty.  That seems to be less of a problem by mid-game if you have been managing your build well.> The loot drops are generally not that interesting... mostly junk, at least by mid-game... although by that time you have a specific build in mind and you are looking for specific loot.  I find that merchants are a better source of loot than drops.Overall I heartily recommend this game9/10 (if you have 3d Vision, 10/10)			"

												Recommend -- with caveats. There is a lot to like about this game if your interests lean towards story-heavy rpgs. The world building is generally interesting (and in parts very good), the dialogue pretty solid (and sometimes very good), the main plot line and dlcs are engaging. If you enjoy supplying an internal monologue about your character's motivations and history (e.g. playing the dlc after completing the main quest) this game allows you the space to do that. It's also pleasant to look at, though its paper doll options could be better. Downsides (especially for those interested in story-heavy rpgs): overall, the game has weak ties to other characters. There are no romances or friendships that you can build up outside of quest lines – mostly this left me feeling less-than-fulfilled from a story telling point of view, occasionally left me feeling eye-rollingly awash in cynicism, and sometimes surprised me by how much I came to care for an NPC nonetheless. The voice acting is very much a mixed bag, as are the lorestones (in game archeological audio books). Sometimes they're interesting, rarely affecting, and occasionally, I regretted touching them, because I felt bad for the people involved. The pronunciation in the game is often downright terrible. With the names, I could almost convince myself that the pronunciation changes were deliberate – e.g. the name “Ciara” pronounced as see-ah-ra rather than key-ra, but then, at other points it was just ordinary words that got mangled. Not a big deal for a lot of players of course – but for me, it was more than enough to throw me out of the story and the story was what I came for. Another issue – much of the game is heavily derivative. This is not something I have a big problem with generally, but it's worth mentioning here because of two things: one – it *felt* derivative; it wasn't something I noticed later, but rather as I was playing it, it felt like a retread of other games; two – I found myself thinking in places, “wow that's really interesting, I've never seen that before” and then immediately wondering if it's just because I'd missed the game where someone else had done it first. Again, not an issue for everybody. Someone else can probably talk about visual issues/bugs better than I can, but I would mention two things: post-processing didn't work for me (and if I hadn't worked out the problem in the demo version I probably would not have played the game at all), and some weird design decision during a major main-plot boss fight required me to look up a walkthrough because although I wasn't losing, I couldn't win. My victory was pointless and tedious and in the end I was just glad to get it over with. If I hadn't had dlc left to play, it might well have soured the memory of the game for me. BUT: overall, yes, I would recommend, and I would recommend going in with your eyes open so that you can enjoy all the things the game does well while accepting that parts of it are not fulfilling and some of it is actively frustrating. One final note: it has low to non-existent replay value for me (and I'm generally all about the replays), but I did get about 100 hours out of it between the main quest, faction quests and dlcs.

												It's big. Too big even. After about 40 hours of questing I got tired of doing practically the same quests over and over again. I even skipped through the conversations, and I normally read/listen all dialogues, mind you. KoA is basically a MMO game in single-player form. Is it a bad game ? Not by any means. It's just that it loses focus about halfway through, giving you too many quests to deal with. This game can easily take 100+ hours to complete.The active combat system works great; you're not just pushing buttons and waiting for your character to finish off an enemy. YOU do the actual combat. It's fresh until you have unlocked most of your skills though, then it can grow a bit stale.My biggest gripe with the game was the inventory system, which was awkward to use. Having to pause, select a category and (un)equip items that way is cumbersome and frustrating. It's an area that could definitely use some work.For an action RPG it's pretty cool, but don't expect another Skyrim.[Rating: 84/100]			"

												If you've heard of this game you may have heard that it is like an MMO.Don't walk away just yet. I'm not an MMO player, but I do enjoy this game.It is like an MMO in some respects, but it lacks the things that make MMOs not fun. For one thing, it isn't grindy. You don't have to invest many hours to get into this game. There are a lot of side quests, but they don't feel as trivial as the ones you might encounter in MMOs. The battle system feels very fluid and polished and you don't have to spam your number keys to get attacks off. As far as what I kind of don't like about this game there is a rather large land to explore, but it consists of a lot of trails and forks in those trails. There are some open areas, but you will mostly find yourself on trails. It isn't a real big negative though because you don't feel like the game is a linear excursion.All in all, this game is worth a look, but especially so if you can get it on a sale.			"

												Pretty good, but lacks its own identity (feels like Everquest + Fable, and a dozen other rpgs at once), and suffers from a lot of what makes modern RPGs (even many FPS) suck; being artificially extended with pointless busywork. 90% Sidequests for Deliver this to-, Kill 8 of-,.. ""Hey you're supposed to be a warrior on an important mission to save the world, but can you go fetch my <mundane object>?""It's certainly not this game's fault. They ALL do that these days because it's an incredibly easy way to flesh out a game. Leveling via uninpired fetch quests isn't so bad in an MMORPG, but its dull as hell in single player games. I'm not anti-sidequest by any means, its just that they're a whole lot more common and less creative than they used to be.I'd still recommend it for the $5 I paid, though its ~82 metascore feels a bit high. I'd have it closer to 70.			"

												Very enjoyable action RPG.The great freedom as to what your character will be (You can just mix all the classes in game, respec and start over anytime), what weapons or spells will you use, what stats will you hone - combined with the oddly satisfying combat (Never was a huge hammer so much fun in a game) and the ""bullet time"" mechanics makes it all very appealing and rarely boring, since you can just whip up completely new character with different fighting style on the spot.The huge world and story is nice. Nothing that will shock you, but you can feel the certain quality that comes with a good writer.On the downside, this game has a terrible FOV, depending on your monitor, you may end up just having your characters back over half of the screen - luckily there is an easy and fast fix called Widescreen Fixer (little program that allows you to set up your FOV and distance of the camera from your character). Another possible downer might be the very MMO-ish style of the quests and progression. You may like or dislike that, comes to personal preferences.Neutral - The game is very long. I mean it. Very long. You will likely never finish it, unless you like it as it can very easily take 100-200 hours. For me that is a plus, but I do understand some people don't fancy games of that length. You've been warned.All in all, I do absolutely recommend this game and think it's a great shame the studio is no more as they could've made something even cooler in the future.			"

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning delivers exactly what it promises: an awesome fantasy RPG, with visceral, intuitive gameplay that is easy to pick up, wildly flexible and just plain fun, in a way that had previously not been seen in the genre. many people compare it to action games, but it's really more like an updated 3D variation of a Seiken Densetsu / Secret of Mana game. it's an action RPG with exploration, but no real platforming elements, such as no jumping. Lots of neat weapons skills, talents, spells, and combat styles to try out, and a big loot system on top of it that the Mana series only wished it had.{A General note. I pre-ordered this game when it first came out and thus played it on Origin, where I still have a copy owned.  I have three full playthroughs there each with over 130+ hours played, and one has mastercrafted equipment that made me literally invincible [unless I was afflicted with Bleed status]. And a forth playthrough done ""fast"" with over seventy hours on it. So my time played stats here on steam should be added to those for Origin playtime of an additional 450+ hours.}The world is accessible and vast, offering genre fans plenty to sink their teeth into. One gets the sense that they are watching an entire world unfold before them, one rich with history and lore and life. Amalur opens itself up to the player in a way that is both familiar and refreshing, then empowers the player to do incredible things. It is important to note that much of the setting lore is in books and scrolls found along the way in the various nooks and crannies of the game world, and discerned from NPC conversations, rather than thrown at you in raw exposition, except for a few areas early on, during, and near the end of the main plot line.Amalur looks, plays, and feels like a Secret of Mana / Seiken Densetsu game loaded with combos, super powers, and general badass attitude. Usability and player satisfaction were clearly at the heart of the vision for this game, and it shows. Even without a proper targeting system, your avatar quickly shifts between multiple enemies, flinging all sorts of death dealing nastiness around the battlefield. You never feel weak or hindered in combat. Enemies fall to your reaping as you deal a hurricane of destruction, be you an acrobatic Dervish, stoic solid Warrior, or serene Mage.The flexibility of the battle system is truly remarkable. You have access to three talent trees based on your standard warrior, rogue, and mage archetypes, and you assign talent points provided you meet the requirement for each allocation. This allows you to make a straight mage, a fast archer or stealthy stabber, a rough brawler, or any combination in between. The developers even encourage these types of cross-class creations, as statistical bonuses for your potential Hybrid Death-Dealer have already been planned out. Trust me, you can play Amalur any way you want. Better still, re-specing your hero requires only a small investment that is a chunk of resources early on in the game, but gets easier to bear (despite it's escalating cost) as you level up and gather more cash.Then there's the loot. Sweet Lord, is there a lot of loot! Reckoning plays quite similar to Diablo in many ways. You can scour the countryside and find a staff that easily outclasses your current weapon of choice. Maybe you find a turban that gives a massive boost to your mana pool, or perhaps a shield with a substantial bonus to your health regeneration. The character progression and loot acquisition is enough to keep you playing, and that's something I can't really say about a lot of games out there today. In essence, Amalur serves the purpose of providing you with ways to make your virtual death machine as powerful as possible.Mechanically, Reckoning stands above most current RPG releases in interface and reliability. The menus may appear dull to some eyes, but they are easily read and quickly accessed. A junk button for loot allows you to quickly sift through armaments without any hassle, and this needs to be standard in every game, period!The PC version isn't exactly optimized for the mouse and keyboard format however. I suggest using a controller if you have one because Reckoning was clearly designed for the consoles. Still, the game looks remarkably better even on a modest machine. Seeing the world run at 60 FPS certainly helps with the slightly cartoony graphics. 38 Studios and Big Huge Games have created a world worth saving, and they have given us some pretty damn cool tools with which to get the job done.[Updating my review, edited for clarity.]			"

												My first impressions of Kingdoms of Amalur, if you're into RPG's get this now, don't wait until it's   on sale.  I played the demo when it was available and on the basis of that pre-purchased the  full version.  I am not disappointed.  It's not Skyrim, but it's got it's own charm, and  in some ways I'm enjoying playing this  as much as Skyrim. Some of the characters look cartoon like, but   the environments are beautifully rendered; not  in a realistic way, but with saturated colors which give the  game another worldly look .  The fighting in my opinion looks better than in Skyrim, with sword fights   similar to Prince of Persia or The Witcher.  The game is played in third person  but that doesn't detract from the game in any way, however I would have liked to have had a choice as sometimes first person is cool and at other times third person.  Overall I would say anyone into dungeon type  RPG's  will love this gorgeous looking game.  There's already DLC available for this game.			"

												Try this game if you really like action RPGs, but if you're looking for a good, solid sandbox adventure, keep on walking.The game world is huge, and I mean HUGE, but a ton of it is padding, and with the limited mobility options you're given, it gets really really tedious carting your sorry carcass all over creation to get things done. After a certain point it becomes a series of well-choreographed and engaging battles held together by drudgery and vast amounts of running, and that's even with fast travel as a possibility.This game was originally envisioned as an MMO, and it really shows. You can't jump on your own, you can't really wander off the beaten path (largely because every path is so thoroughly beaten already) and without a horse or some form of mount you're left to running or sprinting. Calling this game a ""wide-open adventure"" is kind of like calling a hike through redwoods with the inability to look up a ""wide-open adventure;"" all of the things are there, but you can't really utilize them to their fullest capacity.At the end of the day, KOA:R feels exactly like what it is: a U-turn into marketability.

												A decent game, but everything gets repetitive and bland after a while. All the quest mostly meet npc, long run to dungeon, kill kill kill, long run back, get crappy reward. Even with the fast travel its still a lot of running to be done.World map view is separated to two different view, one overall view and one more detail view. You have to go to the overall view to fast travel, which is really annoying since you need to swap between those two and the overall view is pretty much useless.This game would be a great for multiplay/online coop game with their huge world, running alone in the bloody huge world is really tiring.In summary, loads of content, but most of it are the same. Rather then making the world huge they should've concretrate on the quality of the content.			"

												A grossly underrated, overdeveloped game. It may have cost the taxpayers of Rhode Island a fortune to make, and it may have cost Curt Schilling a lot of credibility, but the result was actually decent, even if it missed the exceeding high mark 38 studios had set for itself.In many ways, it plays and feels like a Skyrim clone, and while the comparison is fair, it's not the whole story. The combat is much closer to Darksiders than anything, and gameplay is rich enough to give completionists plenty to do. It's only serious drawback is its lack of difficulty, which can be corrected using a widely-available mod.This is most certainly one of those big titles worth pick up when you see it on sale for $5.

												Must have game for any RPG fan. 9/10 overall. A hugely underappreciated title, even moreso than Enslaved.Damn shame what happened to this IP and developer. This is by far one of the most entertaining RPGs I've played, with loads of content, fun and deep crafting system, engaging combat, etc. etc. BHG did a really good job.Pros:-Incredibly bug-free-Fun, smooth, combat-Flexible character development with easy respec-Great storytelling all over-Truely unique world-Great crafting system-I could go on and onCons:The only complaints I have are:-No new-game plus, so replay value is limited-The complex zone level-locking mechanic, in order to get the best loot and have the most end-game loot options, you'll want to level as much as possible in each zone before moving on to the next, and plan out the order you visit zones carefully, but that will make you overpowered for some areas; if you don't care about end-game loot you can just play through as you like.

 Intro To begin off with, yes this is a very alluring title of a game. With a good backstory and gameplay to easily dive into this is really the icing on the cake of RPG games. Sitting next to Oblivion, the Gothic Series and Two worlds this game is very simular in the sense of being unheard of and tending to push people away cause it's a bit older than some other titles.Story time; I played this game back in september 2012, after its Febuary release, when it was free for playstation plus, I easily clocked over 100 hours in my first playthrough. (It's so easy to get lost in the behemoth world map or get trapped into a string of quests which could be both a bessing or a curse) The pros heavily outweigh the cons, to prove so I'll make a nifty list to point out highlights in gameplay. Pros Fast paced combat+Rewarding quests+Compelling story line+Dark Souls boss setups+Enemy variety+Weapon variety+Character builds+Weapon combos+Quality DLC (worth it imo)+Minimal grinding+Interesting lore+Aged like fine wine+Loot system+Lighting and textures+WAIFU DARK ELF Cons -Very casual, easy-Mid-game difficulty spike-Hit and run combat (large enemies mostly)-Few boss fights-CTRL C + CTRL V dungeons-Enemies equivalent to Fallout 4 bullet sponges-(Story spoiler) The end Conclusion All together this is quite the tempting offhand game for people who enjoy any major titles running along the lines of Skyrim or....Witcher... Anyways, as I was saying, to completely clarify the whole fighting thing yes the boss fights are amazing, the encounters are clever and converge well with the gameplay without leaving any gross stitch lines, speaking in retrospect that is, the large enemies like the giant tri-boob desert serpent thing (Banshaen if I recall correctly) and other colossal like relitives are a pain in the ♥♥♥ to fight since you can't stunlock them into submission and don't even get me going about those Son of Laz gangbangs and Scav gank squads it's like Threshold Bridge & Iron Keep SotFS all over again. There's so much more I can say about this game but I'm just going to end saying; all in all it's a good game to pick up and play in your freetime as you don't have to dedicate and learn it unlike a few other RPGs and JRPGs. 8/10tl;dr:Quality game to jump right into, suggest buying on sale			"

												Forgotten Gem.For a change, I will start my review with the verdict:Great game, a must buy for ANY RPG-Lover!Don’t compare this game with Skyrim or Diablo 3 – that would do this game great injustice.If you look for an RPG with great atmosphere, graphics, audio and hours and hours (and I mean hundreds of hours!!!) of gameplay, look no further!…And this is why…in my opinion:I will try and break down this review in a few categories:Options:Only basic options are available, such as a few sound settings, resolution and few gameplay options…that is about it….not to fancy or complicated. For some players it may be too few options, but I found it a relief that with few tweaks this game can be set to my personal liking.This game was clearly built for a gameconsole (hence the limited settings-options) and to be played with a controller (x-box or similar). It doesn’t play well with keyboard and mouse. With a controller all controls are at your fingertips, whilst with using a keyboard you have to look for the controls. Making use of a controller gives the player an easy and intuitive gameplay.Character customization:Not to many features are available, but just enough to make your own character. Different hairstyles, tattoos and jewellery (like earrings) are provided.You can build your character from scratch or use a template/prefix.With the limited options available, this will only cost you a few minutes.Of course you can also choose gender and race. I only played as a human so I will not review any races. Check the internet for that.Graphics/World:What immediately catches  the eyes, are the vivid colours used in this game.Also the lighting is superb! Neon-like plants etc. light up the landscape.The style used is somewhat cartoonish: lean and slick textures with not to many details.All graphics are in perfect balance.Combine that with a HUGE map and you already have a unique universe to make your own.This game runs very smoothly on maxed out settings on my i5 with 8gb ram and Nvidia 710m laptop.Gameplay:As said before: a controller is a MUST HAVE. The game plays smoothly and relaxed.The map is huge! Sadly there are no mounts (like horses etc.) in this game, so walking is your only option, besides teleporting to locations you have already visited.One more minor issue: you cannot jump. When standing on a cliff or river/lake-side you can only jump down from certain points. Climbing up can only be done by following a predetermined route (like a slope or stairs).Items are hidden everywhere, so exploring every inch of the map is worth it….Hint: boost your “Detect hidden objects” – skill from the start….soon you will be drowning in items, which you can sell for better ones or breakdown into parts and make your own unique items (level your “blacksmith” –skill to get better parts etc.) which you can enchant with magical powers and even give a name….I called my sword “Burning Love”  …..:)Loading happens frequently but takes a very short time. It was not hindering me at all.Multiplayer is not available.Skills/Levelling:What unique is in this game: you can combine any skill with another, without messing up your character. For example: you can build a Warrior Mage (mage with sword-skills etc.) or a combined ranged- and close combat fighter in one mean fighting machine. The choice is yours!When levelling you can choose your skill and/or ability you wish to level/develop. I personally don’t like the big warhammers and VERY BIG blades, so I choose the great sword and shield path….but you can always choose other paths in the skill tree.When, for some reason, you are not happy the way your character developed, you can visit a “Fate Weaver” and COMPLETELY rebuild your character to your liking for a small fee (money is not really a problem in this game). This is quite a more than fantastic feature!Quests:I have the complete edition (so with all 2 dlc packs):Hundreds of (side) quests are available. Some short and easy, some long and more challenging.They are varied enough to make you pursue them. Also the rewards and items are worth it….only downside:  A LOT OF WALKING….and A LOT OF ITEMS….but that comes in handy for selling or crafting your own items.Hint: Complete armorsets of the same type provide bonuses. At its release this game was overshadowed by the launch of Skyrim and shortly after that, Diablo 3.But it does not deserve to go unnoticed! It is a game that deserves a big hand of applause and lots of participating gamers.			"

												I have so much to say about Kingdoms! This is one of my all time favorite RPG games. The battles can be a bit repetative and you can count on your enemy throwing the same fight combo at you time and time again (which makes it pretty easy to get those parry achievements) The story line is huge! and there is so much to do in this game which brings me to my first complaint... the level cap :( You can reach the level cap by just doing the main factions. The first time i beat the main story line i was a little bummed to learn of the level cap. I mean who doesnt like to watch their XP sky rocket when you finally beat that main pain in the a** boss?! However, i just started a new game, leveled up the weapons i knew i loved and kept on going. Sometimes the camera view got a bit wonky, its hard to fight when the camera decides to view only the ground lol but it is possible. Just a slight annoyance. The open world is also huge! There are tons of side quests to keep you busy for quite awhile. I love the Fast Travel option, which lets be honest, who doesnt just love spending half the game walking from end of the map to other?! (insert sarcastic gaze) Fast Travel really really helps with a map that is this big. I downloaded The Teeth of Narcos DLC after i beat the game the first time. It's okay.... The underground sewer is a bit of a maze and isnt as ""open"" as the main game map, but it's still pretty fun. Again, it brings up the level cap that sucks....The game says Partial Controller Support but after 200 somthing hours i would have to say that its pretty much full controller. Has anyone heard of a Kingdoms 2?			"

												Played this game alot back when I was in highschool on the 360. Even after so long and with a recent purchase from Steam I am enjoying all the same things that had made me like this game two years ago. Story is rich and combat is great in my opinion. There is always something new to do, from doing side quests and Factions or just enjoying the story. RPG fans out there will love it as I have and am. Strongly recommend using a controller though. Keyboard and mouse can sometimes be a little overwhelming when it comes to combat.			"

												Would I recommend this game?THAT'S A BIG YES, thumbs up!The graphics: 10/10The story: 10/10Side quests: 8/10DLC: 9/10The story is awesome. No words for that!For the sidequests: I am talking about EVERY FREAKIN' SIDE QUEST THERE IS IN THIS GAME: there are A LOT! Some quest are big, you can earn houses for them. Some are small, get this - bring it to me - you get money, kill him - tell me he's dead - you get money. Still, they send you to beautiful places and each sidequest has is own little story and that can be really fun too, right? This game makes you feel like a God! For the DLC: buy them except for the Weapons & Armor Bundle. They'll be good in the begin of the game, somewhat in the middle of the game you will find better and stronger armor and weapons.I don't think it's worth the €4,99The Legend of Dead Kel includes a brand new quest line, multiple side quests, three Twists of Fate, previously unseen armor and weapons, and a new player home. Teeth of Naros opens up a new unique quest line, a new floating city to explore, and multitudes of unlockables. Skyrim was my favorite game before I started my adventure in Kingdoms of Amalur. This became my favorite game and it still is! I hope this review was helpful! Have a nice day! :)			"

												This game made me feel like a kid again.I've played a ton of games to the point where I felt like nothing was new, but this is defintely a unique game.It's graphics look pretty good for it's time. It's got more of a fantasy look than anything and they certainly did a good job on that. While in combat everything looks really smooth and it's fun to look at... especially those finishers, oh man. Sometimes the combat is a little clunky though, mostly regarding the camera. It doesn't have a lock on feature so sometimes it's a little frustrating when you're trying to lock target onto someone else. With that aside, the combat is still great.Usually with an RPG, you'll have to go down a specific specialization to be powerful. That mostly holds true in this game, though you can still spread your talents more thin and still not do underwhelming damage. There's lots and lots and lots of quests. You might not even find all of them which makes this game great. Though it's no Elder Scrolls size, it's still a large game. Because you can make so many different characters and take different quest paths, it's definitely got great replay value. I'd certainly reccomend this game.9/10			"

												Pros: - Beautiful, vibrant, and huge open world.- Good graphics and music.- Decent story.- Good replay value.- Huge content. Lots of sidequests, some are interesting.- Combat is fun but may be repetitive for some people.Cons:- Lack of monster variety. For such a large fantasy world there really isn't much monster variety, mostof them are just different colors with no new attacks.- Some bugs (unfortunately will never be fix).- Speech skill is generally useless.- Not really ""hard"": Hard mode is challenging in the first 3-5 hours.- So-so main characters in the story.- Not much dialogue choices, just choosing between A and B.- (nitpicking) The Fae are boring people.- (nitpicking) Piles of rubbles and dead bodies has more useful loot than chests.

You can combo attacks and such. There is a problem with some auto targetting as aspect, but that is partly coming from somebody used to and with a preference to TES:Skyrim attack aiming. The combat is super fun, an intriguing story, cool enemies with absolutely well done themes and music. I was VERY SAD when the company tanked from bad management of funds when making the MMO version of this game: It was my most anticipated MMO in my life, based on the gameplay of this game in single player- I hope that says a lot, at least as to what I wanted to see in the MMO world when it comes to gameplay and design mechanics. So much to do, interesting weapons and cool abilities/skill trees. CON:It has some bugs and at times the UI comes as rough or not intuitive, that is a bit limited. Literally it has a number of design similarities to Skyrim, as some people that worked on it worked on this game and you can tell. IT has the UI flaws without offering the huge mod culture Skyrim did. That is the main CON to this game.My hard drive crashed when I was many hours into it so I stopped playing for a long while waiting for a good time to jump back in			"

												Honestly, this is a very fun and good game. It's a shame that the studio went bankrupt. This game has so many potential. The graphic is beautiful. Combat is smooth and the storyline is really good. The only con for me is that the quest and side quest became too repetitive. It's mostly, go there and bring me that, or go here and kill that. Other than that I would recommend it.			"

Still, it is fun, and you'll enjoy it.If you buy it, start on hard right from the get go. Seriously.			"

												Real shame about the Company.....this game is awesome. Fun combat system and great story line with a ton of side quests. KOA is definitely worth is price.The only thing I can really say bad about it is that you can tell it's a console port via the menu system. It's managable though once you get used to it. Definitely worth it ......38 Studios should be proud of this game and it's sad that no online MMO or sequel is being made of it.			"

												Wow... what an unsung gem of a game, I would guess its very approachable from a variety of skill levels. The world is big, with lots to do and see. the Environments are fantastic and varied. The character models look good, I've heard some reviewers claim they could have been better but I personally feel the art and style of everything in Amalur meshes well. The action oriented combat is great. There is also a huge story and lots of well acted voice dialog.If I showed this to my Fiance she would probably keep the controller for herself. I guess I'll eventually have to show her because she loves art and creative media. Kingsoms of Amalur really is that pretty, once she starts getting the hang of the controls (which are easy to use, while also having depth) we'll have one more thing we like to share.			"

												Just like the description of the game, it's litterally Salvatore, McFarlane and Rolston meshed into one. This game is freaking rad. I don't play many RPGs like I used to, but this one is a good exception. The game play is like a mix of elderscrolls, mass effect and the witcher. The world is absolutly massive and its quest overload (just like an elderscrolls game). The world (that I've seen thus far) is oversized giant mushroom styled high fantasy....its pretty to say the least. Dialoge, actually pretty well done. A lot of folks seem to think this plays like crap on PC, well I disagree. This plays very fluid. Don't like the keys? Rebind them. I already see myself tossing a couple hundred hours into this. Totally worth the whole 12 bucks or so for the game + DLC on sale. I'd be willing to throw 20 at it....well worth it.			"

												Amazing game to play if you're a fan of any role play games! The graphics are really well done. Most of the game looks really colourful and bright, or dull and dark when it needs to be. The gameplay is loads of fun and offers a ton of variety in terms of what your character can do to fight. Finally, load times seem to be very low, and overall it's an amazing RPG to play!			"

												Let me start this review by saying that I had always seen this game in stores, and passed over it due to just simply not knowing much about the game or the developers. I never looked at gameplay, or even images of the game. I simply gave it no second thoughts. I figured it was another dime-a-dozen adventure game that would be thrown into the void of time and forgotten. Then, I saw the game on sale, and I made the best choice I've made in a long time. I purchased this gem and all the DLC for $9.99KOA: Reckoning is EXACTLY what I always wished Fable would have been. It's a HUGE open world adventure game with awesome loot, tons of quests, simple yet diverse combat (camera being the exception), and very smooth framerate even on the highest settings (The computer I downloaded this on only has an Nvidia GTX 750 :/ ). Anyway, I would highly recommend this game to ANYONE who used to play Fable, and wished for more. Kingdoms delivers on all fronts, and I can't believe I didn't buy this earlier. It's an absolute STEAL for the price.I won't go into an expansive list of pros and cons because you can find countless reviews prior to this one listing all of them. I'll just say that no game is perfect, but it's the amount of fun you have with it which really speaks to a game's quality. I can easily see myself investing 100+hours into this game without even blinking an eye, specially since there's the might/stealth/magic skill trees you can specialize in, making playing through a second or third time a very real possibility.

												Pros: - Beautiful, vibrant, and huge open world.- Good graphics and music.- Decent story.- Good replay value.- Huge content. Lots of sidequests, some are interesting.- Combat is fun but may be repetitive for some people.Cons:- Lack of monster variety. For such a large fantasy world there really isn't much monster variety, mostof them are just different colors with no new attacks.- Some bugs (unfortunately will never be fix).- Speech skill is generally useless.- Not really ""hard"": Hard mode is challenging in the first 3-5 hours.- So-so main characters in the story.- Not much dialogue choices, just choosing between A and B.- (nitpicking) The Fae are boring people.- (nitpicking) Piles of rubbles and dead bodies has more useful loot than chests.

												Great loot and combat system. Everything else is generic. Not saying that it's bad. On the contrary, for a new-comer, it is a fantastic start. To be frank, Reckoning is a great game for the veterans of the genre as well thanks to its engaging combat and not too shallow class system.

												 For myself, this was one RPG that slipped under the radar. I had heard about it years ago upon pre / actual release, but for one reason or another it never made my purchase list. Having bought & played now for 35 - 40 hrs., I am actually  glad I waited. My hardware runs this thing flawlessly now, but 4 yrs. ago when this came out, it would have been a struggle. Good game, story, combat, upgrade system;  definitely worth adding to any PC players' action RPG collection.			"

												Beautifull game that never really got the attention it deserved. Cool looking area`s with a good variaty of enemy`s and large amount of quests to keep you busy. Combined with a very interesting combat system and leveling-up skills that lets you choose between various different playstyles that you can always change whenever you want to (Gold cost goes up after each reset but not too much). Simply a nice world too explore without it making you feel lost like skyrim does. However the game does have a few issues that you need to be aware of. First is saving, there is no autosave, so be sure to save often since you don`t want to lose your progress when it crashes (happened 3 times in 20 hours so its not that bad).Secondly, some quests have weird bugs wich lets you not complete them if you do things in the ""wrong"" order. Most of the times it`s resolved by selling the quest item and then buy it back, but sometimes it just bugs out. There are Forums out there wich can resolve many of these issues, but know that the game has it`s flaws.And thirdly the FOV of this game is very low, but with the program widescreen fixer you can alter it to your own desire, so It`s not as big of an issue but again is an inconvenience that you should know about before buying.All in all a very attractive game you can sink a lot of time in, and definitely a game you should buy or try, as it has a demo.

												I owned KoA for quite some time and recently finished the main quest. And I must say KoA is one of the best games I've played so far. I like the vivid, mostly colouful atmosphere, the story and the combat system which includes mmo elements. On the other hand the voice acting is a little asynchronous especially in German and the animation in generel isn't as smoothly as it would be in new games but that's not a big deal.			"

												A gem that I find myself always coming back to. Not a perfect game, but just does so many things well you can't help but want to try every race and class. Pros: Decent graphics. Not breathtaking, but not a lot of buggy nonsense everywhere either.Story is genuinely interesting, and each DLC story makes you yearn to discover more as well.Combat. Holy cow, the combat is fun. There may only be a handful of weapon types, but the way your talents affect them and the combos you can string together is just plain fun. Mixing and matching magic spells with weapons adds some nice flavor as well.There is a LOT to do in this game. Even if you only did the main story it takes a while to finish, but rising through the ranks in the various factions is some of the best parts of the game!Your character's abilites are NEVER set in stone. You can reset everything to try new ability combos at any point in the game.Cons:This game can be very unforgiving. Probably my biggest gripe with this game, is that there is very limited auto-saving, yet many ambushes/surprise events that you can be quite unprepared for. I ragequit many a time after having hours of work sucked away by carelessly forgetting to save, then dying.The voice acting may seem decent at first, but some of the accents and voices get VERY annoying and repetitive. Not the end of the world, but definitely noticeable.At points this game can be grindy, when the level gap between zones is a little too big. One moment you'll feel like a badass, then move to the next zone and get wasted immediately(Then lose a ton of time as previously stated haha sob).Overall, 8.5 / 10I'll take slightly flawed, lesser known game with insane replay value over a big name blockbuster that leaves me yawning after 20 hours anyday.PS- Bought this on Steam after logging 100+ hours into the PS3 version. Cheers everyone!			"

												This game is very underated. Sucks we wont see a sequel, not anytime soon at least. I think it has a beautiful world, quest and story is somewhat generic, and the loot system makes it really hard to get all set pieces. Other then that though its a great game 100+ hours if you want to do side quest and the DLC is actually realy good. The combat is great not very hard core in the rpg aspect but there is some depth. Todd Mcfarlen did some of the art design and Marylin Manson was in on the score. Pretty awesome! Highly recommend!!!			"

												boy is this game a hit or miss relationship. it has buttonmasher gameplay that is extremely satisfying, and a story good enough to keep you going. the graphics arent the best but they are stylized enough to still look good. the world feels empty though, and i think that is because it was originally intended to be an mmo. i would definitley snatch it on sale.

												This is a good RPG game with a great world that draws you in. However it begins to get repetitive after 15-20 hours which is a fraction of the way into the game. Twice now, at 30 hours the repetitive nature of the game gets too much and I have to come back a few months later to continue. Hopefully someone will buy the rights and make a sequel.			"

												Been playing this a lot, and it's really great. Such a shame that it's not more known than it is.Pros:Good story with lots of nice sidestories.Lovely grafics considered it being from 2012.Great combat, with totally different attacking styles and abitilies depending on weapons.Really cool skill tree and hero progression. Just awesome abitlities! Crafting weapons and armorForging. being able to insert gems into weapons and armor that you created yourself.Loots lots of loot with a very high amount of different armor and weapons.Big map with lots of quests.Cons.you have to play in hard mode for it to be a challenge, none the less, when you Do play it in Hard, there's basicly little to no cons.---------Someone addressed the item stash being limited. I believe you start at 70 items max. but as you explore, you'll find shops where you can buy ""upgrades"" for your stash, which allows more space. I currently can hold 130.Buying the Dlc's is a must. They are really good, and add some great stuff to the game.10/10			"

												Se você pensa em que esse jogo está abaixo das expectativas, com toda certeza você está enganado. Eu fui assim em relação a ele, até joga-lo. E mudei totalmente meu ver, é um daqueles jogos que são pouco divulgados, mas merecem o reconhecimento.O jogo se passa no Reino de Amalur, onde você é um escolhido do '' Destino '', algo que torna as coisas ao redor mudarem, e você é o principal protagonista de um certo experimento ter dado certo e escolhido para impedir o mal ( Clichê que nunca acaba. )Mas, vendo ao mundo vasto que Amalur mostra, sidequests são quase infinitas, dungeons são várias e os cenários,  super bem feitos e diferenciados.Eu já vi isso em vários outros jogos, mas de qualquer forma vale ressaltar o elemento mais ♥♥♥♥ que KoA abrange:  o Combate Hack N' Slash.Não é como em RPGs clássicos que você '' de repente '' encontra um inimigo, ou em uma batalha em turnos, é tudo naquele momento, você viu o inimigo e ja começa a pancadaria, independente do ambiente que for, todos os movimentos acontecem e fluem extremamente bem, sem um único erro ou bug. E até com 4 inimigos a sua frente, é possível enfrentá-los todos ao mesmo tempo, focando todos ao modo que você quiser, através de ataques corpo-a-corpo, longo alcance e magia.Isso já determina as 3 classes, que, apesar de serem poucas, possuem habilidades significativas para cada uma das classes.Exemplo: Não é possível ser Mago do Fogo ou do Gelo, Mago é Mago, você usatanto fogo, como gelo, eletricidade, e até sumona um esqueleto para lhe ajudar.Um fator legal das classes é você poder misturar uma com a outra, podendo fazer um guerreiro + mago, ou assassino + guerreiro, e por ai vai.Mas claro, é possível seguir uma skill tree só, mas eu acho meio chato sinceramente, já que o jogo oferece você poder misturar os combos de cada classe para acabar com os inimigos.O level máximo do jogo é 40, achei baixo, mas é o suficiente para você poder aprender todas as skills da '' árvore '' da sua classe.A quantidade em termos de itens são poucas, porém há muitas variações de um mesmo item, incluindo raros,lendários e os sets ( que fazem parte de um combo de equipamentos ).No jogo também são incluídas facções, que é possível se juntar,assim obtendo mais sidequests e seguir a mainquest dessas facções, são ao total 7 facções no jogo. Descubra por si mesmo auhauhauHá também as cartas, que são obtidas de várias maneiras, e oferecem ao jogador bônus exclusivos, como maior dano, regeneração de vida, e por ai vai.Dentro desse esquema existem também as lorestones, que contam poesias e poemas sobre Amalur, achando um set completo de lorestones, você ganha bônus para algo específico também,Falei muito bem dele até agora, mas KoA contém seus pontos negativos também.Um deles é o Summon da skill de Mago, que aparentemente não fica maior ou mais parrudo quanto mais ele upa, ele aprende novos combos para abater os inimigos. Achei diferente, porém estou acostumado com os summons parrudos do Diablo II, auahuahuah.Outra coisa são os personagens, todos são muito bonitinhos, coloridos, mas isso é o estilo do jogo mesmo, mas é impossível você ficar horrendo no jogo, é mais fácil ficar com uma aparência bizonha e estranha.Além disso, tem certos NPCs extremamente fracos em relação a personalidade, uns 70% do jogo, então não espere muito deles. Claro que tem alguns que te acompanham pelo resto do jogo, que obviamente vão estar bem melhores que os outros.Não há companions permanentes, só temporários.BUGS malignos, como som atrasado, acontecem algumas vezes, ou também o jogo fica mudo, mas volta ao normal.FInalizando, KoA é um daqueles RPGs que você com certeza não bota fé por não seguir os estilos clássicos como FF, Tactics Ogre, Diablo II, ES,etc.Mas, mostra por um lado, uma obra prima que conseguiu colocar o combate como maior foco do jogo, coisa que poucos não focam e muitos gostariam de ver a ação tomar '' ao vivo '', um mundo incrível para explorar, itens para achar e melhorar e seu personagem, e principalmente, um caminho a escolher para o seu Destino.8/10.

													I purchased Kingdoms of Amalur on Steam as a complete package for $11.99 which included all of the DLC and finished the main story in 53 hours.  As with most games I play, I finished all the side quests I came across. Graphics – Great	I loved the graphics in KOA.  There is a strong a vivid use of color and the world is filled with detail.  Animations are fluid and my PC never once stuttered the frame rate from a constant 60 fps.  The environments could have used a little more variety as by endgame you will grow tired of the same recycled assets. Music – Fair	The music in KOA is well orchestrated but the songs lack depth and variety.  More songs would have been a plus as a large amount of time is spent in each area before going to the next and this can have you listening to the same loop for many hours at a time. Cinematics – Good	Picture the same dialogue cutscenes as KOTOR or Mass Effect.  The dialogue itself is very well written but unlike the Mass Effect series, you may not find yourself delving into the various conversation options.  The characters and their backgrounds just weren’t interesting enough for me.  The choices during conversations also lacked the Mass Effect style feeling of autonomy.  You could make good or evil choices but it never mattered much.  “Quick Time” events in combat are a cool sight to see. Story – Good	As RPGs go, this story is original and kept me interested enough to finish the game to see what happens.  I did not grow attached to any of the side characters or find them interesting.  This game is really all about you.  The main villain(s) were menacing but far from the kind of evil we love to hate. Control – Great	I had no issues with the controls.  They are very simple and easy to learn.  The UI was easy enough to use.  The awkward camera may startle you at first but you quickly get used to it. Gameplay – Fair	I played as a melee class so your experience may vary.  Combat in the beginning is fun but quickly grows stale.  All I really had to do was click mouse 1 until everything died.  Even on the hard setting, combat becomes too easy as you gain better weapons and armor.  You completely overpower everything and I did not die once the entire game.  I also never needed any of the consumable items with the exception of a very rare healing potion. Content – Good	There is plenty to do here and the game’s zones adjust to your level so you are free to do as little or as much as you want to for side quests.  The loot you find is very rewarding in the beginning of the game but by the middle, I was scrapping everything I found for parts.  I had over five million gold with nothing to spend it on. Value – Great	For $12 I had 53 hours of fun.  The game is huge and kept me playing until I finished.  I did not feel inclined to play through the DLC quest lines.  In my opinion, they weren’t worth it. Recommended – Yes	I recommend this game for the price I paid.  In my opinion, this game is worth $20 or less.  It is currently $19.99 on Steam without the DLC.

												Great Game! except there is no co-op....-1This is a game of wonder, you can explore the world, have a lot of quest and side quest, their mission is fun and take alot of time to complete,each mission has their own plot and genre story, while doing a quest, player can go around kill a monster, animal, people which not related to the quest for a no reason, also you can choose side, where i can regonize them as bad or evil, good or juctice, and ""i don't care"" charcter type. Not only that, you also can reach a state of question: ""what the heck im doing right now?"" because there is no set of ""rule"" that you can follow. So, i give this game... Fun: 2/4 & Plot:4/4The good thing about this game is the avatar can be customize yet its boring, of course its fun, you can create your own character and became the character by exploring the world and experience the tale of your awesomeness, but, that's make you feels there is lack of something. There is no love, yes, i cant find anything that i can love about this avatar. Why? because there is no character to fall in love with! P/s: Also, the customerize appreance,face,and others stuff is limited. Character:1/4Skill set is awesome, you can upgrade your own power based on what type of your character, not only that, the charcter can have a multiple type of skill set and power.This mean, i can play as mage but at the same time,i can play as rogue. Yet, the weopen is limited, there is nothing fancy about them, just a typical weopen that can been seen on others game. Skill&Inventory: 3/4Overall, there is nothing much to talk about, this is a good game, if you are a player that like to play a game like diablo, torchlight, or any common game that share the traits of RPG and pack of full blown action, this is a game for you( while waiting new game to get realease). Overall: 3/5			"

												KoA:R was a surprise buy for me while I was trying to take a break from binging on Dota 2. Didn't touch it for a few weeks before deciding I would dust it off.I honestly should have started playing this sooner.One design aspect I really enjoyed when starting off is how easily I was able to distract myself early in the game regarding combat and character development. Normally in these types of open RPGs, I tend to get bored early on and rarely get to the part of the game where you actually feel badass and know what you're doing: you have good gear, nice weapons you're glad to have found, some money in the bank, etc. KoA:R lets you play around enough early on with different playstyles so that by the time you find the playstyle that fits you best, you are already well-geared and feel like a power house.Combat is fluid, the weapons are overall pretty great (although I wish I had more patience for the slower weapons in the game e.g. Greatsword, Hammer, etc.).There are likely flaws to this game that I haven't mentioned, but currently, I haven't really found anything that would annoy me enough to stop playing mid-session.PRO-TIP: Play on hard mode!! I started off on Hard and was wondering why some of the enemies were still so easy. This changes as your progress and find new mobs to fight, and luckily this is around the time where you are able to grasp how to hold your own.9/10 Still playing, and will likely reroll a character after I finish on this guy!

												I'm hesitant to recommend this game because I didn't love it, but for some reason I kept playing it until the end.  I found myself speeding through some of the more boring bits of the game just to see the main storyline through to completion, but honestly, the main story leaves much to be desired.  The world is huge and feels very complete, but unfortunately much of this is lost if you--like me--can't quite cross the threshold into obsession with exploring the world.The gameplay is fairly fun and varied for an action RPG, but the skill progression for the sorcery tree is VERY unbalanced.  You'll spend the first third of the game abusing the same couple of abilities over and over again, feeling somewhat underpowered and dependent on your physical weapon to fill in the damage gaps.  It starts to balance out a bit in the middle of the sorcery tree, but then the scales are tipped ridiculously upon reaching the highest tier.  The Meteor ability is capable of wiping out an entire group of enemies, and while it does have a long cooldown, it is always ready by the time you reach the next group and doesn't consume enough mana to slow you down.  Speaking of mana, itemization was a bit frustrating and seemed too random.  I finished the game with a staff bought from a vendor, but then again, I was just destroying armies of fools with giant meteors summoned from the depths of space, so who needs a nice staff?One of the things that continued to irritate me in this game is the sound.  I'm not sure if they didn't have the budget for a good sound team or if they hired amateurs, but the sounds in this game feel completely wrong.  One example is the sound they used for a shattering clay jar.  It doesn't feel like part of the environment, but instead a flat sound file played slightly out of sync with the action.  There are many other examples of terrible sounds throughout the game.  The music was occasionally decent, but for the most part it was forgettable.The graphics in this game were nice enough, and the art style felt consistent and well-done.  Framerate was never an issue on my aging machine--even with settings on max--so clearly the core tech team behind the engine knew what they were doing.All of my complaints aside, I still found myself coming back to this game day after day to see what was around the next bend.  Upon completion, I almost felt as if I could do more exploring or wrap up some of those faction quests I left unfinished...but, I have better games to play.  If you like MMO-style gameplay and want to get lost in a big, lonely world for hours on end, give Kingdoms of Amalur a shot.  However, if you--like me--find yourself with less and less time to play games these days, you may not get as much out of this game as you put into it.			"

												This game is:An rpgThat plays like Dragon Age: OriginsThat also plays like an MMOWith the combat style of Dragon Age: 2.I'll explain. If you've ever played an MMO before, you'll know that there's a rotation to your skills/abilities. This game offers up three sorts of abilities - melee, ranged, and magic. The game allows you cross-abilities and encourages it. The UI is set up like a typical MMO sort. The controls aren't difficult to grasp.You move as though you were in an action game. Think Kingdom Hearts if you've ever played that. Or Devil May Cry.This game came out about the same time as Skyrim. It was overlooked because of this, and subsequently the developers went out of business.This is a tragedy. The game has the same open world feel as Skyrim, and allows you to fast travel to places you've been before. The looting system is much the same, only it allows for more.For instance, you get the inventory is full instead of slowing down.For another, within your inventory are bags. Each bag is for a crafting. Alchemy, sagecrafting (jewelcrafting), and blacksmithing. The components for all are placed within these bags, and not in your actual inventory. So you can stock up as much as you like on them all.You're able to purchase a house, expand it, and have your own shared storage within it.The scenery is gorgeous, the characters are pretty amusing, and while the character customization is sparse, you're allowed to be something other than friggin' human.The plot has an absolutely fascinating premise, and how many games can you play that starts you off in a dumping ground for corpses?It also touches a LOT on fae mythology. Brownies, trolls, sprites, etc. The elves are particularly badass in this game rather than being a bunch of pretentious snots or a downtrodden race.The downside to this game is that there won't be any sequels coming to it due to the company going out of business.

												This game surprised me.  I read some reveiws that said it was surprisingly good but it still caught me off guard.  I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I am.  It's a pleasant feeling to be surprised these days by a game that seemed to be so resoundingly denounced on release.  I highly recommend playing it, even with all its' flaws, because it's fun and familiar. Let's get the bad out of the way:-The first 30 minutes.  It's awkward to control without tweaking because it was absolutely designed to be used with a controller.  If you have one, I recommend using it.  If not, tinker with sensitivity and hotkeys to make it more playable.  The defacto tutorial level is unimpressive, slightly confusing, and rather buggy.  It takes you through each class and weapon type but you don't have to commit just yet.  At this point it seems to be super linear, on rails type of game but push through to the first village and it opens up.-The camera.  It takes getting used to.  The third person perspective is unfortunate.  While I generally play in third person, not having the option to move the camera is frustrating at times.  This is one of the areas where it's design for consoles is very evident.-Vanilla.  This isn't really a negative or a positive.  It's what you expect from a game like this.  Some fetch quests, some kill quests, some steal quests, a few factions and schools to join, and the RPG trinity of classes.  Even with some multiclassing, it's still an expected experience class wise.The Good:-Rich lore.  If you didn't know, it is written by RA Salvatore and it shows.  Some of the stories feel familiar if you are a fan of his books.  One of the first questlines, The House of Ballads, is very interesting and they continue in the vein throughout.-Tons of side quests.  You can get lost in sidequests for a few hours with each new area and those discovered in the wild.-Combat seems simple on the surface (and can remain so if you desire) but with multiclassing can become dynamic and engaging.-Crafting! I generally only craft because I have to but this system makes it easy.

												This game surprised me.  I read some reveiws that said it was surprisingly good but it still caught me off guard.  I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I am.  It's a pleasant feeling to be surprised these days by a game that seemed to be so resoundingly denounced on release.  I highly recommend playing it, even with all its' flaws, because it's fun and familiar. Let's get the bad out of the way:-The first 30 minutes.  It's awkward to control without tweaking because it was absolutely designed to be used with a controller.  If you have one, I recommend using it.  If not, tinker with sensitivity and hotkeys to make it more playable.  The defacto tutorial level is unimpressive, slightly confusing, and rather buggy.  It takes you through each class and weapon type but you don't have to commit just yet.  At this point it seems to be super linear, on rails type of game but push through to the first village and it opens up.-The camera.  It takes getting used to.  The third person perspective is unfortunate.  While I generally play in third person, not having the option to move the camera is frustrating at times.  This is one of the areas where it's design for consoles is very evident.-Vanilla.  This isn't really a negative or a positive.  It's what you expect from a game like this.  Some fetch quests, some kill quests, some steal quests, a few factions and schools to join, and the RPG trinity of classes.  Even with some multiclassing, it's still an expected experience class wise.The Good:-Rich lore.  If you didn't know, it is written by RA Salvatore and it shows.  Some of the stories feel familiar if you are a fan of his books.  One of the first questlines, The House of Ballads, is very interesting and they continue in the vein throughout.-Tons of side quests.  You can get lost in sidequests for a few hours with each new area and those discovered in the wild.-Combat seems simple on the surface (and can remain so if you desire) but with multiclassing can become dynamic and engaging.-Crafting! I generally only craft because I have to but this system makes it easy.  It is not particularly deep or impressive in it's installation but it is perfect for players like me who don't generally dump a ton of time into it.  I like that you can craft usable items at any point no matter the skill level.  Strength of weapons or armor are based on components used and NOT player skill.

												I inititally dismissed KoA when it was released, thinking it was just another bland RPG game. However after buying it on a whim I was blown away by the amount of content. The quest system is solid and will keep you busy for the forseeable future, and the game is brilliantly optimized.As of writing this review I am not even half way through my first playthrough (finishing the main quest lines in both DLC zones). There are three distinct classes to level in depending on whether you want to be a ranger, who favours bows, a mage, who can summon powerful AoE spells, or the cheapest class I have found, the warrior. You are not limited to one class or the other and can make just about any character you could so desire. but the only way to get the very most powerful perks is to invest all of you skill points in to one skill branch.The crafting system is solid, allowing you to make your own potions, weapons and armor, as well as gems that infuse your items with other powers (Health or mana regen, poison damage, extra armor). Crafting your own gear is recommended as anything you make with high enough ingredients will out perform any weapon or armor piece found in the world.The game world itself is huge, and given that your character does not have a mount, you will be walking everywhere (fast travel becomes available after visiting a location). There are many different biomes that you will visit on your journey from lush jungles, to scorched deserts, to damp marshes.It is true that no game is perfect, and I am quite sad that the developer shut down after this game was released, my personal rating for this game is:Story 7/10     The game starts in a new way to anything I have ever seen before, but still has some cliche momentsGameplay 8/10     The fighting system is a breath of fresh air to me after skyrim, it feels fluid and quick swapping lets you juggle your opponentsGraphics 7/10     Don't expect crysis the RPG the game does look a bit cartoony but it earns the high rating because it fits so well with the gameSound 9/10     The ingame soundtrack is beautiful and the little details and subtle sounds bring this game to life, an absolute pleasure with headphonesThis has become my favourite RPG in my steam library and I cannot recommend it highly enough, the game might be a bit slow for some people to begin with but after you begin levelling up you choose the pace			"

												I've always felt RPGs to be a bit different than other types of games. They require time, dedication, and skill. But in return, they give you one of the greatest possible benifits- no, not a drip for your sensory systems or endorphins, but an endless creativity and a bueatiful world. That being said, creating a game is different from creating a painting. It can't just look good, it must be fun to play, fun to interact with, fun to experience. And while when many think of RPG, TES comes to mind, I think Amalur: Reckoning is one of those games that is sorely missed. It carries you into a colerfull, viberant, world, ripe with imagination and ready for the taking. It gives you what is, in my opinion, a better system than any other game- it allows you to have the freedom of skyrim, but also the classical class system and skill trees. The gameplay is fun, the world is simply gourgeous, and the lore is plentiful. This is one hell of a game you would not want to miss.(NOTE: I am a PC gamer, however, I find this game is much more enjoyable with Xbox 360 controller. Its not meant for it, but it sure should be!)			"

												The RPG format is one where you have fairly clear expectations.  Despite this, most of them get it wrong.  But KOA Reckoning is the first one I've found in a long time that has actually had me telling myself I needed to go to bed (and then ignored my own advice).  The storyline is rich, which a lot of developers forget is important when you're supposed to be *playing* a role in a virtual world, and the gameplay is fun and flexible.  As much as I love games like The Witcher, the user interface and controls can be awkward and clumsy; this game overcomes those problems and is genuinely enjoyable from start to finish - where you'll actually *want* to spend dozens of hours off on lore-related side quests instead of begrudgingly doing them out of necessity.  Overall one of the best RPGs that I've ever played.  I haven't checked out the DLC yet, but it's definitely something I'll be doing and not just considering.			"

												An excelent game. It has a level of character customizability that rivals and possibly surpasses the Elder Scrolls series. Your ability to thoroughly customize your character's powers and abilities adds a level of forthought to who you want your character to be while you fight. If you don't like the way your stats are progressing, then you can wipe the slate clean and start over. Through the course of the story line, you could have a warrior, a mage, a rogue, a combination of any two, or all three. Plus, your ability to sneak, forge, craft potions, find hdden items and other such skills are seperate from the combat skill trees. You could have a warrior with an insanely high sneaking and discovering items skills, or a thief that likes to forge weapons and armor. Basically, this game is definately worth playing, Nine out of ten, I'd say.			"

												Short: The game is amazing, yet so underrated and overlooked. It's got good character customization and creation, it has a plethora of awesome weapons and delivers a funny yet dramatic storyline.* Pros- Open world (HUGE)- Lots of weapons and other equipment- Three ""classes"" to choose from, warrior (Might), rogue (Finesse) and mage (Sorcery) with lots of skills each, which can be mixed! (I.e. Might/Finesse or Finesse/Sorcery or a bit of everything).- The player is fateless, so you can choose different fate-cards that have different effects, choices in dialogue also make differences.- Funny dialogue, you can decide what to say and get a funny response if it's absurd.- Lots to explore, many dungeons, areas and quests!- Awesome combos and finishing moves* Cons- Lacks some sounds, even though your player says something, there's no sound for the dialogue. (Though the npc's are voiced)- There aren't as many monsters as weapons, enough, but there could be more. (Some vanilla are even used in the dlc content)- There's no mounts, so running everywhere is a pain sometimes. (There is fast-travel though)			"

												This game really fullfilled my action RPG needs and it's got some great features. First of all, I got a bit shaken off by the camera system, but I got used to it. It's quite funny because this game kinda has to be compared to Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, because they came out practically at the same time. I made a bit of a comparison with a friend where I called this one a ""little skyrim"".That said, this game has some unique features, such as:+Fate meter/Reckoning Mode (special combat mode, like an overdrive)+Twists of Fate (bonus after certain key quests)+Destinies (passives according to character stat growth you made)The game has some replay value since you can:+Do story and optional quests again giving different answers and check the other's reactions+Invest on Persuasion in order to see different reactions+Align yourself to good or evil in certain story quests where you're given the option to either kill an ancient being(or keep it imprisioned) or unleash him for his powerAs for the game design itself, some pros and cons are:Pros:+You can do Stat resets anytime by visiting a Fateweaver and paying some game currency+Fast paced combat which rewards for diversity over repetition+Varied weapons, skills and playstyles to choose and re-choose from+Big meaningful sidequests for certain factions+Skippable DRM (the game asks for your e-mail, but if you don't input it, it carries on)+Investing on different abilities (lockpicking, blacksmithing, stealth, detect hidden,...) may unlock new dialogue optionsCons:-The main storyline boss fights are quite dull-Most of times your input doesn't matter for how the NPCs' general reaction unless it's from one of those unlockable options-Once you enter a map, monsters are designed to accomodate to the level you were when you entered, forever, meaning old areas become easy pretty fast if you're ""running errands""-Killing enemies while stealth doesn't alarm someone beside that guy, but killing a civilian in a city hidden in the attic brings all the cities' guards over, for some reason.Overall verdict:It has got me playing for some time and got me interested in the story and some of it's features, but it didn't become memorable and some parts of it just seemed unpolished. Your interaction with the game's world is meaningful, but only to a certain extent.			"

												This game is absolutely beautiful. It is soo much fun and the story is pretty good imo. The classes are fun and its totally possibly to do a combination instead of solely sorcery, might, or finesse. my favorite combination is sorcery/might. some of the weapons are really cool in this game and I think they are unique. You can play this casually, or turn it on hard for more of a challenge. A lot of people say this game is too easy, but I have a character on hard and it is definitely more of a challenge, at least to me. This is a super gorgeous and enjoyable game, and it will always be one of my all time favorites. I greatly reccomend if you are considering this game.

I ended up really, really enjoying it.Pros:--OMG this game is SO PRETTY.--Enjoyable combat and malleable skills. Good variety of weapons, and the spell animations are fun.--When playing with a controller, the camera handling is pretty good. There have been several fights where the camera angles have added a lot of drama and ""wow factor"". Haven't played with a keyboard and mouse so I can't speak to that, --The world is MASSIVE and there's lots of exploration.Cons:Sometimes the subtitles for the lorestones don't sync with the sound. There's also a part near the end game when the lorestones will talk over a character giving you important backstory.Some of the names of places and people have that weird, hokey fantasy name thing going on. You can tell that there was an attempt to make the naming schemes different for the elves, dwarves, humans, etc, it's all equally hokey-sounding to me.There are some game-breaking bugs, including one in the main quest line.

												Probably one of the most overlooked games I've been surprised by.  Immersion is completely to the 9's, the artwork amazing, and possibly the most convincing voice acting of any RPG I've played of late.  It's only weakness that I have seen is it's combat so far.  Simple and only challenging sometimes.  This may be cured by the difficulty slider, but due to the big warning that is given for changing it, I have left it for this playthrough.			"

												The most epic, colourful and beautiful fairytale I 've seen. Enourmous world, a lot of locations and places of stunning beauty to explore,great plot, style and attention to details and history, yet at the same time without any boring and repeating stories. Along with the main story, there are a lot of !!!!!!! (a whole lot of)!!!!! different quests for factions and just NPCs. With  2 DLCs ( each as big as the main storyline) you can play this game for a very very long time. And this time you'll spend with a great pleasure.			"

												It's really unfortunate this game came out at the same time as Skyrim, as it deserves it's own place. It has an amazing story, a world at least as big as Skyrim (maybe bigger), and great comic-book style graphics. Combat is much better than in Skyrim. The add on DLC is amazing, can't recommend it enough. The world setup is very immersive as well. Crafting is OK, not as good as Skyrim, but the potion creation is a bit better in my opinion.Only downside is that there's a lot of walking, and no horses. The fast travel system works the same was as in many of these games - you walk there the first time, then you can teleport between places. Overall, really loving this game.			"

												One of my favorite games of the last generation. The story may seem nonsensical and the facial expressions of the characters may seem wooden, but it's all more than carried by the superb battle system. It is an absolute joy. One of the best non-turn based battle systems I have ever used. Easily on par with Dark/Demon Souls. It's fast paced and fluid. It just feels good. It makes you feel like an utter badass. You are given 3 archetypes to work with: Mage (clear enough), Rogue (bows, daggers, fast stuff, cool assassiny skills) and Might (great swords, hammers, tanky things). You can go solo in any tree or mix between two or even all three. Putting points in trees unlocks tarot cards as you go on that change how your character functions in fights. The 3rd tarot for a Mage/Rogue hybrid for example changes your roll dodge into a teleport and tarots beyond that adds the ability to poison enemies that you teleport through. It's pretty rad.The game world is also pretty expansive; it'll take you a long time to finish everything. Steam is for some reason saying I've only put 3 hours into the game but I know that I have bare minimum but in 40 hours (lots of airport layovers while travelling) but I'm pretty sure I'm only about halfway through the games content. Lots and lots of questing to do here. Just buy the game. It's a good time.			"

												This game is a lot like Fable, but that isn't a bad thing. I enjoy Fable. I enjoy this. It's kind of like I enjoy them both. Hey! How about that? I do. I really do enjoy them both. Amazing that, isn't it? I must like games that are like both Fable, and Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. This is something I had no idea about. I wonder if there are more games, that we could enjoy, that are like Fable and Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. What do you think? Do you know where we can find more games like Fable and Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning? What's that? You say we should check the tags created by gamers just like us? Good Job. That is a great way to find more games like Fable and Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. Lets go!			"

												I'm going to compare this game to Witcher 2 and Skyrim because they are my two favourite RPGs and many people have played them. Secondly, if you're going to buy this game, it goes on sale fairly often so I would suggest waiting for a saleKoA does a lot of things right but a lot is sincerely average:KoA has the option to completely change your character's style and perks at any point meaning that you can change the type of character you have whenever you want to try something new. This is cool but it made me feel like a second playthrough would be fairly pointless as I have already tried all the character builds in one playthrough.Playing through the whole game the environments are beautiful and varied. The look of the game is more animated than Skyrim or the Witcher and this gives it a ""friendlier"" look, this is either good or bad depending on your preference.The fighting mechanic is fun and fairly reactive, being more like the Witcher than Skyrim. You can dodge and mix spells and abilities seamlessly in with melee or ranged combat. I found the game too easy, playing the whole thing on hard and never really struggling, eventually you become so powerful that you cannot be beaten and fighting creatures becomes tedious even though the fighting mechanic is funThe main story line is decent and has some originality but is definitely not on the level of the Witcher (but few games are in my opinion)The faction storylines are fun and to the point but fairly predictableBut the side quests have some cool little twists and original little stories.The soundtrack is terribly repetitive and NPCs like talking during battles which results in you missing half of what they are saying because the background noise is so loudSome reviewers found the voice acting sketchy but I did not notice any problemsThere is a lot of lore to be discovered which is nice for people into that and it isn't thrown in your face so you can ignore it if you wantLastly, you can sell any item to any merchant and they all have unlimited funds (because running around trying to sell things in Skyrim is pretty annoying)Pros:Beautiful environmentsGreat fighting mechanicLots of loreDecent storylineRecustomising your character at any pointCons:Too easy (for a Dark Souls person)Predictable Repetitive soundtrack and some difficulty hearing NPCs explain key story points (which they don't repeat)No point in a second playthroughSo in conclusionKoA is a fun game that I would recommend to any RPG fan, but I personally would not rank it above either Skyrim or the Witcher 2			"

												This is a good RPG game with a great world that draws you in. However it begins to get repetitive after 15-20 hours which is a fraction of the way into the game.

												Fun game that's definitely worth trying if you're looking for a good action RPG. The DLC is fun, though maybe a bit short if purchased at full price. The graphics (especially for an older game) and story are solid, though not as good as something like Witcher. One of the biggest things that I like about the game are that the combat, while not necessarily the most complex, is fun and customizable depending on your preferred style of play. The other biggest pro for me is the amount of character progression, in terms of the look of your character, the gear that you get, and the talents/abilities that unlock over time.			"

												I was looking for a Fantasy Rpg to play and found this, I'd finished Skyrim and was looking for another great experience. While it didn't live up to my expectations (which were probably far to high considering what I was comparing it to) but I found it nevertheless to be an enchanting game, beautiful music, wonderful scenery, nice graphics, combat had just enough variety to not be tedious and boring. My favorite part of it all would have to be going around finishing side quests after the main story. Besides Skyrim I've never actually enjoyed this process in other games, it just felt repetative beating foe after foe with my godlike powers, but in this, the music and scenery just made it magical. I'd reccomend this to anyone wanting a Fantasy Rpg  game that's comfortable and fun to play. 8/10			"

												This game is full of content, not to mention if you add the dlc's to it. There is a load of Weapons and Armours, all sorts of items to upgrade with and its great! The leveling up system is very nice and really makes you think about what you're upgrading, For both the combat and the skills.There are many quests to do and so many more side quests, the faction quests are great for lore as well.The final boss fights are very well laid out and make you create a plan of attack, sometimes its fun to just go nuts as well.Of course there are some things that aren't the best, for instance the prices of items and such can be fairly unbalanced and if you are not careful can end up wasting a big chunk of your gold.The camera angles can be tricky to get use to, especially if you play a lot of other games that all use a different camera style. It can be a bit of a nuicence that you can zoom your camera or lock/unlock it.But other then that this game is absolutley amazing, graphically and visually. Audio and musicaly and combat balance and all that, offering a wide variety of content it is a game that is worth buy and spending hours into nights of playing. "

												A decent game with bright visuals and a long runtime.  The story is confusing and forgettable, but decent for an RPG.  There are a variety of environments, owing to the size of the map, and a number of different enemies to match it.  The travel system is easy to use.  There's really nothing that I disliked, but it lacks some content and systems that other RPGs have.  Overall, well worth it if you can pick it up for cheap.			"

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning came out at a bad time. It was only about 3 months after Skyrim launched and most western RPGs now had a new king to contend with. This game fell under the radar and the studio closed even, which is unfortunate as this is a great game.Penned by R.A. Salvatore the world of Amalur is familiar enough for a traditional western RPG player but different enough in it's storytelling to be just compelling enough to keep on playing. Everything is fully voice acted and quite well at that. I personally didn't find myself falling in love with any characters in particular but the story is only one part of this game. One of the other great parts of this game (and in my opinion the main reason to pick it up and play) is the combat. The combat is fast, interesting, and requires a decent amount of strategy. The easiest game to compare it to in terms of combat is God of War. You'll be building combos, countering, and dodging your way to victory with a wide variety of weapons that almost all play differently. Fortunately you can handle two different weapon sets at a time allowing for a significant amount of customization that let's you create a character that fits your play style. Visually, the game is decent. There isn't much in the way of lush foliage like in The Witcher 3 but the color palette is vibrant and on an artistic level the game shines, even if it's not necessarily a technical marvel. Armor and weapons look especially cool even if many modern visual effects aren't present.In terms of getting all the achievements keep in mind that this is an open world RPG. This means very few missable achievements (although there are a few so check a guide beforehand) and several story related achievements. There were some kill grinds which are always fun in addition to semi-collectible achievements. I would also recommend the DLC if you don't mind forking out extra dough. If you can get them on sale even better. You'll also need them to 100% the game on Steam.Overall, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a great western RPG that unfortunately fell under the radar. It's a shame more people didn't play this game because it tells a pretty good story, has some of the best western RPG combat around, and looks pretty good from an artistic point of view. I highly recommend picking this one up especially if you consider yourself an RPG fan.8.5/10			"

												PLAYTIME: 30+ hours on XBox 360. 10 on PC.I was leery of the game's notoriously easy difficulty level, so I chose to handicap myself a little. I played on the hardest difficulty level, and did not accept any HP upgrades. If the game became too easy, I would remove armor.Thankfully, the game turned out to be enjoyable enough for me to purchase the 360 and PC versions of this title.PROS[+] Very good combat. Melee and projectile attacks are mostly viable for all weapon and spell types, without being too easily abused. Some enemy mobs are dangerous enough on the highest difficuty level to require light tactical decision-making on the player's part. Dodging and cancelling your combo attacks will help you get past tougher enemies.[+] Several helpful interface features make lootgathering and questing more manageable thann games like Skyrim. Multiple waypoints can be selected via Active Quest selection. Inventory management is helped immensely by one-button junkgathering and junkselling. Gathered loot is easily compared to the gear you wear.[+] Loot model is reasonably generous.[+] Very colorful visuals with fluid animation.CONS[-] Combat only allows one or two types of attack per weapon, tops. Beyond the basic 3- or 4-hit combo and a charged attack, there are no variations to weapon attacks.[-] Combat on lower difficulty levels is too easy, since enemies are constantly stunned by your basic attacks and never really fight back. (On the highest level, stunlocks are much shorter.)[-] The early areas of the game are mostly claustrophobic: a series of caves and tree-lined corridors.[-] Maps only allow one custom waypoint. Players maybe be able to manipulate the Active Quest in order to juggle two waypoints, however.[-] Exploration is far more two-dimensional than Skyrim. Hills and mountains can only be scaled via designated points on the map. It makes the exploration less dangerous in vertical areas (since you can't die by falling), but means travel options are less common.[-] The story is mostly a forgettable jumble of lore and characters that are far from compelling.[-] Music is so subdued, it's almost nonexistent.

												I had heard that this game was too similar to an MMORPG without actually being one to be fun, but these claims were wrong. Certainly, the quest system is a degree like an MMO's, but it was nowhere near as monotonous, and I went through the game doing every quest for every region, and only became tired of that when I had went through every piece of land on the lefternmost (see: largest) continent, and was about 40 hours in. The combat is fantastic. I only played as a warrior, but the moves were so stylish, and made you feel so powerful, that I never got tired of fighting. The challenge is kept consistent all the way through, and the gameplay and character customization overshadow the admitably awful story and characters (that fortune-teller dude that follows you throughout the game is badass, though, as is your gnome buddy). I strongly recommend this. One playthrough, including DLC, will get you 50+ hours, and it is certainly replayable.			"

												Kingdoms of Amalur is a good Action-RPG in its own right. It has plenty of loot drops, a very action oriented battle system and a very good skill tree.The skills are fun to explore and satisfying to combine, to find your own playstyle.The quests usually range from killing X to talk to Y and fetch Z. Nothing new here. The game features a huge map, which is unfortunately not a single map, like in Skyrim, but large Zones that are connected without a loading screen. Art style and graphics are very colourful, yet gorgeous, comic-esque. And although it looks a little like Torchlight, it features rather bloddy finishing combos. If you are in need of easy action without a deep story KoA might capture you for hours, until something ""better"" comes along. It's not Skyrim and it does not try to be, but it's also not as mature, deep and tantalizing.			"

												This is one masively underrated RPG in my opinion.  A massive world full of people, factions, quests to do, places to explore and experiences to be had, it never received the due praise that it should have received.Possessing a truly original and authentic story and set in a vibrant world, I keep coming back to this game for more.  A non-linear leveling system that actually lets the player customize the game around their own playstyle, and a Fate system that allows for either further customization and giving the player a sence of accomplishment.  I wish more RPGs could be as well thought out and beautiful as this one.For a single playthrough to experience a near full clear will take well over 100 hours, and that does not even touch the DLC.  At $40, this is an RPG YOU HAVE TO TRY.  The demo includes not only the starter ""tutorial area"", but after that you can take to the first zone for 45 minutes and do ANYTHING you want - quests, crafting, gathering, killing NPCs, whatever your heart desires.I cannot say enough great things about this game.  I wish everyone could get as lost in a single game as I did (and still do) with Kingdoms of Amalur.			"

Here's the tl;dr at the top of the post: Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning is absolutely worth your time.Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning is an open-world, action RPG created by the unfortunately defunct 38 Strudios. After booting the game and playing the first extended mission, you will quickly realized that a lot of love went into this game. There's not many games out there that feel like the people who made them were making a game that they simply adored and would want to play themselves. However, this is, without a doubt, one of those rare games.Let's take a look at some bullet points straight from the Steam store page:- Uncover the secrets of Amalur in hundreds of hours of immersive gameplay, from the vibrant city of Rathir to the vast region of Dalentarth to the grim dungeons of the Brigand Hall Caverns.This bullet is not exaggerating with the ""hundreds of hours"" bit. I've easily sunk 63 hours (as of this posting) into the game and I have no idea if I'm close to the end. And you know what? I'm fine with that. The story is engaging and the world is full of awesome locations full of interesting people eager to send you even farther out into the world.One of this game's most amazing strengths is that EVERY SINGLE QUEST has full voice acting. You never have to read a line of text if you don't want to. For me, this keeps the game interesting and pushes me to play farther into the story because I actually care about these characters. For once, the NPCs are not just cardboard cutouts with text attached to their face. It's incredible what a difference that makes.Okay so it has a ton of missions and voice acting, but does it have a world to support these characters and their stories? Hell yes it does! Take a look at this next point of interest:- Explore deep levels of lore in a universe steeped in 10,000 years of fiction created by New York Times bestselling author R.A. Salvatore.Kingdoms Of Amalur has an Elder Scrolls level of world back story. Every book you find has a story written inside them about the towns, cities, people, and invading monsters. Exploration is rewarded with notes written by local townsfolk about their everyday lives, how they came to be, and their personal demons. Some merchants even keep inventory notes that you can peak at. You can spend hours just talking to individual people in the towns and learn how they feel about certain locations, the legends of old, and events that are likely to happen.If you're one who craves lore, this game will not disappoint.Lots of missions: Check. Lots of lore: Check. How about a good combat system: Double Check:- Customize your play in a dynamic combat system that delivers some of the most intense and responsive action ever seen in an RPG.- Seamlessly integrate magical and melee attacks as you take on scores of enemies in grand fight sequences and finish them off with brutal Fateshift kills.The combat system is a hybrid of God Of War and the Fable series. You can move around feely, use two seperate weapons (of any type), and dispense of 4 different magic spells at anytime during battle. There's also a nice blocking mechanic that slows down time and knocks back any enemies around you to give you the upper hand.Combat has a very light locking mechanic as well. All the melee weapons have a 3 to 4 point combo that can be executed by pressing the button at a certain pace. Once you hit someone, the game will softly nudge you to keep you hitting the target. The reason I say ""softly"" is because you can change your direction at any point during an attack. See someone coming up from behind? Whip around and hit him with the final attack from your combo to make sure he doesn't get you with your back turned.Spells vary. There's a ton to choose from. Some are simple character effects, some are projectiles, while others are area of effect attacks. Each has a special visual style and devastating effects that can be upgraded through the abilities tree.The ""Fateshift"" mentioned in the second bullet is a slow-motion mode that is activated once your Fate meter fills up from killing enemies. When Fateshift is activated, you are given increased damage output as you kill as many enemies as you can in the allotted time and then perform a special finisher move to the final enemy. Doing so gives you extra experience points!Alright, so there's one final piece I'd like to talk about, and that's the character building:- Build the character you've always wanted with the revolutionary new Destiny system that allows you to continuously evolve your character class to your style of play.- Create and modify your hero with millions of combinations of skills, abilities, weapons and pieces of armor.When it comes to character classes, there are three main choices: Might (Warrior), Finesse (Rogue), and Sorcery (Magic). You can either fully spec one of these classes, or go for something a bit more interesting and incoperate a little of each. Doing so actually effects some of the class bonuses (called Destinies) you get later in the game.Also, if at any point during the game you get bored of your current class or you want to change your profession, visit a Fateweaver and simply respec every single skill and ability point you've earned so far for a small amount of coin. The game is long, and you'll like want to do this once or twice just to change things up and try something new. It's always nice when a game is flexible.There you have it, my extended thoughts on Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning. Hopefully through this post I've helped alleviate any doubts you may have had about the game and pushed you towards trying a wonderfully crafted RPG full of exciting characters, locations, and monsters. Good luck in Amalur!http://forums.fungineers.net/index.php?topic=1403.msg22646#msg22646 "

												For some reason when I first got this game I thought it would be similar to skyrim, but I soon realized it is very different.  the artwork and music of the game was just so unique and the character animations were so sleek.  The way you play the game makes it so you can make many different combinations of attacks with many different weapons.  There can be quite a few ways to play through the game.  The only complaint I would have is that it's too easy to just make your own weapon that will just make it very easy to kill enemies.  Trust me if you want a challenge while playing this game then don't invest in smithing.			"

												Hands on the table, I've yet to explain such a great experience as I have been having with this game, thus far. Amalur: Reckoning, has become a favorite in a matter of moments, to me.If you are in search of a story-backed, heavily armored RPG, or something to bring an emotional (and nostalgic) rememberance to you. THIS IS IT!Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning has brought back to me the same nostalgia of games such as, Fable, Morrowind, and other timeless classics that brought in a new era of RPG gaming. 9.3/10 Story8/10 Graphics10/10 Content8/10 UI/Combat Mechanics10/10 Replay ValueThe story is unique and enthralling from my point of view as the player, many bonds formed in the game. Reckoning has an exciting amount of information to learn for almost every NPC character as well, there is lots to learn, and always a bonus! Graphics are intriguing, lots of intuitive graphic inspirations which look and feel similar to games such as WoW, Prince of Persia, Fable 2, and The Last Remnant.I could not ask for ANY more content from this game, personally. The content that has been provided, is incredible. It takes a keen eye to see all the little details put into the fabrics of this game, and there is a bountiful amount of things to do in this game, never boring. As for the UI of this game, it's not ""clunky"" or ""misplaced"", but it definitely could have been shown off a little more. Speaking for this in a comparison, it would land closer to an original inspired UI, such as Dark Souls. Relatively simple to navigate, and basically gets the job done. Could have been better, but I've seen worse.Combat in this game lands incredibly close to that of a Fable game, the particles of Magic based skills/attacks are very similar to the style of that series. And the combat feel is smooth, and aaalmost clean. It has a bit of register and error when it comes to trying to scroll between weapons when you want to, and when you want to aim at an enemy while moving backwards, something that comes with most games. Just need to remember that these things occur. The actual skills and devices of combat in this game feel familiar to Continent of The Ninth Seal (C9 by Webzen), the skills are incredible and awe-inspiring! I really feel at home with this game, and there is always something new to accomplish, or experiment with. Lots to tinker with, lots of different ways to go about doing one single thing. Always new possibilities for your character progression, and every class tree is fun to play with. Needless to say this game userped the throne of my RPG Top 10.Feel like this game is for you? It should. It is worth the full price, believe me. It is always nice to get it on sale, just don't waste any time NOT playing this game :)			"

												This is pretty late to the game, since Kingdoms has been out for years now, but I think it's important to review a game I love this much. I have more hours into this game than almost any other, and for good reason. The story is pretty extensive, and the sidequests are mostly worth doing, unlike some more recent RPG's.Pros:-Good main storyline-Easy to learn combat system-Excellent DLC-A weapon crafting system that makes your efforts count-Ability to respec easily later in the gameNeutral:-Built-in level cap doesn't allow for maximized characters-Even without maxed abilities, the game isn't difficult to beatCons:-The side stories are extremely repetitive and predictable-Speed is heavily favored over powerI know not everyone will agree with some of my points, especially the last one.

Whatever, let's start: • 4 races to play.• 3 skill trees Might, Finesse & Sorcery. (You can be three of them if you want)• Fighting system like Darksiders.• Epic boss fights. • A great story, never got bored while playing. • A huge world to explore. (Better with DLC Packs)• Amazing animations. • And the best part, insane finishing moves while in Reckoning Mode! So, you MUST buy this game if you wanna feel the real action.

												Initial review when halfway through the game:More epic than Torchlight, less epic than Morrowing/Oblivion/Skyrim.Although KoA is not as epic and deep as the other famous titles in this genre, and the battle mechanics take some time getting used to, I would highly recommend this game! KoA has a more linear storyline, with fast travels, character customization, quests that are easy to follow.Followup review:After 74.6 hours of play, and with the main quest completed, I felt exhausted. The first 40 hours of the game was fantastic, absolutely loved it. However, once you get to the 60% mark of the game, the whole thing starts to get repetative. I stopped doing side quests and did not bother reading the dialouge between characters. All I wanted to do was to complete the main quest. Probably because I used melee set-up throughout the game and hence the game got boring for me. I never tried the ""mage"" or ""theif"" set-ups (you can change set-ups anytime during the game). And at the 60% mark of the game, the world started to get really big. You had to waste 20+ seconds to run from the entrance of the building to reach someone.During combat, the camera tends to 'fly' around. I couldn't see what my character was doing and the actions of my enemies.That being said, I still enjoyed the game. The game was not difficult and I had no issues completing the game comfortably on 'normal' mode. The game not was buggy at all, apart from one insignificant side quest where I was not able to complete because it kept crashing my game when I tried to 'light up the cactus"". Summary: Kingdoms of Amalur was definitely worth my money and time.			"

												★★★☆☆When i was playing mass effect 2 on xbox 360, I had chance to play kingdoms of amalur (as KOA) demo version. And this demo game gave me a good time. So i bought this one. Anyway that's personal history. :) Return to the subject, 'KOA' presents the new fantasy world about 'Rule of Cycle', 'Immortal Fea', 'Crystal War', 'Fateless One'... and so on. And these things are showed with beautiful graphic (not mean good quality).Also this game contains many thing to do. After tutorial, you will be faced a lot of quests. Even sometimes these quests make me confusing. You can collect regents or shards to create potions or gems. And you can breakdown equipment and salvage gears to make weapons or armors.And battle system is good. Even this is a RPG game. You can against your enemy by combo, air combo, combat ability and reckoning mode. Various weapons, skills, destinies (like specialized jobs) give you joyful choice. Even you think 'I made a wrong choices', don't worry, you can return to level 1 with all skill points. And reckoning mode is awesome, you become a powerful one and you can do fate-shift (like finish blow). I always felt catharsis when i finished a strong enemy by fate-shift.But 'KOA' also has bad things. First and Worst thing is '38 Studios (developer of 'KOA') was closed without 'KOA' licence sold. That means no more updates, DLCs and 'Kingdoms of Amalur II' :(And character customization is awful. May be, you have bad feeling, when you make your player. Because character customization has very little selections to make your face. Then your worry become a problem of game play. You can see  a NPC what have exactly same your face with different hair color. But that's not a problem, i can imagine he is a my doppelganger or unknown my brother who was seperated at childhood (in game story). But real problem is same faces NPCs are too many to focus story line. For example, You will meet a mentor who guide you in arcana faction quest, and he will send you to the archimage. (I skip many things to prevent spoiler). Then... you will see a same mentor face archimage with white hair. WTF, Even they are major NPCs of faction quest, they have same face!!! except hair color!!!! This problem will teases you until final battle.Other thing is the low level cap. If you are a person who complete all quest in the game (not repeat quests), you can reach level 40 (max level), soon. In my case, i could reach level 40 after siege of mel senshir. Probably i could do that because i finished 'The Legend of Dead Kel' and 'Teeth of Naros' before cross the ocean. Then i lost my purpose of side quests and battles. Level cap must be higher than level 40 to make player can push forward.Anyway 'KOA' is a good RPG game. If it was not, i didn't get all achievements of this game. 'KOA' is a new IP game what has potential to be a great franchise game. But it's a shame, future of 'KOA' is unclear.			"

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning (KoA) is probably one of the best games I've ever played and ever will. Soon after you fall down into a pile of bodies and miraculously come back to life your pitted in a war against the people of Amalur and the Tuatha. The Tuatha are a race of the Fae that have been corrupted. You start with one area gathering armor, weapons, supplies, allies, ingredients, crystals, and other different nouns and items. There is a great leveling up system that gives you unique and different abilities. I never got the hang of dispelling or lock-picking so I'd recommend upgrading those early so you can force them. Let's also talk about how there are lore stones that give you background information on the land around you. You'll enjoy your time in KOA from becoming a witches husband or the hero of the Warsworn. There's also a achievement if you talk to someone with nothing equipped so that's cool. If you'd like to discuss more about the game feel free to friend me. It's worth whatever amount of money you pay for it. Rate 10/10 Rank The Best			"

												Alright, well, here we go, I bought this game under the impression it was open world, and had RPG elements, which it did have on both accounts, HOWEVER, After playing for 20 hours I came to a realization, this game is monotonous, it feels like ive been doing the same side quest 50 TIMES, the main story itself was intriguing, and combat is fairly fluid and dynamic, the class system in this game is different to say the least.To summarize, I came away from this game the same way I came away from Skyrim, its alot of fun, until you do everything, the choices you make have no real consequence, and the world seems HUGE on the map, but the reality is, its just large open (or semi-closed) spaces with the same brands of monsters scattered throughout the world at large, there is a backstory, but your so caught up in everything, you dont see it, I recomend this game when its onsale (for like 10$) but otherwise 7/10			"

The world is large and amazingly detailed, the monsters are strange and exotic, and the combat, while it takes a little getting used to, is pretty fluid. It can get difficult at spots, but such is to be expected from RPGs of this nature. Say what you will about Curt Schilling and the late 38 Studios, but they know how to make a damn good RPG.

												This is close enough to Fable to make me want to play it, but far enough away with enough minor issues in just the right places to make it annoying. It's so close to being a great game, but it just isn't. This game was written by my favorite writer: R.A. Salvatore.This game's art was directed by my favorite comic book arist: Todd Macfarlane.One of the creator's of Morrowind's engine was responsible for this game's engine, and I loved Morrowind.I wanted this to succeed more than anyone, but it fell flat. It has the repetition of an MMO, but without the other players to fill that void. The combat is decent, but not good enough to make up for the repetition. The characters are mildly interesting, and the voice acting is good. I would even say the graphics hold up even in 2017 because of the art style they chose. I just keep waiting for the point where I get immersed in the world, and it just isn't happening.			"

												The game is actually pretty great and I would love to recommend it but it also managed to provide me with some of the most frustrating gaming experiences I've ever had, enough for me to just uninstall it after 30 hours of play time.  There are several bugs in the game that there are no fixes for and which get you stuck, permanently.  So if you didn't make a separate save (not auto-save) then you basically have to start over.  The first time it happened I had a save from like 10 hours previous, very frustrating but I kept playing.  Then it happened again on another quest.  It just blows my mind that the developers don't even acknowledge it, let alone try to issue a patch for it.			"

												Underdog detected :)PROS- Truly HUGE world.- An amazing amount of quests, a lot to do- Three classes with that play very differently because of their skills- High polish and optimisationCONS - Weird to say but the game is so huge that sometimes it can be discouraging :) But this is not really a con, mostly we have been playing short games for so long that we lost the attention span required to play a game for weeks.- Some of the lore can be boring sometimes. I find the fae to be a boring race for exemple, bunch of broken record playing the same songs again and again. But it fits the story and the world setting, i just wish there were more diversity in the culture of the world.REVIEWThis is a huge game and deserves a long review, but lacking the time suffice to say that it is an excelent RPG, and fairly unique in the way it tastes like an MMO because of its scale.I am not sure why this title didn't do better, I can't recall but i think at the time it came out there were 3-4 big titles coming out also and they completely overshadowed this game. I guess most people didn't have the budget or the gaming time for another 60$ title. I only grabbed this recently because it went on sale, and certeinly don't regret it. I got about 90 hours out of it already after finishing it (not a full clear mind you, a lot of quests and some exploration still left over), and I still have the DLCs set aside.Some advice : If you get slightly bored in your play, respecialize as another class. I went through all the 3 classes in my single playthrough, and it helped keep things fresh. The game certeinly doesn't warrant a playthrough with each class as it would be too repetitive, so might as well experience all classes on the same go.			"

												An unsung treasure that deserves a spot in every RPG fan’s collection.Writer R.A. Salvatore created original IP for this game, giving it one of the most unique settings and characters of any RPG you’ll play. While the game itself is nothing groundbreaking Kingdoms of Amalur does it all well; the controls are good, the story is compelling, the graphics are solid, and most importantly, the game is just fun to play. One of the best RPGs to come out in the last few years.			"

												This game somehow manages to be perfect, despite it's flaws. When I first got into it, I played trough it literally two times in a row and I'm still planning on doing a third run to get the last few achievements I'm missing. I'd even go as far as calling it Skyrim's little brother, as it's not as huge or overwhelming as Skyrim, but has the same effect when it comes to getting caught in it's world.			"

												Do you want a game that could be compared as the arcade feeling The Elder Scrolls with with too many side quests to deal with? Then this game is right for you. At the start, you were a dead person, and resurrected by a gnome. Eventually you will be fated to be three archetypes: Warrior (representing Might), a Rogue (representing Finesse), or a Sorcerer (representing Sorcery). During your time, you may swap points around any, or all three of these fields to get a nice mix-match of what kind of character you want to build. Sounds great at the start, but sadly the further you go to see a pattern of go to this region and do mindless side-quests that may get you so sidetracked that you may forget what you were meant to be doing with the main storyline. Especially in my case when I took a year long break because of said mindless sidequests.Combat system is not that bad, but it is not that great either. You are allowed to hold two weapons at a time, yet both, or any of the weapons do have a limiting combo system. Best way to describe is just pressing X X X or B B B with a hint of X ""pause"" X ""pause"" X. Catch my drift. Too bad the baddies in the game do not hold up in the variety party. Could be a good thing when you do not have to remember how enemies attack, and can anticipate any attacks.After the combat comes the spoils, and it feels like the loot got spoiled. In the beginning, when you have nothing to use everything is great loot. By the time you come around your twenties or thiry levels the look; much like any dungeon crawler, can be sparse in quality. Even the armor sets could not hold a candle to some of the blue or even green armors that I had been picking up which makes you wonder if picking the lock of an average or higher difficult chest is worth the trouble.Speaking of lock picking; there are skills you can either pick up from leveling or some NPCs that you meet along the way. Most of these NPCs may only teach you so much in skill levels that it can be hard to find ones that can teach you further deep into the high ranks; even at areas where it should be level appropriate. Otherwise, most of the skills can you help you further into your adventure especially one to find all the hidden goodies. I did wish the crafting skills could make armor that would of been your end all to be all armor or weapons.Pros:+ You got PLENTY to do+ Though limiting archetypes, but you can mix them up+ Gorgeous world even at this point of the review it still holds up well.+ Decent skill system with worth while skills to achieveCons:- Too many side quests, but it is up to you if you want to bother- Lackluster loot at the end, and crafting weapon and armor is not much worth it. Shame...- Not much variety of enemies, and not much variety of a combat systemEven though I said a fair share of gripes with this game, but I did played through to the end, even if it was a bit painful if you are one that wants to finish all the quests. Without a middle recommendation, I am still going to recommend, but during a sale.			"

												In general a great game that is easy to play either for a quick 5 minute bash or a complete quest.Only complaint is that it still has bugs such as a killed enemy's image remains standing after death and unable to complete the last 2 conquests because suddenly the weapons no longer work once you leave Camp Moondown.Bit frustrating but overall plenty of hours of mindless killing fun.

Honestly, this game is amazing. I bought this game around 4 years ago on EA Origins. I only got to complete the game without the DLC but wow, this game was the greatest game I had ever played at the time. I saw the deal for the game and all the DLC for only $10 and I had to buy it, so I could relive the experience I had back then. If you want to buy and play a game that has: An amazingg soundtrack, Good crafting, an epic storyline, and so much more, I highly recomend this game. The game does have its bugs and can be easy after a certain point, but there is just so much to do in this game. 9/10 "

												Don't let my low game hours fool you. I played this game for over 100 hours on my xbox before I wiped it.[Slight Spoilers]Pros:+This game lets you play whatever build you want to do.     -> Do you want to be a Mage and surprise people by slamming them to the ground with a massive warhammer? Do you want to play a Rogue who uses Daggers for assassinations but can hold her own in normal combat by wielding a Longsword? Do you want to play a Warrior who's only goal is to destroy people in insane combos with a sword that's twice their size? If you answered yes to any of these, please keep reading.    -> Each class has a set of weapons and armour associated with it, as well as abilities. A Rogue, for example, is built on skill points invested into Finesse and uses light/medium armour that gives bonus critical hit damage. Rogue weapons are the Bow, Daggers, and Faeblades. Their abilities are varied between sustaining mana to apply poison damage to all of their weapons to raining arrows from the sky.    -> The Warrior class is built on skill points invested into Brutality and can use Longswords, Greatswords, and Hammers with the heaviest armour that improves damage resistence and blocking ability. Their abilities vary from an adrenaline surge to deal massive damage when close to death to lifting all surrounding enemies into the air and slamming them all down.    -> The Mage class is built on skill points invested into Magic and can use Staves, Septres, and Chakrams with Robes for armour that help improve mana regeneration. Their abilities can vary from chaining lighting to summoning a meteor to crash down on enemies.+Gives the middle finger to restricted builds with the Destiny system.    -> You are not set to one way of playing the game. Just purchase a reset from a Fateweaver and suddenly, you can rebuild your character in their entirety! Go from a Mage in robes with a Staff and Septre to a hybrid Warrior/Rogue who uses a Hammer and Faeblades! (Keep in mind that there are many abilities to each class and you can do more than one class, or even all of them at once if you wanted. When you level up, read up on everything in your abilities tab and decide how the game should work for you.)+Super satisfying stealth gameplay.    -> Say you were spotted by a Jottun (a reverse Dwarf as I like to call them.) You can teleport through them, throw a smoke bomb down, jump on their back from stealth, and stab their neck to oblivion only to backflip off as you watch them bleed out. It's not just the massive enemies that are satisfying to stealth kill! You can sneak up on a Bandit and in quick succession you can trip them, making them land on their back only for your character to cover their mouth and stab their chest. The sneaking mechanic itself is a little bit wonky but oh my gosh it's still amazing to assassinate half of a Tuatha scout party and have the last few left ♥♥♥♥ talk you only to get torn to bits by open combat; speaking of which, my next point is close to this one.+Fluid combat system.    -> My favourite build was on my character named ""Lorabella."" She was a Warrior/Rogue hybrid that used a Longsword and Daggers. In the span of a minute, she can roll behind an enemy in stealth, backstab them, and immediately turn to the other enemies that spotted her afterwards. From here she can toss a smoke bomb or use an invisibility potion to get more stealth kills, or she can hold a weapon's attack (you can only equip two weapons at a time) and use the charge ability to launch herself at the nearest enemy, starting an attack combo which kills them quickly. After that, she can block with her shield at the right moment to deflect an enemy's attack and turn it into a combo to kill them quickly. I could go on and on about how many different ways you can play the same game and still be satisfied, but I will spare you from that.+Fateshifting.    -> In a tight spot? Too many enemies and you just want to go to the next area quickly? Want to get bonus XP for doing what you already do to kill enemies? Just do it™+Fast Travel!!!    -> Seriously who doesn't like this feature?Some cons: -The game can feel very repetitive.    -> Bandits, Fae, some Gnomes here and there, Jottun, Etten, Spiders, Kobolds, and so on. There's not much for diversity in enemies to face, some are just slightly different reskins of the base creature that does something different. See: Kobold Savages are Kobolds that throw their spears instead of try to poke you with them.    -> A lot of the game's quests are a variation of ""go here and kill these things for me"" and while the combat system is very fun, there's only so much that can be done before it feels like a chore. -Short story.    -> Excluding the time spent running to the new locations, the Faction quests as well as the main quests feel a little short compared to the size of the world given to the player.(Overall, I would say this game is absolutely worth buying. I haven't gotten to the DLCs yet though I do look forward to it! I hope this review helped!)-KEM			"

 Currently at the time of reviewing this game it is on sale for $5 and all of its DLC $6. 	This game is definitely worth the price because of two reasons:1. The Combat2. The time it takes for completion  $5 = atleast 5 hours but in this case you get 200PROS +AMAZING COMBAT - Its combat is truly amazing it has great fluidity and just overall is extremly fun without getting boring. I just wish there were more skills for me to try.GRAPHICS - Although this game was released in 2012 its graphics still look good with a really colourful environment.OPENWORLD - Just a really nice touch for an rpg.LOOT - One thing that has always attracted me to rpg's is the loot/ special items you can find in them. KOA Reckoning does a phenominal job with having tons of  rare accessories, weapon and armor sets.TIME PLAYED - You can play this game for hours because of the sheer amount of quests and the size of its world.FACTIONS - You recieve special stuff when working with factions. The idea of factions is really cool and even though I like how you can work with all of them there isnt much story for them.REQUIREMENTS - Works great and doesnt require a top end gpu.CONS -STORY - Its story.... well all I can say is that it has one. The story is pretty lack luster and generic in my opinion and the npc's aren't really memorable either.CAMERA - You miss out on a lot of the beautiful environment because the camera angle is facing downwards on your character.RNG/BUGS - I've played through this game so many times looking for all armor sets but due to some unlucky bugs that make chests impossible to open I always quit halfway through due to frustration.BOSSES & Difficulty - The bosses in this game aren't really different from the monsters you fight regularily while playing through the game and the game itself is too easy even on the hardest difficulty._______________________________________________________________________________Overall this game is just great and  really fun to mess around in! I just wish that somehow, someway they can make a sequel to this game. "

Everything from the graphics to the skill tree system is incredible. The combat is a blast, especially using the chakrams.

												The game's pretty much a WoW clone single player (and with this I've covered a lot, cartoonish graphics, plenty of skills, and character skill customisation, and lots of loot to be found), so it depends a lot on your taste if you like it or hate it. The main story is interesting and the game has a lot of side quests to keep you going for hours. The problem with it also comes from it's WoW ancestry, after a few hours it'll feel like all the other mmo's out there, except it's single player. Detailed crafting sistem that allows you to make really powerfull gear. The shiny stuff however is restricted to loot only. If you're the explorer type, I have to say the game is beautifull with it's breathtaking sceneries.Overall good game.			"

												I am 100 hours into this game, and I can honestly say that I prefer it over Skyrim. The combat system is a million times better, and is probably the most fun weapons and combat system I have played in any rpg  played since atari 2600. From what I have read this game can be over 200 hours with dlc and everything and it is a blast. If you do not own it and you are a fan of rpg get it. The story line, combat, graphics, class system, everything is great. The only thing is, If extremely long games are not your thing, then avoid this, it is MASSIVE and will take a long time to finish. But if  a very lengthy, involved, well developed, fun, beautiful game is something you would enjoy then 5 dollars is a true steal.			"

												A really enjoyable ARPG with open-world feeling, crafting, and console-like combat. It would be easy for this game to fall into the trap of not doing anything well, but it's a lot of fun. There's some great voice acting with a pretty good story for immersion, satisfying combat and a decent amount of challenge. A ton of quests to do means you'll set off in one direction and get entwined in a town's story when you were intending to do something else, and that's a good thing. This is also the case with ""shinies"" on the ground - alchemical ingredients and loot chests. My path through the game makes me look like a drunken bumblebee.I highly recommend using a controller for this game - trying to use a keyboard gave me an epic frowny-face until I looked up whether it had controller support. It's much more intuitive that way, though you'll still need to glance at the controls listing from time to time when starting out.I received a bunch of OP-feeling gear when starting out, I think due to the complete DLC pack, but I happily received some upgrades fairly early on. Leveling occurs at a decent pace - enough to keep you feeling like you're getting somewhere, but not so fast you don't have time to stop and smell the roses.I almost feel guilty having gotten this game at 75% off during the Steam Summer Sale. This is a rare game that feels worth the retail price (especially since it was only $20 to begin with).			"

												The combination of rich lore inspired by Celtic and Gaelic mythology and the varied and engaging combat, I loved my experience in this game. I like the idea behind MMORPG games, but the execution falls short for me and the social component is more of a liability than an asset. Kingdoms of Amalur delivers on the promise of the MMO setting, and the ability to rebuild/respec your character from scratch was a great way to keep the experience fresh and engaging. While it doesn't warrant multiple playthroughs, once through gave me dozens of hours of fun and exploration. I just wish the player races had greater consequences.			"

												EDIT: After playing more, I can safely say I do really enjoy this game. It's very charming in its own way and the world is pretty big. At the time of this review I've played about 30 hours and I'm only level 10 and still in the starting land!There are some bugs, the camera angle can be annoying at times, auto target is a bit wonky, I really dislike the short render distance (it was ported from consoles so the textures pop in at short distances... just annoying) But overall this is an ""underrated"" game if I ever saw one. It's a slightly flawed gem that should have gotten more attention. I was very sad to learn the studios went bankrupt after making this game because it didn't sell enough copies :( If it had gotten more attention it would have been given the love it deserves. The guy who made this game put all his savings and time into it and it ""failed."" So sad.PROS:-Pretty big world with about 10,000 years of backstory/lore (literally)-Graphics actually look pretty nice-""Cartoony"" look sort of like Fable or Torchlight-Pretty good voice acting-SOOOO many quests and stuff to do! -Nice easy to learn skill system and flexible for any type of playstyle-Works 100% with a gamepad or controller (I myself use an XBOX controller)-RPG elements like a dialogue wheel and choices that affect quests/story-Unique story with a fairly interesting plot-Celtic mythology and lore which you don't see in many games(I myself am Irish so maybe I'm biased...)CONS:-Short render distance so textures pop in obviously all the time-Kind of weird camera angle FOV but there is a mod which fixes that-Some dialogue is a bit cheesy or repetitive now and then... but I find it hilarous :)-Silent main character... this is a con for me because it's quite awkward to have your character just stare at people during dialogue-Combat is a bit tricky.. sometimes it's difficult and sometimes too easy... Basic wolves and other ""fodder"" are the most annoying enemy in the game, while single bosses are easy peasy-Pehaps a bit too much reading, VERY dialogue and text heavy at timesI would still give it about an 8/10. If you like Skyrim, Fable, and Celtic mythology you would definitely enjoy this game :)			"

												An open world RPG with real-time combat and such a large indepth exp you will never get bored. But.... that does not mean its for everyone. It could be... but lets be honest... people get salty real easy these days.-lots of loot. Unique and Legendary items are everywere to be found and often well designed.-lots of quests. There a many stories to follow besides the main, and they follow the worlds tone well.-The main story isnt a life sim. Its not gonna rely on cheap ambiguety and bs to hold you. Its simple, fun, has a few twists that are reasonably predictable but fun. If you expecting DarkSouls or DragonAge then ♥♥♥♥ off and go play DarkSouls or DragonAge.-A simple yet well crafted skill-stat lvling system.-Item crafting, ranging from useless-overpowerd.-Combat is smooth and fun. Its got an arcade like feeling while still holding onto just enough depth to be a decent RPG. The abilities and skills, although based in commen ideas, are often presented in original ways.Now admittedly the game has a few middle fingers to spare. For one, theres no fireball spell... no thats a lie... theres no usable fireball spell. The NPCs get one. As well as a tornado and other stuff. They also get costums and one or two weapon types the player cant use. It doesnt break anything but its anoying... trying to think why the devs left that stuff out. Or why they left it in... for NPCs.I can understand NPCs, or bosses, having spcl attacks but the classic RPG Fireball. Its not even like its only one or to rare enemies either. Every enemy mage.All in all the games got a massive world, good story, and lots of fun combat to keep the average gamer going. I always reach a point where I need to put a game down and play something els, and although I have moved to other things, I never felt this game borring me. Maybe just me though...^_^9.5/10Note:-No co-op in a game this is perfect for it.-Although missions are fun and fighting is enjoyable almost everything is find and fetch or hunt and kill simple objective based goals. The story around said goals can be golden but, if you let it, it can turn into a grind. Not a 'hard' one mind you.			"

												The game is well-paced as an action RPG. But, because it was formerly an MMO in development, the whole structure suffers, somewhat, from a multitude of bland quests. Later in the game I've noticed some botched up voice acting too. However, these are just the flaws put up front, the game itself is glorious in it's features. The storyline also happens to be quite good, although the end is totally expected yet not disappointing in terms of combat. All things considered, the game is a long trek for completionists, one which I hope you will find enjoyable too. Have fun!			"

												A review for this game may be pointless now. But I feel I need to praise this game for the immense enjoyment I got out of it since purchase. I will say three very positive things about this game.1 Combat balance: While it is true this game is super easy past level 20 or so, the ""balance"" I am talking about here is the balance between warrior/mage/rogue play styles. Unlike many other fantasy type games I've played, where your mage character usually gets much less choice in equipment compared to warrior/rogue types, here in this game, mages have the equal amount of variety in both weapon and armor selection, and some of the mage weapons are the most interesting ones I have ever played in any game. Reversely, in many other fantasy games, while warrior and rogue characters got more choices in equipment, they got shafted in spells they can use, this is again not true for this game. The rogue and warrior have a lot of interesting abilities they can cast around just like mages. This balanced playing style makes all three schools and any combination of the three feel refreshed and extremely fun for the majority of the game. And if you are like me who feel mages should have as much choice in equipment as other characters you are certainly going to love this game.2 Art style: Kingdoms of Amalur is probably the most gorgeous game I have seen for a very long time. While many mordern games may have better ""graphics"", they don't necessarily look any prettier. I am in the camp that firmly believes a good art design and style is more important than graphics and constantly find games from 1990s look better than games released in the past 10 years. And while the very particular bright and colorful art style of this game may not be for everyone, it is definitely the preferred style for me. And the game maps is carefully designed so you end up in many majestic positions in game to appreciate the view. Each major city in the game is grand and elegantly beautiful, each region has its own unique charm while all look amazingly appeasing all the time. In summary I think the art style is perfect in this game, if you love it at first sight you will love it for the remainder of the game.3 Sound track: While not many of the soundtracks stand out on their own, the magic thing here is that each of them goes along perfectly with the scenary. Good soundtrack in video games enhances the atmosphere and by that standard each music piece in this game is considered superb. Whether if it is charm, grandeur, danger or mystery the music in this game brings the mood out perfectly.To sum up, this is one of the most fun and beautiful game I have played in a long time. I hope whoever read this review can enjoy it as much as I do with this piece of epic gem.			"

												I was wandering in a game store and picked up this for PS3 back in 2011. One of the best decisions ever.I know this game is not the best, but it's my most favourite RPG of all time, and I've been a long time fan of the genre.+ Good plot, not too complicated but still has its own complexity.+ At first I was a bit turned off by the cartoonish art style but it actually fits the game world really well.+ Beautiful music+ Huge map with lots of things to do+ Lastly, the combat system in this game is fantastic. Great variety of combat styles and they all fit with each other seamlessly. Until now the only game that could come close to this is Dragon's Dogma. + The factions in the game are very nicely designed. I really feel sad doing the quests of the House of Sorrows.+ The 2 DLCs are great, they add 2 very unique regions to the game.- There are quite a few game breaking bugs, as well as many minor bugs- The player character doesn't talk, thus making us feel a bit colorless. This is a common problem among the genre. Conversations are long and boring at times.- Monsters and loots are level locked the first time you enter a region. This discourages early exploring.Too bad we will never be able to see the sequel.9.5/10			"

												Essentially, this game is an EA verison of Elder Scrolls and just as incredible. I've only just begun playing this  game and I'm already taken in by it. From it's immersible gameplay to it's unrivaled scenery, the game is perfect, to say nothing of the epic weaponry. There are four races to choose from with each having it's own unique attributes and the choice of a deity to allign onself with or not at all. There are perks to choosing a deity. Also, like in the Elder Scrolls franchise, you may design your own character down to the facial tattoo, though the designs are less numerous than those in Elder Scrolls, meaning you can't adjust the eye width or scowl lines or anything of that nature. You can, however, choose your own destiny as either a Rogue, an Acolyte, or a Brawler. Overall, the game is an unbeatable 10/10 with it's amount of quests and side-quests. I'm only at Level 3 and I've already found three unbelieveable suits of armour, shields, and weapons. This game is well worth it's cost.			"

												Definitely one of the best ARPGs that came out recently.The combat system is really well done. Not only the control feels smooth, you are also given so much freedom to find your own play style. You can equip any two weapons and four spells at a time, and you can mix them however you want in combat. Not to mention the weapon crafting system and the gem crafting/socketing system that further enchance the customzation. Either you want to be Gandalf or Geralt of Rivia, it's all up to you. There are also classes, or Destinies, for you to choose and change at any time.One thing I don't like is the dodging. It's hard to find the right timing to dodge an incoming attack, at least for me. I think it is caused by the slight delay before your character makes a dodge, or I just suck at dodging. Hey, guess what, I can also block with my shield and it doesn't take a weapon slot.The blend of sword and magic and the stylish art style remind me of the Fable series. As far as combat goes, KOA:R definitely does it better than the Fable series. However I don't find KOA:R's story is intriguing enough for me. ""Wow your fate is blank"" ""You'll save the world"" blah blah blah. I still enjoy the gameplay, at least.One last thing, you can hide your helmet!! 10/10			"

												A main storyline playthrough of the game itself is only 26 or so hours. Why the ♥♥♥♥ would I say ONLY? The game has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (200+ hours) of content in sidequests and other content. 200 HOURS!! That's right, crazy. So you're sold on the amount of content, right? But what of the QUALITY. Well, I can confirm each quest, especially a ton of the side quests, has an interesting and unique story that fits into the huge ammount content in this lore filled world. Many of the side quests I've seen allow for alternate rewards and task changing interaction through fully voice-acted dialogue based around your pursuasion (charisma in other games) skill. (Making tue skill actually useful, unlike some games.) The character destiny cards systems encourages awesome hyhbrids of different combat styles and abilities from the three main branches where you can invest ability points. These cards are unlocked based on what trees you invest your AP to add bonus stats and even complete changes to your abilities to make yourself into the exact blend of abilities and strengths you desire.The combat itself introduces a number of skill based fighting mechanics that never seem to lose their weighty and epic feel. This is only added to in the fact that you can make any number of crazy class combinations to tailor your combat experience. Not to mention the weapon and gear options that are also complimented by the epic skills system.The complexity and depth added in the alchemy, blacksmithing, detect hidden, dispelling, lockpicking, mercantile, pursuasion, sagecraft, and stealth skills furthurs the great sense of benefit you get from investing in one skill each level. Each skill builds to greater perks as you invest furthur along in one particular skill, but the gut wrenching decisions you face in deciding where to invest next are what makes you realize the importance of each skill, and the role they serve.The progression of the game overall is at pretty much whatever pace you play at. If you want to rush to train for that next ability, do it. You will be fine, although you might want to bring some extra potions. If instead you want to do some side quests and join guilds for added benefits and rewards, do it. In fact, you can maintain a balance of both. The only qualm (not even that) I have is that if you progress to a furthur area and return to do some quests, they can in some cases seem too easy after becoming more powerful. Which, I don't see it really as a game flaw, because it is just the nature of the RPG genre. For example: after having defeated a dragon and then returning to kill some slimes of any typical rpg would be a walk in the park.I've been through just the tip of the iceberg, and there lies a journey of trials and triumph awaiting you. So,please buy this game, not for me, but yourself. You'll be glad you did.			"

												I heard allot of good stuff about this game. It was kind of like the epidemic of everyone telling you over and over again to watch Breaking Bad. ""You don't watch Breaking Bad!!! YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT!"" and from 100 different people each week until you finally just give in and watch it and realise what the heck you was missing! This game was like that. Every corner I turn I was hearing ""Have you played Reckoning yet??"" ""Dude you have to play Reckoning, Seriously!"" So I finally said heck with it and bought it. And there has not been one single shred of regret. You may know how it is to have a ton of games you have purchased in your steam library and you play one for a while and get bored and go to the next for a while. And with so many games you can't fully get into one certain game. And kind of wish you was stuck with just one game so you would be forced to enjoy it without feeling like you are missing out somewhere else. Well this game here has pretty much did that for me. Because there is no other game out there right now comparable to this so my Steam library might as well only have reckoning on the list. One of those games where you are thinking about it constantly when you are out of the house and soon as you walk in the door you push the button on the computer to get it prepped for some playage. If you are an RPG and or Hack and Slash fan this game will be your best friend. You will be buying the T-Shirts and watching youtube videos and drinking out of a reckoning coffee cup you purchased from china off ebay. It really is a great game. So stop reading this right now and purchase it so you can go ahead and get the download started. I love you...er...where did that come from...sorry..			"

												For 20 hours, I wanted to like this and tried as well. Eventually it became too hard to do so. The world is interesting, but there is too much lore and not enough drama and characterization. The choice of graphical style was very poor and is a complete mismatch to the fairly serious tone. Combat system, skill trees and many other things work well enough, but all collapses in face of the difficulty, or lack of it. It is simply impossible to fail in Amalur, and extremely hard to fall in combat. Crafting is so overpowered that loot becomes inessential and it is easy to kill everything with single clicks. Amalur is not moddable either. There is a difficulty mod, but it actually requires CheatEngine to use!			"

												I tried this game a bit and I can't say it's a bad angle although at times the camera annoyed me.What I will say about this game is this.  This game apperently came out around the same time as Skyrim and because Elder Scrolls always gets so much hype, people forgot about it I guess.Here's the thing though.  This is not a game you can compare to skyrim.  This is not a true RPG like Skyrim.  This is far more like Fable.Yes, I would definetly compare what I've played of this game heavily to Fable.  It's far more of an adventure style RPG like Fable and if you enjoyed Fable even a little bit but like me always wanted more.  Then I think this game is a good choice.I'm a bit of a loot snob and I prefer elder scrolls series for a few things, total customization, wide world map (this game has walls, lots of guiding walls like Fable does and like Elder Scrolls does not) and HEY, if that guy i just killed was carrying two sword a crossbow and chainmail armor, I want all of that, whatever he was saving for lunch, and the gold in his pocket.Because I am a looter.  Fable doesn't give you that much loot.  This game doesn't give you that much loot.(but hey, the gear is pretty wicked.)TL:DR, This game compares far more to fable then it does to elderscrolls. you like fable style games? buy this.			"

												It's a pretty average game. The Graphics and world building are top notch. The combat and balancing was unique but not fully engaging. It became monotonous and I just ran past most of the fights towards the end. I suggest this game to people who really like RPGs. If you don't like RPGs, I don't think there's much here you'll enjoy.The story and writing is a bit inconsistent. The sidequests are written brilliantly while the main story is rather dry. The combat isn't bad, but it's not good. It was never balanced properly. So your character will be OP for about 90% of the game no matter what you pick. Combat is more of a pacing mechanic than a  meaty gameplay element. You'll find yourself simply running past enemies to fulfill quests since enemies become time sinks rather than challenges.It was the quintessential mediocre RPG. Not too good, not too bad, with proper pacing so you never get stuck doing something you don't want to do.			"

												I absolutely love this game. It's easily one of my favorite games of all time and I'm still to this day disapointed that the company went belly up and there will never be anything else in this game world.I like everything about this game but the part that really makes it stand above and beyond for me is the combat. There isn't any one specific thing about it, it just feels good. It's fast, smooth, and flows. No matter if you want to go heavy melee, fast melee, bow, spells, or some combination of them all, it not only works but looks and feels good while it's doing it.The world, the characters, the story, the combat, I love it all.

												Even a few years after the release I still think that this game is among the best RPGs ever created for console and computer. The graphics plus characters are lovely and the world is as many-sided as it is dangerous. You can do a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of sidequests which sometimes makes you forget what you are supposed to do, but personally, I love that about my openworld RPGs. After 20 hours of playing this game (yet again since I started it when I came out but started over again here on steam) and completing all sidequests so far, I can say that this game is totally underrated and has a lot to offer.Personally I don't share the opinion that this was crappily adapted from the consoles. I've seen far worse adaptions over the years and it's really easy to get along with this one; of course, sometimes you might encounter situations in the menue where you definitely clicked on ""Load"" instead of ""Save"" but who the hell cares about that anyway. Go back and make sure you click the right one xD I haven't encountered any bugs or problems with the game so far; not now and not when I played it back when it was released for the computer.So anybody who likes RPGs and open-world and a ridiculously interesting story: You should really buy this!

												What great fun. Why did no one play this game? It's huge, beautiful, and has rewarding combat system. If you have been gaming for a long time it's best to start this on hard mode and forgo crafting armor/weapons. It keeps the game feelings more balanced and challenging through lvl 35. Story has been great.  You have your common tropes as with all fantasy, but there are many unexpected turns and vast amounts of lore.  It balances in the favor of the good storytelling.You should get this game.			"

												I picked this up during one of the Steam sales, but had passed on it a number of times prior because I had the impression that this was supposed to be a not so great game. I enjoyed it, and if you've played Skyrim to death and want something similar in a different setting, this should fit the bill. Lots of decent quests along with the usual grindy tasks as well.  However, the DLC is only so-so and does not come with a level cap increase, so only buy if it's really cheap and you just want to have more to do in the Amalur world. The combat is hack and slash style al a God of War and that ilk. Button mashy, but there are special moves and it's easy to pick up. This has more of a console feel to it than does Skyrim.			"

												Bargin from the sale, pumped only five hours into it so far. But i must say it plays very well. Warrior, Thief , or mage as your classes and they also do multi classing when you get higher in the levels , so you can build your own style with in the game. The story is easy to follow , with a strong back story that you can jump right into and feel apart of from the out set. Well done voice acting, on normal ive not died yet but the first play though i dont mind as you can increase that part in another play though.			"

												KINGDOMS OF AMALUR HERE IT COMES THE RECKONINGKingdoms of Amalur was a surprisingly good fantasy game. It has a fluid and fun combat system. It has a generic but decent storyline. But best of all, it has good side quests. Some of them are even more interesting then the main storyline at times.What I liked most about Kingdoms of Amalur, personally... was how you could build your character in whatever way you wanted. You were not tied down to any restricted class. But you could cross-class between three different trees. Don't like what you ended up doing? No problem. You can re-spec your character at any time during the game. Gold is no object, as there seems to be an over abundance of it in the game. I finished the game with over 6 million pieces of dosh. If that gives you any idea how much money you can make in this.The story goes like this. Your character gets killed doing something he or she shouldn't have been. You come back to life by some mysterious means... and you have the ability to control fate. Now it's time for you to go off and save the world. So yeah that's cool and all. We've heard this kind of plot before. But what is best about the game is the journey through it and the quests you undertake throughout. This game has good beefy side quests with rich story and characters. You wont be wasting your time like with a certain other game that just recently came out.. something with Dragons. Dragon Day I think it was called. Anyway, you'll find that there is a ton to do in this game. If you're a nut about completion this'll take you a good 100 + hours to complete. SO clear you calender, ya dig?Weapons are cool. Each weapon has its own unique style and use. I suggest dicking around with all of them and seeing what you like best. I personally enjoyed the chakrams cause you don't see them much in games, and the daggers because they're the only weapons you can do killmoves with on a sneak attack.The game has a big flaw however and this is one I don't usually complain about with games.. but it was too easy. At level 20... 40 being the max.. I was nigh invincible. It's too easy! I played on normal difficulty, so I recommend maybe playing on Hard if you're not new to RPG's and third person action games in general.The DLCs were both great. Teeth of Narnia & Dead Kenan & Kel had a great storyline and plenty of extra and new content. I'd totally recommend picking up the complete package when it's on sale!So am I missing something? Probably. If you have any questions regarding the game, let me know and i'll answer them post haste.Finale Verdict: (4.4 out of 5)			"

7/10As RPG's go, this one is sticks to a classic mold but mixes things up enough to make it worthwhile.The Good: Being able to mix and match between warrior, rogue and mage archetypes is probably the best part of the game. Few other games (outside of Skyrim, because that's in a league of its own) can deliver this well, if at all. Even the storyline plays into this aspect of the game which I found to be pretty damn clever. Plus, if you don't like your current skill set, you can pay some gold and change it. And the gold amount needed is relatively small considering your resetting your skills.The Bad: The voice acting is painfully bad in some cases which can be really annoying. Also, while the mixing and matching I mentioned above is great, combining classes (i.e. rogue and mage) can be a nuisance since it takes an excessive amount of time to get to the next skill tier. There is such a thing a TOO MUCH balance.The Ugly: I found the crafting system to be borderline pathetic. Minimal depth to it and using a skill doesn't improve it at all but merely gives miniscule generic experience. On another note, the quests often spread themselves out too much forcing you to traverse half the map to complete many quests rather early in the game.Long story short, if you want a fun, easy to play RPG with some unique quirks (good ones at that), then pick this game up!

												This game is a collection of many other games. Dialog like Mass Effect, Questing like an MMO, Story like Guild Wars 2,Exploration like Skyrim and combat like Vindictus ( There is probably a better example of this one ). There really isn't anything origional in there, but that is not a con. This game combined the elements of all these other games together into a very enjoyable experience.  If you liked any of those games you will like this one.Features -Generic Story ( I am a sucker for generic stories )Fun combat Quests that give excuses to go fight more stuffMaybe binary moral choice ( Good/Bad options are there but it isn't recorded as a stat like in mass effect )Easy to get overpoweredConsNo jump button, can't walk off most ledges. Hurts immersionDungeons feel exactly like skyrim dungeons with the expection of one key feature. Many small dungeons don't have a shortcut back to the start like there is in skyrim requiring you to backtrack your way out. Larger ones do have this shortcut. Keyboard controls work but change combat vs a controler. With keyboard you have access to more spells but you have to swap between weapons while on a controler you have a button dedicated to each weapon allowing you flow them into eachother smoothly but skills are access through an awkward RT + ABXY combination and are limited to 4. Game feels made for consoles but the port works fine. Controles are simplifed with buttons having multiple uses and the character draw distance being tiny. Game is no longer being developed.------------------------------Overall it is a very enjoyable experiance just don't expect anything earthshattering.			"

												A review for this game may be pointless now. But I feel I need to praise this game for the immense enjoyment I got out of it since purchase. I will say three very positive things about this game.1 Combat balance: While it is true this game is super easy past level 20 or so, the ""balance"" I am talking about here is the balance between warrior/mage/rogue play styles. Unlike many other fantasy type games I've played, where your mage character usually gets much less choice in equipment compared to warrior/rogue types, here in this game, mages have the equal amount of variety in both weapon and armor selection, and some of the mage weapons are the most interesting ones I have ever played in any game. Reversely, in many other fantasy games, while warrior and rogue characters got more choices in equipment, they got shafted in spells they can use, this is again not true for this game. The rogue and warrior have a lot of interesting abilities they can cast around just like mages. This balanced playing style makes all three schools and any combination of the three feel refreshed and extremely fun for the majority of the game. And if you are like me who feel mages should have as much choice in equipment as other characters you are certainly going to love this game.2 Art style: Kingdoms of Amalur is probably the most gorgeous game I have seen for a very long time. While many mordern games may have better ""graphics"", they don't necessarily look any prettier. I am in the camp that firmly believes a good art design and style is more important than graphics and constantly find games from 1990s look better than games released in the past 10 years. And while the very particular bright and colorful art style of this game may not be for everyone, it is definitely the preferred style for me. And the game maps is carefully designed so you end up in many majestic positions in game to appreciate the view. Each major city in the game is grand and elegantly beautiful, each region has its own unique charm while all look amazingly appeasing all the time. In summary I think the art style is perfect in this game, if you love it at first sight you will love it for the remainder of the game.3 Sound track: While not many of the soundtracks stand out on their own, the magic thing here is that each of them goes along perfectly with the scenary. Good soundtrack in video games enhances the atmosphere and by that standard each music piece in this game is considered superb. Whether if it is charm, grandeur, danger or mystery the music in this game brings the mood out perfectly.To sum up, this is one of the most fun and beautiful game I have played in a long time. I hope whoever read this review can enjoy it as much as I do with this piece of epic gem.			"

												Essentially, this game is an EA verison of Elder Scrolls and just as incredible. I've only just begun playing this  game and I'm already taken in by it. From it's immersible gameplay to it's unrivaled scenery, the game is perfect, to say nothing of the epic weaponry. There are four races to choose from with each having it's own unique attributes and the choice of a deity to allign onself with or not at all. There are perks to choosing a deity. Also, like in the Elder Scrolls franchise, you may design your own character down to the facial tattoo, though the designs are less numerous than those in Elder Scrolls, meaning you can't adjust the eye width or scowl lines or anything of that nature. You can, however, choose your own destiny as either a Rogue, an Acolyte, or a Brawler. Overall, the game is an unbeatable 10/10 with it's amount of quests and side-quests. I'm only at Level 3 and I've already found three unbelieveable suits of armour, shields, and weapons. This game is well worth it's cost.			"

												Definitely one of the best ARPGs that came out recently.The combat system is really well done. Not only the control feels smooth, you are also given so much freedom to find your own play style. You can equip any two weapons and four spells at a time, and you can mix them however you want in combat. Not to mention the weapon crafting system and the gem crafting/socketing system that further enchance the customzation. Either you want to be Gandalf or Geralt of Rivia, it's all up to you. There are also classes, or Destinies, for you to choose and change at any time.One thing I don't like is the dodging. It's hard to find the right timing to dodge an incoming attack, at least for me. I think it is caused by the slight delay before your character makes a dodge, or I just suck at dodging. Hey, guess what, I can also block with my shield and it doesn't take a weapon slot.The blend of sword and magic and the stylish art style remind me of the Fable series. As far as combat goes, KOA:R definitely does it better than the Fable series. However I don't find KOA:R's story is intriguing enough for me. ""Wow your fate is blank"" ""You'll save the world"" blah blah blah. I still enjoy the gameplay, at least.One last thing, you can hide your helmet!! 10/10			"

												A main storyline playthrough of the game itself is only 26 or so hours. Why the ♥♥♥♥ would I say ONLY? The game has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (200+ hours) of content in sidequests and other content. 200 HOURS!! That's right, crazy. So you're sold on the amount of content, right? But what of the QUALITY. Well, I can confirm each quest, especially a ton of the side quests, has an interesting and unique story that fits into the huge ammount content in this lore filled world. Many of the side quests I've seen allow for alternate rewards and task changing interaction through fully voice-acted dialogue based around your pursuasion (charisma in other games) skill. (Making tue skill actually useful, unlike some games.) The character destiny cards systems encourages awesome hyhbrids of different combat styles and abilities from the three main branches where you can invest ability points. These cards are unlocked based on what trees you invest your AP to add bonus stats and even complete changes to your abilities to make yourself into the exact blend of abilities and strengths you desire.The combat itself introduces a number of skill based fighting mechanics that never seem to lose their weighty and epic feel. This is only added to in the fact that you can make any number of crazy class combinations to tailor your combat experience. Not to mention the weapon and gear options that are also complimented by the epic skills system.The complexity and depth added in the alchemy, blacksmithing, detect hidden, dispelling, lockpicking, mercantile, pursuasion, sagecraft, and stealth skills furthurs the great sense of benefit you get from investing in one skill each level. Each skill builds to greater perks as you invest furthur along in one particular skill, but the gut wrenching decisions you face in deciding where to invest next are what makes you realize the importance of each skill, and the role they serve.The progression of the game overall is at pretty much whatever pace you play at. If you want to rush to train for that next ability, do it. You will be fine, although you might want to bring some extra potions. If instead you want to do some side quests and join guilds for added benefits and rewards, do it. In fact, you can maintain a balance of both. The only qualm (not even that) I have is that if you progress to a furthur area and return to do some quests, they can in some cases seem too easy after becoming more powerful. Which, I don't see it really as a game flaw, because it is just the nature of the RPG genre. For example: after having defeated a dragon and then returning to kill some slimes of any typical rpg would be a walk in the park.I've been through just the tip of the iceberg, and there lies a journey of trials and triumph awaiting you. So,please buy this game, not for me, but yourself. You'll be glad you did.			"

												I heard allot of good stuff about this game. It was kind of like the epidemic of everyone telling you over and over again to watch Breaking Bad. ""You don't watch Breaking Bad!!! YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT!"" and from 100 different people each week until you finally just give in and watch it and realise what the heck you was missing! This game was like that. Every corner I turn I was hearing ""Have you played Reckoning yet??"" ""Dude you have to play Reckoning, Seriously!"" So I finally said heck with it and bought it. And there has not been one single shred of regret. You may know how it is to have a ton of games you have purchased in your steam library and you play one for a while and get bored and go to the next for a while. And with so many games you can't fully get into one certain game. And kind of wish you was stuck with just one game so you would be forced to enjoy it without feeling like you are missing out somewhere else. Well this game here has pretty much did that for me. Because there is no other game out there right now comparable to this so my Steam library might as well only have reckoning on the list. One of those games where you are thinking about it constantly when you are out of the house and soon as you walk in the door you push the button on the computer to get it prepped for some playage. If you are an RPG and or Hack and Slash fan this game will be your best friend. You will be buying the T-Shirts and watching youtube videos and drinking out of a reckoning coffee cup you purchased from china off ebay. It really is a great game.

												Good graphics, nice music, varying enemy types, entertaining quest dialogue, nice skill tree and class/job system. It can get very dull after long periods of play in my opinion, I just thought it was slow paced at times. I found it hard to stay invested and interested in the story of the main questline or side quests. Combat is fun and somewhat simple and can get repetetive sometimes, but at the time I write this review I went full might skill tree, Warlord, so I have yet to experience the finesse and sorcery skill trees enough to adequately judge all combat styles in this game as a whole.PROS:Graphics.Gameplay.Good music.Varied environments.Large game map.Simple and easy ui (quest log, game map, inventory, junk tab, etc.).Lots of loot to dig through, if that's your thing (I know it's mine).""You are what you play"" class system. You can go full warrior, rogue, mage, or do a bit of all 3, or a bit of two. It's all up to you. Not to mention there's a lore based method to reskill your character; you don't have to make a new character to switch up your playstyle.varied quest objectives, be they personally engaging with the quest NPCs or having you run to the end of a cave and retrieve an heirloom (chances are you know the kind).CONS:Slow paced.Gets dull after extended play sessions (at least in my opinion).You can't abandon quests once you get them; once they're in your quest log, you're stuck with it.It's WAY too easy to get filthy rich in this game. Just loot every little thing you come across that you don't want and pawn it. Before you know it you'll be rich. Like, Bill Gates rich.If this game is on sale, definitely get it. I picked it up when it was on sale for just 5 bucks, and it feels like a steal.I'm no video game journalist, just a gamer. I would give this an 8/10.Replay value: moderately high.Hours played at the time of this review: 107 hours.			"

												Absolutely worth buying especial for its price, If your an RPG fan that likes unique and skilled base combat systems, and storylines that are not too huge with content (athough there is plenty of fun, amusing, and interesting storyline content in the game) The game has a huge open world with plenty of areas to explore and find, if you chose to do so. But still its a game you can put down and forget about and then come back and immerse yourself once again.			"

												If you enjoyed Skyrim or Fable, this is a mix between the two. So many quests that it's definately worth the price. I'm 15 hours in and haven't left the first section of the world map because of all the sidequests. Can't comment on the story long-term but I'm enjoying my experience a lot so far.			"
