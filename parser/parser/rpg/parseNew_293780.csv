Early Access Review
								I've never been much of an online multiplayer kind of guy, in my household we couch co-op and that's just always been our tradition. Playing side by side with friends and family, bulky plastic controllers in hand is a lost art and one that deserves a lot more attention. We've seen many titles try and bring back this passion for a more human gaming experience in the living room recently with successful titles like Nidhogg and TowerFall Ascension reminding us of that feeling of intense person-to-person competition and friendly rivalry we were able to get with console games in the past. With the rising popularity of online PC gaming where does this close and personal human interaction go, is there still room for the local multiplayer experience?Crawl thinks so, and it answers the call by pitting man against monster, friend against friend, in the darkest and nethermost of dungeons of the most replayable player on player brawler to date. You will die many times by the hands of your most trusted acquaintances but as Bram Stoker once wrote, ""We learn from failure, not from success!”The heavy, ominous chip melody evokes a feeling of terror and haste as the monsters swarm about the mortal player for their own chance at sweet humanity, and must tear it from the cold dead hands of their cohort before losing the chance to turn the tables. All sound direction is incredibly fitting, with voice samples sounding as if straight out of an authentic 80's pinball machine or arcade cabinet. Suspenseful horror aesthetics and the doom-impending tone of the music compliment the tension, chaos and madness of the multiplayer struggle for supremacy all too well.You begin by choosing one of the Gods of unspeakable horrors, determining which set of ghastly familiars you will be taking control of and leveling up throughout your mad grab for humanity. Blood is gained as you spill it from your human target to be exchanged for gold and used at merchants to buy an array of varied equipment and skills, ranging anywhere from double-daggers with fast speed but short reach to floating glyphs that fire lasers on your command. This puts a lot of motivation on the monster players to bleed the human as much as possible, in order to better prepare themselves with loot once stealing back humanity. Monsters themselves add one of the deepest layers of the game, each with branching sets of evolution trees to play around with. Evolving your monsters is dependent on Vitae which is acquired through enemy humans leveling up, and keeps the playing field between the two more or less balanced. Honestly, though, I don't think anyone is capable of explaining the mechanics as well as the trailer does. Before even getting a chance to sink my teeth into Crawls' gritty and visceral gameplay I couldn't stop watching the trailer, it sent chills down the spine. It's really the most captivating I'd seen in awhile and the narration nails the urgency of your doom-ridden quest. I had to know how such an effective voice actor was acquired. After questioning the developers on the subject, it turns out that the narration wasn't hired or professional help at all, but the contributions of a close friend they had previously worked with and this fact just fortified in my mind the strong bonds behind the creation of the game and it's origin of a personal and human nature. According to Dave, ""The voice actor from the trailer is a friend of ours, Adrian Vaughan. He’s a 3d artist who we met at the first game studio that Barney and I worked at together. He’s one of those guy’s who’s always putting on funny accents and I got him to do some voices for an adventure game I made for a competition (called The Unicated)."" Apparently they weren't expecting the trailer to gain as much attention and praise as it did for the game, as Dave goes on, ""We were incredibly pleased with how the trailer went, we had no idea if it would be received well or not while we were working on it. We thought it might be too long, or wordy, and it was difficult getting a balance of the tone and the explanation of the game. We’re so glad we did it that way now though.""Crawl clearly has some heavy retro arcade influences, and upon discussing the game with the developers the sources of inspiration were confirmed. ""For Barney, two big inspirations were Bomberman and Gauntlet, and they shine through in the gameplay most of all."" and with it's blend of the dungeon delving hack'n'slash action of Gauntlet and the rage-inducing competitive aspect of Bomberman, I'm inclined to agree that both of these examples shine through. He continues to explain, ""We’ve grabbed inspiration from tonnes of games though really, old RPGs like Legend of Zelda, the gothic tone of the first Diablo, and a bit of Dark Souls’ brutality to name a few."" All being perfect representations of where Crawl takes its grim and savage direction.This is a game that will bring together the most unsuspecting of players, serious-minded people who don't even game will forget themselves and get caught up in the blood-boiling clash for mortality. Not only does it bring friends together but it tests the limits of your friendship, edging you closer to feelings of vengeance on your once trusted peer. Similar to the feeling of having the excitement of 1st place in Mario Kart swiftly crushed and ripped from you by a friend lucky enough to get that one Blue Shell and take your place of glory, leaving you with nothing but the desire to track them down and kick their♥♥♥♥♥Crawl is a game made by friends, for friends. A multiplayer experience unlike anything seen since the 90's. A game made by two close compatriots who wanted to rediscover and reinvent what gathered them around the tube so many years ago. The kind of entertainment we've lost sight of after so many years of growing into adults, getting jobs and families, and in general forgetting what made us really have fun as kids.Despite being its best around warm-bodied experiences I can still wholeheartedly recommend the game even for those who might be too busy or too far from friends to partake in the multi-person mayhem. With bots and their adjustable difficulty, I was still kept on the edge of my seat during every attempt to steal the victory from the intelligent computer opponents. With even more balancing on the horizon as well as constant updates to content, and a serious community involvement from the developers on forums there is pure determination shown in shaping the game how players want and proves that Crawl is already one of the shining examples of Early Access done right.

								NO! NOT MY SLIME!!!This game, is simply fantastic. Its a simple concept, but its a good one. You and up to 3 friends will scramble to kill the hero, or stay alive as him. You will get better gear, evolve your monsters into stronger ones, and in the end, control or fight a massive boss monster. Its ok by yourself, I can recommend it if you dont have at least one friend to play with. But with a full group, prepare for yelling, insults and tons of good laughs. The only thing that kills me, is the lack of online multiplayer. If that was here, whats to stop this game from being the best game on steam? 10/10 would steal slimes again.			"

								The Recipe for Crawl goes something like this:• a dash of inverted D&D (one player, three DMs)• a sprinkle of Tag• a cup of Legend of Zelda• three tablespoons Altered Beast• 20 pounds of arcade nostalgiaThe goal is simple: kill the final boss and regain your humanity. However, there's only one soul to have and four greedy dead paws trying to grab it. Who has the humanity now? Everybody gang up and kill him. Killing blow takes the soul. This pattern repeats itself until somebody becomes powerful enough to face the final boss. Whether they succeed or not depends on the skill of all involved.This is some of the best couch entertainment I've seen in a while. It tickles my heart with its presentation, seeming so serious but hinting at its self-awareness.			"

								a perfect gaming experience hindered by just one drawback: lack of online multiplayer. However don't let that stop you from buying the game. it's perfect game for when you have people over, with immense replay value and surprises. I really hope the devs get to implement multiplayer access eventually. Very rarely a game does so many things right like whats in crawl.			"

Early Access Review
								Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!For the longest time now publishers and devs have decided that gamers no longer have friends in real life... our social gaming lives exist solely online. This has lead to the downfall of “couch co-op,” with many multiplayer games being released completely lacking any local multiplayer feature. It's time we say enough is enough! I still have buds over to play video games, real ones that stay too late and often drink too much (Hey Will! Sure, what kind of party would it be if you didn't vomit everywhere?).The devs of “Crawl” remember the yesteryear of “couch co-op” and they hear our cries. Like silent, brooding Batman-y types they're the heroes local multiplayer deserves; and they're paying an homage to classic, “Gauntlet” type dungeon crawlers. The concept is simple: you and up to three friends select a god to represent (you can also use bots that are HIGHLY competent). Each god represents different creatures you'll take the form of during battle so choose wisely. Then you're dropped into the first level of the dungeon. One player is the hero, the rest of you are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ specters of death who's sole purpose is to thwart the crawler with traps and dark symbols through which you become corporeal monsters. First player to kill the crawler becomes one themselves, and the cycle continues. Be warned: “Crawl” has friendship killing potential the likes of which haven't been seen since “Mario Party,” “Mario Kart,” and the little-known “Mario ♥♥♥♥s Your Friend's Mother.”Throughout each dungeon you'll gather gold to spend on upgrades and weapons. As you clear each section you'll use vitae gathered to “evolve” your monsters, branching off into more powerful ranged, magic, and warrior types. Each level also features an ominous Stonehenge-like monument pulsating with blue magicka that unlocks the final boss once you or one of your former pals reach level 10. At that point you can choose to face the big baddie. You'll get a cool battle strategy hint in the boss fountain room before entering the arena. Each of your friends (and bots) will possess the boss, working in tandem to stop you from winning by using a variety of attacks. Assuming you win it's game over, you won! Assuming you lose another friend gets a shot. But each time you face the boss you do damage to the monument and if no one wins you will all game over.“Crawl” is beautiful, stylish, and a blast to play. The monsters are really cool, the music is most excellently retro, and when playing against three friends (or AI bots with the difficulty increased) it is a challenge. The devs (now famously) sent out a cool apology gif when they had to delay “Crawl” briefly – which to me is a good indicator that they will work with the community to continue expanding and polishing an already excellent core game. ALAS, I have one major gripe. It isn't a deal breaker, not for me anyway. But at the moment there is no ONLINE multiplayer. Now I know what I said earlier. I miss the bygone days of local mutliplayer and I'm happy to see it as an option. But I still have lots of friends I want to play this with online, ones that live far away in mythical places like California and Canada. I want to live in a world where I don't have to choose. I want both, perhaps greedily. Hopefully we'll see it implemented. Otherwise keep in mind this is Early Access. At the moment there appears to be one final boss and only three deities to choose from. But what is there is highly polished and very fun. They'll be adding more end bosses and deities throughout development. I also hope to see more variety in the dungeon layouts and color schemes. But as it is this is an excellent title. For ten bucks I easily, heartily recommend this.Reviewer's Note: “Mario ♥♥♥♥s Your Friend's Mother” probably doesn't exist. Probably.			"

Early Access Review
								This game by far is the most original game that I have seen ever since before games became re-hashed and ruined by franchise!  I saw this game on greenlight awhile ago (love at first sight), and I instantly wanted it. this game totally packs a new kind of competitive gameplay into dungeon crawlers. What is this game? it's multiplayer 1vs3 dungeon crawl, where 3 people can be the dungeon masters and one person will be the player; Here is the twist though: Once you kill the player you ""steal"" the players humanity and become the player yourself (the killed player becomes a dungeon master); which is totally new compared to the typical co-op experience you get in rogue-like games.  The goal of the game is to level up and gear up untill you can face the final boss. Whoever kills the final boss or has the most xp will win.  Another cool feature is that you can level up the enemies you can spawn as a dungeon master with a currency called vitae, which is gained by other players leveling up (Very good balancing technique, people who cant kill the player and remain at level 1 will gain more vitae than the others, so they can make their monsters super OP and finally kill the player). You can also collect small brown blobs that charge up the dungeon master's skill, and be able to summon slimes. However this game is not complete, and is still in early access; It also only supports local co-op at the moment (Not LAN co-op, its couch co-op), so For people expecting the multiplayer to be online should wait a little untill the developers can add it.  My score for this game is a definite 10/10, and it is completely worth spending $10 on.How can this game improve?-ONLINE MULTIPLAYER: in my opinion online multiplayer is this game's key to becoming even better. Even if it is peer-to-peer/Direct IP entry multiplayer, it will still be a major step for this game's future. I know Powerhoof said that multiplayer MAY be added later, but I do not feel comfortable with ""may"".  From what I've seen from powerhoof's website this is their first major release, and pretty much all the other games they released were point and click adventures. It's likely they are unexperienced with networking a game, and I dont blame them (I dont know how to add multiplayer to a game). I wish for the best they can get the help they need to eventually break through this barrier and add the feature this game would be perfected with.-MORE SPAWNABLE MONSTERS: (maybe make several more monsters with different upgrade trees and have them randomly chosen when you choose which deity you worship).-MORE SKILLS FOR THE GHOSTS: The dungeon masters/ghosts skill could be different for each deity (current skill just spawns slimes after you gather enough brown orb things). Some examples: Choosing Murkan gives you the ability to summon red crystals and traps, also blocks all the doors in the room, Choosing S'hrim gives you the ability to summon zombies/skeletons that do poison damage, and Choosing Teok gives you the ability to summon slimes/or maybe dwarfs with red cone hats :P  .-MORE BOSSES: (could have them choosen randomly once you enter the boss portal).Ideas include: Hydra: it lurks in a cave inside of a pool of water. maybe a plant boss of some sort who can roots come out of the ground and stab the player, (it would be in a forest-like cave).  Another boss could simulate games where you keep running right (the boss tails right behind you as you run) untill the boss is dead (similiar to the wall of flesh in terraria).-CAMPAIGN MODE: let the player set the number of floors (10,20,30) before starting. after every 5 to 10 floors a portal will appear that lets you teleport to the boss which will be randomly chosen; after beating a boss in their respective lair a staircase will appear allowing you to continue,at the final floor there will be a giant red door which will lead to the final boss; the final boss will not appear in arcade mode (arcade mode is the original gameplay that you guys can play right now).  There would only be 3 tries for each boss (boss is still controlled by the ghosts (dungeon masters).  The bosses difficulty scales as you continue going down the floors (more health/damage).-A POINT SYSTEM: this would be shown on the screen (for campaign mode and arcade mode), to be honest I do not like that the points are completly based on gathering XP which pretty much makes everything you did as a dungeon master pointless (pun-intended).  Points Should be added once you get xp and kills.  Each XP orb gives (1) points, every time the human player hits a monster he gets (1) point, points should also be given for damaging the human player in any room; this system would be similiar to how the blood currency is distributed - Example: 1st - most damage dealt (75)points, 2nd (50)points, 3rd (25) points, 4th - least damage dealt (0)points), killing a monster gives (25)points.killing a player gives(100) points, killing a player with a trap gives (150) points, and lastly killing a boss gives (400) points.  This makes it so that even if you didnt kill the boss you can still win first place. The point counter would be shown at the top of the screen, but would be small enough so that it doesn't block any view of the game.[optional] A message could be displayed under the players point interface, announcing why they got the points.-DIFFERENT PORTAL MECHANICS: Don't have the portal generate on every floor, and make it so portals dont appear untill floor 5. It's kinda annoying when BOT's fail the boss, and just end up fighting him again on the next floor. Also If a player fights the boss already and loses he should have to wait a certain amount of floors before being able to fight it again (lets say 3) this way it gives the other players a chance to fight it if they are not level 10.-MORE TYPES OF TRAPS: (Poison darts, mine launcher, spike floor where spikes pop out of the floor when the ghost activates it, and a trap that shoots out acid that remains on the floor for a bit.-DIFFERENT RED CRYSTAL MECHANICS: A higher chance for red crystals to spawn in a room with traps, and a chance for red crystals to Re-appear in rooms if the player were to enter a room he has been in more than one time. (sometimes BOT's tend to run around FOREVER, and traps don't work well if the player can just run through the room which leads to this situation: The second you posses a trap the player has already left the room).-MORE ARTISTIC VARIETY: as you go deeper into the depths the floors theme should change. As for what you could do I have a few Ideas. A floor everything is slightly dark and is illuminated by candles (the player and enemies will have a dim glow around them so the players can see where there characters are) The pentograms will also have a red glow. Different themed floors will change the look of the enemies slightly (different colors that match the floors theme). -MORE DECORATIONS: Pictures, procedurally generated furniture, knight statues, sword racks, etc.-HERO CUSTOMIZATION: this game could have 3 different hero classes. The customization options (vanity) are unlocked after completing challenges (ie: kill 50 enemies to unlock the beholder mask).  You will also be able to choose your class and how your hero will look before choosing which deity to worship (which monsters you will have).Well This is about everything I can think of that can be added or improved, I hope you can take my review to heart and add these features in the future even if not all of them.

Early Access Review
								One of the best local multiplayer games ever made. My friends and I have played this almost every week without fail since launch - it's that damn good. When we meet new people who claim they're into games, we vet them on this and see if they have fun or can appreciate the depth of game mechanics. We love this game because there's nothing like sitting shoulder to shoulder with a pal and howling with rage at a stolen kill, laughter at a horde of slimes causing a human to suddenly play a Shmup, or roars of hype when a close bossfight comes down to the wire. My short recommendation for this game is BUY IT. But now let's get to why you should.CRAWL is a local multiplayer game that involves between 2-4 players. One player is a human, and the other 1-3 are monsters. Every time a monster kills a human, whether it being done as a monster, as a possessable slime, or a controllable trap, that player will become the human. This has to be done on a last hit. This means that the three non-human players must work in a loose alliance until the very last minute, because there can only be one human!The other gameplay mechanics are a bit more complicated than that, and I'll explain the most complicated one, the leveling system and the asymmetrical nature of the players:-A player possessing a human can kill monsters to gain XP and continue leveling up. This primarily adds extra health and to the human and gets the player closer to a boss run, since only characters with level 10 or higher can do boss runs. Humans get better gear and stats by accessing shops. They use gold that they gain primarly while being a monster (I'll get to that later)-Nonhuman players control ghosts most of the time. Ghosts can possess pentagrams to spawn as monsters and fight the humans. They can also control traps or collect ectoplasm while they're in Ghost mode to drop slimes, which are weak, autonomous/controllable monsters that can be dropped at any time. This is useful for trapping a human in a room, since humans must kill all monsters before leaving a room. Slimes aren't too strong on their own, but if the human's health is low, and/or the room is full of traps, they can be utterly devastating. All players can level up their monsters at the end of a round. Nonhuman players can also all control a boss monster Voltron-style, with each player controlling a limb or head and working together to kill the human.Now here's what keeps this asymmetrical gameplay balanced from a progression standpoint. As other players level up their human forms, all the other players get ""Wrath"", or monster XP. So as any given player human(s) get stronger, the monsters of the other players get stronger. This keeps the players' monsters roughly scaled with players' human forms, and it means that people who are especially good at playing only humans or only monsters may be in for a dramatic uphill battle once they get out of being a human/monster for an extended time. Also, while players are monsters, they gain gold by hurting or killing the human. HOWEVER, this gold can only be used when you're a human! This means that someone who's been a monster for a long time will most likely have strong monsters, a lot of gold, but low human levels. Even if you can buy out the shop, you'll still be a pathetic creature of flesh until level up or reach the shop to get some assistance.There's a lot more stuff going on here as well. Single-fight upgrades that require slime/gold/human health sacrifice, spells, dodge rolls, blink teleports, poisoned food, magic staffs, frog hexes, cursed weapons (that make you insane), repeating crossbows, Gabe Newell, I could just keep going on and on. Let's just say there's a LOT of content packed in the core game, and different human/monster builds play very differently from each other. There is also a ingame database to keep track of all the traps, monsters, and items, and even a monster/boss duel mode, where you can practice as a human or as a monster to improve your skills.The only drawback I could say about this game is the fact that it doesn't have online multiplayer, and that it is quite different in terms of gameplay flow when you get started for the first time. The online multiplayer aspect is not a big deal. This game plays at a fast, almost twitch-like speed, and lag would utterly ruin the experience. As for the gameplay, a gross approximation I would make is classic Zelda crossed with Dark Souls, but the monsters are hilarious jerks because they're your friends sitting next to you! But really, it's a bit of a gross approximation - CRAWL is one of a kind. And the devs are great guys. They provide substantial updates to this game - not very often, but it's only 2 guys and they take the time to address balance issues while adding content during updates. They'll even talk to you on their Facebook page and respond to emails you send them. I'll say this though: if you ask them about online multiplayer, they'll tell you that they'll finish the game first then add it later, so don't get your hopes up.Anyway, get it, my personal GOTY every year since it launched because it's just so damn fun.

Early Access Review
								Crawl is a roguelike game that is being developed by the Australian team, PowerHoof. This game was put onto Steam's early access list in August 2014. The developers are very active with producing updates and content for the game, as you can see by their updated blog - http://www.powerhoof.com/Whilst I try to steer clear of Early Access games, and especially reviewing them, I decided to break my trend and try this game out as it was one I have been following for a while now. Crawl can be played single player, or with up to four people on local co-op. I have only played single player so far, so my review will be solely based on that.  One of the players will control the hero, and the others will be in control of ghosts. The ghost's aim is to kill the hero, they can do this by possessing traps in the randomly generated dungeon the hero is crawling through. Ghosts are also able to spawn into demons and monsters in various rooms.  The hero will gain experience points by killing monsters put before him, more experience means more health and more damage. The hero will also find gold, which can be used to purchase new weapons, items, potions and special abilities.  Once the ghost manages to kill a hero, they swap roles and you rinse and repeat. Monsters which kill the hero will be rewarded with Wrath points, these points can be used at the end of each level to level up the monsters to be able to do more damage and gain more powerful abilities. The traps found throughout the dungeons can vary from bouncing spike walls, to bolt arrow turrets. All of them provide a sufficient threat for the hero, since they can't actually be destroyed, all the hero can do is escape to the next room. Unlike the monsters, where the hero has to clear the room before being able to move on. Crawl uses a nicely presented pixel style art which has a nice charm to it. Whilst it is more pixelated than most games that use this style, it actually looks a lot better than most of them. It gives it a feel as if you are playing in an arcade, with the Metal Slug style character selection screen, and the health bars at the bottom for all the players. I really enjoyed the look of Crawl, even though it's using a style which is growing very thin in the PC market at the moment. From what I have seen so far, there is no story behind any of the game, purely focuses on the gameplay elements. To begin with, Crawl is a very hard game to get to grips with. There isn't an easily find-able help menu or tutorial, and you are kind of just left to figure it out on your own. Whilst this can be done after ten or fifteen minutes, it would of been nice to get a proper introduction to the game. Since I was playing on single player mode, and was up against the AI all the time, I managed to breeze through the levels with hardly any difficulty at all. When it comes to purchasing items from the shop, the AI just seemed to pick things at random, whether they are worse than what they currently had or not. Maybe this is something which can be fixed in up coming updates.  I would anticipate the multiplayer mode to be where a difficulty curve takes a large rise though. All of the dungeons in Crawl are randomly generated, so I can't really say much about the level design, but what I can say is that all the rooms are still interesting to be in, they have a large selection of breakable objects, some of which will hold extra gold, there are normally one or two traps in each room for the ghosts to poses, and there are normally, two, if not three, summoning ports for the ghosts to take control of one of their minions or monsters. There is a huge amount of replay-ability to be had with Crawl; I am about two hours into playing so far, and I am barely scratching the surface as to the amount of gameplay there is. Each time you finish a run, you unlock new weapons, items and abilities to use, making the next run you play completely different to the last.  I would absolutely love to see some sort of online multiplayer added to this game, limiting it to just local multiplayer seems like a silly idea to me, especially if you are putting your game on Steam. It could so easily be integrated with Steam's servers and made to be a fantastic online multiplayer experience. I had no technical issues whilst playing the game. A controller is highly recommended, as most rogue-likes go, it is increasingly difficult to play these games on a keyboard. To conclude, since Crawl is still an early access title, I am simply going to recommend it, but verging on the side of caution. Whilst the devs are still updating the game currently, early access games always run the risk of never being completed. However, the game has a low enough in price to allow you to take that risk with the knowledge that you are easily getting your money's worth as things stand at the moment. If/when this game gets a full release, it's easily going to be a game you'll keep installed ready to launch when you have friends over. Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

								Crawl: Antagonistic Cooperation	If you’ve never heard of Crawl, stop what you’re doing and run, don’t walk, to youtube and watch the trailer. It is the best trailer for any video game I have ever seen. Don’t worry I’ll wait.No seriously, watch it.If you have no idea what kind of a game Crawl is, let me tell you…Crawl is a four player local co-op dungeon crawler. One player is the Human and the other three are the Monsters. Simple concept. Amazing execution.You might be thinking, “One guy is the Human? Sucks for the other three!” Not really.I’ve had the game since Early Access release (August, 6th 2014), and in that time I’ve learned this game is fun by yourself, but it shines when you have four living breathing people to play together. It is a lot like Super Smash Bros: great by yourself, but best with friends. And it’s completely possible to have a wonderful time never even playing as the Human. The Monsters are that interesting and fun.As the trailer showed (seriously you should watch it), when a monster kills the Human their ‘Humanity’ is transferred to the killer. Just like how gold is awarded in DOTA, rage upon last hit stealing is also included, which ensures everyone is going to be the Human at least once per playthrough. And as the Human player(s) level up, everyone else gains ‘Vitae’ which is used to level up your Monsters, ensuring there is always a challenge. In some cases, Human players will take an early lead and level up too quickly, causing the Monsters to scale up faster than the player can cope. Meaning at level 10, Humans might have a similar experience to a player at level 1 (they can still get their teeth kicked in with relative ease). There have been many cases in which I’ve skyrocketed to level 6 or 7 and suddenly I’m fighting all 2nd tier Monsters with starting gear. This usually ends how you would expect; weeping in the fetal position. The only way to actually gain gold is to draw blood as a monster. Mechanically speaking, that means damaging and/or killing the Human. This creates a desire to play as both the Human and the Monsters. The only way to improve your Human is, ironically, to hurt and kill other Humans. Many times I have thought “I wish I had blood” whilst doing my best to prevent the others from taking my Humanity. In my experience, you almost always feel like you’re about to die when playing as the Human. And when playing as the Monsters, you’re working with your friends one minute and then actively working against them the next. The fluid nature of the cooperation in this game is amazing. There is nothing else like it.The main goal of the game is for the Human player to reach level 10 as quickly as possible, find the Eldritch Stones, and challenge the boss. If they win, they win! If they lose? They have to continue further into the dungeon with about 1/10th of their HP. After a total of three loses, the current Human loses the game. They’re ‘CONSUMED FOREVER,’ and the game deletes their account.Dark Souls would be proud.There is never a dull moment when playing Crawl. Whether you’re the Monsters or the Human, there is always pressure. If you wait too long, the Spirits will collect ectoplasm and summon blobs on you. There’s nothing worse than fighting tooth and nail to get through a room only to have all of your buddies summon nine blobs to finish you off.  Trying to fight three other players who are working together to kill you but against each other to kill you first… is very hectic. And with so much happening on screen, it can be difficult to keep track of who and where you are. For the most part, it isn’t too hard to parse your position. It’s definitely harder to find yourself after you’ve lost track than it is to lose track in the first place. Perhaps something like an aura with your color could be added? Losing yourself aside, Crawl has an incredible lo-fi feel, while still letting you know it’s a modern game. The sprites are evocative of older games, yet they still feel fresh, new, and lively. The animation is fluid. The colors are deep and have good contrast (Thanks to the v0.3 Plague Mushroom update, released 1/15/15). Seriously, this is some of the best pixel art I’ve experienced. Also the music is superb. That’s all I really have to say. It’s great.Overall, Crawl is an exceptional game with great gameplay, amazing art, and outstanding music. It’s simply dripping with flavor. Powerhoof managed to cram so much style into a “simple” game. It is refreshing, fun, and one of the best $10 games I’ve ever had the privilege of purchasing. Buy it and play it with all of your friends.The dudes over at Powerhoof are going places. They have created such a great game and deserve more recognition.And, seriously, that trailer was amazing.Like this review? Check out http://100hoursave.wordpress.com/ "

								Since I don't have friends to play this with I was a bit afraid to pick this one up. I read a lot of reviews and only a few of them mentioned the solo play but I decided to take a chance on it anyway. I am so glad that I did! This game is great, even for solo play. I highly recommend it.It can be a bit confusing at the start but I found reducing the number of bots to 2 and learning on easy made all the difference. If you are like me and are on the fence about buying this because you dont have anyone to play with, do  yourself a favor and get it.There are only two major cons:1. No online play2. Floors look too similarIf those two items are addressed this would be one of the greatest titles I've ever played.			"

								You may be thinking, ""Hey, my life is depressing and I don't have any friends. Is this any good single player?"" As someone with a bleak existence also, I can say yes. This game is great Singleplayer.It's got a lot of replayability, even with single player, and the pixel art is phenomenal. You unlock more items, enemies, and weapons as you play, making the game better the more you play it. Despite the simple controls, the game is ♥♥♥♥ing hard. The only thing I'm good at is gaming. My social skills suck,  and all my experience gaming and stroking my ginormous yet lonely pickle has never quite managed to get me a job, so i've had a lot of time honing my skills. I still struggle to beat this one.Overall, buy this thing, even if you're lonely. You won't regret it as much as you regret your life.			"

												Get your friends and play Crawl with them. Make new friends and play Crawl with them. If people come to your home and you do not play Crawl with them, you will have failed each other on a deeply personal level. This game is amazing. Play it against bots if you have to. The sense of overwhelming tension and the nimble responsiveness of the action already set this game above most other 2D dungeon crawlers, but the attention to detail and tightly-balanced leveling system mean that in Crawl, it's even fun losing.This game is amazing. Play it.			"

								Crawl is a unique experience that can only be described with one word. Awesome.This dungeon crawling masterpiece is incredibly fun to play. I love playing it so much. Here's why:-Radomized Dungeons: Each time you play the game, you get something different. Even the textures on the wall are different each run.-Wide Variety of Weapons: There are lots of different weapons to choose from, and not all of them are the same. There are heavy melee, light melee, ranged weapons, and magic weapons as well as various spells/abilities that can be aquired during a run.-Play as the Monsters: This game is meant for 2-4 players (I suggest 4 even if 3 are bots), 1 player is the hero while the other 3 are ghosts who can become monsters to try to kill the hero and take his place. It adds a unique feel to this game. -Multiplayer Mayhem: This game really is meant to be played by 4 people (even if can be played by 1), with 4 people this game becomes an all out brawl to become the hero and beat the boss to clear the game. It is an unforgettable experience to gather some friends and just play this game.Crawl is an amazing game and the devs should be really proud of themselves. I can tell that they put a lot of hard work and energy into making this game the best it can be. I really hope to see more content added to Crawl to make it an even better experience.			"

CrawlThis game is a refreshing entrant into the couch-multiplayer games genre.As much as these types of games are appreciated within the gaming community, Crawl offers something more unique that I personally had never seen before in a dungeon crawler. That is saying a lot, given how many of those types of games are on Steam alone.Unlike many of those games, Crawl is played out in a king of the hill style, with one player controlling the hero, and the other three controlling monsters and traps. Kill the hero: become him. This is a mechanic I had never seen before and am thouroughly impressed with how well it was implemented. It draws you in. The fights and tension between players is genuine, and when you find yourself shouting with excitement... or resentment, without even realizing it, that is a very good thing.The art is amazing. As someone who appreciates pixel art style, especially the retro, arcade-type pixelation, the art and animation immediately stood out to me. Very fluid and well done but at the same time still able to hold that nostalgic factor.The soundtrack, while limited, shines where it is implemented. A very omnious feeling throughout, and the tracks change appropriately depending on certain events such as a player approaching victory or entering a boss fight.The gameplay is well balanced and thought out, characters and monsters can be upgraded, and the rubber-banding is appropriate. Players can come back from any defecit at any point in the game.Overall OpinionThe game is a must buy in my opinion. It is best played with friends, but I have enjoyed several hours of playtime with the AI, which can give you a run for your money. Updates are still on the horizon at the time of this review, showing the devs really care about this game and its success. Their forum on their website posts upcoming updates for the game and gives players the oppurtunity to give feedback, which is a welcome stand-out from a lot of other developers.With more content on the horizon, Crawl is shaping up to be a very promising game. As of now even, it is definitely a complete, polished game worthy of many hours of playtime.			"

								Ok, so I've never done any review. Ever.But this game deserves it. So let's get started. First of all, what is Crawl? Like the name suggests, along with the pictures, you might understand that it's your usual dungeon crawler. But it isn't.It IS a dungeon crawler. But not in the likes of Diablo or Torchlight. It's more of a skilled-hack 'n' slash-dungeon crawler.And TBH, as a fan of dungeon crawlers, this is the best one I've ever seen. I might also add that I may have a little bias about it because of the god damned amazing music/teaser trailer. But I digress.As I've said before, it's not your usual dungeon crawler. And there's also another reason because of that. It's not open world and it's not story driven. It's an arcade game.And it does it really well. The game, as you may already know if you're reading this review because you want to be sure that the game is nice, is a local co-op/versus game.""But Baron! I don't have any friends! I'm a god damned loner!""Well they added some bots which you can play against for ""practice while you're waiting for your friends"". And they're also going to add multiplayer in the near future. So that's good. Because I'm also a loner. How's the gameplay? It's good, 10/potato.Just kidding. The gameplay is absolutely amazing, but to be played at its best you NEED a controller. Which isn't a problem FOR ME, but might me a problem for the people who can't afford to buy one. Any controller that is supported by steam will do. But personally I prefer to use a PS3 controller with the scarlet crush drivers.As I've said at the start of this review, the game is part hack 'n' slash. And it's a blast. The controls are responsive and easy to learn. It's literally just two buttons. I've never found myself saying ""God damn it, I didn't want to do that!"", if I died it was 90% of the times because of the skill of the bots or because I wasn't good enough.The only problem about it might be that they made the button to attack also the button to ""use"" stuff. I've found myself sometimes entering the final boss battle by mistake with little health remaining and dying by the hands of the bots controlling the boss. How are the graphics? Well, I really don't know, I don't have eyes to see a god damned PICTURE ON THE STORE PAGE. TL;DR? Do you like co-op fast paced hack 'n' slash dungeon crawlers games? Then this is for you, I guess, I've never heard of games like this, but whatever, everyone has their own fetish. Gib scor plz KK bb, from a scale from 1 to 10:Music: 10Gameplay: 10 [seeing yourself getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to death just to kill the same bot that killed you is an amazing feeling]Graphics: 10Overall: 10On a side note, it runs on my toaster, 10/10			"

								Amazing 4 player couch co-op game! When I first bought the game things seemed really chaotic and disjointed, but after about 5 minutes in-game things started making a lot of sense: You're basically playing a modified version of playground-style Predator vs Prey. One person starts out as the hero and the other three players (or AI) are ghosts that can inhabit deadly traps to attack the hero, or stand on a pentagram and become a monster with special abilities. The goal of the hero is to level up and beat the dungeon boss, while the goal of the ghosts are to collect ectoplasm to level up, kill the hero, take over his body and kill the boss. Along the way, you stumble upon shops where you can buy trinkets that give you buffs, or new weapons. Going deeper into the dungeon allows all players to level up their summonable monsters which evens the playing field between hero and ghost.The first time I got to play this game with three other friends was when I realized that this game was truly worth the purchase and the risk of buying an early access game. I tend to stay away from EA games unless I see that they have true potential of becoming a complete game, and this one definitely has it. If you're on the fence about getting this game, take my advice and BUY IT! You won't be dissapointed.			"

								The best local co-op game in my opinion. If you're looking for non-stop fun killing your friends and taking your throne as the ultimate friend, well this game is for you. Definitely worth the money you paid for this game.You can play with someone using only mouse and keyboard. Other than that is through the use of controllers.While you wait for your challengers, you can train against the bots and they are deemed quite powerful in the normal difficulty, how much more in the hard difficulty which is no mercy.There are also deity challenges that really measures your capability against others. One of it is the Glub where you only stick to one monster type and weapon in which you cannot evolve nor change weapons. Are you up for the challenge?I am keen and supportive to the development of the game because I am a huge fan of this game and to the team behind it. Updates take a while because it is only made by two people behind it but when they release it, it comes with a bang. "

								I'm having a blast with this game. I highly recommend this game to any arcade horror fans.Pros:- Really fun and original gameplay, even against bots.- Cool pixel art graphics.- Awesome monsters to level up and play as.- Great and diverse character animations.- The narrator's voice is awesome.- Good soundtrack.- Plenty of unlocks and character progression.- Monster battle challenge mode is fun.Cons:- No online multiplayer. In summary, even playing single player against bots, this game is a blast. Every run is different. The bots are very intelligent and challenging. Every aspect of this game is spot on. I would rate this game 9/10. This game would be one of the few in my library that would gt a 10/10, if it had online multiplayer. "

Crawl: Competitive Multiplayer RoguelikeGameplayThe gameplay is akin to The Binding of Isaac, you collect items in shops to further inhance your character whilst exploring a randomly generated dungeon filled with monsters, the difference being that it's a cometitive multiplayer experience, where you your friends or even cpus (which play near identically to a human) are ghosts fighting over a single human body, by killing the player in the human body you gain control of it and can upgrade yourself (each player has their own seperate pool of items).But how exactly do you kill the human as a ghost, well as a ghost you're able to temporarely control one of three monsters (the monsters you get depend on which god you pick), when you damage and get damaged by the human you gain blood which will turn into gold if you become human, if the human levels up you gain wrath which lets you make your monsters evolve after someone ends the floor, these mechanics allow someone to easily jump infront which leads to a constant intensity in the gameplay.The end goal is to defeat the boss monster, the boss monster can only be fought by a level 10 human, the boss monster is controlled by your opponets, whoever defeats the boss monster wins, if you lose you are still a human (you just have very low health), however there are only 3 total attempts shared between all players, whoever loses on the final attempt is the loser and the game ends.VisualsThis game has beautiful pixel art graphics which invokes a feeling of arcade cabinets from the 90's, every sprite is well done and fits the same theme, while there are flashes that might pose a risk to someone who is prone to epileptic seizures.AudioThe sound effects are very well done, all fitting the same theme.The music is amazing, it's very energetic but not overly so which is very fitting for the gameplay.PerformanceA potato could run this game with no slow down, it's barely intensive.Price EfficiencyThis game will last you at least 3 action packed hours just by your self, you'll get an extra 1 or 2 hours from playing with friends, but if you play one run every now and then by yourself it will start to add up over time, I've got 13 hours just from playing this one or two runs and then setting it down, for $9.99 (usd) that's an amazing deal.Scoring  Category Score   Gameplay 18/20   Visuals 19/20   Audio 20/20   Performance 20/20   Price Effiiency 19/20   Total Score 96/100 (this review was done as of version 0.11)			"

								Crawl is a great game, it has loads of weapons, items, characters and decorative pieces that you can unlock quite easly.Its a realy fun and competitive game to play with friends. I recommend it if you have many friends that can come over and play with you.The very few thing that I would like the devs to improve are:~The AI: I found the AI in this game to be to hard even on easy, i mean you can still beat it but i found that it made playing by your self less fun, I know that it is meant to be played with friends and that was alot funner so please ramp down the AI. I mean on easy there attacking the boss on level 2 and 3.~The multiplayer controls: For keyboard it was abit crowded as multiple keyboards cant overlap keys, that's fine because you can use controllers, the controllers were fine but I played it on my friends mac (xbox controllers dont work) so we all had to use the keyboard.Sorry i talked more about the problems, the game is great this review is more intended to tell the devs about some of the things that would make the game even better :)			"

I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to play coop all night long slaying each other and in the end coming victourous whilst you laugh at the demise of your friends who absouletly SUCK at the game.10/10 Easily one of my favourite games, and will always come back to it when I have mates over.

								Crawl is an incredibly fun multiplayer dungeon crawler, where you take control of a hero, or monsters.

			Genna plays Crawl. A dungeon crawler where you play as the hero, and monsters. Click here to Subscribe ► http://bit.ly/mrwssub...		

At the beginning, everyone selects what monster leader they'd like, which determines what monster minions they'll be able to use within the game. Once a game starts, one player is chosen to be the human hero. The other players start as ghosts, that can only affect the player through possessing traps around the dungeon, or spawning as a monster on a pentagram. All monsters have unique abilities. If a monster kills the hero, they will become the hero themselves, and transform the previous hero into a monster. If the hero kills a monster, then they will gain xp, as well as give ""wrath"" to the enemy ghosts. The ghosts can then use this to upgrade their monsters into evolutions with different abilities. This keeps the game balanced very well. A hero can use collected gold to purchase new weapons, spells and accessories at shops. The hero also uses xp to level up to level 10. Once that has been reached, a portal will open on the floor, and allow the hero access to the boss.Boss fights are interesting, because the enemy ghosts can take control of different parts of the boss. Shooting acidic balls out of one hydra head, or bubbles out of a tentacle.There's a lot to the game that makes it very interesting, and can be quite strategic if you really plan things well.It's a lot of fun when played with friends, although the AI is also quite competent.Overall, a great game!

								This is only an Early Access review for C.R.A.W.L., so please keep in mind that everything is subject to change. Hopefully for the better, because I don't see how this game can get any worse.In this 1 v 3 player game, there is only hero meant to save the world, until his jealous ghost friends stop him. The game fluidly changes from one human fighting off 3 ghosts who summon all manner of atrocities and thirst for his blood, to three ""friends"" partially wanting to help each other kill the human, but at the same time all those friends are just backstabbers.With only a dodge roll and sword to start with, dodging traps, buying equipment, crawling through dungeons, leveling up and fighting monsters controlled by other players (unfortunately, unless you are smart enough to just play with bots), playing as the human means juggling three different, unpredictable enemies and traps controlled by jerks who hate you and your life. It takes a certain amount of out-of-game problem solving to defeat/overcome the people pretending to be your friend: sometimes your opponents will say their strategy out loud to communicate to each other, but are they speaking in code? Are they trying to use reverse psychology on you (I mean the corner is totally a vulnerable spot right?)? Should you try to con them or will they see right through you? Are they whining about not playing as the human to trick you into losing? Can you just unplug their controllers or throw something at them? How good are you at throat punching? Should you practice throat punching more? Probably. All of these strategies take some serious pondering.On the business end of the human's bloody sword, playing as the three ghost is intense and gratifying. You can summon and possess all manner of colorful monsters with different play styles and strengths. At the end of every level you gain sweet, sweet hero's blood in order to upgrade these various monsters from lowly skeletons and rats into demon lords, dragons, and beholders (among others and more to come). When not completely wrecking your friend the hero's day as fiendishly awesome monsters, you can ruin your friendship by obliterating them with traps and summoned blobs that auto-attack but can also be possessed. While you are happily torturing the poor human you are becoming best friends with your other two friends who aren't a lame human: you are communicating strategies through eye blink Morse code, you are yelling out fake strategies to throw the human off, you are playing dumb to catch them off guard, you are probably even fake-choking to gain the upper hand. All is great, until you realize the human isn't your only competition. And when you realize that everyone in this house sucks at the Heimlich maneuver.Now you know that those other two ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are trying to take your rightful kill from you. What the hell is up with that? You were best pals just a second ago, you were like siblings, but now you deserve to be human and they aren't letting you. Now you have to try to trick the other players out of the kill by assuring them that you aren't going to unleash a fountain of fire in order to take the kill, maybe you pretend to miss all of your attacks right until that last sliver of health is begging you to take it.Then one of two scenarios happens: you get the kill and start the cycle of 1 human v 3 ghosts all over again, or someone else gets the kill and you kick them out of your house and refuse to speak to them again.I don't recommend playing Caustic Relationships And Wretch Losers (C.R.A.W.L.) unless you want to be alone. If you are already alone, the bots aren't so bad. At least they aren't a bunch of backstabbers. You can always count on red to be your friend....Seriously though, Crawl, at a most basic level, is incredibly interesting. Part co-op, part competitive, and all fun. It covers a wide audience range by being finely tuned for accessibility while still remaining flexible and deep enough for more serious players to give each other a good challenge. I eagerly look forward to all of the tuning and content updates will bring. "

								If what you're looking for is a medium for you and 1-3 friends' endless antics and shenanigans, with a backdrop of delightfully grimy pixel art and eldritch horrors which will never fade, you're looking for this. If what you're looking for is 20 to 30 hours of playing by yourself against three cpus to unlock new monsters, items and traps, followed by an amount of time entirely dependent upon your tolerance for feelings of utter loneliness, you're looking for this. If you're not looking for either of these things, you're not looking for this game.			"

								Crawl is worth buying, whether you're playing alone against the AI or with friends. It might not look like it, but even casuals can easily enjoy the game because the mechanics allow you to always be involved in the game play, and you are actually made stronger at times even if other players are doing better than you. Beating the game can range from 15-45 minutes, and other than randomly designed dungeons, the only differences between game plays is that additional items and other things will be unlocked each time you finish the game for next time.Video showing what the game looks like:

								Crawl is a beautiful combination of teamwork, skill, and luck.In Crawl, your job is to venture through various rooms, where you try to find monsters, which are spawned by other players. Upon slaying these monsters, you gain experience points, which you can use to fight the boss after you have collected enough.If your friend (a monster) kills you, you swap places, meaning you spawn the monsters, and they fight them. When you kill the adventurer, you gain ""hero blood"" which you can trade for gold to spend at a shop, spending it on weapons, allies, and abilities.When you eventually fight the boss, the game doesn't stop being multiplayer. Oh, no. The non-adventurers must actually possess parts of the massive boss and work together to defeat the adventurer. If the adventurer kills the boss, he/she wins. If the boss ""kills"" (you teleport back aways) the adventurer 3 times, the game is over.When a game is over, you can unlock new monsters which players can transform their previous monsters into. You also unlock new abilities for monsters and adventurers, etcetera.Overall, I think that Crawl is a masterpiece. The pixel-art blends very well with the shifts in scene, the soudtrack is amazing, and the gameplay itself is one-of-a-kind.I rate this game 10/10, and it's still in development. I highly suggest you buy this game if you're even remotely interested.			"

												Should you buy this game? Yes.Crawl is a arcade throw back of yester year (even has a cabinet display option) in which you and up to three friends (or AI if you don't have any friends) face off in local multiplayer in seeing who can hit level 10  by slaying monsters and buying new equipment first to face off against the boss to gain freedom!.. With the other players attempting to murder you and wear your flesh as a suit so they can attempt the same.In between the levels players have the chance to upgrade their monsters by evolving them into such things as Beholders or Demons at the every end of each monster tree (with more being unlocked after each successful game).Having played a few games myself I would advise against buying this if you just want a single player game, it's still fun against the AI but the real enjoyment is watching the light of your friendships fade as you rob them of their hard fought victory and win the game yourself, well that's the real enjoyment for me at least (#notsorryChris).

								So, a problem I run into a lot with CRAWL is that I'm lonely as heck, and don't have any friends who are willing to come where I am to play a videogame. That being said, the amount of single-player content is pretty substantial for a game in early access, especially since this game is focused on multiplayer. The amount of time that was put into devising upgrade trees for monsters and old gods to worship is visible. Some parts of the game need balance or lack polish, but it's in early access; I can't expect a perfect experience from a game that isn't finished. The gameplay is solid, and the music is catchy and well paced to the in-game events.I like epic nice			"

								I am just LOVING the renaissance of couch coop.  Just two years ago I thought it was dead.  In the last two years tons of games have come out exclusively for couch coop.  I heard about this game awhile back and had yet to pull the trigger, well I finally did.  I can safely say it doesn't dissapoint.  TBH I have yet to actually play couch coop with somone I have just played against bots.  I will revise my review once I have played it with buds.  Everything about the game is brimming with style, from the flashy menu, to the incredible pixel art, tight controls, unique gameplay, and the intense chiptune soundtrack.   Early access gets alot of flak but this is done right.  The Game is released in an EXTREMELY playable state with a very large update looming ahead.  Grab some buds and Crawl, I know I will be soon!EDIT: Just played with 3 people and one bot.  it was a blast!  I was surprised at how simple it is to pick up.  :)			"

								This game hits me in all the right places! From the amazingly well done pixel art, to the incredibly satifying sound effects.""Rise, from your grave!""When I first started up Crawl I was instantly reminded of ""Altered Beast"". And I know some people will say that was a terrible game, but it has a warm spot in my heart. There is something very primeval about getting to be a monster, especially when massacring your friends. I hope Powerhoof meant for a slight throwback to ""Altered Beast"", Or I'm just crazy.Ok, back to Crawl! The animations are pure genius and you never feel hindered by them. The variety of weapons and special moves keep me going back for more! I cannot wait to see what new things are being added.With all this positive, I will say the one thing I feel needs improvement with Crawl, is more varied rooms. They sometimes feel repetitive, and trap layouts can be a bit wonky (have seen two traps inside another, or about a pixel apart).Don't be fooled! This is Early Access done right. BUY IT! Murder your friends! And ""never give up."" "

								This is a very solid game for early access. and has an enormous amount of style and potential.  I do have a few complaints about the overall balancing however.1. Defensive playstyles through monsters are ultimately more rewarding than aggresive playstyles, and camping is a big problem. (Atleast, in the 12 hours we've played collectively). 2. Because of this, some of the final monster evolutions are not worth evolving too (Im thinking of the slug, for example)3. Part of the issue is because of all these defensive options you're given as monsters, it almost feels like online would just be overwhelmingly frustrating to deal with if it was implimented. If i wasn't sitting next to some friends playing this game, i'd probably have ragequit against the defensive playstyles in an online setting playing against people who i didn't know. (This is just personal prefernce however, and im sure online would still be an amazing adition for the community and players of this game)If the dev's were able to find a way to combat this while not completely destroying the ranged characters playstyle, it'd be much more rewarding to play as a monster, and maybe not feel like such a scumbag to your friends all the time.Negatives aside, this is still a blast to play, and leads to many hilarious moments. May lead to some frustrations, but ultimately is one of the most entertaining Couch co-op games i've played.			"

YouTube™ Video: Crawl: Early Impressions 

			Views: 566		

			Crawl: Early Impressions Crawl video created on version: v0.01: 01 (Giant Spider) Crawl is a competitive multiplayer dungeon crawler.		

Crawl takes the idea of dungeon crawling to a competitive level. The game features an unique A-symmetrical competitive design where it's a hero against a team of ghouls. Though the ghouls can not directly harm the hero, they can spawn mobs, turn into greater mobs, and take control of traps to hinder the hero's progress. Though the ghouls have the common goal of killing the player, they are still in competition with each other to land the killing blow. To break it down, it's an XP race, and you can't gain XP unless you are the hero, and you can only become the hero if your ghoul lands the killing blow. This dynamic presents some very interesting and unforeseen strategies.The game's art, music, and sound design are all top-notch, and worthy of praise. The pixel art is detailed and well animated, while the music and sound design is distinctly 16 bit. Overall the game keeps to it's theme quite well, and it's certainly not too hard on the eyes.Though the game features some very unique and interesting ideas, and top shelf presentation, it's not with out it's flaws. Currently, as of this impression, the game only features local multiplayer. For a game that is very multiplayer focused, this is a huge sin. Those who have people close at hand, Crawl is an easy recommendation, but if don't, then you have to consider your purchase more. I've played this solo and still enjoyed it greatly, but after a while, bots are bots, and once the gimmick of the unique mechanics is settled away, boredom can eventually set in. I can see how this is much more interesting with live people, unfortunately I never got to experience this very important aspect of the game due to it's lack of online.Overall all Crawl is a very uniquely designed competitive game that is both engaging and beautiful. Even at it's current early state the game feels stable and ""finished"". Any new updates from this point will feel more like extra content, than the game making up for obviously missing parts. This is a good thing :) It's just too bad about the lack of online. With out it It's not as easy of a recommendation as it deserves to be, but hopefully in the (near) future, that will be rectified.Pros:- Uniquely designed competition / mechanics- Great presentation- Easy to understand, but challengingCons:- No online... :(			"

								Absolutely fantastic game!Let me start off by saying that if my 50 hours of logged gameplay have taught me anything, its that this is one of the most balanced and fun games I have ever bought. The replay-ability of this game is actually amazing! I used to play this game with my brother a year ago and now I have most of the people on my college dorm floor actually addicted to palying it. This, combined with the fact that the game isn't actually finished is stunning. The balance between human and monster gameplay is amazing. Many people will talk bad about how some monsters you can just troll with, and to that I say, ""Git gud.""The only problems I have observed with this game are the variety of final bosses. There are currently two. Most of the time a certain player has the skills to destroy a certain boss, no matter how good the boss controlers are. Therefore, sometimes its up to the flip of a coin as to if someone will win the game automatically or not. HOWEVER, I am happy to hear that they have annaounced and are in the progess of making a thrid boss. This will fix the lack of variety.Another note is that the longer you play the more you find really cool room themes. Some I have seen semi-frequently are rooms with the walls/floors lined with blood sigils or rooms that have grass and vegetation. I would love to see even more of these fun-to-find environments as the game is developed.Overall, this early access game could be a game all on its own right now if it wanted to. However, I am very glad work is still being done on it. I encourage literally everyone to buy and play this game. I hope it brings as mouch joy to you as it does to me and my entire college doem floor!			"

They continue to release updates, to tweek based on user feedback, to add new things all the time.I have no idea what the end goal for this game is but every time I load it up there's something new to experience.Pros:+ Great multiplayer fun (4 people in a room is awesome)+ Unique concept+ Beautifully designed monsters with so many varied abilities+ Great level system to balance the gameCons:- Unable to play online (I believe this wont ever be an option)- Outside of the main game the training grounds feel a little lackingReally those cons do nothing to make the game worse for me though.

												1.0 DEVS CONGRATS!!This has been our main ""family-get-together"" game since EA  (wife, her sis and husb).Couch, 4 game-pads (steam now compatible with PS4 natively) , decent TV with the laptop on HDMI is the best!One of the greatest parts of this game is how drastically everything changes with the different ppl you play, or how they develop their play styles, a skeleton in the hands of my wife is vastly different than one played by my little sister.An example of the different styles: my wife loves all the bleeding buffs as hero and building the necromancer for an army of terror, my lil sister focuses more on monster play with items to buff her monsters as well as rush dragon and make your life a burning hell, and her husb is all about floating weapons and trashing your day with that damn lazer spell, I HATE that spell (please don't change it!).  And it doesn't stop there either!  Everyone has their strength when playing the boss and it is always amazes me how everyone will quick build a strategy to take the hero down during the boss fight, 3 human brains crammed into one boss is better than any hell mode AI and managing to beat them on occasion is the most rewarding thing ever!  666/666 - would have my soul lost forever by my family again... and again!PS - This game NEEDS a 4player arcade cabinet!!

 I like Crawl.  Mostly because it's a ""couch competitive"" RPG where  when you're not the hero, you become the monsters.  The stronger the hero gets, the stronger your monsters get, until you become strong enough to defeat the hero and take his place. This is a great concept that was very well executed. The animations are spot-on, the music adds to the tones of desperation and violence, the mechanics are simple enough that anyone should be able to get familiar with them in a brief amount of time, and the polish on details always feels that much closer to  just so  with each update. I'm happy to say that, since receiving this title with Humble Monthly, I have thoroughly enjoyed almost every aspect of the game.  Fun combat that makes every attack feel as good as the last one. Good music to set the tone for a variety of scenarios. Simple and straightforward mechanics to keep the game progession strong. Consistently provides a unique experience every time. Playable without your friends by adding bots to the game.  This is a great buy, especially if you have friends to share it with.  "

								Well, well, well... Of all of the roguelike, couch co-op indie games out there, Crawl has to be my favourite. The atmosphere of the game is just creepy enough to send the willies up newcomers, not to mention the new intro cutscenes narrated by the magnificent Old Shrimpeyes. I don't know what that man eats, drinks or starves himself of to get that kind of voice, but whatever it is, I want it.Intro and Atmosphere aside, Crawl is just a boatload of fun to play. I picked up the Steam Link recently and said box of goodness has proven itself to be quite good at processing these pixel-style games. It's situated in my living room, so I of course went on to have a real couch co-op experience with a few mates which consisted mainly of ghostly noises and violent screaming. The graphics are great, especially when running at 60fps as you get to watch the current human shifting fearfully from hall to hall before being set upon by rats, spiders and goblin grasshopper thingies, all of which are controlled by either bots or the people sitting next to you.The best part is, if you haven't been human for a while, you gain Wrath every time the lucky fellow levels up, which in turn allows you to evolve your goblin grasshopper thingy into a rock-lobbing giant. This system of EXP for the living and Wrath for the dead makes the game a lot fairer and keeps things interesting in a long runthrough.Overall, I'd recommend Crawl for anyone hankering for some old fashioned jolly cooperation; I can't remember what I bought it for because I was a pre-release funder, but whatever it costs now, it's worth it!

								Despite being in Early Access, Crawl is one of the most unique, interesting, and promising games in the overdone and dry market of dungeon crawlers. And don't forget that updates are still coming, adding even more variety to an already good game.Pros:•Updates are often filled with a good amount of content, even if they are aren't very often.•A base idea* that is becoming more common, but never done in this way.•Different monster progression paths to follow.•Unlockable paths, monsters, traps, and weapons.•Variety of the above.•Beautiful art style.•AI to play against, if you have no friends like me :(Cons:•Environment has no variety, but they recently added a whole new environment and plan on adding more.•Somewhat bland color palette, hopefully getting better with new environments.•AI seems a little off, but not too much.*The Idea of one monster VS 3 or 4 good players is being used in a few games, such as Evolve. In Crawl, there's one alternating player fighting a ton of monsters inhabited by 3 ghosts.Overall, a great buy for you and your friends, but still does great for singleplayer. Despite the beautiful style, the environment is still relatively unvaried and bland. If you really want, wait until its out of Early Access if it bothers you that much, but other than that, it could easily be released today, albeit without as much content as it could have.A solid 7/10			"

								One of my absolute favorite games to bring to parties, Crawl has rarely disappointed and led to multiple body injuries among the partygoers. To put a long story short, the developers rock and are continually adding new content as time goes on, and the gameplay keeps itself tight and self-balancing. Now, if you'd rather bring Mario to your parties, go right ahead and do that, but this game will keep you CRAWLing back to it.			"

								I love playing this casually every once in a while in the few 13 minutes I have before my first class, and as such I derive most of my enjoyment from short games spread out a period of time. If you're looking for a game you can splurge on, I wouldn't really recommend this unless you have several friends to play with often, but for its low price and amazingly executed mechanics, Crawl is an excellent game that you can probably play for about 16 hours by yourself before it even becomes a smidge monotonous.

								Excellent and unpretentious top down roguelike dungeon crawler that's over the top when it comes to fast paced extremely satisfying and gory gameplay. This game is especially good for when you want to sit down and have a quick instant fix of fast action, because matches mostly range between 20-45 minutes, and can even last longer depending on how much you want to level up before facing the boss. The atmosphere is on point in terms of making you feel as if you're exploring a dank dark dungeon that's haunted by an ancient evil presence, the spirits that haunt you, follow you and possess traps and summon monsters only add to this feeling... there are some references to Lovecraft's work in the level names which is always a nice touch, the rooms and map layouts are randomly generated and every playthrough is different, but unlike many other games with randomly generated rooms you don't start noticing the same variation of a room being repeated until maybe 5 or so hours, there isn't an arbituary set pattern in which you experience rooms either, the only thing that's consistent is that each floor has one store (with each floor having randomly selected different items, making way for different character builds which further ensures each playthrough is unique), one portal that leads to the final boss and one exit that leads to the floor below.... anyway regardless, even if the room layouts aren't always unique... the map layouts are always unique, the repetition of rooms isn't something you're bothered by because you're too busy trying to get the final shot on the hero or you're the hero desperately trying to cling to every last inch of your humanity and you really become absorbed in the addictive gameplay... it's also worth mentioning that the developers are awesome dudes who are very responsive to the community, always respond positively to ideas, negative criticism, and are still constantly showcasing screenshots of different environments / room layouts that are in progress so you can expect to see much more variation in that department in the future, at the rate I see them posting screenshots of new room types, my point on rooms repeating themselves once or twice per match will probably be completely and utterly void by the time this game gets a release... it's also really fun to play single player even if it's designed for co op!Recommended!!!PS: I love the skeletons to death, whenever they laugh or use their ranged attacks where they throw a bone at you, I get a flashback of Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness where the skeleton says to Ash; ""I've got a bone to pick with you!"" :P			"

								Crawl is a retro inspired dungeon crawler where one person is a human and others are ghosts that can spawn as enemies and control traps attempting to take his life and get a go as a human, the ultimate goal being to defeat the boss. Couple that with reasonable asking price, fantastic sound/music and addictive gameplay and you've got something that's easy to recommend even at this early stage. More monsters are on the way it seems! Really the only negative is that the multiplayer is local only. If online multiplayer was added this would be truly something special, though it is already good.Powerhoof provided me with a copy to do a first impressions video on the game. If you'd like to see some of the game in action consider checking the video below.

								Crawl has honestly blown my expectations away, giving me the feel of nostalgia from it's music and art style while also giving me the kind of gameplay that has nearly infinite replay value. Games like these come around every now and again, and were very abundant during the NES and SNES ages as far as I saw it. I love the fact that this game can give me the excitement that it has even without multiplayer.. yet.10/10 would hook up an HDMI to my 70 inch projector and play it with 4 people at once in a dark basement that flooded last year.

								An amazing game best played with a controller, Crawl is a local (and maybe, in the future, online) competitive dungeon crawler game, where while one person is the dungeoneer, everyone else are wraiths and need to kill him, once you kill him, the person who killed him becomes the new dungeoneer. The graphics fit the game very well, the upgrades are amazing, and there is quite a bit of content.10/10would play again			"

								Put this on a laptop, hook it up to a TV, and have the most competitive session of couch-multiplayer you've ever fought through. Every attack, dodge, gold purchase, and death is a high-stakes play. Victory is truly satisfying and the first thirty minute to hour round will leave you drained and exhilerated. My friends and I always come back to it when we need a game to test each others' skills and patience. Extremely fun. Cannot recommend highly enough. (The insanity animations are also incredibly charming.)			"

												Crawl is an excellent couch co-op game which encourages you to work together as a team to end the hero's life, then take their place and fight your way to salvation by besting the cthulhian horror that resides at the end of it all... or die and have your humanity stolen, only to be cursed to rot forever amidst your wrath in the infinite tombs of Crawl.Crawl hits all the right notes:Monsters scale well over time, going from murderous nuisances to outright tough-as-nails murderbeastsHero weapons and abilities are interesting and variedBuffs and debuffs provide an additional strategic layer which raises the game from simply ""good"" to ""great""There's a heavy cyber-lovecraftian theme which elevates the mood. It's immersive and tense, appealing to that intrinsic desire to survive which exists within every human.I love the fact that your scorecard is saved between runs. I also laughed out loud when the game told me that my hero had been ""lost forever"" because we ran out of attempts against the boss (and then it deleted my scorecard, a really nice touch).I never felt like any of my deaths were unfair, or that any of the monsters in particular didn't come with their own weakness to exploit. Your decisions really shape your hero and you'd do well to expect your enemies to exploit gaps in your defense.It doesn't have online multi-player, but that's a small concession for what is such a tight and cohesive array of elements that come together and create an experience that'll have you sweating from the sheer intensity. Even if you don't have enough people nearby who can slum it on your couch to gather up 4 players, Crawl provides a powerful AI that will keep you on your toes. I especially thought it was a nice touch when the AI even goes through the human motions in shops and goes through upgrade menus like a regular player - its an oddly salient touch that I didn't know I wanted until I saw it.

								Crawl is an enormously entertaining game.  The interesting mix of so many elements is immensely entertaining.  Crawl is a retro themed, but modern take of a dungeon crawling mix of assymetrical multiplayer with co-op and campaign elements among many other great elements.  This game is the perfect combination of game elements that just becomes... well, perfection.  I started gaming years ago and have played games of practicaly any kind, but this game is somewhere in my top 3 favorite games of all time!  It is perfection!     Now, time to address negative reviews.  All negative reviews of this game either complain about the lack of online multiplayer or lack of content in the Early Access version at the time they typed up the review.  Since the writing of those reviews at the early Early Access of the game, the game has gained a ton of more flesh to it.  It is full of content and exciting gameplay and there are still updates to come because this amazing game is still in Early Access.  Online play has not yet been implemented so it can be hard to find the full 4 player game it was meant for, however, at the time of me typing this review I have a 19 hours of gameplay.  At least 12 of which have been me with no other players and just a full roster of bots and I still found this game amazingly entertaining.     Overall, this game is one of the best games of all time and deserves to be on a top 10 list of games of all time.			"

A superb, fun party game with great animation and a rad soundtrack.Multiplayer Crawl is amazing fun. You can play it against bots and they work great but multiplayer is really where it's at. It feels like arcade games used to back in the golden age of arcade games.It makes a great party game, but take note that the multiplayer is local only and you will need joypads. One player can use the keyboard but you can't aim precisely using it. You can use this to handicap a player if they're winning too often though, or turn off precise aiming for everyone if you like. You can even use a mouse as a controller if you're desperate.Powerhoof have also added a 'taunt your god' option, to properly handicap individual players in a variety of ways, fixing the one gripe I did have about the game.One player at a time has human form and all the other players are ghosts that gang up and try to kill them with monsters and traps. Get the killing blow on the human player and you take human form instead! The human player advances through the dungeon to attempt to kill the boss and win.The animations are superb, the music is great, the controls are tight and responsive and the combat is smooth and impactful. There are a ton of weapons, items, potions, abilities, dungeon features and monsters, some of which get unlocked as you play more.Also the trailers are great, and the early access trailer gives a nice overview of the game if you're about to start up a game with new players.

												Crawl. If this had some sort of single player, dungeon running, loot gaining, level uping going on, it would be my favorite game of all time.As it is, it is very close. The aesthetic is amazing. The voice acting makes me feel happy. Everything is so well animated, so fluid. It feels as good as it looks.Sure, there's that random thing where maybe you'll never get to play a human and you can't win, but in that case you ought to have the most leveled up creatures, and you're bound to be having fun playing dragons and pit fiends anyway.

In my time playing this game, I have yet to encounter any bugs. The A.I is smart and can be a challenge to take down.

								Absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best couch multiplayer games I have ever played. In fact, just plain one of the best games I have ever played!The gameplay is fantastic, tight and thrilling. You are one of four adventurers before you turn on one another in a quick and visceral opening scene. Once only one of you is left alive the rest of you take control of your spirits with the options to control monsters, traps and debris in each room as the remaining human player tries to progress. This creates a tense experience as you are always either fighting for your life, just trying to scrape through, or fighting for the chance to regain your humanity - if you kill the human you can restore your humanity and take control of your human body again. As excellent as the core gameplay is, it is the underlying systems that raise the standard to magnificent. The human needs to reach level 10, gaining levels by defeating monsters, then enter the boss room and defeat the boss to win the game. However, every time the player gains a level, making them stronger, the other players gain ""wrath"", a currency they can use to upgrade one of their three possible monsters. Each upgrade tier has two choices, offering a wealth of diversity, and indeed mayhem when all of the effects start flying. With the wrath mechanic those who are not playing as the human get progressively more powerful until they have a good chance of getting the kill and reclaiming their humanity once more. The mechanics of play are simple to understand; one button attacks and another uses your ""special"", a choice of whatever spell that you choose to buy from the blacksmith, gold permitting.  We had two regular gamers and two non regular gamers and everyone was able to compete out fo the gate. Tutorialising is extremely clever in Crawl, other than the buttons you are introduced to each of the ideas of the game through play; for example one of the bosses offers the chance to utilise a healer mid battle so before you enter the boss room he appears and gives you a glimpse of how it works. It is an extremely clever and intuitive process. Similarly, when you enter a new room items that you can interact with flash. The meta game is really quite engaging, too. At the start of each run you choose a deity to worship; this determines the three monsters you are able to use during the run and also a passive bonus. After each run you unlock new deities to worship, new weapons and spells to buy from the blacksmith, new monsters to play as and even new traps to utilise in the dungeons. All of this is to say that as you play more, the options increase and the game becomes even more varied on each play through. In summary, I can't praise Crawl enough. I thoroughly enjoyed every tantalising moment of play, every death throe and every victory. For anyone that enjoys gathering some friends and playing together, both in competition and in co-operation, you can't do any better than Crawl. ************************************************************Feedback for the Devs:First, thank you for this amazing game!Second, in my humble opinion, I think a few elements could be tweaked to improve the awesomeness:The monster with the shield special; I think then cooldown is too short when coupled with his impressive speed.Player colours; red and orange can become confused in the heat of play.Loss of control; occassionally it is hard to determine why a player cannot attack (such as when on a pool).Lastly, a few ideas we had...Game modes! Such as on death rotating to the next player in line, rather than on kill. Or a human's health ticks down, ensuring that each turn as the human is finite and the rotation is more likely.Thank you again, for the wonderful Crawl. ***************************************************************			"

								Crawl is an excellent four player local competitive game, with a well defined style and a lot of heart. You're four lost souls damned to wander an unholy dungeon, fighting to escape through exerting your will upon the frail flesh which happens to pass before you. As a spirit, you are ever at odds for when you inhabit the hero the other spirits seek to displace you, and when you are a spirit, you must be the one to strike the killing blow if you would escape. Once you've advanced your hero to a sufficient level, and subsequently discovered a portal, you can go through it to face a monstrosity which may end up inhabited by all your foes. Fail there, and return to the dungeon, until someone escapes, or you collectively fail too often.If Crawl has a flaw, and you do not agree that the flaws are at times inherent to the beauty of a piece, it is that the game loop is secured around four players. If you do not have four people, you will need to fill the remaining slots with A.I. which - while quite capable - is not nearly as unpredictable and thus exciting as a human player.Purchase a copy, invite three of your friends, and prepare to writhe - no - crawl your way back to the living.

								I have found this game to be very entertaining and in many cases hilarious when I play with friends. The couch co-op is something in gaming that AAA gaming companies seem to be shunning lately and quite frankly that is a mistake. This game is a breath of fresh air in that regard. Crawl is a fun game, a game that(at least in my experience) has no broken combos to use, has plenty of monsters that are all really fun to use, and traps that are not overpowered but not useless.The only downside I can imagine that this game has is the fact that it doesnt have a playable soundtrack to listen to for the Steam Library, because the music is one of the great things about this game.

								Crawl is an excellent couch mulitplayer title. It's gameplay is easy for anyone to pick up and can be enjoyed in short bursts or long playthroughs. While it does feature bots and a Challenge singleplayer mode it is better enjoyed with friends. The two button controls make it easy to have two players with just the keyboard and mouse, one player using each, without being cramped on the keyboard.It has a variety of procedurally generated rooms, filled with traps, upgradable monsters and there are many secrets and mysteries to be found (one worthy of Gaben himself...). Seriously, stop reading this review and get it when it's cheap! It's guarenteed to be a hit with you and your friends.The only downside is that at the time of this review it does not have online multiplayer, but it's still in early access so that and many other features are bound to be introduced soon.

								When I first saw Crawl it was love at first sight. After a little bit of waiting I bought it expecting it to be excellent, and it partialy was. I love the graphics and the diversity in monsters and weapons. The A.I is pretty good but 4 player local multiplayer is the real fun of the game, although it is the only multiplayer :(.  But after a few hours, the gameplay grew stale. The lack of bosses and and content in general made for the same sort of matches happening over and over again. I would hold off from buying this until there is more content.			"

								This game is seriously awesome. The developers are very active in creating more and more content, and it’s already packed full of coolness. While the art is pixilated, the movement does not have an “old” feel to it, but a smooth fast paced action feel. The game changes each time you play in regards to maps and which enemy characters each person chooses, and the player choices during the game. It seriously keeps things fresh.PROS:* Insanely fun game play* Original concepts with a 1 VS 3 game of dungeons and dragons where it’s 1 hero against 3 dungeon masters* Controller Support for 4 players local* Fast paced action that feels fresh each time due to the roguelike aspects of each level* You can choose how you progress as an anti-hero depending on which enemy path you choose to use each game* Great balancing mechanics that can bring an underdog back into the fray where no one feels as if there is no hopeCONS:* No save function - you may need a break after an hour of button mashing* No online multiplayer (yet?)* Bots are easy to anticipate since their strategy is pretty linearThis game, even in Early Access, is an absolute BUY NOW.If you have a friend who can come over to play, you will be more than happy with this game and it will become a “go to” in your Steam Library.

								Remember reviewed in early access, so hold onto your butt.IMAGINE a world where your one passion is to kill, which is why i love this game so much.The game features two! different styles of play ( other than the main menu ). you can play as a valiant hero who seeks to end the tyranny of the boss ( currently only one but hes a nice guy so its okay ). or PLOT TWIST you play as a ghoul summoning monsters from the darkest realms to tear the flesh from the hero.all in all the game is very solid, the two sides of the game are very balanced thus far. the art is tooooooo gooood, showing true tallent especially when you die and theres blood every where and people scream and monsters cheer.. anywayobviously nothings perfect ( excluding firefly ). theres no online multiplayer only local but thats not that bad. also theres not many differences in each game i play because the low amount of monsters to face and the weapons looking mostly the same, but thats all promised in the fuuuture so i cant complain Rating! 70 i like this game's out of something also Early access review			"

CrawlGameplayCrawl is a local multiplayer dungeon crawler where it is a race against your friends to be the ultimate hero. Crawl has been in early access for a few years and it might be one of the shining gems to come out of the Early Access void. Crawl is supposed to be a party game where you or one of your friends control the hero and wanders the dungeon alone while the others try to control one of the monsters and try to kill you and halt your progress as the hero so that they can take your place and vice versa. From the start Crawl puts your friends and you in a gladiatorial arena battle where you hammer each other to death before one of you emerges from the rubble caused by the commotion to wander into the dungeons. The other people then become ghosts who can control monsters of varying powers and try to kill the hero at every step he takes. Even here it is a race to get the last hit on the hero so that you can become the hero. It is very frustrating to reduce a hero down to low health by yourself only to see someone else come and take the kill. It does put a lot of pressure on the monsters and they have to be on their guard at every given moment to check out their surroundings.  The other players do not need to become a monster to harm the hero as they can possess things like traps and spring them up at the exact moment to get the kill or throw random objects to hurt the hero. Crawl also gives the player who has been the hero the least times the most powerful monsters to control so the game never feels unfair most of the time unless someone from your party of your monsters take the kill and it is a rage fest all over again. When a hero reaches Level 10, they can activate a sacrificial portal which allows them to face Giant Boss creatures in a bid to escape his fate and the cursed dungeon. The other players control the Boss’s different organs in an almost Power Rangers Megazord kind of way. This great loop of gameplay of Crawl where you keep dying and coming back as the hero makes Crawl one of the best couch co op games in recent memory.As the hero Crawl feels like a typical dungeon crawler RPG where you hack, slash, loot, dodge and earn XP to level up. There are a variety of weapons and spells for the player to use as the Hero and while there are you usual inane weapons which don’t feel anywhere close to some others, there is quite some interesting loot present in Crawl. The game as the hero plays like you would expect but it is the great unknown of the pleothera of monsters waiting behind the next door that is the great draw of Crawl. As the ghost you have a lot of options to choose from a variety of monsters who have different tiers which require Wraith to unlock more powerful monsters. The monsters are quite obviously different from each other in very unique ways and while it might seem unfair, it gives the lowliest of players the strongest of monsters to have his own time in the glory.The AI for solo play in Crawl is competent but nowhere near as fun as you will have with your friends. It is completely worth a try for its single play but do make a reminder to invite your friends over later for this one. There is no online play to speak of and considering the gameplay, it is probably for the best too. Crawl feels incredibly polished and the game runs really smooth at any given instance of time.VisualsAs far as pixelated art goes, Crawl takes the cake. It has a gorgeous art style which somehow makes even the blood and gore on the screen pretty neat. This is a game famous for spawning countless GIF’s and there are more to come from here. Some of the monster designs are truly incredible and some of them never fail to make you laugh. The game looks incredibly good and there is nothing quite like it.SoundCrawl has an incredible sound design which compliments its gameplay and visual aesthetics really well. The sound effects are solid and set the mood perfectly. There is little voice acting from the narrator but whatever there is, it is done really well.OverallCrawl is one of the best couch co op game to have ever graced my screen and there is no two way about it. It is one of the best examples of early access being done right and there is nothing quite like a Crawl party when it really gets going, Crawl works completely fine as a single player game too and there is a lot of content here to justify the price tag but you should definitely get Crawl if you want a solid game to enjoy with your friends.Rating: 95/100This review was brought to you by SaveorQuit.

								Where do I even start.This gave me a vibe like none other.Best roguelite I've played in a long time.I can't explain this experience on it's own, so here's some media sums to make the game what it is.Do NOT look at the screenshots and walk away, just buy the game.It's one of those games where the screenshots and descriptions are very misleading.What I expected: Another stupid ""roguelike"" cash-grab with some local co-op features, meh.What I got: An atmospheric, chilly, I'll-remember-this-first-experience-forever-because-I'm-playing-at-12AM-and-my-room's-lighting-suits-the-game-holy-crap-i-love-this-soundtrack, game.Pros:OriginalityAMAZING FREAKING SOUNDTRACK, SO GOOD.Controls are freaking smooth and AMAZINGAI almost feels like another player!

He said he just brought crawl and i never heard of the game at all. He explains to me and my other 2 friends how to play. We sat down and we connected some controllers. I had a blast. Now im having so much fun even with playing with bots. The bots in this game ar 10/10 bots, but i cannot wait for online multiplayer. If you dont own this game, Just buy it.			"

Early Access Review
								Imagine finding someone on a cold concrete floor, the room devoid of any windows or open doors.  As he struggles to his feet he notices three of his best friends making the same discovery in the room.  Suddenly, as if a product of his own confusion, a voice shouts in from above telling him that only one of them will survive.  Scrambling to find something useful on the ground, he realized they must have heard that same voice!  Brought back to his feet by the safety of a knife, he notices there is only one left and his back is turned.  The knife is plunged into his back and he immediately falls to his knees with him in dismay.  Regretful thoughts and sobbing are interrupted by the voice again, “Get up, death is no means to an end in this vile place,” and to his uneasy comfort, his friends were floating above him in spirit.	The mechanics of this game have created an incredibly balanced gameplay that is easy for anyone to get into, built on top of a wonderfully themed visual and auditory experience.  Now begins the intrepid narrative through the ever-changing procedural dungeons of Crawl.  This unique four-player split-screen game by the Australian studio Powerhoof starts you off against all your friends (or surprisingly intelligent AI) in a one-hit-to-kill brawl to decide who the hero will be first.  When you are not the hero, you are a ghost that may float around the map getting into whatever he or she may like.  They could inhabit furniture and throw it, they could command traps to aim and activate, they could interact with pictures and holes in the walls, and of course, summon and inhabit upgradable monsters on pentagrams.  Once a monster, or even a trap or furniture kills the hero, that ghost will take his place leading the exploration.  The goal in this game is to reach level 10 and challenge the player-controlled boss.  	The cohesive design of the auditory and visual aspects of this game are really the biggest things that set it apart from others.  They had decided on a very low-resolution pixel art type of sprite style, which being paired with the chip-tune style of music creates a beautiful modern take on this classic style.  The title screen and name screen even say “Insert Coin” instead of “Press Start” and only allow you to enter three-character names like an old arcade box.  Many tiny details have been added to the game, proving how much time and dedication it must have taken to build such a piece.  From random seeming pixel glitches on the menu screen paired with auditory glitches, to rich item descriptions, to screen shake.  There is even a narrator at the beginning of rounds that tells the story slightly different every time.  If you are the type of person that is overwhelmed by this art style, which I will admit is pretty common when you first start playing, I urge you to play for a while and really give the game a good shot.	Everyone I have showed this game to seems a little overwhelmed and intimidated at first, just due to the amount of things happening on screen at all times.  The presumption that you will not be good at this game at first, however, is one that could not be further from the truth.  Even if you cannot kill the hero and lead the charge, your monsters will continue to level up as the current hero does.  Inversely, if you are very good at this game and spend the whole time playing as the hero you may have good weapons, but your monsters will be weak and it will be significantly harder to become the hero again.  Given the multiplayer mechanics, the balancing aspects of this game seemed to have just come together inherently.  It feels so very natural to play, and often times, will create some very unexpected outcomes.  The bosses require the ghost players to work together and coordinate their attacks; otherwise it will be all too easy for the hero.  *********************Warning: Spoilers*************************One boss has an arm that fires sludge that will slow down and damage the hero.  The other arm fires bubbles that will trap the hero and make the final boss weapon much easier to hit.  The last weapon is an enormous eye laser that moves very slowly, but if the other teammates have done their jobs correctly, it will make short work of any level hero.  The other boss is a three-headed elemental dragon that has somewhat similar mechanics, but requires a different strategy.  There is an NPC in this boss fight that heals the player, which means the dragons best bet is to stay between the hero and the health.  As interesting and fun as these bosses are, more bosses would add a lot more variety to each dungeon adding much more replay value to this game.********************End Spoilers************************** 	After playing “Crawl” with lots of friends it has easily found its way into my top five games.  The gameplay is chaotic, and challenging, and terribly competitive.  The overall style and design of the game makes it feel like a complete new artistic world to explore.  However, as full and entertaining as this game is, it is only in early access. It is not even finished yet, so go on steam and watch their wonderfully interesting trailers and support the designers at Powerhoof by getting your copy.TL;DRAwesome Game, go buy it and beat up your friends			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game a couple days ago and I have to say I am very dissapointed... in the obnoxious, trout-bearded tacowallets I call friends. What I expected to be a competitive and fun game to play with others turned out to be the biggest troll-fest to which I've ever been subjected. If they were in human form, they'd allow me to kill them without a fight just so they could have the satisfaction of teaming up on me. I climbed level after level, giving them precious vitae to evolve into the most powerful BS monsters I've ever faced in any game. I can't count how many times I was reduced to a puddle of blood by a giant death-beam eyeball with wings, or forced to endure a small room full of traps because they just HAD to drop a single blob as I was about to walk through the door. I was the only one able to make it to the boss battles with my humanity intact, but I soon discovered that this was just a complex ruse to make me use up all the portal attempts and have all memory of my character erased from history by getting barfed on by my friends' three headed dragon.But as long as your co-op parters aren't complete jerks, you'll enjoy this well-polished game.10/10 would get trolled again.

 TL:DR - This game is truly a masterpiece, featuring challenges, voice acting, and the end of friendships.  Crawl. Crawl to your fridge, because my♥♥♥♥♥is numb the solid hours I could waste playing this game. I gotta be honest, this game is super intense, and I still keep mixing up the Z&X buttons, but I can't change them, because then I'd get even more mixed up, how does that work? I don't know!  I've always been a fan of pixel graphics in games, and this one excels my desire for such that. Of course, this isn't Online Multiplayer, but Local, so if I did have friends, this would likely end friendships. Regardless, I'm having quite a fun time on my own with this game, and those REALLY annoying bots. After a good 1.3 hours, I figured out how to kill that giant statue♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I mean - I hit him once before I got destroyed, but I figured it out at least, it's progress..  This game is pretty dope. I plan on spending a lot more hours on it, and becoming better at it, maybe. There's some amazing voice acting in this game, which more than surprised me, and it offers insane challenges within itself, which is rather new to me, actual challenge in a game. I yet, have not faced loss, but neither win - and both sound pretty fun if I'm honest, in order to improve for a game in the future, I figure. This game is beautifully made, and the developers knew what they were doing to craft such a masterpiece. I am truly in love with how this was made, it's style, and the challenges that arise whilst in game.			"

								This review is long overdue.  I bought this game quite a few months ago since I have a huge interest in neo-arcade games and I was not dissapointed.  This game has it all:-fantastic 4 player party experience that leaves you yelling at each other and getting worked up over your clutch kills to steal the hero role-The story telling you get at the begining of the game is absolutely perfect.

								I wanted this game as soon as I saw the trailers, and I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I've played it everyday since I got it. It's a fast-paced game with great music, atmosphere, gameplay, and a lot of challenge without too steep a curve. I have only played with AI so far, and I still have a lot of fun. They feel like proper opponents, and help set the illusion that you're playing with people.I first used keyboard controls. They're alright; I wouldn't advise you slouch or curl up while playing though, as there's a lot of rapid button-pushing involved and that'll make your hands cramp up very quickly. I now use an iBuffalo Classic USB gamepad; the same goes for it, although that might just be because it's a new gadget and hasn't been broken in yet. Both control sets work great! Word to the wise, though: As of now, you can't adjust the gamepad controls in the main menu; you have to start a game and then use the controls menu that appears immediately after.The developers are still working out the kinks, I imagine, and they're adding new content all the time. The brief story-like introductions have some great variety to them, and there's nothing more awesome than going through all the new monsters, weapons, and items you unlock after every game. I have no complaints!			"

								This isn't your run-of-the-mill roguelike. It's adaptive to however many friends you have with you - constantly balancing itself through the level/wrath system. The sheer amount of monsters, weapons, trinkets, spells, traps and other features is staggering considering the attention devoted to each one.I have thoroughly enjoyed this game so far and I'm sure I will continue to do so (when I find more friends).

Holy ♥♥♥♥ dude, This game is amazing.I started playing it alone, not knowing what to expect. I start a game, two AI join and we get spawned in. The voice acting - Very nice,The artstyle - Very very nice.The combat feels great, movement is smooth and the controls are very easy to understand.I started playing and then finally stopped 3 hours later, because it was about midnight.The item and god unlock system in this game is great, and really makes you go back and play again for the new stuff.The weapon variety just a few games in was great, always getting cool stuff, and finding much more as I went on.The monster progression system is very fair and incredibly rewarding, and their abilities are on par with a player that knows what they're doing, making it even fairer.The feeling of competition and the tense atmosphere when you're on 5 hp and you manage to kill the final boss just makes it that much more fun.Multiplayer is easy if you have friends and a few spare controllers, set up was a breeze.Overall rating - Hey, it's pretty good!

								This review is long overdue.  I bought this game quite a few months ago since I have a huge interest in neo-arcade games and I was not dissapointed.  This game has it all:-fantastic 4 player party experience that leaves you yelling at each other and getting worked up over your clutch kills to steal the hero role-The story telling you get at the begining of the game is absolutely perfect.  The second the intro happened, I was immediately pulled in and knew I would love this game-The music and sounds effects are fantastic and really pulls me into the experience even more.

												Crawl is one of the most fun local multiplayer games I have ever played, with a unique mechanic whereby players take control of the dungeon and become the hero by killing him. The hero is more powerful than the monsters, so the non-hero players are forced to co-operate to whittle down his health, but once he's at low health that spirit of co-operation goes out the window and everyone is trying to land the final blow for themselves. This game's balance is extremely tight, barring a few exceptions (bows are the worst starting weapon in the game by far) and it's always a blast to play since the games aren't too long.The mid-game is where Crawl truly shines, as the monster players have gained enough power to defeat the hero and he has yet to gain the powerful late-game equipment that would allow him to defeat such threats. At this point the game becomes a race, where you want to grab enough upgrades to be able to take on the bosses, but not spend so much time in the dungeon that you die and lose your spot as hero.My only real complaint about Crawl is that I wish there were just a couple more bosses, as for most of the early access period there were only two, and now they have come to full release adding on just one last boss. The boss fights are fun, but with such a limited pool they get old fast, with optimal attack patterns that are easy to counter as the hero.			"

								A lot of fun already! With Lovecraftian horror and 8-bit pixel art, a couch competitive 3v1 dungeon crawler emerges from the depths.How it worksI've never played a competitive game with this mechanic before. A brief matchup at the beginning of each game determines who the ""human"" player is, and who the ""monster"" players are. The human player traverses the dungeon, looking for the stairs to the next level. The monster players control spirits who float around the room with the ability to possess traps, spawn slimes, and summon controllable demons for the purpose of killing the human player. If the human player dies, the monster player who landed the fatal blow assumes the role of the human hero while the former human player joins the ranks of the ghosts. The amount of monsters you kill as the human hero determines who wins the game, with a levelling system that gives boosts to overall health. Monster earn a separate class of EXP which can be used to upgrade their demons to even more powerful monstrosities. Human players also have the opportunity starting at level 10 to fight a challenging dungeon boss picked at random.What it needsThere should be a system to upgrade peak monsters' base attributes, though, as a handicap for less experienced players. I already love the balancing system though. Also, at this point, the music is very limited and gets pretty repetitive. Finally, attack controls feel a little gummy and could use work before you stop walking away from the game with bloody thumbs.In conclusionBuy this game if you love dungeon crawlers, rogue-lites, and are looking for a very new twist on a classic genre to challenge your friends with. Don't have friends? Pick this up when it's on sale, you can still play the game with up to 3 AI players who range from competent to outright ruthless, but this game really shines the brightest when your opponent is on the couch next to you.

								This game is great! I'll try to avoid giving out the same details as everyone else, but the praise is well-deserved, this game does a ton of things right! Now, since all the peeps below me have given the game the good stuff, I'll say all the bad stuff I have come across. Firstly, the rooms look nice, they really do, but they all look the same, their shapes are different, and that does determine life or death in circumstances, but still, change it up a bit please. Secondly, the game could use some balancing, the starting human starts off at  major disadvantage to the monsters when they inevitably fall and become a monster, they're a super-weak monster (this is an early access, so this'll be fixed sooner or later.). The controls are also less fit for a keyboard as you can only aim in 4 directions, this can be fixed with a controller, but not all of us have those, and it often makes the game a tad more difficult when aiming. The boss also has an unskippable cutscene which after a while made the boss look kind of...Cute, in a derpy fashion...(IGNORE THAT.). Besides the above, this game is a great example of early-access done right, and its dev's are fun guys. I highly suggest you get it if you have friends locally near you, if not, it may not be the best, but you can play with bots, who are pretty smart, and can become stupid if you turn down the difficulty.

								Crawl is a great game I give it 4 out of 5 stars for the state its in as of 08/07/2015 and let me tell you why. Its pretty much like its not in early access. What I like about the game is that there are a lot of possibilities in the battle of who is to win. I like how there are only three chances you get to win the game. With that being said, anyone over the level of 10 could go for it when they reach the shrine. As of right now there are two bosses you can either be or fight which is randomly chosen for you when you activate the shrines. Either you or the other 3 players (depending on who activates the shrine) become part of the three parts of the boss, and you have to try to defeat the boss while the others use the boss to defeat you. Anyone can fail twice fighting the boss battles. The third time whoever fails will ultimately lose the game and the other players win in a first, second, third basis.(The loser being 4th) I also like the dynamic of there is one hero and the others are ghosts vying for the life of the hero and use forms of monsters to try to steal the life of the hero and become him. All an all this is a great game and I cannot wait for the full version. What I would like to see in the full version is a database for all that you unlock like a lore, just like Risk Of Rain. And also I really hope and pray they create multiplayer because that would make it 5 stars in my opinion.			"

I'll give this 9/10 (and it's in Early Access and the developers have a lot of future plans, so the rating it's amazing! *done by my rating*) + the price is amazing, so buy it now because this game's price might rise and Evolve with it!

								Everyone needs to play this game. Even though it is in early access, it has very little bugs. ( so little I haven't spotted one)The main goal is to level up to ten and defeat the boss at the end. Sounds simple until you have a three friends over with the same goal. This game is fun alone and with your friends. The fighting is simple and easy to use. ( for both ghosts and humans) The game is also very balanced. You also unlock more items for your next round. I haven't unlocked everything yet, but everytime I do unlock something (you unlock at least one thing every game) I want to see it and test it out. This game has a ton of items to choose from. Making it very easy to fit your play style. One more thing I love is the ""gods"" you can pick from. The gods is like your class for your hero. They give you three monsters and a passive to help your ghost or hero. In the end of every level you can level up your monsters.In the end, I am so pumped to see every update, to unlock every new thing, to destroy my friends in a battle with all odds against you. This game puts such a smile on my face. If this game was finished right here, I wouldn't be mad, this game is already fun, with almost no bugs.96/100			"

Die, kill, die again, try and take back your humanity and then slay the boss monster guarding the exit. It's a hell of a romp for couch gaming.Con if you don't have friends that will come over and game: no online at present. The local multiplayer aspect adds a great deal to the experience.The latest update for 9/26 added new monsters, deities, and balance changes. Scorpion OP, demon lord sucks.			"

Worship Dark Deities whom give you access to three variations of beast (pro tip name your character HL3 for the one true GOD!!), Earn WRATH and upgrade your monsters into bigger ones with better killing ablities to truly beat the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your 'friends'. Should one of your 'friends' be good enough at the game, they'll face the final boss, you, their 'friend'. The human will earn gold to get new ablities, weapons, upgrade their stats and so forth.This game is too much fun, great music, great visuals, great everything, well balanced, been playing on and off for a year checking out each update, I'm glad to see it leave Early Access and be a full fledge title. This game is easily worth the money its a no brainer, up to 4 friends can play so make them play CRAWL then find some more friends and do the same thing.-Double thumbs up from Royial			"

								Short version:Get it if you have 1 to 3 friends, (so, a total of 4 peeps,) that love playing new types of games on a couch.Longer version:Couch Conflict games are great but tend to fall into a very small selection of catagories.A large number are 1 screen platformers.Another swathe are 1 screen ""asteroids"" based twin stick shooters.Within these 2 large pools there are some stellar gems, a lot of winners, a few minor tweaks and innovations and a lot of ""others"" that don't really distinguish them selves well.For the most part, if you have a handful of entries from these groups in your library, you'll have the basics covered and dipping back in too the pools probably won't net you anything wonderfully different.So it's always exciting when clever people come up with something that feel radically different with out over complicating what you seek out from these experiances.Nighogg is a great example of this idea, and if you're looking at Crawl as a multiplayer couch gamer, you probably already know about the joys of that.What Crawl offers is different again... and does take a minute more to absorb, but after that you will be drinking in a game that takes the head to head nature of this genre and mixes in a brilliant and ever changing landscape of all vs 1 and and great ""begining-middle-end"" arc in each session.If you have your basic couch conflict games covered, Get Nidhogg and get this and you'll have a great little menu to pick from.Nighog for instantly accessable gaming at snack like speed.Twin stick arenas and 1 screen platformers for experiances with a hair more length and variable substance.Crawl for a solid hunk of entertainment that still leaves room for multiple sessions.(Oh and Mount your friends for dessert... because it's fruity and lite) :D "

								For people who like local multiplayer games, I cannot reccomend this game highly enough. A friend and I only discovered it last night and it continued to impress us from beginning to end. The game is simple to pick up and play, it's a fun new dynamic between players that is nonstop fun and it keeps in mind the important qualities of an old-fashioned game. I hope they make tons more.

								This game is fantastically fun. You may find it overwhelmingly hard at first, but after one or two games you'll get the hang of things and be loving it.Best played with friends, it's very well balanced and does give entertainment to all ability levels. If you don't have any friends, the AI is very good and feels very human-like too. You may be a bit tired of pixel art by now, but here it's done really well and looks great. It is also smoothly animated which helps when coping with the fast-paced nature of the game.I absolutely love it, and I've been dying to play more everyday since buying.			"

								     Gameplay is great, even with bots it gets competiteve and faced paced. Bots are very competiteve in the first place, and i cant even imagine fighting them on hard mode. The monsters evolve after each floor, getting tougher and tougher, and eventuallly, they will kill you, you only get ""xp"" (or vitae, as its called ingame)  to evolve your monsters if the other players level up, so it has a massive competition side to it, if you survive the whole floor, and not be killed once, then you probably wont be able to evole your monsters. So what do you get? The other players are getting the advantage... but not really, you have weapons, swords and bows and javelins/spears to fight them off, some quicker some slower but more damage, there are many, many many many weapons to this game to kill your undead enemies, atleast, i think there are. (plus theres assassins blades... so thats cool :D)Each time you finish a game, more content gets added (it of course tells you what once you beat it) like more weapons, traps, gods and more, so if theres not enough content for you, dont you worry there will be more.So your a monster and you kill the player, whoever got the last blow turns into the human, and you got it, what do you do? go to the blacksmith shop, or find it, because every time you hit the player, you earn ""blood"" which you can give to a statue in the blacksmith shop. the statue is happy from the blood you spilled, and rewards you, with money, that you can use for weapons or purchase a ""spell"" that replaces your dodge roll.So this game offers much, and is definatley worth ten bucks, infact i think that is a lower price than what this game offers, and the fact this game is going to ofer more in the future... well thats just great.So welcome to the dungeons, Crawler			"

Early Access Review
								It is already one of the best couch (semi-)coop games you can get IMO, even though it’s in early access. The game offers a whole new experience: in-game friends turn to enemies and the other way round.Also it never felt like a beta, it seemed very well thought-out from the get-go and now they are adding new content and balance it a bit more, a flagship early access game if you ask me.At our first session we’ve played the game 6 hours straight without noticing the time going by. It is definitely already one of the best invested 10€ ever.The graphics are great, if you like pixel art and the sound/music really fit the game well.But before you buy it, you have got to have at least 2 friends who are willing to play it with you (offline ofc). And I’m saying this, because the graphics really put off some people and the start of the game can be a little hard, because eventhough the game uses only to buttons aside from the stick, it can really get confusing. So I’d suggest you’d play it with “gamers”. But if your friends are hooked they are hooked for good and will be as excited about the game as I am.Aside from that It’s the most fun I’ve had with a game in a long time. I’ve played it 13h by now and it would have been much longer if I had more people to play it with. Go try it out! :)			"

Early Access Review
								Well, I saw this game at the bottom of Steam's New Releases list. I'd never seen or heard of the game before, but that pixel art drew me in close enough to click on it. Boy am I glad I did.In Crawl you play as a ghost trying to murder your living friend, or a hero trying to survive your dead friends' onslaught. Hero's can explore the map, break things, buy weapons at the shop, open chests, and attempt to kill the monsters your friends summoned and are controlling. Ghosts can summon monsters when inside a pentagram, possess various kinds of traps throughout the dungeon, spawn slimes if they've collected enough ghost fluff (or whatever it is...), or even take control of a boss the hero is trying to kill.So, the game starts as one of you randomly chosen as the first hero, who goes about the dungeon exploring rooms, and fending off friends who actively try to kill him. ""Why?"" You may ask. Well, the ghost that lands the killing blow on the hero regains their humanity and becomes the new hero, while the dead hero becomes a ghost. And the fight continues.The hero progresses through the dungeon, leveling up by collecting experience from slain monsters. They can buy new weapons, which range from broadswords, to crossbows, to dual throwing knives; special abilities, which allow you to replace your starting dodge roll with better dodging abilities, beserker rage, and lasers; as well as potions and apparel that grant permenant effects like Dragon's Blood that lowers your max health, but makes you deal more damage. My personal favorite, Golem's Blood, which causes you to mave 10% slower, but raises your max health by 40%. Acid cursed rings that causes you to loose pools of acid every time you get hit to damage your attacker, or the shield that floats around you blocking damage altogether. Need some more gold? Cash in all the blood you took from the hero as a ghost to earn a ton of extra cash.Once a hero reaches level 10 they can challenge the boss. The boss is also controlled by the ghosts, who work together to keep the hero from winning the game, because the boss slayer automatically wins first place. If defeated, the hero returns with low life, sure to die within the next few moments.Now, here's the catch. You can only challenge a boss three times before the portal permenently closes. If the hero loses here, not only do they automatically get last place, but they lose that character forever. Normally, even if your the ghosts and lose when someone beats the boss, your character profile is saved, and you can use them again next time. (with all abilities and weapons reset of course) Not if you lose to the boss the third time. If that happens, your gone forever. This allows you to sort of keep a win streak, or stay-alive streak rather. I can't wait to see how the devs use this in the future.Now, heros can level up, so how do the ghosts compensate? They can evolve their monsters. When a hero levels up, each ghost gets Vitae that they can spend evolving monsters when the hero completes a floor. There's lots of monster evolution chains and you can unlock even more. Before you start, each player chooses a deity to worship, which changes the kinds of monsters that are avalible to you as a ghost. Staying the hero for too long will yeild very powerful enemies for you friends, but stay a ghost for too long and you'll never have a shot at beating the game. The longer you stay a ghost, the more powerful your monters become compared to your friends, and the more powerful your monsters, the higher chance you have at landing the killing blow and becomeing the hero. You see? It's all ingeniously ballanced.Yes I can recomend the game right now. Although there's only one boss and and a few deities. The devs are working on more. This is really good for an early access game.On a side note, This game is Lovecraftian as heck. And I love it for that.Only one issue with the game. It's local multiplayer only at this point. Not that I have a big problem with that, but...Now all I need is 3 people willing to sit around a computer screen to play with me :p8/10			"

Early Access Review
Platform: Ubuntu 14.04 with mid-high specs (see profile for details). Runs absolutely perfectly, with brilliant gamepad support using steamos-dkms xpad drivers. I have a soft spot for local multiplayer, and so I tend to add to basket as soon as I see a game tagged in this way. This review starts by saying that Crawl is potentially one of the best local multiplayer games I've played for a while. I played this game last night with my sister and parents (3 gamepads and myself, the unfortunate soul with the keyboard). I know we'll play again tonight, its that kind of game. Each time you play it begins like this, someone starts up the game, everyone taps their respective controller and occupies a slot, which the game cutely refers to as inserting a coin. You enter a 3 letter name, or choose a previously used one. Then you select a deity to worship (as of writing this review there are 3 deities; two instantly available and 1 unlockable). Your choice of deity decides what sort of beasts you can manifest yourself as to hinder the current hero. The game begins.The current hero is selected randomly from the up-to-4 players, and attempts to crawl through the dungeon as far as possible, amassing gold, buying new items and buffs. All the while, the non-hero players attempt to kill the hero by either manifesting as monsters by activating pentagrams that are one the floor of some rooms, ""going-poltergeist"" and possessing traps or turrets, or summoning slimes that they can stockpile by collecting dust. The non-hero player that kills the hero player gets to continue where the previous hero player left off, albeit without his buffs and items, these have to be collected individually. The object of the game, which you can only progress towards during your time as the hero, is to reach at least level ten so that you can open the boss portal, and defeat the boss. Aside from this the game has intervals everytime a player descends to a lower floor. During these intervals players receive vitae points for everytime an opposing player levelled up on the previous floor. They can use these points to evolve their selection of beasts, making them stronger and a greater threat to opposing heroes. Why I like it so muchThe game offers a simple but very replayable mechanic. The non-hero players work together to try and kill the current hero, but ultimately want to beat the others to land the final blow and secure precious flesh-and-blood hero time. The current hero works to improve their items, spells and buffs so that they can fight off opposing players for longer. The struggle is fast paced, skillful and very fun. After level 10 players have the chance to nab the winner's position by choosing to fight the boss, but they only get so many chances, otherwise they finish last. As more bosses are implemented into the game, the risk of entering the boss portal will become even more interesting; what if its a boss you don't like and you only have one chance left? Maybe you should level further? But what if one of your opponents goes through? So so fun.  "

								This is possibly the single most fun game that I've played locally with 3 other people, and I've had a PS2/3 set up for it in my room for years, specifically for that purpose. The combat is fast paced, brief and exciting, the light RPG elements have your choices affect the game significantly yet don't bog gameplay down because they're nice and simple, the art and animations are ( in my opinion at least ) gorgeous and delightfully crisp, and the sound design perfectly rounds out the frantic action, as well as the parts inbetween. If you've got a couple of controllers and can get some people around a monitor, you would be hugely wronging yourself and your friends to not have this as one of your choices for the night. It really is amazingly fun.			"

								This game is great. If you're on the fence about whether or not to buy this, buy it. Actually, even if you think you don't like it, buy it anyways. This game is fun, and the time I've spent playing seems to just have washed away. This is one of the few games where I feel that the addiction that I get from playing it, is worth it. Pros:  -Requires almost no system specs. Could easily be a smartphone game. (I get ~1000fps... Yeah, it's great) -Fun to play -Very little, if any, learning curve. -Local multiplayer -Controller Support -Up to four players -You can play solo with NPC's -The AI on the NPC's is so good, I would think they're real people if it told me so. -Competetive, and a great game to play with family/friends -Music is great -Different weapons to fit different play styles (I like the claymore, it's got really fast attack speed)Cons: -Not too many cons, this game is pretty good -One little thing: If you are playing the ghost, and you and an allied ghost both happen to spawn the same monster, you    might get mixed up on who is who, because they are the same skin.TL;DRGet this game. It's great.			"

Platform: Ubuntu 14.04 with mid-high specs (see profile for details). Runs absolutely perfectly, with brilliant gamepad support using steamos-dkms xpad drivers. I have a soft spot for local multiplayer, and so I tend to add to basket as soon as I see a game tagged in this way. This review starts by saying that Crawl is potentially one of the best local multiplayer games I've played for a while. I played this game last night with my sister and parents (3 gamepads and myself, the unfortunate soul with the keyboard). I know we'll play again tonight, its that kind of game. Each time you play it begins like this, someone starts up the game, everyone taps their respective controller and occupies a slot, which the game cutely refers to as inserting a coin. You enter a 3 letter name, or choose a previously used one. Then you select a deity to worship (as of writing this review there are 3 deities; two instantly available and 1 unlockable). Your choice of deity decides what sort of beasts you can manifest yourself as to hinder the current hero. The game begins.The current hero is selected randomly from the up-to-4 players, and attempts to crawl through the dungeon as far as possible, amassing gold, buying new items and buffs. All the while, the non-hero players attempt to kill the hero by either manifesting as monsters by activating pentagrams that are one the floor of some rooms, ""going-poltergeist"" and possessing traps or turrets, or summoning slimes that they can stockpile by collecting dust. The non-hero player that kills the hero player gets to continue where the previous hero player left off, albeit without his buffs and items, these have to be collected individually. The object of the game, which you can only progress towards during your time as the hero, is to reach at least level ten so that you can open the boss portal, and defeat the boss. Aside from this the game has intervals everytime a player descends to a lower floor. During these intervals players receive vitae points for everytime an opposing player levelled up on the previous floor. They can use these points to evolve their selection of beasts, making them stronger and a greater threat to opposing heroes. Why I like it so muchThe game offers a simple but very replayable mechanic. The non-hero players work together to try and kill the current hero, but ultimately want to beat the others to land the final blow and secure precious flesh-and-blood hero time. The current hero works to improve their items, spells and buffs so that they can fight off opposing players for longer. The struggle is fast paced, skillful and very fun. After level 10 players have the chance to nab the winner's position by choosing to fight the boss, but they only get so many chances, otherwise they finish last. As more bosses are implemented into the game, the risk of entering the boss portal will become even more interesting; what if its a boss you don't like and you only have one chance left? Maybe you should level further? But what if one of your opponents goes through? So so fun.  "

								I really like the first trailer when it is first announced many months ago. Get this immediately when it goes greenlight. The art style and details in the game is fantastic. The unique two sided game play is refreshing and very fun to play, and enough variety and tricks to keep us playing for hours.While I think it is very fun to play in local multiplayer, if this game offer online multiplayer we can play it more often.

Early Access Review
								I've really liked this game. So far I've been playing it for about an hour and here are some of my first impressions:Gameplay: The gameplay itself is very sleek and smooth. Crawl resembles that of a button mashing arcade figher, which isn't a bad thing. There are two buttons you use to attack (primary and special) which just feels very satisfying. The concept itself is original as well, and that's something I haven't seen in quite a while. It's almost like a multiplayer dungeon crawler King of the Hill RPG. You battle your friends who are attemtping to kill you in order to revive themselves as humans and collect randomized dungeon loot along the way. If you or any of your friends finish off the human, they revive and then have their shot at completing the level. As the ghost characters, you take control of items and can summon monsters which you can evolve. At a certain point along the way you gain enough experience to fight the boss battle. Admittedly, the boss battle did come a little quickly and I had beaten the game before I knew it. However I noticed I unlocked a few items, so I know that coupled with the randomly generated levels means replayability is implied.Art Style: I'm also a fan of this art style which is what first caught my eye. The animations are smooth and the characters are well drawn. I've never been the type to complain about pixel art as if it were an excuse to ""real art""; it looks great. The only issue is I find myself backing away from the monitor to get the full view of some text which is otherwise a little difficult to read from up close.Music: About what you would expect, pretty catchy but has a few points where it appears to stutter.This game is in early stages, and it looks promising. So if it's good now, it can only get better.It's only $10 right now so there's really nothing to lose by giving this a try.I suppose the only thing I'd like to see a network multiplayer. And I understand the naivity of most people who make that statement and don't understand that networking isn't an easy task, but I could see this game being a blast at LAN parties and with friends who don't want to crowd around one screen or use mutliple controllers.

												This game is best played with friends, and it is unfortunate that it still (and probably forever will) lacks any sort of online multiplayer (even LAN would suffice with programs like GameRanger and Hamachi). Disregarding that, Crawl has a great atmosphere, fun and challenging gameplay, and plenty of content to unlock and experience. Overall it's a decent game to play on your own, and much better with others.Also, you could probably run this game on a toaster, I get fps in the thousands			"

								This game is great. If you're on the fence about whether or not to buy this, buy it. Actually, even if you think you don't like it, buy it anyways. This game is fun, and the time I've spent playing seems to just have washed away. This is one of the few games where I feel that the addiction that I get from playing it, is worth it. Pros:  -Requires almost no system specs. Could easily be a smartphone game. (I get ~1000fps... Yeah, it's great) -Fun to play -Very little, if any, learning curve. -Local multiplayer -Controller Support -Up to four players -You can play solo with NPC's -The AI on the NPC's is so good, I would think they're real people if it told me so. -Competetive, and a great game to play with family/friends -Music is great -Different weapons to fit different play styles (I like the claymore, it's got really fast attack speed)Cons: -Not too many cons, this game is pretty good -One little thing: If you are playing the ghost, and you and an allied ghost both happen to spawn the same monster, you    might get mixed up on who is who, because they are the same skin.TL;DRGet this game.

								After a couple hours of gameplay, this is easily one of the most addicting games I've ever played. It's a fairly simple dungeon-crawler, yet it is very enjoyable. Very old-school, which is something I appreciate. In each round there are 4 players. Of these players, 3 are ghosts and 1 is a human. As a ghost, the objective is to work together with the other ghosts to slay the human. This can be done by turning into enemies, activating traps, and summoning blobs. When a human dies, the ghost who landed the killing blow then becomes the human. The goal is to stay human long enough to become level 10, after which you must find a portal and defeat a boss.Pros and Cons:+ Simple to learn, yet hard to master+ Very addictive+ Great multiplayer+ Nonstop action, monster or human+ Well-balanced mechanics (monster strength, health, etc.)+ Old-school, classic video game feeling+ Well randomized, even with small details+ Lots of weapons+ BE THE MONSTER- No online multiplayer- Only 2 bossesAs you can see, I have few complaints about the game. Overall, it is a well-made and very enjoyable game.			"

								Crawl is a fun and new take on the classic dungeon crawler. However, instead of having a party of heroes, venturing into a dusty pit of doom, you have one hero and a party of evil ghosts, trying to kill him and thus take his place as the hero. The version I've played just before the early access started, had three evil gods to worship, each with his own set of horrible upgradeable monsters + tons of magic items for the hero to invest in, including madness inducing swords. And there's more to come!If you love playing with a bunch of friends, this game gets my highest recommendation, even with the content at Early Access release. It's hours of fun for the price and the originality of the gameplay together with the charming blocky art style has already made this one of my favourite local multiplayer games on Steam.			"

								Crawl is a great dungeon crawler with a twist.   It is a unique game in the fact that you succeeding, helps your enemy succeed. There is a cut-throat feeling to it when you are determined to beat it for the first time, but still seek to destroy the hero as the boss, thus destroying your chances of seeing the endgame cutscene.   As for the fact that it isn't multiplayer, it's ten dollars. 4 people can play it local for $2.50 each. It's cheap, even if you only play it once a month.			"

The concept combined with the incredebly well done trailer and the fact it took less than 24 hours to be greenlit (not to mention, only two people were on this project) hooked me right from the start! I waited in anticipation for roughly 7 months (other people have waited for 2-ish years), so you'd expect that there would be A TON of hype, and I'm telling you right now, that all of that hype did not exceed that which this game deserved. To be completely honest, this is the most fun I've gotten out of ANY multiplayer game ever. This is an early access game, so it isn't finished (even though it's pretty much flawless in my opinion). They're going to be adding so much more content that I think may surpass the $9.99 value (which I feel is a perfect price for how much content there is currently). I urge you to consider supporting these two fine gentlemen in their quest to make the ultimate game (which may increase the chances of online multiplayer).EDIT: Just thought I should add a few things based on what i've learned and also on the new update that came out a while ago.I think it's imperative that everyone knows that the devs are actively interacting with the community on a weekly basis and sometimes more often than that. They are two very well mannered gentlemen that love to hear your ideas and definitely take every one of them into consideration. They actively post updates on development weekly and, like I said before, sometimes more often than that. There is promise of a trove of content that I'm pretty confident will come!This update that came out in September practically doubled the content and they almost nailed the ballance on some of the earlier monsters from the first early access build. Just a few ballance issues with a few monsters from this new update need to be worked out, but that's hardly a concern of mine with devs as dilegent as these.I should also note that the community that has been formed around this game is quite lovely and the people in it are very creative! Right now (Nov-december 2014) there's tons of excitement surrounding the release of a new update coming towards the end of December that includes a brand new boss and some other valuable content and the devs have maintained 100% transparency as far as their progress on the implimentation and testing of said boss and content. (aside from surprises that they wish to keep a secret). So you can just head on over to the forums and check that out. Drop in some suggestions if you'd like! (aside from Online Multiplayer, the devs have heard that over and over and over again) We'd love to have you!EDIT EDIT: A lot has happened! A new boss has been added, new gods, more secrets, a new environment, and a wealth of monsters. They've added game changing mechanics and features that really change up where the game goes and can really shift the outcome of a match. They revamped the color pallet so it looks really nice and pretty now. Barney and Dave have really pulled it out in these last few months and have done nothing but improve the game and its value!EDIT: Been a while. We've had quite a few updates since I last updated this review. Added a few monsters, traps, features, etc... I'd say my opinion hasn't changed at all. If it has, it's more positive than before. :)			"

								I love playing this with my son, but I haven't seen any updates from the developers in awhile.  I posted some ideas in the forums that I think would make the game absolutely great and help balance out the late-game where heroes can get really overpowered and cause the game to drag on; but most everyone thinks their ideas are great, don't they?  A large selection of options like in Worms Armageddon and Super Smash Brothers may also boost replayablility and make each game more (or less) interesting.  Anyway, I would like to see that this game continues to develop and hope that it will get more balanced out.  Overall, this game is a 9/10 and definitely worth getting if you've got a few friends to play a local co-op game with.  Lots of replayability!			"

								Finally the release of the game many of us have been waiting to play!The gameplay mechanics are extremely smooth and unlockable characters keeps you excited. Everything from the music to the art is very appealing and just makes the overall experience that much better. Even if you aren't doing very well or don't have the chance to become the hero you can still gather experience and upgrade until it's your turn. Playing alone is also not that bad since you have the option of easy to hard leveled bots to play against.It just a very well balanced game and completely worth the purchase. I just can't wait to get back home from work to continue playing it.Congratulations to the team once more for making this game happen, even after what they have gone through and only being 2 members! Excellent game and looking forward to playing more and also what the game has to offer already!Cheers! :)			"

								Definitely one of my favorite local-coop games and nearly the only one, I play alone, too, from time to time. It's always fun and gets more interesting from run to run, because the game being still in early access, it's getting better and more polished, too. What I really like, you always unlock some new items etc. after a run, sometimes you don't think, they won't change too much, but after the next run you are deeply satisfied.OK: the gameplay: you and your friend/enemies try to get enough experience to defeat a big monster boss. What makes the game interesting: there is only one player that plays a living human being, the other ones are ghosts that can possess different objects/traps in rooms to kill the human or conjure monsters, at certain points. When the human dies, one of the others, a real player or the computer, can have the body of the human. You fight from floor to floor, earning gold, to buy interesting weapons and other upgrades at shops, one shop each floor.I really love the controls, at first they felt clumsy and out of touch, but this is part oft the charme of the game, that it is rather difficult to aim et cetera: just brillant! Because everything in the game fits to each other. I love the retro graphics/pixel art/the music/sound, everything. Only one thing would be a negative aspect for me: there are far too less different end-bosses: there are only two of them.And that makes the end-fights a little bit boring and repetive. I hope for much more (at least five?)!Thanks!If you want a game that gives you deep satisfaction and is perfect for killing some time here and then, without getting addicted, but always to be remembered in the best possible way: give it a chance, it's worth its money!

YouTube™ Video: Crawl - Indie Game Reviews 2017 - Backstab your friends! 

			Views: 105		

			Welcome back to Indie Game Reviews 2017, hosted by ShortGameReviews.com! Today we are going to take a look at the game called ""Crawl"", a dungeon-crawler with strong local multiplayer!		

About the GameCrawl is a peculiar game. It recently left early access, entering the fully released stage. The game’s idea is really original: four players (either bots or humans) are playing at the same time. One of them gets the role of dungeon explorer, going through the dungeon. Other take the roles of ghosts, who can spawn monsters or possess the traps across the rooms. If someone manages to kill the dungeon explorer, he takes his role, while recently deceased player becomes a ghost. The player who manages to get level 10 and kill the dungeon boss wins.The Good•	Really innovative and fun gameplay: there’s also no downtime for anyone, because all players influence the game in a way. It’s like telling a story from two different points of view•	Lots of content and variety: different bosses, monsters, weapons and items. As you play more games, you get more unlocks, diversifying the randomized gameplay even further•	AI is really good•	The game has its own style: the pixel art is well aligned and fits the theme wellThe Bad•	A bit of a snowballing tend to happen. If one player levels up while playing explorer, other players (ghosts) are getting stronger monsters. Technically, that tends to even out the disadvantages (weaker players have stronger monsters -> statistically they tend to kill explorer more and take its role) as the game progresses. But if weaker player gets the role of explorer – he still has to fight the strong monsters of at least two other ghosts which often won’t be in his favor. During the midgame this gap is felt the most, but then it evens out if the game drags on a bit. That’s really the only drawback I can name.•	No online multiplayer: the game could really benefit from it.•	Also, minor thing, but I could not switch active display on my machine (could not move the game to second screen). The option to do this is there, but it did not work if I changed it.SummaryThe game is good in singleplayer, because AI can use the surroundings well and both control and combat the monsters skillfully. However, Crawl shines brightest when played with friends: the hot-cold relationship that turns upside down when someone takes control of the explorer (and the old foe, in turn, becomes somewhat your friend) makes up for a lot of funny and exciting moments. The content unlocks also makes it really replayable. Overall, it’s a solid game with original premise and I highly recommend it.			"

								An incredibly polished and tightly paced experience. I'm having as much fun playing it with my friends as I have playing smashbros and the like. Each game really feels like a mad scramble to steal the human and then decide if you want to stay on a level or rush down to the next. If I have one qualm it would be that one or two of the 4th upgrade monsters feel underwhelming compared to their 3rd level forms. But apart from that the array of different choices for monsters and the human are incredible, nothing is more satifying than beating the boss while intermittently turning into a frog!			"

								Every once in a while, a game comes along that I get obsessed with. I found out about this game while it was still in development in greenlight and I've been hyped about it's release ever since. If their magnificent trailer doesn't sell you on how awesome it is, let me attest that this game is fantastic. I don't advise buying early access games unless they are fun as-is. And this certainly meets that requirement! It is one of the most fun local multiplayer games that I've played since before I became a computer gamer.This does NOT have online multiplayer. As the devs have said, if this a requirement for you just wait for more information. If not, it's a worthwhile purchase.			"

								This game is fantasitc. It is probably my most anticipated Indie game title that I have ever purchased. The game has an extremely unique concept of being a dungeon crawler where other players play as the monsters. Tons of fun to play with friends who come over, considering the game does not have online capabilities.Even though the game is in early access, it still delivers a positive gameplay experience and has a lot of content. The developers spend a lot of time in the discussion forums reading over concerns and suggestions so that they can deliver the best possible gaming experience. I would say that the game is ""safe"" to buy during the early access stage, but is a must have once it is completely finished.			"

Early Access Review
								      Wow, what a surprise. I'm not usually one to pick up early access games as I would prefer to play a finished project, but after seeing this on the Humble store, I  immediately fell in love with the pixel/glitch art style. I checked out the gameplay video and decided to give it a chance.      Crawl starts up as if it's an old school arcade game, asking you to insert coin and enter you initials. Up to four players can play via couch co-op (no online unfotunately, but I think the fast paced gameplay lends itself better to local co-op) using keyboard, mouse or controllers. One player starts as the human character advancing through the dungeon collecting money, loot or finding the exit to the dungeon. The other three player take control of ghosts who can summon creatures or possess traps in the dungeon with the purpose of destroying the human character. Once a ghost player has killed the human player, they become the human. End game happens once a human character destroys the main boss.      As you progress, your character levels up and can buy weapons and equipment that change the way the game is played. In between levels, you can upgrade the monster creatures you send out as a ghost, making the game more difficult as you progress. It's very nicely balanced and I never felt like one player was too strong or weak against other players. While this game is meant to be played with multiple players, I found single player with bots surprisingly challenging, and at times forgot I was playing against the computer.      I highly recomend Crawl if your looking for a frantic couch co-op game to play with your friends, or just looking for a fast paced arcade style game to play by yourself. With the added promise from the developers of more creatures, dungeons, and items to be added in the future, as well as the $10 price tag, you really can't go wrong with this one.			"

								We’ve all played RPG’s before with friends at our side, but what happens when your friends control the monsters instead? Developed by the two man team over at Powerhoof, Crawl is a local co-op dungeon crawler for up to four players, and provides the answer to that very question.In a rather interesting turn of events, one of you controls the hero, slaying monsters, gaining levels, and buying loot, while the other 3 players use ghosts to possess traps or summon monsters with the simple goal of killing you to become the hero instead. The point of Crawl is to survive long enough to reach level 10, then activating a portal to the final boss encounter. The player that reaches and defeats the final boss first wins the game.If you have local friends who frequent your house, Crawl is an insanely good time. Its short 30-minute games, combined with its accessible pick-up-and-play control scheme, make it ideal for parties or for larger groups of people to pass the controllers around. However, if you’re running solo, you’ll most likely grow tired of fighting the A.I. rather quickly and there isn’t anything to do after that.Full review: http://wp.me/p2go2D-4Gd "

								I cannot stop playing this game, and if it's supposed to get any better then holy crap do I have even more reason to play this over and over again! I have 2-4 people playing this game and swapping in and out, but the game is even great by yourself! The game is a constant stuggle to see who can last the longest and who can crush the hero the quickest! It's also a moment of literally bloody tension to see who last-hit the hero. Even with only one boss and a medium range of monsters, this game has kept me Crawling with excitement up to and after release and I hope it only gets better from here! May I suggest online multiplayer (even though I love the couch co-op, I would like to mix it up some), some different ""slime"" enemies you can spawn as a ghost, and maybe an elimination or some other gamemodes?

								It looks at tad simple at first, but after playing even one game the player will soon realise just how deep everything in this game really is. The combat, the evolution system, the bosses and gods (both will be expanded upon in the not-so-distant future incidentally, or so the VERY friendly people behind this game are stating) all blend together to create a deep and enjoyable experience. Literally the only downside to this game is it's lack of an online multiplayer system, though for what it's worth the bots are very human like and responsive as well.Special shout out to the visual style of the game, it's simply fantastic, and the sound effects which make every attack seem to have a special kind of weight to it.8/10, as petty as it sounds I'd bump it up to an easy 9/10 if it had online multiplayer simply because this is the kind of game that goes so well with a crowd of friends to play it with, and many such as myself rarely have the time (or in my case even spare controllers) to get a group together and crowd around a computer screen. Everything else, from the combat to the purchases to the monster evolution system is superb.			"

								This game.... I had seen the Yogscast play it for their Yogsclash, and since then, I had been waiting for this game to release Early Access. It is a highly addictive game specifically designed to play with friends. If you don't have any friends to play with, that's sad... but okay, as well, because Bots are able to be played against, as well. I highly recommend the game to anyone that wants a creative twist on the classic Dungeon Crawling theme.			"

								WOW!!!!!Just bought this today after following the game in its development and boy does this game gives you the RUSH!All the reviews you have been reading are true!Controls are smooth and the attacks available are enough although soon you realize the action is not just button smash instead you need to plan your attacks and dodge / other special abilities you unlock to survive! :DAction is heavy and you need to be quick on your feet to anticipate the enemy!Played with bots now and 'normal' level is quite tough hope I can survive the 'hard' level :PI have only played for around 25 minutes and I am already a fan! This game has huge potential in the future with more additional contents and stuff do which will broaden the game mechanics such as different game modes and more stuff to unlock and explore!With online multiplayer promised in the future this game is a piece of gold....PROS:+Varied Enemy who can be further be evolved with unique evolution trees! Sweet!+Competitive Multiplayer, at no time do you feel that someone is winning through button smashing, you die because you suck...+Loot is in form of XP and Blood (for ghosts) which can be traded with the blacksmith to buy higher level gear!+Balanced mechanics (yet) although I dont feel balance will be an issue as the developers are hard against imbaness....+Random Level Generation+Bot AI+Sweet Retro GraphicsCONS:-Lack of Content at present there is only 1 boss and limited Gods(used for enemy set choice) to start with but this is an early access wait until they add more ;)-Lack of more stuff / goals / game modes but at this point also gives you a focus, however in the long run I feel more varierty and goals will help enrich the experience and replaybilityThanks for reading!

Early Access Review
								Great game. One of the best games I've ever played. This is an addictive, competitive, dungeon crawler that will keep you on the edge of your seat when fighting friends. Most of the monsters seem balanced and are very fun to use.However...Monsters Problems- The Green Shaman monster thing that summons the zombies need to be nerfed to hell and back. It's very very fast, and has so much health. Not to mention that the slime it leaves behind slows you down so much it's not even a fun challenge. The tentacle things need to have slightly lower health and weak attacks also. The one that is able to go underground and then come back up and attack you is way too ogrepowered. It need to have lower health or do less damage, or not be able to go underground as often. The other one's not as bad, but the tentacles it makes come from the ground are SUPER bulky and take up the whole screen! The minotaur that stems from the rat monster needs to be slower or have a longer recharge on it's sprint. I'm really good with a bow and it frustrates my friends when I kill them because they can't even reach me due to me speeding around the map so often. Other than these specific monsters, I can't really think of anything else in the monster catagory.Boss Problems- Kourok needs to have more health and need to be stronger. Something about Kourok needs to be stronger because anytime someone activates the portal, it's either guarunteed death, (Ghidraak) or a free pass to beat the game. Kourok is nowhere near as strong as Ghidraak and is too easy of a boss. Ghidraak is WAY TOO STRONG! I have probably beaten this boss maybe 3-4 times when fighting it. It is incredibly overpowered in full dragon form, but the fact that EACH INDIVIDUAL HAED GETS THEIR OWN LIFE AFTER DETACHMENT completely breaks the game. You struggle through enough with fighting the boss. Some people are probably saying ""That's why the healer is there!"", but it doesn't matter! Even if the healer doesn't get hit AT ALL to where he doesn't run away, he only drops 3-4 health orbs at the MOST. It MIGHT be okay for Ghidraak's head to each have a second chanceif their ealth wasn't so high. Their health is the same as if not more that it takes to knock it off of the dragon body in the first place.PLEASE PLEASE POWERHOOF! FIX GHIDRAAK!!!! PLEASE! The ending of the game literallly depends on if the human gets Ghidraak or Kourok, and that's really unbalanced and unfair. It needs to come down to the players skill, and no matter how much skill you have, it's near impossible to kill Ghidraak, even without competant playuers. (I just ten minutes ago fought Ghidraak and was versing an ""easy"" bot, and lost. I am very good at this game and have played for wuite a while. PLEASE CHANGE GHIDRAAK!)			"

								This game is great! The graphics really aren't too bad, and besides, I vastly prefer well-made 2D graphics to fuzzy, badly made 3D graphics any day. Very fun gameplay, and I like the fact that you can, for once play as the traps as well as the monsters. My only real problem with this game is the aiming, and the fact whatever you are shooting goes whichever way you are facing. This makes ranged monsters/heroes feel uncontrollable at times. I would like to see some more content, such as new monsters and equipment, as well as maybe a couple of new traps. I also think the Gatekeeper is a bit easy, and could perhaps have some more health.Apart from that this game is AWESOME! I highly recommend it to anyone who likes dungeon crawl games, as well as Dungeons and Dragons players. By which I mean, of course, PROPER D&D, the Pen and Paper games, not that stupid Neverwinter game made by Perfect World. That game sucks.Anyway, DEFINITELY a reccomendation. They are still bringing out more content for about another year, and after that the price is going up, probably to this games actual worth, about $20. Definitely get it soon!			"

								Yeah, I didn't play that game for long, but my reason is that I want to enjoy it with my friends. This is definetly a game you should play with your buddies. It is a dungeon crawler, but the most authentic and unusual one you have ever played. And you know what? It works out really well. The pixelart looks awesome and I really dig the music which fits the artstyle perfectly. Really cool music and presentation and I didn't even get to the gameplay. This dungeoncrawler lets you fight against your friends. Your friends are actually the enemy, not the AI as it usually would be in a coop game. At first, all the players fight against each other and the last one alive gets to ""crawl"" the dungeon while his friends try killing him as all sorts of mobs. The variation is really surprising, you play a fish, a undead, a samurai and so much more. Those are the opponents of the human player. As soon as one of the dead players kills the human one, he gets to be human. This sounds really weird but it totally works and is probably lots of fun together. I really love that the game finishes so complete. The animations in the menu alone are cool with the music.			"

								While on the surface Crawl may not look like much, it only gives you short play sessions and the gameplay is pretty straightforward, it's way too plain.YOU'RE DEAD WRONGCrawl may only have short play sessions and generally simple gameplay, however, the experience that is delivered throughout that short period of time is like no other. You play as the monsters to regain your humanity or fight as a human to keep your humanity. This extremely unique multiplayer experience cannot be overlooked. The only real problem comes in with...limited multiplayer options. Fighting AI controlled bots is more entertaining than you might think however, the serious problem arises with there being only local multiplayer. Although you can play a smooth two-player match with one person on mouse and one on keyboard, online or at least LAN multiplayer would truly make this game much more enjoyable. All in all, the gameplay may be short-lived but it leaves you wanting more, and although multiplayer is still a bit of a problem, it still provides hours of entertainment.Pros:   +Unique gameplay experience   +Outdated yet good looking Graphics   +Endless replay value   +Game is simple enough to be played just with a mouse, allowing for a smooth two-player match (As long as you have a keyboard as well)Cons:   -Multiplayer is limited to local (Quite a drawback) May want to wait until it's finished before purchasing			"

												This game is a gem of local co-op fun and chaos.I took about 30-40 minutes per game with 2 humans and 1-2 AI players, and the game pacing felt about right. Crawl itself has a crazy simple design, looks and feels like an old arcade game (only 2 buttons, and one stick) I played with a controller and loved it (haven't yet tried the mouse). As simple as it was on paper, playing the hero took some work (monsters actually felt more responsive and intuitive, controllwise, than the hero), aiming ranged weapons took finesse, and missing a special or crucial attack because the target was moving around was heartbreaking, but  each time I moved to deny either my friend or the AI my precious humanity was a moment of absolute triumph. The cutscenes between hero death and the new hero entering the game gave the unfortunate loser a chance to exclaim thier losses, while the winner exclaimed thier victory.The Games basic premise is refreshing, with 4 players all competeing for the chance to be a hero and defeat the boss. The switch off between being the hero, a monster, a trap and a ghost was enjoyable. Best moment was when I realized that the final boss was also controlled by the ghosts, and I took great pleasure in shooting my friend with a simple, but really enjoyable array of attacks. The ghosts will need to work together to take down the hero, because although they outnumber him, most of the time the hero has more health, and often does more damage (depending on monster level), when an AI hero battle began my friend and I would quickly talk strategy and each try to exploit the hero's predicament in order to land the final blow ourselves.The chaotic and quick pace that ensued was enjoyed by all, and even though we didn't win the match, simply playing the game was enjoyable.  Finaly, after finishing the match we got to see the new items we unlocked for our next game, I can't wait to try and find them all.For an early access game feels both polished, and nuanced.8.9/10, can't wait to see what this game becomes!EDIT: With New Bosses, New Monsters and Tons More to Explore I am more excited than ever to keep on exploring the dungeon.. I got goosebumps when I saw the release trailer, and I can honestly say that I expect the next few evenings are going to be spent in the company of friends trying to brutally murder each in CRAWL.

								Dungeon hack and slash where your friends try to murder you. Then you murder them. It's a vicious, wonderful cycle.It's got a play-with-bots mode, which is nice, but couch multiplayer is where it's at.			"

								This game is the competitive all-for-one game you never knew you wanted.Seriously, everything from the graphics to the gameplay is amazing.oh and the soundtrack.THE SOUNDTRACK.My only gripe with the game is the way the unlocking things works, it's a blessing and a curse.You get new stuff after every game, but it makes the first few games feel a little empty.The game is still amazing though, get it.9/10 overall, worth every penny and some.

								I just got this game and it gives a very dungeon crawling and addictive experience. Its recently updated and you can fight against AI or your friends. The most addicting part is that you unlock something new just by finishing a game. I would recommend this to anyone who likes huge amounts of content to unlock.			"

								This is one of the most fun games that I have ever played. Crawl is a fun arcade-style game where the game shifts from co-op to survival and is completely competitive. As you can see, my friends and I have played this for several hours and had a blast doing so. There are lots of strategies, weapons, and monsters to learn about it if everyone that is playing starts getting really good, but before then it is fairly simple to pick up and has not yet gotten repetitive. It is also continuing to be updated with new monsters, skills, and items since when this review was posted. Great work and keep it up!			"

								Crawl is an awesome multiplayer (local) game in which you, your friends and AI will control up to 3 ghosts. The players will be competing for gold and experience while traversing a dungeon. One player will spawn as the hero, and the remaining players will start as ghosts. The currently alive player will move from room to room, coming across pentagrams in most rooms. The ghosts can activate these to summon one of 3 monsters chosen in a kit at the start of the game. Should a ghost deal the killing blow on the player, they spawn as the hero and must continue the dungeon! Each floor has a shop and boss ring the player can interact with, as well as other wishing wells and a few other entitys to work with. The combat is fun, there's plenty of weapons the store offers, plenty of artifacts to modify the character, as well as spells to get from the shop. Pros: A fun (currently local) fighting game for friends to challenge each other in. Plenty of weapons to choose from, a good bit of item variation. Lots of unlocks to encourage replayability. Challenging bosses that force the ghost/players to work together to kill the hero/playerMore content to come! The combat is solid and fun. Nice design for a minimalist/pixel game.Cons: While maps are randomly generated, there isn't any difference in backgrounds or themes at this time of review The sound is very harsh and not appeasing at all.

								I thoroughly enjoy Crawl. The graphics and simple controls give a really nice asthetic feel to the game, like something you'd play on an old console. Despite it's apparent simplicity, Crawl is anything but.The game handles the fast paced action of The Hero (you) being attacked by all of the Spirits (your friends) incredibly well. The team work potential of Spirits to destroy The Hero, using the huge number of combinations of items, monsters, and traps that exist gives the game a lot of replay value.A few parts beautiful graphics, several parts chaotic action, one part slow motion, Crawl is a great game that will (probably) cement your bonds of friendship with friends.Clever trash talk not included.

								Crawl is a well put-together, accessible, couch-co-op game. The become the monster dynamic is unique and well implemented. I play this game with my kids and they always feel like an active part of the game even if they are not the main hero. The unlockable gods, unlockables, items, etc. are a cool incentive to keep playing.The boss battles currently in the game are a bit lopside. One is far easier than the other, but I'm hopeful more challenging battles will be added as the game is developed. Looking forward to more content on this title as time goes along.			"

								Awesome game with a pretty unique concept. It's a blast to play with friends and very easy to pick up and play, yet has a ton of replay value. Bought it on a whim because three friends and I were bored and we were hooked instantly and played nonstop for the next 4 hours. Seems super polished, even in early access and the devs obviously put a lot of love into it. The only downside I could see would be that it probably isn't something you would want to play alone, though it IS possible by turning on bots. The game was made for local multiplayer and it does an amazing job of fitting the role.			"

								The game overall if fun if you have friends at home. It's great for that local co-op feel back in the old controller game world. A fun favorite for anyone who likes dungeons and monsters and could have people over. With that said, you can not play online with friends outswide your room, which is a huge fault in my opinion. I truely wish to play this game with others, because I lack friends near me, most are online or too far to come over for a simple thing that would be done better over the net.			"

								MAN, where do I start. Ok first of if you enjoy classic 8 bit style games or their modern counterparts such as Terraria, Risk Of Rain, Super Meat Boy, Shovel Knight, then I would take good hard look at Crawl.What's so fun about it? For one it has a very fitting, nostalgic, well made soundtrack. You're given many controller options and the controls them selves are very simple and In addition, are very responsive. They don't feel goofy or sloppy. *UNLESS* you choose to use the mouse as your controller, I wouldn't recommend it.The level design is randomized, you will never play a game and feel like you've been on a particular level before, it just doesn't get old. The scenery always seems fresh.The game is stable I've played around 37 hours so far and bugs as well as crashes are rare. It's most likely not a game you're going to be frustrated by because it crashes every 20 minuets.The AI is actually very enjoyable to play with, it's surprising how clever they can be at times which provides a highly entertaining experience. With few bugs to mention besides occasionally getting trapped it's a great addition which allows you to play offline any time.I could go on about the large selection of weapons, unique items, buffs, monsters, mini bosses, bosses, statues, traps. But that would take a long♥♥♥♥♥time.  To keep this short, In the end, for $10 this game is dripping with content, and quality, and fun times.The only thing that I'd warn of, is that the game isn't online multiplayer, only local multiplayer (as in) you plug in 4 controllers to one computer and you can play with 4 friends like a console.Online would be a great addition but it's not currently avalible.

								I don't often review games. However, Crawl is probably one of the coolest time wasters I've ever played. The only drawback for this game, is that it only supports local multiplayer. I'm hoping this is an added feature in the near future. Playing single player (yes, it supports bots) is extremely fun - but I imagine this game's value increases 1,000 fold when playing with good friends. A ton of reviews on here already go over the game concept. So let this be another positive review for the pile in case you're wondering if it's worth the $10 purchase. Do it.			"

								I thoroughly enjoy Crawl. The graphics and simple controls give a really nice asthetic feel to the game, like something you'd play on an old console. Despite it's apparent simplicity, Crawl is anything but.The game handles the fast paced action of The Hero (you) being attacked by all of the Spirits (your friends) incredibly well. The team work potential of Spirits to destroy The Hero, using the huge number of combinations of items, monsters, and traps that exist gives the game a lot of replay value.A few parts beautiful graphics, several parts chaotic action, one part slow motion, Crawl is a great game that will (probably) cement your bonds of friendship with friends.Clever trash talk not included.

								Crawl is the definition of party games to play when you want to start a fight with your friends. Crawl is a co-op(or single player with bots) retro arcade simulator fantasy dugeon crawler. Aiding yourself with powerups, spells and abilities, and tons of unique weapons, the hero must fight through levels and levels of dungeon against player coltrolled monsters. As you get stronger, so do the monsters. As a human player your goal is to reach level 10 and kill the boss(which is also player controlled). However, everyone else plays the roll of the monsters and traps in the dungeon which constantly evolve and become more and more difficult. If you are killed you become a ghost and your killer becomes the hero. See where this is going? This game has competition and rage written all over it. One can play a quick game within 15-20 min, but the longer the game lasts the more exiting it tends to be. The developers are constantly releasing new content and making the game better and better with each update. For anyone who enjoys dungeon crawlers or simply wants a game to play with their friends, this game is for you.			"

A unique take on normal multiplayer dungeon crawlers because 1 player fights as the hero to kill monsters and the boss while the others are ghosts who take control of mosters and bosses to beat the hero whoever kills the hero becomes the hero and the ex hero becomes a ghost. The first person to beat the boss wins, but all players have a combined 3 chances to win against the boss. If the boss wins on the 3rd try the players controlling the boss win and the hero loses. Super addictive and fun. But only has 4 player local multiplayer and no online multiplayer.			"

The game Crawl is fast paced, action packed, and ultimately a great way to test your friendship. Surely this retro four player game is what feels good for a competitive afternoon of doing nothing and contemplating how to escape the bowels of hell or just being bitter to the point that knowing you won't win... NO ONE WILL WIN. Though it doesn't have online multiplayer the local multiplayer is delightful. I apoligize if I implied you might actually have fun with friends (internet friends don't count by the way). Most of the time no one wins to escape this heliish 8-bit nightmare, but when you do win the ambrosia of victory is quite delectable.			"

 Crawl  delivers just what it promises: A local multiplayer crawler type game with superb art and a great style and feel to it. From what little I have played of it I would definitely recommend it. The game is well balanced, with one player taking on the role of hero, while the other three play as the ghastly dwellers of the dungeon, aiming to defeat the hero for their own benefit and to regain their mundane form. In terms of combat the game flows very well, loot and different weapons can be aquired throughout the dungeon, and can be unlocked as you progress. There are different active abilities that the hero can preform, all from AoE damage to your more typical combat rolls. There are also plenty of different monsters with varied playstyles, tactics and various evolutions for the opposing players to control. The spirits can also possess various traps with different effects throughout the dungeon.As it is only in early access, I can't wait to see this game developed even further in the future with even more content.

								This game is... I don't know how to even appropriately state how fun this game is. A blast with friends or even just with the computer. When this game is no longer early access and more content is added, currently there's only two bosses, I will say it's easily worth the money, because it's already easily worth the money.			"

								When I saw the trailer for this game, admittedly it made me weak and sent a shiver down my spine. The idea and setting of the game is utterly marvelous. Not only creeping through a dungeon with your friends trying to cause your downfall, but with care, they can take that delicious chance of freedom from you is so very entertaining. I personally love the art style, it's suitable and really helps set the theme for this dark dungeon crawl. The controls are simple, yet very satisfying, every strike with a blade and every dodge to spare your life is as satisfying as any. Not to mention the monsters you encounter, some you love and some you hate, but that makes you fight so much harder just to make sure you do not see your grinning friend shout in success as he steals your humanity. Though many people have complained about an online functionality, I understand however am not too upset by it. If there is not going to be an online function however, I would like to see some improvements to the AI. Often I've found the AI to act in peculiar ways, like they're on a cycle, letting another AI or player get away with things completely at certain times and it's tremendously obvious when they do so. I'd like to see the AI be a little more dynamic and not quite so inclined to help each other, it is a desperate fight for freedom after all. Aside from that however, so far into the Early Access I am loving the game, and hope many more do. Absolutely  worth the price, and the fun to be had.			"

												This might just be the best dungeon-crawler game I have ever played.Four major reasons for this:1) The unique gimmick of going back and forth between hero and monster.2) Amazing visual style (It reminds me of Atari games, but with a lot more 'flourish')3) Replayablity4) Tons and tons of unlockablesIf you are a fan of dungeon-crawler games with some unique twists and fair challenges, this is the game you should definitely check out.And if you have one or two friends who also like such a game, you guys will have hours upon hours of local co-op fun. There's nothing more amazing than trying to destroy your friends as all the monsters and traps the dungeons have to offer...			"

								Crawl is a chill game for those late nights when you want to sit back, listen to some music, and enjoy one-hand gaming. While it is primarily multiplayer (Players on the same system) the AI for this game is sufficient for an enjoyable experience.Scaling in this game is wonderful with playthroughs ranging from 5 minutes to an hour plus if you just want to max everything out and fight against high difficulty monsters.The final bosses (at the moment being the two) are very easy to garuantee a victory potentially ending the game too early to experience late game content.Controls are fair, plays smoothly and there is no state of (full) debilitation, and the writing is worth turning off anything you have running in the background just to hear.

								What a great experience!Really fun and kinda of adticve. Kinda because I don´t recomend play hard on it, it is more of a Party Play, gather some friends, open some beers, take turns (if more than 4 friends) and have a lot of fun. The main ideia is that a main character fights rooms in dungeons to lvl up to 10, buy itens, and prepare for the boss battle. The other guys tries to kill that main character, either by controlling the enviroment or buy summing slimes and monsters that can be upgrated. They can even control the boss to kill the main one. Whoever kill the main character is revived and this process goes on and on until some you kills the boss, and wins the match. Every match has a different dungeon, and new challenges.Pros: * Really fun * Party play game * Unique Gameplay * Unloackables that extends gameplay * Awesome skills * Awesome Monsters to upgrade and kill the main character Cons: * I dont recomend playing for a looong time with the same guys, because it can get a lit bit repetive and annoying, mostly for the ghosts. * One must love pixels "

								Crawl is- and always will be, in my opinion, one of the best games of all time. So many hidden references and jokes, but yet incripted, et cetera as to stay in the same atmosphere, its mechanics, and gampeplay, and just about everything I can think of about this game is perfect. I mean, to think it is only £7, to think that it is only early access, well, in the future I cant even think on how they can improve the perfect, but Im sure Those 2 creative people down there will find a way, for whatever choice they make, even if they poke fun at a real religion, would be done in such a way nobody would care! The concept of the game is, when you start, everything is glitchy. >:D. Ok, so, it causes a good unsettlement at the start, thats ok. then you start playing with a friend. And then you realise the TRUE PERFECTION THE GAME IS!!!! I mean, I have a friend who owns it, and I am sharing it using the steam library, but I AM SO BUYING THIS GAME ANYWAY! You start as one of you a human, entering a place, and walking around, when there are pentagrams. Your friend, a ghost, goes up to them AND BECOMES A MONSTER AND YOU FIGHT AND THE MONTER KILLS YOU, AND THEN THE MONSTER BECOMES A HUMAN AND YOUR THE GHOST!!! THEN YOU LEVEL UP AND KEEP ON DOING THE SAME THING, AS DIFFERENT MONSTERS, AND THEN YOU GO TO THE NEXT FLOOR AND EVOLVE THEM UNTIL YOU BEAT A BOSS AND WIN! Unfathomably great, atmospheric and suiting music, insrutably satifsying and fun gampeplay, concept, et cetera. All in all, I rate this game: 11/8. Must buy. as soon as I get the money I am going to get another game for my own. Not because I cant play it, but so the develepors get the money they deserve.P.S. when you call yourself something, name yourself HL3. that, on its own, is worth the £7.			"

								This is one of my new favorite games on Steam, hands down. Like a normal Dungeon Crawler, you go from room to room fighting off monsters. However in Crawl, the players play as the monsters, all trying to attack the main player. The goal of the game as a monster is to kill the human player and take their place, while the goal of the human is to kill as much as possible and gain XP points. You win the game if you're the player and you go into the boss room and destroy the boss. (The other players also control the boss too!) However, you may only do this at level 10. If the players fail to slay the boss 3 times, the player who fought the third time is removed from the game forever. (And I'm not kidding, it actually deletes your name!)If you have friends locally, this is for you. Just grab a couple of controllers. And no, unlike 70% of steam games with controller support, it DOESN'T need to have XInput. The devs of this game were sure to incorporate as much controllers as possible. As long as it has a USB that you can stick into your computer the controller probably works. Did I mention the game only uses 3 buttons and a d pad? (2 not including the start button) Haven't tested it, but this should work in theory: http://www.amazon.com/Classic-USB-NES-Controller-PC/dp/B002YVD3KMIf you want one of the best local play experiences you'll ever have, buy now. Also the game devs are really active in the community pumping out updates like mad.Positive Features:-Up to 4 Players Locally-Single player mode with AIs-TONS of controller options-Innovative control scene-Active Devs (As of now)-Low Price-High Repeatability-Cabinet mode (You may hook the game up to an arcade machine!)Negative Features:-No online support yet. May not come for a while. Don't buy the game hoping for online support, it's clearly not it's focus, although it may come in the future.Overall, this game is wonderful locally. If you're having a party or just inviting friends over, this is a must have. It's still fun with bots, but not as good with other people, I haven't played much single player but I know it's kind of a mixed response, some like it and some don't. I like it though.Also you can fight Gabe Newell. He hits you with his custom skinned digital knives. 10/10			"

								Let me start out to say this, I love this game. I found it by scrolling down some Local-multiplayer games and it caught my eye. It looked beautiful as a retro styled game. As I have some nearby friends who can't just go out and buy things on Steam so we could just play online, this local game, is perfect! The game is simple too! Theres 2 buttons, 1 for attack and the 2nd one for a spell or dodge. There are many ways you can buy, so that each item you find you wonder 'how will this come to my advantage'. I recommend this game for you if you're looking for a good simple local-player game!			"

								First impressions written  20. Nov. 2014:One of the best and probably the most competetive local coop games I ever played.It's worth every cent!Addition from 17. Apr. 2015:Since my last ""review"" the game has already doubled in size of content and it is constantly getting better, still being in ""work in progress"" state.Everytime I start the game just to have a quick match and take a look at whats new I end up playing 4 or 5 matches and forcing my self to quit playing. This game is fun! Even in single player mode playing against bot enemies!So if you like couch coop games, I'd definately say ""go for it!"".			"

								Great game, really polished.  Everything from the animations, to the special fx and sound is just killer.The best part of the game is it brings back the co-op play back into gaming.    Even more impressive is if you don't have any friends, you can enable bots who are very skilled at the game.  Their behavior is pretty impressive.It does take a little bit to get used to the controls and the timing/aiming of attacks.The weapon/enemy power ups already seem pretty robust for an EAG.  I can't wait to see what other cool stuff they add.My first play through with 2 players and no bots took 40 minutes, we were both able to upgrade out creatures to max level and got some pretty sweet weapons.  So there isnt too much content to the game, but the replay value is off the charts.Worked great with my wired xbox 360 controller.			"

								Just played through my first game with bots.  So fast paced and cool. Really never played anything like it.  So much fun once you figure out what's happening.  Now I'm off to play real humans...UPDATE: The only thing I didn't realize is that it's multiplayer from one PC.  Meaning I don't see any network or online support for playing others.  You all have to be playing on one system.  I certainly don't have a way for 4 people to play from my PC.  I don't know if network support is planned for the future since this is an early access game but I'm sure if they do the sales will skyrocket. Super fun game.			"

								Rating: 7.5/10What I like:-The game is awesome, it provides hours of fun if your alone and whenever I have friends over we play and we dont stop.-I think that the graphics are very fun and I espically like the art on the all of the monsters.-Being both sides are fun and enjoying to play, and I love how its easy to make a come back-I adore the boss the fights and all the little things you have to micro manage, and the fact that you have to work with the other ghosts to bring down the heros is honestly one of the most fun things What I didn't like:-I think it would be awesome if this game supported online play, but I understand if the developer wasnt going for that.Everything in this game felt smooth and awesome, and if I ever get behind and am the monster for too long I always can get ahead by getting better monsters and then becoming the hero. The cooprative play feels good and thought out, it may be simple but it feels great. I play this game whenever I am feelin really bored and want a challenge or whenever my friends are over. I fully recommend this game.			"

								Keep up the good work, really enjoyed this title and it has potential to go places in the local co-op world. If you bring it to online even better!  Traps could use a little work to be more effective (not sure how) and blobs could be beefed up a lil bit to aid in making traps better. My thoughts being if you have to dash in and hammer on a blob mid trap you will take some damage. Also can you posses traps before the monster spawns are cleared? Sometimes I want to throw some spikes around before I become a monster, just a thought. Of course the biggest pull for myself will be level changes, mainly for enviroment sake and more bosses, which i'm sure with time and Support will come to be. Crawl on!			"

If you land the killing blow on the hero in the process you then become the hero and now are trying to race to level 10 so you can kill the boss and win the game.7/10 Dungeon Crawl Party Game			"

								At the beginning, this game worth to play. It is a game which you can play with your other 3 friends-or bots if you have less friend, offline by using keyboard, mouse and two joysticks. One to be a hero and the other contrl the creeps(read the game instruction). It is not only kill their contrling creeps, but also cooperate with your other creeps which your friend's contrling,  against the hero to slow him go furder and earn the blood to upgrade your creeps, or just kill him-when you think he is suck, too weak in the other word- to be a hero-then you will be the hero. The hero would upgrade- of course -and also can buy the magic, item, weapon and so on to be more stronger. When the hero upgrade to lvl10, the hero can activate the charm to teleport to the final boss room. The boss would be contrled by other players, cooperate to kill the hero. If the boss kills the hero, the game will continue, otherwise, game over, the hero who kills the boss wins. The charm can only activate 3 times, after 3 times, game over also (I forget who will win in this case because no boss alives in our hands). Its really fun to play with your friends, more players, more passionate. Really, really worth to play. Go buy it and play with your girl friend now, and you will break up by my will, ha-ha.CHINESE先说，这游戏值得一玩。这是一个4人游戏，跟朋友一起玩特别嗨，除非你的朋友很少，那你可以跟电脑玩儿。这游戏就是一个人扮演英雄，其他人扮演怪。具体游戏是什么个玩法，自己看游戏介绍。我想说的是，这不只是一个杀怪的游戏，怪之间要懂得配合，把英雄当BOSS打。或者说，你觉得这英雄太菜了，就干掉他（抢人头！），自己当英雄。怪可以靠攻击英雄打出的伤害获得BLOOD来升级，英雄可以击杀怪物获得经验升级，然后获取金币去商店购买物品、魔法、武器等等用来加强自己的东西。10级之后就可以激活符咒开BOSS房打BOSS了，总共有3次挑战BOSS的机会，控制怪的玩家控制BOSS攻击英雄，杀了他之后会损失一次挑战BOSS的机会。谁干掉了BOSS，就谁赢。要是3次全失败，呃，反正我们没有失败过3次我不知道会发生啥事。跟基友们一起玩特别基情，人越多越基情，真心值得一玩。快买买买，然后跟你女朋友玩儿去。然后就会正如我所愿的分手的。哈-哈。			"

								Reminds me of a faster version of gauntlet from the arcade, except you can kill your friends!!!!!I really do love this game, I just wish I had some friends closer to me I could play with.Only real drawback is that it doesnt have online multiplayer, but I understand why the devswould just stick with single player with ""splitscreen"" multiplayer.

								This is an absolutely fantastic game for local multiplayer. The single player is still a blast but this really shines when you get a couple friends together and wreck each other.  Conceptually, this is genius. I feel online multiplayer is the only thing that it is lacking but the updates keep rolling in so who knows what this game will be like once it officially launches.  Highly recommend giving this a shot.			"

You and up to 3 people will be trying to kill the lone dungeon adventurer, however only the person who kills the adventurer becomes the new one.  Only one person can win, but you can all lose as well.  I highly reccomend you get this game if you and a couple buddies want a good time.			"

								Great for coop! Interesting competitive mechanic where everything changes and you want to be the guy to kill the hero, for a chance to win yourself. Graphics are colourful and the monsters and scenery are well designed. It's satisfactory even as a dungeon crawl, with weapons to upgrade and artifacts of power.Best played in a 4 player group, but it still works with less players. And played in single player against bots it's not that bad either. Recommended for it's original gameplay mechanics in a ""you get to be the bad guys"" style.			"

I like how you can level up your character and monsters at the end of each level. Great retro graphics, great controls, cool soundtrack. Overall totally worth the ten bucks, even if you only play the game once with some friends its worth it! All that and the game isn't even done, can't wait to see the finished product.

								This game is great..But its overpriced.I feel like they really should have made more out of this game. It starts out great.. you trucking along and oh.. whats this portal.. hmm level 10 to use portal gotchya... then you make to level 10.. omg portal takes you to boss ... ok... kill boss... game over... 10 mins... beat the game... wtf i have only played the game for 1.8 hours and i have beat it like 6 times. i get that this is supposed to be more of a couch game and a multiple person game but the bots do a good job. The game play is fun. upgrading weapons is fun. and the currency system feels great. but the game is SOOOOOO short. i was super pumped that the game was level based... then you kind of realize that each level is kind of the same... and it almost seems like they are random generated. so there is no outside... there is no travel or anything like that.  i would have loved to see this in a more open style with armor upgrading aswell.. toss in a minor storyline and some different worlds and more bosses and you have youself a hell of a game. so... overall i would still recommend it... but i feel like 10 dollars is too much... 4 dollars seems more legit for the amount of gameplay you actually get out of it. but still pick it up for the expirence lol			"

								Most of the time when I find a game based on such a fantastic idea it falls flat of my expectations. Crawl was not one of these games. I bought Crawl because I was looking for a game I could play a local multiplayer game with my friends but I wasn't expecting to have such a great time. Hour after hour we killed each other and every game played out differently. I am excited for the future of this game and can't wait to sahre this gem with all of my friends.			"

								For the unacquainted... 'Crawl' is a dungeon crawler with fluid pixel gameplay and mechanics. It, in its current build, it is a 4 player local multiplayer game where the friends you play with are the monsters, bosses and environmental hazards you must overcome. One player plays as the human, whilst the rest of the players take control of the ghosts of comrades that were slain by the human. If a ghost manages to kill the human, that player gains humanity and takes the place of that human. All players must fight amongst each other for this humanity, reach level 10 and kill the boss (of which, each player takes control of a section of the boss). As the human improves, the ghosts/monsters evolve stronger too. This chaotic and entertaining Indie game has brilliant potential, updates and adds new content quite often.If you ever see this game on sale and have at least one local friend also possessing a mouse and a keyboard, I urge you to buy this game and support this games development. It is a game that would be enjoyable to a wide range of individuals regardless.When online eventually comes to Crawl, It instantly becomes a must buy hands down.Give the game a chance. It is constantly improving.A purchase that you will not regret.			"

								I remember seeing MangaMinx and Boyinaband playing this on Youtube and thinking: ""Wow, this actually looks pretty fun!""So, thinking back to that video, I decided to try and find it. Lo and behold, it was on Steam! I immediately bought, noticing it had a single-player feature as well, something that appealed to me, since I don't have the best Internet in the world. After the fast download, I played it for the first time.Wow! I had seen gameplay for this game on Youtube, but I never thought it would be soo much fun! Even against the AI, the game itself has a simple yet challenging playstyle to it that I love, and the music and graphics match so well with the action the game can offer!I have few complaints, to be honest. Normally, I would have a number of them, seeing as this is Early Access, but I only have a few. First, it just seems so short. Eight floors just seems so small for a game. But it is in Early Access, so I could understand why.Secondly, while I enjoyed what I saw so far (I managed to play the AI into losing his Humanity, which was satisfying), maybe adding different kinds of surroundings, like mossy dungeons or dark, dank caves would be possible. It'd be interesting to see how a fight against a mindflayer (or hentai tentacle beast, either way, they're pretty interesting) would go in a cave with floor-to-ceiling rock formations here and there.And lastly, the weapon selection. While the weapons are useful in different situations, it just seems kinda boring to swing a sword or throw some daggers around. Maybe adding a bow or possibly a staff is possible? It'd certainly change how players played the game.All-in-all, this is a great game to play with your friends. Everyone is involved in not just the dungeon-crawling levels, but also the final boss, which was pretty interesting.I've never seen a game like this before, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing how much more is going to go into this game!EDIT:After playing the game a few more times, I realized that it DOES include other weapons, as well as other monster elvolutions. My bad for not playing more of the game and securing my knowledge. All it takes is a completion of the game as either the human or the spirit, and those new unlockables are given to you before heading back to the main menu.EDIT 2:I'm forgetting or overlooking quite a bit in this game, apparently. I recently discovered a spirit-usable statue feature, which allows spirits to become strong, high-level monsters that would normally be available through monster evolution. It's a pretty interesting concept, and one I kind of dread. A low level player can quickly be eradicated by one of these monstrosities, but the battles are tense and hectic. As for other features, I noticed that there are a number of other weapons that are unlocked through continuous play, such as javelins and clubs. Once again, makes play throughs a bit more interesting as time goes on.			"

								The game certainly has potential, but is far from complete enough to enjoy or PLAY yet. The gods from the start don't really matter, and while upgrading the monsters and stealing the life from your one hapless buddy seems fun, it gets to a point where the monsters, even at max level, become trash against the player. And the frame rate at later levels becomes just as trash. We could barely play. I see a future for it, but for right now, you're going to have to stick out through the bad and wait for some fixes. I want to reiterate- I like the idea alot. I love the idea and baseline concepts. But the execution isnt great right now.			"

								For everyone who reads this and is thinking that they refuse to buy this game until an online co-op mode is built in. I implore you to just buy it and give it a try anyway, you have little to lose, you hate it return it, but when you play it make sure that you have a few mates around to play it with you (Best with a full house but not necessary). I also don't believe that this game should get an online multiplayer namely because this game's fun strives from playing next to your mates and socializing and interacting versus playing online.			"

								Crawl is a great game for a group of friends, or even a good 1-player dungeon crawler. The game has a few balancing issues, but it's mainly pretty fair, and is a blast every single time. 10/10 would crawl again.			"

								HOLY HELL!This has to be one of the most original and entretaining multiplayer games on PC. The idea is pure genius, battle with your friends to have control of the only survivor in a horrific dungeon, you died?  its your turn to be a vengeful spirit and try to kill the survivor!Even with bot enemies this is so entretaining, if you and your friends are fans of couch coop games, horror, action and fantasy this is a very recommended party arcade game.The game could use an online multiplayer option and of course more boss monsters, but I am sure new things will be added to it. As it is right now is very fun anyway.Also I REALLY want achivements in it, to have more goals to cover. Very recommended.			"

								Love dungeon Crawlers? Then this is the game for you. Fight your freinds and defeat the boss. Thats it. Its quite simple but brilliant. This game is a good representation on how to fight your friends and win. This game can tear your friendship apart though. So beware of that. XD Anyway get this game. Its sale price is $10 buts its worth $100. Its so awesome and amazing! BUY IT!!!			"

While one player tries to be the hero, the others control an wide array of evolving monsters determined to inhibit their progress, because if they do they get a chance to become the hero.The average round of the game lasts a good deal longer than most adversarial multiplayer game and the action can slow down while players are shopping or debating evolution choices.

Never a dull moment. always exciting. always hyped. cant wait to see the future development of this game. the biggest thing it could need is a good, supported online gameplay with public and private parties. 10/10. I hope these guys that created ""Crawl"" get what they deserve. they need to go BIG for this.			"

												Bought this game because I was having friends over for the evening. I played 10 min to see what it's like and I'm SUPER excited! This game is a perfect party game. It's so cool how you can evolve both as a hero and as a villain. That means you're never bored or upset of being killed since you still get to play and have a huge influence on the game. This changes the dynamic of the game every time.The people who came up with this concept are brilliant. Well done!			"

The combat mechanics, progression system, attention to detail, and art direction are nothing short of inspiring. Even if this game were just a ""generic dungeon crawler"" it would be a fantastic one. The animation and production values are something to be admired and even if just for that, this is a must purchase.			"

								A bunch of thoughts after playing this awesome game:- Don't play against bots. You're losing half the experience.- Nothing is as menacing as a fat fish shimmying towards you.- Remember to chant ""Spoooooooky"" whenever you're in ghost form. No, it doesn't get old, ever, and don't let the others tell you otherwise.- Amass ghost blobs and deploy jelly monsters to assert your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ status. Best practice includes:** Deploy blob before the player wishes to leave the room or travel down stairs.** Whenever the human player enters the boss chamber, deploy every jelly. Watch them swarm him while the cut-scene plays.- Don't underestimate the small floppy fish and its pew-pew stick projectile. It is the Magicarp of this game. By god, you don't want to die from Splash.- Most monsters let you leave trails of colored fluids. Make sure you produce appropriate sounds during the execution of such skills			"

								A pretty awesome party game with good atmosphere, okay graphics and music and fast paced combat.Great if you have 1-3 friends to play with (against) not so great if you prefer to play alone. AI is not as good obviously.In essence, a 4 player single screen combat with dodge/attack mechanics and RPG elements but definitely meant as a party game.			"

								Had some friends over, and finally got to play around with Crawl. This might have instantly become our favorite ""couch game,"" with tons of hollering, shouting, and an all around awesome time. It still feels a bit light on bosses, but there's already *tons* of monsters, weapons, and gear. All you need is one or two levels for everyone to get the hang of what's going on. Each game also lasts the ""right"" amount of of time overall, not too short but not too long. Just long enough to have people shouting for ""one more!""			"

I'm not saying this is a bad game I'm just saying if I had wanted to play an interesting multiplayer game in which my friends could join me and have fun with me, especially after having bought a 2nd copy for them, I would've bought literally any other game. No I'm not saying this game is bad, I'm just saying, if you are looking to play this game with a friend of yours who lives very very very far away from you. You my friend, are♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck.

Early Access ReviewCrawl almost has a sort of Super Smash Bros feeling to it. Not in the mechanics, art style, or the way the game conceptualizes itself, but in how it affects you and your friends as you duke it out.Truthfully I'm hard-pressed to think of a game that has been as much raw fun as this one with 3 other friends. Crawl is a work of art on the side of game mechanics -  a brilliant concept that has so far been executed extremely well and met my very high expectations.More content is coming to the game, and it drives me nuts waiting for it. I definitely, like most others, feel that the game needs an online component, but the developers have said that they are seriously considering implementing that down the road.If you have a group of friends that you hang out with in person who game, Crawl is an incredible game and one you won't regret getting!

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review Crawl is a game developed and published by PowerhoofCrawl is an excellent couch co-op game which encourages you to work together as a team to end the hero's life, then take their place and fight your way to salvation by besting the cthulhian horror that resides at the end of it all... or die and have your humanity stolen, only to be cursed to rot forever amidst your wrath in the infinite tombs of CrawlMonsters scale well over time, going from murderous nuisances to outright tough-as-nails murderbeasts whereas hero weapons and abilities are interesting and variedBuffs and debuffs provide an additional strategic layer which raises the game from simply ""good"" to ""great"". There's a heavy cyber-lovecraftian theme which elevates the mood. It's immersive and tense, appealing to that intrinsic desire to survive which exists within every humanIt doesn't have online multi-player, but that's a small concession for what is such a tight and cohesive array of elements that come together and create an experience that'll have you sweating from the sheer intensityEven if you don't have enough people nearby who can slum it on your couch to gather up 4 players, Crawl provides a powerful AI that will keep you on your toes RECOMMENDED :)  "

												You're lucky to have controller support because your fingers will be bleeding after your first game, mine were. This is such a fun game I can't begin to describe it. I got it on sale, but even at £10.99 you're getting so much game for money. It's fun, challenging, a game for the couch, for friends, or just by yourself. The CPU are good at the game, probably better than I am, so it doesn't feel like you're lacking a challenge.I can see myself coming back and playing this game over and over, not for long periods of time, since that's not the type of game it is (however it could be if it was ever given a multiplayer). I can't wait for the next time I get all my friends together, a hot pizza, some cold beers, this game and the couch and I've got my weekend SORTED.Fun game, low cost, win win.			"

								Crawl does what some other games fail at doing. It actually succesfully replicates the old retro feel of games.Sitting down with a couple of friends, and having a good time. The mechanics of this game are great as well. The fac that you can evolve your monsters and hero keeps the game fun and exciting. Also, being given only 3 chances for the play to defeat the boss. It provides an insentive to keep playing through the floors even after you reach level 10 so you can truly defeat the boss. Another cool thing that you don't really see is players being able to controll the boss. This allows for cooperative fun even though it is the final.Overall, this game is fun and I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a retro style game.			"

								I had really have high expectations for this game...THEY HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED!This is the *ultimate* couch brawler.  It has simple controls, pacing, and plenty to unlock with each playthrough.  (I daresay, they unlock *too* many items with each playthrough.  I'd rather it dish out one at a time - lest it run out someday!)  Oh, and the polish.  This game is sooo well polished, words cannot explain.  This game *ooozes* style.Believe the hype, and the trailers.  If you don't have real friends, the bots will do a great job entertaining you. This is a capable single player game.  If you do have friends, and don't want them anymore, have the come over and play Crawl.  Just try not to spill any *real* blood.			"

Early Access Review
								A great concept of a game carefully crafted and bundled into an easily set up multiplayer game. There is character progression, adversity which shifts constantly as other players take the role of the hero and the others take the role of the monsters trying to turn him into floor paste and some great bosses which allow for some nice action.Overall, a solid concept. Now the reason for the no recommendation;I played local multiplayer with a bot or two (not having more than one other person immediately available) and the result was a frantic scrabble after the AI, trying to figure out what to do. This itself did not take long, but the frantic scrabble continued on and on and on. Normally, frantic in a game is good, but this just felt like always playing catch-up and never progressing. At the end of each floor, regardless of character advancement, it always felt like we were not quite sure what had been achieved, what happened or what we were even trying to do. We continued on for a while, had a few boss encounters and played as both the monsters and hero a few times each. It was around the time my friend said ""I'm bored"" that I realized that I was too and had just been forcing fun onto the session.The ghost characters constantly felt like they were dragged from room to room, rather than chasing the hero, often never having the chance to even attempt the various awesome traps in the corridoors between some of the rooms. The blob drops were a nice touch, enabling the ghosts to stay in the action, but not overwhelm the hero too much with mobs. But it still felt a bit bland and it was hard to relate to any of the characters with the constant control switch (mostly with the AI bots getting in there 9 times in 10). Overall, for two of us playing with two bots, it was not fun.Other people with three friends to play with may very well have an awesome time with Crawl, but I think it needs a little more balance, maybe some humor or something, anything to bring it to life. Players need something to work with to get fun out of a game. Other than that, the devs have done an awesome job (love the boss intros, they looked awesome!) and I hope I get chance to have fun with this in the future.			"

								Crawl is an amazing Dungeon crawler type game. One player controls The Hero and the other players play as Ghosts. The Ghosts have to possess traps and become monsters to try and kill The Hero. Whoever lands the final blow to The Hero becomes The Hero. There is also currency in the game, You can get blood by hurting The Hero as a Ghost and you get gold by finding chests. While exploring you can find a blacksmith where you can buy better swords, spells and you can kneel down to an idol that takes all of your blood and makes it gold. That was a basic rundown of Crawl. Before you buy it though, it is only local co-op as of today but the devs said that online is a possibility. I recommend this to everybody who likes a fun multiplayer experience.			"

								Crawl is a very fun game. It is still in development though, but the devs have done a superb job of keeping in touch with their community and letting them know about what it is they're doing and planning to do. Content is released at an acceptable pace as well. They're a shining example of how these titles should be handled, at the moment. I've enjoyed this game immensely and that's without being able to get people together to play it with me on a regular basis. That's right, I'm having fun playing against the AI. I'm not saying that the AI is in anyway extraordinary, but I just find the game itself so fun that I don't mind playing by myself, even though this game shines the brightest with friends. As of right now I can recommenced this game to anyone looking for a unique game concept and a fun party game.			"

												Gameplay is okay but I just can't shake the feeling of disappointment with this game. You expect it to be a couch co-op game in which your friends can just come over, pick up a controller and play. However the game is slightly more in depth then it has business being for some casual players, it's usually fun for whoever the hero is but you may have a friend who is stuck as a ghost the whole game and will get bored and not have fun. On top of that, multiple play throughs of the game get repetitive and will cause you to lose interest. I suggest buying on discount to make this game worth it, but cannot recommend it at full price.			"

This game is definitely brilliant, and I know that many people would really enjoy playing it, but the simple fact that, even taking into account that we had just finished a game of Risk from boredom, we weren't enjoying it and didn't want to continue means I can't recommend it, at least not in it's current state.

												I'll rephrase what I mean about this game,It's in no way BAD. The game itself is spectacular and the idea is something new, refreshing and quite unique however, the lack of online multiplayer feels like the game is shooting itself in the foot. It feels by design to be a game that is online multiplayer a lot like Risk of Rain. It's just not there though. As I understand the game was developed by two people and I bow my hat to both of them, the game is amazing in itself, it can be played quite happily in single player mode but for myself and I'm sure for others, IT NEEDS ONLINE MULTIPLAYER.

								Got boring very fast playing against the AIOnly get if you are CERTAIN you'll be playing with friendsSo far the content in terms of single player is abysmal. And besides that, not much variety in the game generally...what is here looks very promising, and I hope they can add nuance to this great concept.But so far, I can't recommend it, especially at its full price.

								Two years now since they last added a new boss battle (meaning this game still only has two boss battles - which get boring really fast when they're the only thing to do).  Seems pretty dumb to invent a fantastic new game mechanic then completely ignore it (and the fans asking them to actually use it).As such, I'd say treat this as a dead project until they actually demonstrate real improvement - instead of the meaningless minor tweaks to the numbers and lesser sprites they've done FOR TWO YEARS NOW.

								A game so terribly hindered by lack of online multiplayer I cannot in good conscience recommend it. Singleplayer is nigh unplayable, especially given the poor tutorials, and the game is entirely designed around multiplayer, so no online option just brings this down to a wasted purchase.I know netplay is a difficult thing for indies to add, but when the entire game revolves around it, and it's the #1 thing requested for over a year of early access, it really needs to be a priority. Especially in the PC market, local only is baffling for an entirely multiplayer game.Will revise review if netplay becomes available, otherwise, absolutely do not recommend.			"

								The objective here from the ""developers"" was to create an arcade cabinet retro experience.The problem is they did an absolutely horrid job of it.  The graphics are worse than arcade games of the era (back then they actually put some effort into the games, unlike these tools).  This game actually looks exactly like someone trying to make a retro looking game and failing horribly - that's the perfect way to describe it.   They captured none of the retro art style. Controls are absolutely shoddy.  Gameplay is terrible.  No graphics tuning.  Repetitive and lacking content.   Complete low effort shovelware.  This game is completely outpaced by the arcade games from 30 years ago that it's insulting with its terrible aping.			"

								Sorry, I don't understand what is fun about this game. I hate writing bad reviews of indy games because I'm sure the devs worked very hard on it and are proud. But I just didn't find this game interesting.I'm wondering if it's a generational thing? I've really been there and done that as far as mashing a single attack button and killing pixelated monsters over and over and over. Got my fill of that 30 years ago.I'm not accusing these particular devs of this, but, it seems to me that ""retro"" 8-bit graphics and gameplay are starting to become synonomous with simple lazy game design.Anyway, best of luck, but I've requested a refund.

								I really enjoyed what I have seen so far. Although the game only has so much to offer right now, it is early access, and I am exspecting all sorts of new great things during this game's development. The game features 4 player local multiplayer, in which one player plays a normal dungeon crawler. The other three people, though, are the monsters. This is a very interesting twist to dungeon crawlers, and it is well done. I also thought the music was well composed and that the art style was great, but the game is one of those games that without friends, it's charm fades quickly. Over all, what Crawl has to offer so far is great, but if you don't have any friends to play it with, I would wait until news of online multiplayer.			"

								Never before have I felt that a game truly defined a brawler co-op+VS experience until crawl.Games such as castle crashers and even the old final fights had some sort of co-op and some some sort of vs but traversing the level feltexactly the same as if you were doing it single player with a tinytaste of competitive on the side. Crawl doesn't do this, playing alongsideyour friends means having to keep an eye on every single thing eachof your friends does. Their level, their money, who's hanging back tojump in and steal the kill, who's flinging an all out assault. It'sextremely enthralling and keeps you on your toes throughout eachand every game, you even start to get some of, what I like to call,the mario party aspect. You start resenting and shouting at yourfriends. ""WHY DID YOU HAVE TO FIGHT THE BOSS, IT'S OUR LAST TRY!?""""DAMMIT I WAS GONNA BUY THAT WEAPON!"" etc, etc.Crawl is a great game not only in multiplayer with your friendsbut even in single player, with advanced and clever AI thatseem to know what you'll try before you try it (although theydo get caught on boxes sometimes) making even single playerquests an exciting experience.I've been playing on off since release and even I still haven't unlocked everything which means there is a lot in this game toobtain and because it's still being built even MORE will be added.I hope you consider Crawl as the multiplayer experience of the yearand buy yourself something fun and exciting. With some frogs, demons and just a dash of Lovecraftian horrorCrawl is a great game that deserves your time.			"

								Get it! Go! Now! Take it! Have it! Love it!Crawl's a short-session action roguelike. It takes thirty minutes or so to play a single round, and win or lose, you'll net new unlocks to change up future crawls. Fast-paced and capable of hammering home a gloriously tooth-grinding need to win, even just against the AI bots, Crawl is exactly what it looked like in that first video that took us all by storm months ago (and if you haven't seen that, watch it at once, it's on this very page).Most impressive is the game's catchup mechanics. Each player has three tracks of monsters that they level up from lowly worms into terrible dragons, from cackling skeletons into...whatever that giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ black knight thing is, seriously, he's worryingly huge. The ""Vitae"" these upgrades require is earned when your -opponents- level up. That's right: The further ahead one player's human shape gets, the nastier the beasts he'll find himself facing, and those who've been struggling will have the most worrying monsters of all. I was a little unclear on how the game decided what tier to spawn you at, but it seems to have a similar catchup mentality (I saw an AI who was wayyy behind the rest of us spawn as a top-tier dragon twice in a row).It does a lot to keep the humanity ball passing around. After reaching level ten (which is not the cap, if there is one), that player, when human, can use one of the portals scattered around the dungeon to take on the boss. If he loses, he's ejected, but gets to stay human (if a human at terrifyingly low life). The game can't drag on forever, though: The third time the boss is engaged (by any player) the portal explodes in a totally metal portal explosion. Defeat of the human player now means the end of the game, a consolation prize for the ghosts and absolute devouring of the foolish human who'd tested his might and failed.It all comes together really well. The joyful rage of getting your killing blows on the human stolen by an UNWORTHY GHOSTLY ALLY who hadn't contributed much is palpable, and the satisfaction at pulling apart the creatures as a human and getting your big, glitzy retro levelup effects is real. Both modes of play are fun, which is probably the key factor here--dying sucks, but hey, on the other hand, now you get to be a giant ♥♥♥♥off black knight and make your friends bleed. And that blood spilled when playing as a monster gets saved up, to be converted into gold when you next find yourself human. There's never a lazy moment: It's constantly important that you be pummeling your friends (or computers).There's an almost infinite amount that could be done with this game. Items could be added forever. Alternate bosses, more sets of monsters to pick from, hideous new traps, diversified level pallettes--the paging space is almost numbing. So buy this game! Encourage our antipodean friends to make more out of it!			"

								Hello potential costumer, this is a review of the game crawl.Here is a list of things to consider before buying this:- Are you into retro/8Bit/16bit stuff?- Do you have friends to play this game with (offline)?- Are you in possesion of enough controllers, preferable the ones from the Xbox 360 ?If all the 3 things apply to you and you dont borther with losing your friends after playing one round or two as  you WILL inevitably rub your gigantic nerdboner errection that you´ll get from playing this absolute masterpice of art into the faces of your friends becouse you just DOMINATED THEM WITH A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 360 NONSCOPE SKELLETONARROW TO THE NUTS,umm.... where was i going with this yes, buy the game.Its a hell lot of fun, even for an early acces. The game mechanic and design is just wonderfully put together and work realy well even in this stage of the game.There is a lack of content, you realy have to say that, but content is just a thing to be patched in and nothing of consern when the artstyle, the music, mechanics and gamedesign are allready perfect.In my 2 hours of playing i also only encountered one singel bug, impressing.You may not play this game for more then say 2 or 3 rounds in a row (one round is a bit longer then 30 minutes) but its still worth the 10 bucks as you and your friends will be drawn back to it.Besides, this game looks, feels and sounds just AMAZING.One final thing to the developers (maybe they are reading this) , the solution for not having a minimap as there is allready so mutch going on UI wise is absolutely genious, why have i never seen this before in any dungeonCRAWLer? Realy well done.You allways know exactly where you are and where to go, the problem is that this doesnt realy allow for bigger complex or maze like dungeons but thats allright in my books as this game is more focused on the multiplayer aspect.

								Can't recomend the game enough. The game is updated every few months providing plenty of time to test out the new additions and get used to the tweaks. The devs are active in the steam forums and are VERY open to discussion and reccomendations. gameplay:one player (chosen at random) controls the hero at the start, the other players are ghosts that control the monsters and traps. dungeons are randomly generated and each room has a minimum pentagram(monster spawn point) equal to the number of players controlling ghosts. each player has 3 monsters based on the god you choose to worship. god can also provide a bonus to your hero character. evolve monsters by damaging or effecting the hero. branching monster evolution tree. While they are fairly limited there is still a large selection and every combination is possible.  definitely more fun with people but single player against AI is fun as well. really the only negative is that when playing with 4 people it is possible for one player to be underleveled in one form or the other. if the other 3 players are the only ones getting a chance at being the hero then the 4th player has higher level monsters but the lowest level hero fighting the higher level monsters. granted they will gain xp for killing the hero (which is usually enough for a 1-4 level up). the player would at this point have a massive stockpile of gold (also gained from harming the hero) and can purchase a large amount of upgrades provided they can find the store on that floor.finding the store isnt dificult because the doors are marked with a red stairs (end of floor) blue portal (boss aka how to win the game) an anvil (shop) or a ? if an area is unexplored.ranged weapons have been fixed from earlier versions where they were clunky but are now much smoother to use. bosses: there are 2 bosses a 3 headed hydra where each player controls a headand a squid monster where one player controls the eye and the other 2 control tentacles. great party game			"

You can have up to TWO players with just one Keyboard and mouse. Player One uses the Mouse, and Player Two uses the Keyboard. It's simple really.			"

								Crawl is an incredibly interesting multiplayer game. Upon taking the role of the human you are thrust into a dungeon filled with traps and monsters all controlled by people you may or may not know and must fight until you win or die trying. Upon death you become one of three ghosts seeking to end the life of a man in order to claim his humanity, during your quest you may choose to work together as you possess monsters and traps but ultimatly you all strive to be the one to deliver the final blow in order to claim a chance at sweet deliverence.TLDR: It's a fun multiplayer game where you all beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥outta eachother. Unlike other multiplayer games with a small player limit , such as a infamous one which may or may not involve italian plumbers having parties, the game balances power based on how much damage you deal, how much the player has leveled up, and ultimatly makes it feel like you always have a chance to take the game. All in all this game is amazing.			"

								This is an absolutely fantastic multiplayer game! And it's not bad with bots either. One player is randomly selected as the hero and the others as ghost who can spawn minions at certain points or possess traps and statues. The object for the hero is to reach level 10 and take on the boss who is also controled by the ghosts. Whenever the hero levels up the ghosts gain vitae which is used to level up their minions and similarly for every bit of damage they do to the hero they earn blood which can be exchanged for goal in the hero's shop so the hero can remain competative. The game is well balanced and extremely polished. I look forward to the updates!			"

								Literally my favorite Steam game. It is visually stunning, an artisic masterpiece, and its simple intuitive controls make the game feel so polished and solid. I've not played another game in my life with the mechanics this game instigates in a multiplayer setting, and yet I feel completely at home within those mechanics.All this being said, a warning:This game supports local co-op only, and the bots are just simply a poor substitute for a human player. Crawl is at it's peak with 4 human players. 3 works out okay, but I personally wouldn't recommend 2 or fewer real players.			"

								My first impression of the game while watching the trailer was that the dungeon was filled with monsters that you could take control of as a ghost and the summoning circles were used to summon more powerful monsters. Boy I was wrong. The circles are the only way to summon monsters except for slimes that you can drop as a ghost if you collect enough orbs that float around the screen.I made the mistake of playing the game with three bots my first go. I was lost the entire game as the bots were too fast to keep up with what was going on most of the time leaving me clueless on how to play the game even at the game over screen. I came in third place and only managed to become a human once as the bots constantly got the last hit on the human after I managed to wear him down.The second play through I played with one other person and things started making sense. I finally realized I can summon slime, which I may have been doing before but things were so chaotic I didn't know what was going on.Overall, you should play the game for the first time with 2 players or 1 bot to get the hang of it. While this isn't the best way to play the game, it's easier to learn the ropes.  The more players (once you know what you are doing) the more fun this game becomes.Despite my misconceptions of the game, I still find it enjoyable especially as a party game with friends. Thumbs up!			"

								Crawl is a fun and unique local multiplayer experience.  In short, it's a king-of-the-hill style dungeon crawler, with players constantly swapping roles as either the plucky hero or one of the three ghosts attempting to take them down.  The way that the ghosts team up against the human is best described as ""formalized trolling.""The asymmetry of play helps to keep the game fresh, as well as make differences in skill less pivotal in one's ability to enjoy the game.  While the graphics are blocky (unsurprising coming from a two-person team), the animations are superb.			"

								Crawl is a game in which a group of 2-4 players are thrown into a dungeon, all of them have the same goal: ""Beat a Final Boss to Escape the dungeon"". The problem is that only one of those players gets to escape the dungeon by defeating one of the final bosses. At the beginning of a game, one of the players is randomly selected to be the ""Human"", the final bosses can only be defeated by a human. The other players are then selected to be ""Ghosts"", the ghosts can posess summoning circles to bring fourth all kinds of controllable monsters to attack the human with, ghosts are also able to spawn controllable slimes, control one of the final bosses parts, and control different traps and statues. When a ghost kills a human, that ghost then immidiatley swaps places with the human, which makes the last human a ghost, and the ghost that landed the killshot on the human becomes a human itself. This game is best played with a group of good friends, trust me, it makes the desperate struggle for victory ALL the more satisfying.			"

								My friends and I wanted a good game to play splitscreen while over at each others houses and this was quiet thew find for us. The gameplay is simple enough that people can pick it up pretty well on their first play and rarely does it feel unbalanced. The most unbalanced it ever gets is when someone makes a really lucky find at a shop and has a nice magic effect or always has the most money to buy out the passives on the far left table. My only complaint is the lack of bosses as their are only 2 and one is much easier than the other but more are promised.  It's a great split screen for 4 or less people to sit down on a couch and kill a few hours.			"

								This game is fantastic fun. Both my sister and I cannot get enough of it and we have only had it for a day. During time of writing, this game is very playable, but noticeably unfinished. Only two boss battles a handful of monsters to choose from, but the game is constantly being patched with more from what I can tell. I look forward to the completion of this title; It promises to be a great one.			"

								This game is a awesome from any point of view.The only problem -just like when Torchlight was released- is the lack of multiplayer online.You get to play an rpg, dungeoncrawler, deatchmatch, be the hero, the monsters, customize both sides, use traps to surprise distracted heroes and even play as the final boss, all of this wrapped up in a wonderfully designed pixel art package. I honestly feel guilty about having only 1paid $10 for such a good game. Its in my top10 favorite games.			"

								Hands down my current favourite early access game. Not only do the ads have dope voice overs, but the game is very fun. It reminds me of Dark Souls in combat, with high tension combat between tough AIs (on Hard mode at least, though normal is still good) and your friends and family. It is a rogue-lite which means even though each run is different you keep some of the many unlockables such as Deities, weapons, spells, totems, and more. I still haven't collected everything. Finally I must add that even though it is early access and has a bit to go for completion it plays like a complete game. 20/10 would taunt the Old Gods again.			"

								Crawl is like having a kit kat and all of your friends want the same kit kat however it's so small you can't share it and there's no other kit kat's (or any candy for that matter) in your vicinity. So then as you start eating it all your friends begin trying to snatch it away but you hold a firm grip so they start using more force and begin punching you and eventually one of them is able to pry it from your battered hands so then everyone starts beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of him and it's all descending into chaos as he's nearly able to take a giant bite out of it but then someone comes in with a nerf gun so everyone else grabs more powerful nerf guns and shooting each other and you were all so busy fighting for the kit kat that you weren't carefu enough and now you notice the dog has eaten it so you all start crying and shouting at each other and blaming each other and then you realize this was all over a small piece of candy and you question your friendship.10|10 would destroy friendsip over kit kat again.

								On the surface, this game may seem like just another 8-bit style dungeon crawler game, but Crawl brings something totally new to the table. Players working against each other. It's so fun and challenging to play with friends, and it's a great party game. Lots of cool mosters, lots of cool weapons, lots of cool magic items. The only downside is that you have to play on one machine, you can't hook up with someone else who has a copy of the game. Overall one of the most fun experiences I've ever had with a dungeon crawler.			"

								A hectic rouge brawler where you and your friends team up against and take turns playing as the hero who gets jacked by whomever kills him. just on paper the idea sounds amazing and the game definatly doesn't dissapoint; especially for being an early access title. the game has good AI and is fun alone but playing it as a party game is one of the funnest gaming experiences i had since i was a kid.It doesn't currently have online multiplayer but im sure it will come with a patch one day. the developers for the game seem very commited to it and just released a new patch adding tons of new content. I'm very excited to see where this game is going and have high hopes and dreams in my head of diffrent bosses, diffrent themes, more music, all of which is already in is great of course. but this game gave me a very fresh gaming experience and hope this game gets popular. plus for ten dollars its a steal.

								In this game's current state,  couch gamers with a few controllers will enjoy it a lot.  I've played this game both with a keyboard and with a controller--the controller wins (but the keyboard still fells okay).The game has tight controls and an amazing aesthetic that puts everyone in the right mood. An easy to understand upgrades system and easy access to 'tips' before each floor allow for nearly anyone to learn the game very quickly.I enjoyed playing it with my friends, and I plan to play it even more... I just hope they continue to add features/upgrades to make the $10 worth it (it is always a gamble with Early Access titles).			"

								Giant statue of Gabe Newell kills me and steals my wallet. But seriously, local is great - got this game specifically for the Link. The trailers don't show half of the satisfying content this game contains. Buy this game purely on gut feeling, it seems the gameplay is boring to watch, but exciting to play. The lack of online isn't a problem - the singleplayer still thrills me, although with friends and a couple of remotes, this game is excellent. Trailer is pretty boss though. This game seems hardly like any other early access game - only thing missing is a variety of bosses.			"

								The developers are little overly fond of the phrase ""torn apart"" and variants in their release notes.I mean it's kind of understandable. Everybody gets torn apart in this game. A lot.Oh, you might be wondering, what stops the player in the human flesh bag from just dawdling around and wasting everybody's time? You can do that but when the ghost players aren't otherwise occupied, they're always zooming back and forth gathering up ambient ectoplasm blobs which they can spend to summon slimes. Slimes are pretty pathetic but you can summon them in numbers as a distraction in larger fights and the hero doesn't get rewarded for killing them. Best of all slimes lock the doors when you summon them, which is good fun when the hero is just about to rush out of a trap room.I was surprised though, I was worried being a ghost would feel like wasted time but honestly not only is it fun to be a ghost but you still feel like you're in the running and pushing to win, and as a session progresses humanity starts flipping back and forth between people with hilarious frequencyIdk I'll write a real review later maybe, basically it's good and you should get it. It's wonderfully competitive enough that even when playing against bots you forget that you're playing against bots			"

								I received Crawl as a gift from a friend, so when I first started it up, I didn't know what to expect aside from a Dungeon Crawler. What I got was a unique experience, well geared toward multiplayer fun. Assymetric gameplay at its simplest, and yet most refined, up to four players try to get through a dungeon, each trying to be the one to kill the boss at the end. There can only be one dungeoneer at a time though, so while one player slays monsters and evades traps, the others are controlling those monsters and traps. Whichever player is the one to kill the current active dungeoneer becomes the new dungeoneer. The balancing is actually quite effective, though it can be possible to steamroll the opposition if you get a good streak going while active. The game is still under development, so there are only two bosses that I have seen, but I'm looking forward to seeing more from the game.			"

								Very good game. The weapon's movesets are diversive enough to make every unlock meaningful. After 15 games I am still unlocking new items. For ten dollars I can't recomend this game enough, although I do have a few complaints. The game can be too short which can make the upgrades from the shop feel worthless if you challenge the boss soon after. Also in order to beat the boss consistantly you only need hyper dash or berzerk when playing against the computer. My second complaint is the lack of game modes. I think that this game would benifit from a survival mode where each player takes a turn as the human and tries to clear as many rooms as possible. Finally I wish that there was online multiplayer, although this game is still fun playing against the computers. Time spent4hr - local co-op2hr - computer			"

								This game is a gorey masterpiece. It's quick and even better with friends. The controls can be customize for your liking, although I like the controls given.  Monsters are fun to play as even though you have to unlock them by beating or losing the game. You also can unlock new spells, weapons, and items.All together, I love this game.			"

								Despite being an early access game Crawl feels delightfuly complete. This game is the best muti-player dungeon crawler I have played in ages, perhaps the best I will ever play. Fighting and spiting your friends has never been this much fun, and struggling against bots provides just as much bloody enjoyment alone. Crawl never plays out the same way twice and contantly reveals new content every time you finish a game. I cannot recomend Crawl enough.			"

								Awesome game. I have only been able to play single player so far, but it is still a blast. Replay value is ridiculous in that every playthrough unlocks new items, and every game is different. I have only actually won twice, but it is still great fun. i cannot wait for all the updated bosses, but right now get onto the ground floor for 10 bucks and then get awesome new content when it becomes available.

								1st Impressions: Excellent party game, but stands on it's own as good as single player game.  Very, very fun.  Any criticism I have is in no way a deal-breaker.Pros:- Balance: Lots of attention seems to be paid to keeping it interesting w/ the power dynamic between players constantly shifting.  Getting your minions' butts kicked? You'll rank up monsters faster. Spent a bunch of time running around as the hero killing everyone else? Now you're reincarnated as an toothpick spitting inchworm. All this is done without feeling like it's simply picking on the person in the lead.ADDITIONALLY, the end-game is satisfying regardless of outcome since everyone both worked for and against it the entire time.- Pace: I'm impressed how well it allows for a leveling and item system while still keeping the gogoGOGOGO!GO!GO! mentality.  There always seems to be something for everyone to be doing.- Mood & Atmosphere: The glitched out voice acting brings me right back to scratchy copies of Golden Axe played on poorly tracking TVs.  Pixel graphics can be an aquired taste, but I think it fits well and this game puts a cool spin on it (this kind of ""possessed game cartridge"").Cons (somewhat minor, but I hope can be addressed as the game develops )- Player confusion: With the unsaturated color palette it can be easy to lose track of your player.  This gets harder during big brawls when some people may be controlling the same type of minion.  Regardless, the learning curve is small.- Advancement & Unlocks: As it stands, the item and ""God"" unlocks after a session seem arbitrary.  Currently, they seem to be coming out of the glitched-out ether of the game (which is cool mood-wise), but it might be nice to see as least know what's triggering them - Are they indeed random? Tied to playtime? In-game exploration?I've only played this a few hours but it is already well worth the price - for the single player experience, let alone the strong party game this is!			"

Early Access Review
								I believe this is one of the most solid asymmetric PvP games I've played. At the current moment there isn't a huge amount of content, but the devs do add fairly meaty updates every few weeks. That being said, the mechanics of the game are solid, the way gaining and losing possession of the hero works is an example of good balance mechanisms. It's like a negative feedback loop where the longer you stay as either ghost or hero, the easier it is to kill the hero and be killed respectively.And man does it have style. The music, the ever-present (aesthetic only) glitchiness, it actually makes me feel nostalgic. You can tell what the devs were going for and I think they nailed it. Some people see pixelated art as an excuse for spending less time animating, but the pixel art in this game is made by someone who obviously takes the style seriously, because it actually has a very distinct character and the animations are deceptively smooth for the resolution.

								Crawl is a game in which a group of 2-4 players are thrown into a dungeon, all of them have the same goal: ""Beat a Final Boss to Escape the dungeon"". The problem is that only one of those players gets to escape the dungeon by defeating one of the final bosses. At the beginning of a game, one of the players is randomly selected to be the ""Human"", the final bosses can only be defeated by a human. The other players are then selected to be ""Ghosts"", the ghosts can posess summoning circles to bring fourth all kinds of controllable monsters to attack the human with, ghosts are also able to spawn controllable slimes, control one of the final bosses parts, and control different traps and statues. When a ghost kills a human, that ghost then immidiatley swaps places with the human, which makes the last human a ghost, and the ghost that landed the killshot on the human becomes a human itself. This game is best played with a group of good friends, trust me, it makes the desperate struggle for victory ALL the more satisfying.			"

Early Access Review
								Despite being a just launched Early Access title, this game is already awesome. It is a local coop dungeon crawler intended for 2 to 4 players and meant to be played with controllers. It's really fun, challenging for all players and somewhat competitive within a group who plays it.A match can last 30 to 90 minutes, it really depends on how it's played. It's incredibly fun and almost endlessly replayable.Though, I must warn you - to get the full fun of this game, you'd wish to have a group of 3-4 people (2 may work out as well, but...) in the same room with at least 2 controllers. Otherwise your experience may vary, because (I didn't try, it's just a presumption) it won't be very fun to play with AI and there's no online coop, so you have to gather up at someone's home. Also it's really poorly played when you try to play with 2 players on the same keyboard.			"

								I wouldn't normally review an Early Access game but this deserves it because it 'works'. There are no problems with this release from a technical perspective, all that's missing is some content which the devs are / will be adding. What I love about this game is that a 'game'. Almost like a board / card game, the principles and mechanics are the same each time you play but the enjoyment and experience each time (which takes 10-20 minutes) is unique. This is not a co-op game, it's versus; a game in which you and up to three other AI or friends must battle it out to reach level 10 and defeat the boss. Only one player can be 'alive' at one time and the others must kill them by spawning as monsters or using traps to hinder the other's progress. Fantastic little game and I look forward to seeing what other additions are made.			"

								(Written for Early Access) Great fun with your mates around the monitor, its joined our PC party line-up alongside Towerfall Ascension and Hisoutensouken. Feels reasonably balanced and is high quality for an Early-Access title, worth the monies if you're like me with mates who pop round for games with dinner all the while! My antique Logitech and Cyborg USB controllers work fine on it, as well as my Wii U Pro controller with the Mayflash adapter. Just needs more content!! More Gods! More Monsters! More gear! More Bosses! Most importantly, more and varied environments between floors to stop things getting stale; and maybe some choices on hero design (I know my female friends want girl-hero options!)			"

Everything was complete audio and visual bliss. The game delivers on so many levels even if you're ""forever alone"" the bots implemented will keep you busy til you make some real friends.I love the local multiplayer being a kid of the SEGA/SNES era and the game plays out  like its destined to be classic.It's fast paced and exciting and will have you and your friends resorting back to that primal competitive nature. A must have party game and a beautiful homage to it's genre.			"

								This is an absolutely fantastic multiplayer game! And it's not bad with bots either. One player is randomly selected as the hero and the others as ghost who can spawn minions at certain points or possess traps and statues. The object for the hero is to reach level 10 and take on the boss who is also controled by the ghosts. Whenever the hero levels up the ghosts gain vitae which is used to level up their minions and similarly for every bit of damage they do to the hero they earn blood which can be exchanged for goal in the hero's shop so the hero can remain competative. The game is well balanced and extremely polished. I look forward to the updates!			"

								I got this as a part of the 'Humble Montly' for May 2016.  I installed and started playing the game without seeing anything about it, and was suprised.  It's a really fun game.  The pace and variety is nice.  You get a fair amount of time playing diety/monsters and dungeoneer.  As you progress down through the dungeon you can buy weapons and spealls and upgrade your monsters.  You end the round by defeating the boss or being beaten as the boss by another player (which is really awesome on either side.  You're either battling a giant monster or get to control the giant monster.)  After you finish a round you start over with a bunch more diety/monsters unlocked.  The graphics and music are retro (pixels,2D) but done very well. 10/10 will crawl again.Edit: One last thought.  Online multiplayer.  This game definitely needs it.  I see it listed as a possibility by the dev.  I really really hope they come through on it.			"

								I can't remember if I have ever left a review for any game in all the years I've been on steam.  If I did, it wasn't a good enough one for me to remember.  I'm leaving one now.Simply put:  This game is awesome.  This is one of THOSE games:  Games that I break out in a party setting with my friends and we play it over and over and over.  The idea behind this game is simple enough, but there's enough under the hood to add some depth and variety that it doesn't make the game boring at all or feel repetitive.  Nothing is more satisfying in the world than closing off a room from the hero (as he tries to dash to the portal),  stealing a kill from another monster player (while already at level 10) and race into the adjacent room, open the portal, and attempt to kill the boss.This game will test friendships, no doubt.  It is worth every penny and I can't wait to see what else they add to it.  I'm not crying for lack of on-line multiplayer.  And, the game has some AI in it, so you can even play solo if you want.  (I also really like the 'drop in' / 'drop out' feature A LOT.  Very handy.)  I realize that a lot of people like that component and want it... but the magic here is playing with 3 other friends all in the same room.			"

								Crawl is simple but brilliantly executed multiplayer concept. One person plays a hero traversing a dungeon, and the other players play as the dungeon and enemies.  When a monster kills the hero they take his place. The monsters are generally ""weaker"" than the hero so they need to both work together and compete to get the last hit.The matches are fairly short, usually lasting from 15 to 30 minutes which doesn’t feel like too long. The balancing mechanics are well designed, and players make comebacks regularly keeping the game close - the longer you play as a monster the better off you are if you become the hero, but wait too long and you might lose.The hero and monsters feel good to play, and the players are given several customization options at the beginning of each game allowing them to choose a group of monsters to play as. There are also additional perks which offer variety in play styles.There is a learning curve to the game, and understanding the different resources you have to manage and knowing each monster can be confusing to newer players. The mechanical simplicity helps a lot with this. Crawls biggest problem is that it currently has only local multiplayer and really needs online multiplayer.Crawl is intensely fun and extremely well designed. It is easily one of if not the best local multiplayer games available on steam, and an amazing value for its price. If you can get a group of three or four people together to play I highly recommend it. "

								As Jason Voorhees to my top left says: I love it.Seemingly simple, yet comactly complex in this 300 MB Rogue-like Dungeon Crawler as it's been said. I've only gone against AI bots for the moment, but playing four players is utter madness. It's like a timeless childhood game that needed to be around before Gauntlet. That game was still great at the time, but I can imagine the bundles of joy and frustration this game would have, and will have in the near futureFeels great to control your hero and demons alike, the pixelated art-style vaguely reminds me of Hyper Light Drifter, music and sound design are top-notch, and the game itself feels rewarding to play and beat.In short: it's a must buy that can forseeably supply endless enjoyment, and I would give it a solid 9/10 just because the full game is not available at the moment			"

								This game is def a treat to play with bots or with other friends in the room.You have a total of 4 players. One player starts off as The HeroThe other 3 players act as Ghosts that are tasked with killing the Hero player so that they, in turn, can become The Hero Themselves.The first person of the 4 players to reach level 10, go through the portal and kill the Final Boss wins!The gameplay is some of the best MP fun to be had, the only big downsides I found was that it's Local-Only Multiplayer..on PC which may break the purchase for a lot of people understandably. Thankfully you can play with Bots who have 3 different difficulties.The other issue I found was a bit of unbalanced gameplay when there are 4 players. There just isn't enough resources gained with the 4 players to max out your monsters or really get powerful with your Hero character some of the time.Here's a review of the game if you'd like to see more!

								On the surface, this game may seem like just another 8-bit style dungeon crawler game, but Crawl brings something totally new to the table. Players working against each other. It's so fun and challenging to play with friends, and it's a great party game. Lots of cool mosters, lots of cool weapons, lots of cool magic items. The only downside is that you have to play on one machine, you can't hook up with someone else who has a copy of the game. Overall one of the most fun experiences I've ever had with a dungeon crawler.			"

								Crawl is quite obviously a game made by people who love games. Everything about it is well done. The humor, the animation, the music, the smooth controls, the fun little upgrades, the epic explosions of gore! It's a refreshingly original experience, best played with a couch full of friends and a controller to clench in your sweaty hands. Can't wait for more content. Keep it up Powerhoof!			"

								crawl is pretty much one of the few games ive seen that lets you play as the bad guys aside from dungeon land, as soon as i saw the trailer for this game i KNEW i had to have it, in this game there is 1 hero and 1 to 3 other players as the monsters, the hero's main goal is to servive against the other 1 to 3 monsters and try to defeat the final boss at the end and how do you do that? you get gold so you can upgrade yourself and make yourself a fighting machine, the monsters main goal is to try and stop the hero from doing any of his goals by transforming into monsters and despenceing slimes for the hero to fight, and if a monster kills the hero, the monster who killed the hero becomes the hero and try's to do what the previous hero was doing, and as for the killed hero, he becomes a monster and trys's to stop the new hero by doing everything the monsters do, all in all the main goal for the hero is to kill the final boss to win as the hero, and what if your one of the monsters when the hero gets to the final boss, the monsters ARE the final boss controlling all of his different limbs, however thats not to say this game doesnt have down sides like for instants the lack of online multiplayer, yes there is local multi player but it would be so much easier if there was online multiplayer, also it takes WAY to long to unlock any new gods, and gods basicly decides what monsters you can transform into when you are playing as the monsters, but aside from that there is really not much else that deturns me from this game, there are minor things to me like the AI rushing the final boss once they reach lvl 10, but aside from that there isnt much else, id recommend giveing it a shot, thanks for takeing the time to read this and have fun			"

								In this game's current state,  couch gamers with a few controllers will enjoy it a lot.  I've played this game both with a keyboard and with a controller--the controller wins (but the keyboard still fells okay).The game has tight controls and an amazing aesthetic that puts everyone in the right mood. An easy to understand upgrades system and easy access to 'tips' before each floor allow for nearly anyone to learn the game very quickly.I enjoyed playing it with my friends, and I plan to play it even more... I just hope they continue to add features/upgrades to make the $10 worth it (it is always a gamble with Early Access titles).			"

								A hectic rouge brawler where you and your friends team up against and take turns playing as the hero who gets jacked by whomever kills him. just on paper the idea sounds amazing and the game definatly doesn't dissapoint; especially for being an early access title. the game has good AI and is fun alone but playing it as a party game is one of the funnest gaming experiences i had since i was a kid.It doesn't currently have online multiplayer but im sure it will come with a patch one day. the developers for the game seem very commited to it and just released a new patch adding tons of new content. I'm very excited to see where this game is going and have high hopes and dreams in my head of diffrent bosses, diffrent themes, more music, all of which is already in is great of course. but this game gave me a very fresh gaming experience and hope this game gets popular. plus for ten dollars its a steal.

Crawl is a fantastic game for playing with friends, the gameplay mecanics are unique and fun, the musics are great and the animation/pixel art is really good. Playing this game with friend worth all the AAA titles from the past years for a very small price. Reccomend it for everyone!

								Very good game. The weapon's movesets are diversive enough to make every unlock meaningful. After 15 games I am still unlocking new items. For ten dollars I can't recomend this game enough, although I do have a few complaints. The game can be too short which can make the upgrades from the shop feel worthless if you challenge the boss soon after. Also in order to beat the boss consistantly you only need hyper dash or berzerk when playing against the computer. My second complaint is the lack of game modes. I think that this game would benifit from a survival mode where each player takes a turn as the human and tries to clear as many rooms as possible. Finally I wish that there was online multiplayer, although this game is still fun playing against the computers. Time spent4hr - local co-op2hr - computer			"

Early Access Review
								Thought it can be a lonesome crawl with the lack of online multiplayer, ""Crawl,"" even in Early Access form, is a goldmine of local multiplayer value that shouldn't be missed.In Crawl, you and 1-3 other players are all trapped in a dungeon guarded by a gargantuan monster. One of you will be a human fighter while the others are relegated to existing only as insubstantial phantoms. The hero is free to exlplore throughouth the dungeon, delving deeper into its catacombs as necessary to continue on in hopes of treasure, merchants, or a teleporter which can take the hero to the final boss room and either freedom or absolute destruction. As the hero moves from room to room, however, the phantom players can and will do everything they can to kill the hero, from possessing a variety of traps and summoning helper slimes to, most essentially, manifesting in the physical forms of any manner of beast from bear-trap summoning goblins to centaur archers to formidable gazer demons more than capable of slaying would-be-heroes. In the event that any phantom does kill the human opponent, they themselves will procure that player's humanity, spawinging as their own mortal fighter. This is the key pattern of the gameplay, with the hero being rewarded with experiencing points and the chance to purchase rare treasures from merchants nestled within the dungeon catacombs, while the phantoms are rewarded with stronger monsters and blood, which can later be turned into gold should they attain human form. The essential goal is to reach level 10 as the hero and, with the aid of an already impressive variety of unlockable weapons, potions, spells, and other items, reach the teleporter room instanced on each floor of the randomly generated dungeon and face the final boss in combat. The phantoms can possess parts of the boss's body to aid in the assault against the hero in an all-or-nothing battle. With victory, the hero is rewarded with freedom, but, should the hero be slain by his friends in his final assault, his name and likeness will forever be cast into ashes.This game is still a work in progress but is still an easy product to recommend because all of the fundamental features and gameplay mechanics are already quite functional, entertaining, and polished. The core gameplay of killing your friends and becoming stronger in doing so is well-polished and, a few Early Access hiccups aside (including a lack of variety as of the time of this review and a forgivable level of question of balance with certain elements) is absolutely addicting in it's fast-paced flow of action, chance, and reward. The game is themed well with what could be called a haunted-arcade vibe that keeps the visceral action light and helps the player appreciate the charming and beautifully rendered retro-style graphics. While the look could understandably be considered ""played-out"" to some extent, in the current indie environment, but the atmosphere cast over the room by the up-tempo horror-midi soundtrack is both appropriate and exceptional.With flawless controller support, easy-to-grasp yet hard-to-master brutal combat, quick 20-60 minute gameplay sessions and great mood I would absolutely recommend ""Crawl"" to any gamer who lives with other gamers or plays often with others in the same room. ""Crawl"" has no online support whatsoever and, while the bots are functional and helpful if you have less than 4 people, playing alone feels like more of an empty practice session at best. This game is just a blast with friends that you can easily show someone whose never played before a controller and play well into the night without becoming bored, and that's only with the content available as of this very early access build. For 9.99 I personally think that a better value is difficult to find, even here on Steam.			"

Early Access Review
								 This is probably one of the most fun games I've ever played. Being a fan of both roguelike adventure games and oldschool 8 bit action and never being able to get my fill of either, this game stopped up the hole in my soul. Competitve game fan? This is totally for you. Friendships have almost been ruined. I've made my girlfriend's little brother rage quit several times  (claims Berserk is op, wants you to remove it. plz dont.) The huge amount of unlockables keeps me coming back for more. The variety in weapon animations, awesome/funny monsters (huge fan of the ""flash my tentacles from under my robes"" mind flayers :D) and interesting spell/item mechanics to keep everything spicy in the dungeon.  I know this is the earliest version of early release, but I have a few polish suggestions for you guys. If you could add twin-stick movement support for game pads that would be awesome. As it is now there are specific advantages that mice have over keyboard/gamepad, and vice versa, namely a full 360 degree aim for  mouse players and  ease of movement for kb/gp. I suppose for some people without game pads it wouldn't be as fair, but I would just as well go out and buy two more so everyone at my pad can enjoy perfect aim and movement.  Another thing, somewhat building off of the last suggestion is within the Kourok boss fight. Along the bottom of the screen to the left is a blind spot where, unless a mouse player is taking control of the eye beam, you cannot hit the challenger whatsoever. Perhaps you could add a scrolling left/right adjustment crosshair instead of the five direction spread for the eye beam? That way every section of the screen can be blasted with the beam.  Besides that as of now, I don't have any complaints. I don't think balance is an issue seeing shops/levels/monster spawns are all random, and everyone has access to the same types of spells/items/weapons/monsters. It's a perfect balance of luck/skill that allows a player to excel if they perform well, but can still be thwarted with a bit of teamwork and quick thinking from the ghosts. I can't wait to see how you guys expand on the dungeon aesthetics, more colors/props/texture and whatnot. If I could give any suggestions/requests on this, I think it would be interesting to see the dungeon floors randomized like the Infinite Layers of the Abyss from Dungeons and Dragons Grayhawk cosmology. Instead of having the floor's identities set in stone, just have the decor and name reflect each other and randomly generated (ie, acid themed floor ""The Acrid Hive"" or flesh walls/floors ""Hall of Goosebumps."") Another roguelike game that has this element somewhat is a bullet hell  called Shoot First. Music reflecting the decor would be awesome too.  And one last request.. please implement a monster that's like the Devil from Heroes of Might and Magic 3 http://www.heroesofmightandmagic.com/heroes3/h3px/archdevil.gifThey are able to enter a burst of flame and teleport across the battle grid... maybe area damage when enter/exit the flames? The scythe would be awesome flavor too. Thanks for reading!~			"

								Well time to review Crawl, a game I've been wanting to play since I first heard the awesome voice in the trailer. Overall this is a postivie review living up to my mental hype.

Pros:-Crawl plays very well and the engine is smooth overall-4 players and bot support, good for both the solo gamer and the popular one-Boss fight is amazing!-Graphics, though the some may not like the style, the 8bit feel works really well with the game overallCons:-Not a huge ammount of game to play right now, maybe a little much for the $10-There are points where you just aren't doing anything and waiting for others to make their moves-Steep learning curve, the player has a lot of health and the monsters have much lessOverall the game is building up to be an amazing early acess title and I'm very much looking forward to the full release.

The balance (although tenuous, because the game isn't finished with updates, I hope) is superb, and frankly I can't say enough to praise this game.  Although I will say this:  Stick it to EA with their proprietary engines and decepit corporate ladders by supporting two guys that had a VISION(that didn't suck, still looking at you EA), and made it a reality.  This is the best new game I've played this year, and it damn well earns the $10 asking price.Hell yes, I recommend this game.			"

Early Access Review
								Crawl caught me entirely by surprise. The concept, gameplay and art style were all so fresh and unique that I was immediately hooked by this game. There are too few games in the world today that evoke the same emotions as the quest involved in playing a round of Crawl with your friends.Firstly, as an early access game, I was astonished when I picked this up because I found little to no glitches or bugs and it was bursting with content right from the start. The community is also very much alive and the developers are simply phenomenal, always keeping you updated as to their progress and ideas for the game. The gameplay is like nothing I've ever played with up to 4 players playing locally (3 as ghosts and one as a hero) attempting to become a level 10 hero and defeat the dungeons boss. The catch is that since there is only one hero at a time, if you are not playing as the hero, you are one of the 3 ghosts controlling the dungeons minions, traps and bosses attempting to kill the hero and whomever deals the killing blow becomes the next hero.Games are generally fast-paced and frenetic yet the overall game round can take up to 30-40 minutes to play through depending on the players experience levels. The fact that the game is truly semi-cooperative in nature at all times is wonderful and keeps player interaction high. This is what makes local multiplayer gaming so wonderful to me and Crawl really delivers on that front. Many gamers have argued that they wished this game offered online support, and while I understand that not everybody has the opportunity to play with 4 players locally I really don't think this game would deliver the same experience if it were being played with people miles away on the internet instead  of your friends and family on the couch next to you.While I absolutely love this game and how unique and just plain fun it is the one major frustration for me would have to be the fact that the monster who deals the killing blow becomes the next hero and not the monster who dealt the most damage or some other qualifier. This just seems unintuitive, unfair and unrewarding to the non-hero players and I really think this should at least be an alternative option for the game settings if not the standard. I have discussed this with other gamers and while I understand their points as to how making it the player who deals the last blow can work as a balancing mechanism for weaker players I've seen it create just as much imbalance and more importantly change the flow of play to where camping is encouraged for monsters so that they can prepare themselves to deal the killing blow instead of simply attack the hero relentlessly. I truly believe that there should at least be an alternative option available in the settings for the monster who dealt the most damage to become the hero because I find it silly for a game to inherently make one of its mechanics just frustrating for the players  and immediately turn them off the excitement.Despite my one major criticism I have seldom found a game whose development has excited me as much as this one and I really hope that the developers consider my opinions on the game. Overall Crawl is definitely a game worth checking out for any gamer who wants to experience a new and exciting type of game and I highly recommend it if like me you are a huge fan of local multiplayer games that appeal to that childhood sense of playing arcade games and other video games side to side with your friends and family before the lonely Online Gaming era.

								Despite being a just launched Early Access title, this game is already awesome. It is a local coop dungeon crawler intended for 2 to 4 players and meant to be played with controllers. It's really fun, challenging for all players and somewhat competitive within a group who plays it.A match can last 30 to 90 minutes, it really depends on how it's played. It's incredibly fun and almost endlessly replayable.Though, I must warn you - to get the full fun of this game, you'd wish to have a group of 3-4 people (2 may work out as well, but...) in the same room with at least 2 controllers. Otherwise your experience may vary, because (I didn't try, it's just a presumption) it won't be very fun to play with AI and there's no online coop, so you have to gather up at someone's home. Also it's really poorly played when you try to play with 2 players on the same keyboard.			"

								I wouldn't normally review an Early Access game but this deserves it because it 'works'. There are no problems with this release from a technical perspective, all that's missing is some content which the devs are / will be adding. What I love about this game is that a 'game'. Almost like a board / card game, the principles and mechanics are the same each time you play but the enjoyment and experience each time (which takes 10-20 minutes) is unique. This is not a co-op game, it's versus; a game in which you and up to three other AI or friends must battle it out to reach level 10 and defeat the boss. Only one player can be 'alive' at one time and the others must kill them by spawning as monsters or using traps to hinder the other's progress. Fantastic little game and I look forward to seeing what other additions are made.			"

								Bought in early access, this game is outstanding, the wonderful old school look yet modern feel.  Simply Beautiful.  This is a must have. Takes me back to the 1980's arcades with a mixture of D&D and Castlevania.  Can I say it enough? I LOVE THIS GAME!!			"

								I thought this was going to have online MP, but it really doesn't matter or change my opinion the game.  This is a fun concept, and although I have only played with two players total, it was very enjoyable.  I think with four friends this game could really be a riot.Kudos to the devs for doing something new and putting gameply first.  It shines through in the execution and Crawl is a really entertaining game to play.			"

								This game came out of no where.  I saw the trailer for the first time today and yelled ""SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!""  Well... they got my money.  Within one hour of gameplay I realized that it was money well spent.  It is a great local co-op party game!  I'm not even sure what to compare it to...It's a dungeon crawl (get it?) but only one person is the hero at a time.  The other people play the monsters.  When they kill the hero, they become the hero who then joins the monsters.  As you level up, you level/upgrade your hero and your monsters at the same time.  You basically play until the game ends one way or another (hero wins or monster wins).  The winner is the person scored the most points along the way.The pixel graphics are beatiful.  The whole feel of the game is nostalgic, yet fresh at the same time.  It only takes a few moments to figure out what is going on.  The polish on this game is already amazing (even in the early access phase).  It's already a complete game in my opinion, but I can't wait to see what content gets added to the full release!  I could totally see different dungeons with different bosses to play.  You get to play as the boss when the hero fights him by the way.Lot's of fun.  Buy this!!			"

I'm looking forward for more content but as for now, this is a clear YES, BUY THIS GAME!			"

								There is not a lot of hope in local multiplayer in these days, everything turning to online multiplayer but it seem some havent forget its the best way to play video-games. Crawl is a fantastic game for playing with friends, the gameplay mecanics are unique and fun, the musics are great and the animation/pixel art is really good. Playing this game with friend worth all the AAA titles from the past years for a very small price. Reccomend it for everyone! Powerhoof is an awesome studio, giving news and presence on social media since the greenlight trailer, awesome work!			"

Early Access Review
								Here's a multi-part review discussing how the game works and then information about how my kids of various ages interact with the game.-- How it Works -- The game is gorgeous and we all really love how it looks and sounds. Up to 4 players play locally (2 minimum). 1 person plays as a human, the other 3 play as ghosts. The human is seeking gold and experience. Once the human grows up to experience level 10, they make go into a special realm and fight a final end-boss. If they win against the boss, they are the dungeon survivor.The ghosts, on the other hand fly around grabbing orbs. Once they collect enough orbs they're able to drop simple slime monsters into the map. If ANY monster is in a room, then the doors lock and the human must slay them. In some rooms the ghosts may be able to use Monster Symbols to take control of a larger monster and directly fight against the human. In some rooms, the ghosts can possess traps and trigger them against the human. If a ghost kills the human, they come into the game as the human and the dead player returns as a ghost.Here and there you'll find a shop where you can upgrade your spells, weapons, or passive abilities.The entire purpose of the game is to play as a human long enough to get to level 10, then escape the dungeon by killing the boss.What's really fun, is that you only get 1 chance to fight a boss monster per dungeon floor. If you fail, or are not a high enough level, then you most descend further into the dungeon before you can try again. Between each floor in the dungeon, the players can exchange the power they've gained (granted when the human levels up) to evolve their selections of monsters, to effectively increase the difficulty of the next floor of the dungeon. This is definitely a lot of fun.The final boss is a large beast that 3-players can take control of simultaneously against the human. If the players are on point, it's VERY HARD.With only a few players, this game is very very simple. With 4-players actually trying to do a good job, the game is hectic and REALLY shines.-- Family --My 4-year old is a little unsure of the exact goals. But, she does like possessing items in the maps.  But, she gets tired of the game after 1 run-through.The 9-year old has it all figured out and she does a great job. We really like playing this game 4-player as a family. The 4-year old gets a BIT distracted sometimes. But, overall she's ok. I definitely had to take her through the game a few times 2-player with the explicit purpose of showing her around before she could understand it.-- Overall --I can't wait till they add more boss types and dungeon diversity. This game has fantastic style and I trust these developers to make the right decisions for the game.			"

Crawl never plays out the same way twice and contantly reveals new content every time you finish a game. I cannot recomend Crawl enough.			"

								The game of the gods.  For one, the resurgence of this style of graphics in video games is the best thing ever so this game is already the most beautiful thing I've seen in a long time (I'm very picky you see).  On top of that you have super fast pick it up action where every is involved all the time!?  This game is so charming and so are the developers.  I'm still getting to know them but they are pretty involved with the community playing this game and are very open to the ways in which they are expanding this.  This game is going places and is already a fantastic game even to play on your own, much more once it really gets going!  Easy game, easy controls mixed just right to provide you with amazing chaos and in depth complicated anger and compitition!  Who cares who wins when you get to unlock awesome loot and do it all again in the next ten minutes!			"

								This game is a very fast-paced, addicting and widely multiplayer mix between a Bullet Hell shooter and an RPG. It's fun to play with your pals in front of one screen and on one couch to enjoy the game.One of the most notable features of Crawl is its extreme replay value. Everybody loves getting rewarded even if they lost, so the game will always intensify after every time you play, which adds more possibilities for a character! The 0.3 update was very useful, because it doesn't take long to unlock everything in v0.2 and especially v0.1. v0.3 added some dieties, evolutions and even an alternate boss that can be very useful and effective. But that's what's best about this game: the frequent updates! But, one of the most well-known features is the awesome animations and the retro feel. The animatons are indescribable. They are the smoothest out of every single pixel-graphic game I've ever seen.Thus, I rate this game an 11/10. That's right. 11/10. Never stop being awesome, Powerhoof!			"

								This game is great and keeps getting better with each update. Well worth the $9.99.Pros:-Each time through is different-Good variety of weapons, monsters, traps, and spells-Great fun with a group of friends-Unlocking new items and features after every session makes it hard not to start up another session just to see what the new stuff does-Plays quick (about 30 - 60 minutes) for a session-Very polished already and very few minor bugsCons:-No online support yet: I can't play it with friends who don't live near by : (-Music variety: Good music but there is only a few tracks-Scenery variety: The rooms always uses the same brown brick and tile, a variety of different backgrounds would be nice.Mixed Bag:-Your aim is always in the same direction as your movement. This keeps the game controls from becoming overly complex, but it prevent you from back-peddling while firing a projectile attack.-Fights can become super chaotic, and it becomes very easy to lose track of your character.  Sometimes this adds to the fun and other times it can be a little frustrating. "

It's a game of endless fun and the more the merrier!  Game play: ten, Replayability: ten, Fun factor: ten, Controls: ten.

								Crawl is definitely one of the greatest local multiplayer experiences I have ever had. It is a fun arcade dungeon-crawling combat game with a great depth for something that you can pick up without having to explain a ton of mechanics. The combat feels fluid and diverse due to its wide array of weapons for the human and much greater cast of monsters. This game is always fun, and it has had some outstanding free updates. It feels very polished even when playing with bots and it has entertained a couch full of guests who knows how many times!If you want a fun and competetitive game for you and your friends I cannot reccomend tthis game enough!

Game over for the other two, right? WRONG. That's what makes this game unique. The other two (in ghost form) can either 'possess' traps or spawn monsters to fight the survivor. You know how you always have to kill monsters to progress in roguelikes? This time, the monsters are your friends.The only thing I'd say it's missing is online mp via steam. It's still a great game, though.			"

								At version 0.9 I would say this game is a great buy if you want to play a local multiplayer game that is both cooperative in one aspect and competitive in another. This game is cooperative because you join up with your dead allies and try to kill the current hero, but at the same time you want that last hit to become a hero, so you might not want to pull your weight during some encounters until the right moment arrives. Also, playing against three of your friends as a hero is a pretty big challenge considering how strong some monsters are, so going first  AI on hard mode can be fun to play against since their aim is pretty on point and can make for a great challenge at some times, since I have seem them occassionally stick to walls and just die there. Playing by yourself isn't exactly the most amount of fun and having to unlock new monsters and items can be considered a both positive and negative, since it gives you something to work for, but at the same time it would be nice to have everything to play with your friends from the start. Also, unlocking everything seems like it would take less than 9 hours of gameplay, so unlocking items and monsters is not really a big grind, which helps.I think if they added a few more bosses and balanced a few of the weak monsters, then this game would be 10/10 when playing with friends.Overall,if you got friends and want to have fun killing each other, then this is a game you should buy.

								Already love this game! The unlocks keep you playing and playing, and the games are active and fun. Amazing couch coop game. The only thing it's lacking is more content in the weapons and bosses, and that will be fixed as it's in early access! The only challenge to this game is you will need friends who want to play it with you since it's local only at the moment, and bots only provide so much entertainment.8 / 10 - DEFINITELY reccomend. 9.8 / 10 as soon as the rest of the content gets plugged in			"

								This game.  My friends and I love dungeon crawling games and this one just put a new spin on it.  Being able to play both sides of the fight is an awesome thing but my personal favorite touch is the 4 person local play.  With the ability to set up quick button configurations and even use the mouse as it's own controller, we've had tons of fun.  Definitely recommended.			"

								Review Written on 25/01/2015 (Subject to change) Scroll for Pro's,Cons and Summary.Do you cherish your relationship with your friends?THEN DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!Crawl was made  with the intentions of turning even the strongest of bonds in to heated rivalries; One moment you will find yourself working with others to lower the heroes health, the next you're viciously scrambling to ensure you are the one who delivers  the final blow to take his place.Crawl offers that which seems to be a rareity in modern games: 4 player local multiplayer. Bringing back the golden days of real couch co-op. The game practically comes gift-wrapped in nostalgia, with its retro-arcade visuals,8-bit audio, two-button combat system and fast-paced gameplay.Gameplay:To begin with, you are greeted with an ""Insert coin screen"" where you must create a character name consisting of three letters. As simple as it sounds, it immediately welcomes you. Players  must then  select a god to worhsip. Each offering three different monsters with their own evolution path and starting conditions.The premise is simple; One player starts as the hero, who must reach level 10 by descending floors to defeat the boss and claim salvation.  Sounds easy eh? This would be the case, if you didn't have three other players , in ghost form, competing to become the hero in the process, by possessing traps, summoning monsters and deploying slimes. This makes survival as the hero extremely difficult, even more so as the other players gain ""Vitae"" a currency used to evolve their monsters each time the hero levels up or they draw blood from him.Fear not though! All is not lost, as each floor contains a blacksmith, where the Hero is able to spend gold they have accumilated through killing monsters, to purchase new weapons, trinkets and powers . However, getting to the shop first on each floor is essential if you want to claim all the best gear before anyone else.This is where Crawl really shines, it offers a sense of progression. The amount of purchaseable gear is satisfactory, and even after death, any itmes purchased are not lost.  The monsters don't lose out either, as between floors, players are prompted to evolve their monsters, becoming stronger and increasing their chances of killing the hero.Now, let's discuss one of my favourite aspects of the game: Bosses.Once players have reached level 10, they are able to face a boss, should they choose to do so, by entering the boss room and standing on a glyph. However, you can only have one attempt at the boss per floor, and three overall between everyone. This is when things become interesting, as you need to ensure you are well equipped for the battle, but have to accept the fact that persuing better gear always comes with the risk of dying and not becoming the hero again, allowing others to face the boss. Here's the brilliant part; Once the boss fight begins, any player who is not the hero is able to possess one of the bosses body parts such as the arms and head. Each limb will have a different attack, meaning cooperation and coordination is essential. If the hero prevails, the player wins the game, If the hero is to fail, he will be sent back to the floor with little health and the game continues. If all boss attempts have been used and the hero dies on the final attempt, it's game over. The winner being decided by whoever has accumilated the most XP during the game...Oh and the hero's character is permanently lost, although there seems to be no real penalty for this as there is nothing tying you to your character post-game. You can literally create another character with the same name straight after. To counter this, me and my buddies came up with a system where if your character dies, you can no longer use that three letter name again. Not much of a loss, but better than what the system currently offers.With the completion of each game, win or fail, you earn unlocks. Wether it be new traps, new evolutions for your monsters, weapons , tomes etc.... This adds to the games already enormous amount of replayability. (After 15 hours of play I still haven't unlocked everything!)Mechanics:The game plays best with a controller, although a mouse and keyboard is entirely useable. The two-button system is easy to use; you have a primary and secondary attack and a stick for movement, although the mouse can also used for movement; your character will move to where the cursor is pointed. I found the mouse a little more tedious and difficult to use as opposed to the gamepad. The fighting system is easy to understand, the difficulty comes from avoiding attacks and timing.  Personally, I'd like to be able to carry a ranged and a melee weapon and have another button to switch between the two. All in all, due to the simplicity of the controls, combat feels fluent and tight, with the animations complimenting and completing the system. Multiplayer:Be prepared for cursing, shouting, physical violence and possibly a heart attack-enduced death as you work extremely hard to bring the heroes health down only to have a friend steal the kill and become the hero. This game is best experienced with friends. You can of course play solo, the A.I is more than capable of providing a decent challenge, and is surpringly believeable, making human-like errors. But local couch multiplayer is the heart and soul of this game, and besides, there's no better feeling than defeating your friends and claiming salvation.Unfortunately, at the time of this review, Online multiplayer is not currently implemented. This is a shame because me and my buddies aren't always together, and we'd love to get some Crawl on when this is the case. Fingers crossed though!Another feature I would love to see in this game is Steam Workshop intergration. I'm sure modders would have a blast creating massive amounts of content. This would no doubt increase the lifespan of Crawl.Graphics and audio:Crawl is certainly a pretty game. From the intentional graphical glitches at the main menu, to the colourful displays of attacks ,traps, monsters and blood spills. The pixelated aesthetics feel right at home and sit comfortably amongst the haunting 8-bit track that accompanies them. The randomly generted dungeons  can get a little samey, but there is enough diversity to keep things interesting and the developers have confirmed that dungeon generation, music,  monsters, traps, items and a whole plethora of content will be added. IssuesNaturally, being in early access, Crawl is not without it's flaws; Ghosts being dragged too quickly from the last room into the next when the hero is running through them, sometimes resulting in the inability to utilise a room filled with traps. The occasional door refusing to let you pass or objects disappearing and reappearing. But these are problems that can easily be ironed out; over the 15 hours I've played, I had only encountered a few of these issues and rarely did they hinder the experience.Pro's:-4 playerLocal multiplayer-Progression system/RPG Elements-Brilliant premise; friends play as monsters -Fast-paced gameplay-Lot's of content-Replayiblity-Feels polished-Easy to jump straight in-Gorgeous pixel art-Strong mechanics-Low system requirements-More content to comeCons:-No Steam Workshop-No online Multiplayer-You will put Friendships to the test-Occasional bugsSummary:Crawl feels incredibly well-polished for an early access game, offering fast-paced gameplay, a unique take on the genre and a level of competitiveness that could only be achieved within it's own universe. 8.5/10  ""Must Buy""			"

								Just played for the first time last night - oh my goodness is this game fun.  The art scheme is fantastic, the controls are excellent, pretty much every aspect of this game is superb.  Playing as the hero is fun and if someone playing seems to be unkillable the other players are handicapped by gaining vitae which allows them to upgrade their monsters and give them an edge.  Anyways just take my word for it and buy it already - if you are trying to build your library of local co-op games to be played on the couch with friends this is a must have.			"

								Absolutely fantastic game that harks back to days of old where you and a few mates huddled around one singular TV set clutching an assortment of third party controllers in your sweaty palms, hoping to lay the proverbial smack-down on your enemies. Excellent levelling progression with trinkets and upgrades galore plus a quite innovative 'evolve your monsters' section between dungeon floors allowing you to improve your dungeon master style bestiary as the hero acquires sharper, more pointier implements of death from the blacksmith.I would love to see a proper over the internet multi-player feature added in the distant future as it would put the final gem in the crown of this great game. Until then I guess I'll have to dig out all the old third party controllers and my mates...wherever they are haha!			"

								Some people are afraid of what they might find if they try to analyze themselves too much, but you have to CRAWL into your wounds to discover where your fears are. Once the bleeding starts, the cleansing can begin. - Tori AmosThis game is amazing. The amount of pixelated chaos, unlockables, and 3 v 1 beatdowns instantly made me a fan. My only qualm is that the game does not have an online multiplayer feature (yet?), but it more then makes up for it in its ability to immerse you into the adventures of a man against the world (or three friends who want to take his skin).When I first sat down to play the game I expected an early access game to have bugs and technical issues. I have not found one and its made my experience all the more enjoyable. The gameplay is fun and moves at a great pace, the fighting element is rather balanced between heroes and monsters, and the simplicity of the game makes it easy to understandand  and enjoyable for anyone to jump in and play. This game may seem like other dungeon diving games, but despite what the title says this game stands on its own two feet above the competition. Its a casual dungeon beat em up and this game has great potential if or when they decide to add on more to it. If you're looking for a game thats new, but feels like a classic this may be the one. Check out the trailers (which I've watched countless times), read more reviews, and watch gameplay to see if you'd enjoy it. I've been looking for a game I could just sit down, play, and have good fun with. Crawl plopped into my lap like a big fat answer.  "

								Ever since I've seen the teasers for this little game, I've been really eagerly waiting for its release. Final verdict is that it was definitely worth the wait, with the only disappointment being no online multiplayer (which hopefully comes). The whole concept is every fun and novel, in which all the maps seem to be procedurally generated as you play. One player starts off as the Hero, while the others play as three Ghosts, which have the ability to possess things throughout the rooms... such as pentagrams, for monster summons, and dormant traps, which can be utilized.The object for the players is simple: Be the first to get up to XP Level 10 so you can open up the portal to face the final boss and fight for your escape. A Hero earns their experience by killing the opposing players who take monster forms, but there's also a second form of specialized experience, particularly useful to the Ghost players: Vitae. Every time a Ghost player causes damage to the current Hero, they earn this currency, which can be used in a variety of ways, like taking a warp to the floor's shop, pay tribute to an idol for quick cash, or... if you're feeling more offensive... use it to upgrade your monsters. That melee skeleton not cutting it for you? Upgrade it to a bow skeleton for heavier, ranged damage. Being an early access game, I can see there's still plenty more to be made for this game, so I can see this system being expanded on quite nicely. Even better, winning the game makes unlocks more things to use in the game, which helps increase the replay value here.My only gripe is the lack of online multiplayer, which could make this game's popularity explode greatly, but even then... If you have four controllers to plug into your PC? Get this... NOW. It's definitely a riot of a local multiplayer party game. :>			"

								Get friends together for this because it is a blast with others in particular.  It would be interesting to know if this game would have been more lucrative as an arcade hit or a Steam game because it really puts together some great elements for multiplayer action.  Whether you are playing as a human or monster you are frenetically scampering to survive.  Worth the early access knowing that the more the players; the better the feedback.  Here's some initial observations:- aiming with a bow is difficult, I like the system given to the giant, perhaps allow the hold and aim option for humans (not an option, yet)- remap the keys if you want to save your one thumb from smashing endlessly (this is an option just general feedback)- give more motivation to opening chests / barrels / furniture it mostly helps the monstersThanks for the great start to a great game.

Early Access Review
								Thought it can be a lonesome crawl with the lack of online multiplayer, ""Crawl,"" even in Early Access form, is a goldmine of local multiplayer value that shouldn't be missed.In Crawl, you and 1-3 other players are all trapped in a dungeon guarded by a gargantuan monster. One of you will be a human fighter while the others are relegated to existing only as insubstantial phantoms. The hero is free to exlplore throughouth the dungeon, delving deeper into its catacombs as necessary to continue on in hopes of treasure, merchants, or a teleporter which can take the hero to the final boss room and either freedom or absolute destruction. As the hero moves from room to room, however, the phantom players can and will do everything they can to kill the hero, from possessing a variety of traps and summoning helper slimes to, most essentially, manifesting in the physical forms of any manner of beast from bear-trap summoning goblins to centaur archers to formidable gazer demons more than capable of slaying would-be-heroes. In the event that any phantom does kill the human opponent, they themselves will procure that player's humanity, spawinging as their own mortal fighter. This is the key pattern of the gameplay, with the hero being rewarded with experiencing points and the chance to purchase rare treasures from merchants nestled within the dungeon catacombs, while the phantoms are rewarded with stronger monsters and blood, which can later be turned into gold should they attain human form. The essential goal is to reach level 10 as the hero and, with the aid of an already impressive variety of unlockable weapons, potions, spells, and other items, reach the teleporter room instanced on each floor of the randomly generated dungeon and face the final boss in combat. The phantoms can possess parts of the boss's body to aid in the assault against the hero in an all-or-nothing battle. With victory, the hero is rewarded with freedom, but, should the hero be slain by his friends in his final assault, his name and likeness will forever be cast into ashes.This game is still a work in progress but is still an easy product to recommend because all of the fundamental features and gameplay mechanics are already quite functional, entertaining, and polished. The core gameplay of killing your friends and becoming stronger in doing so is well-polished and, a few Early Access hiccups aside (including a lack of variety as of the time of this review and a forgivable level of question of balance with certain elements) is absolutely addicting in it's fast-paced flow of action, chance, and reward. The game is themed well with what could be called a haunted-arcade vibe that keeps the visceral action light and helps the player appreciate the charming and beautifully rendered retro-style graphics. While the look could understandably be considered ""played-out"" to some extent, in the current indie environment, but the atmosphere cast over the room by the up-tempo horror-midi soundtrack is both appropriate and exceptional.With flawless controller support, easy-to-grasp yet hard-to-master brutal combat, quick 20-60 minute gameplay sessions and great mood I would absolutely recommend ""Crawl"" to any gamer who lives with other gamers or plays often with others in the same room. ""Crawl"" has no online support whatsoever and, while the bots are functional and helpful if you have less than 4 people, playing alone feels like more of an empty practice session at best. This game is just a blast with friends that you can easily show someone whose never played before a controller and play well into the night without becoming bored, and that's only with the content available as of this very early access build. For 9.99 I personally think that a better value is difficult to find, even here on Steam.			"

Early Access Review
								 This is probably one of the most fun games I've ever played. Being a fan of both roguelike adventure games and oldschool 8 bit action and never being able to get my fill of either, this game stopped up the hole in my soul. Competitve game fan? This is totally for you. Friendships have almost been ruined. I've made my girlfriend's little brother rage quit several times  (claims Berserk is op, wants you to remove it. plz dont.) The huge amount of unlockables keeps me coming back for more. The variety in weapon animations, awesome/funny monsters (huge fan of the ""flash my tentacles from under my robes"" mind flayers :D) and interesting spell/item mechanics to keep everything spicy in the dungeon.  I know this is the earliest version of early release, but I have a few polish suggestions for you guys. If you could add twin-stick movement support for game pads that would be awesome. As it is now there are specific advantages that mice have over keyboard/gamepad, and vice versa, namely a full 360 degree aim for  mouse players and  ease of movement for kb/gp. I suppose for some people without game pads it wouldn't be as fair, but I would just as well go out and buy two more so everyone at my pad can enjoy perfect aim and movement.  Another thing, somewhat building off of the last suggestion is within the Kourok boss fight. Along the bottom of the screen to the left is a blind spot where, unless a mouse player is taking control of the eye beam, you cannot hit the challenger whatsoever. Perhaps you could add a scrolling left/right adjustment crosshair instead of the five direction spread for the eye beam? That way every section of the screen can be blasted with the beam.  Besides that as of now, I don't have any complaints. I don't think balance is an issue seeing shops/levels/monster spawns are all random, and everyone has access to the same types of spells/items/weapons/monsters. It's a perfect balance of luck/skill that allows a player to excel if they perform well, but can still be thwarted with a bit of teamwork and quick thinking from the ghosts. I can't wait to see how you guys expand on the dungeon aesthetics, more colors/props/texture and whatnot. If I could give any suggestions/requests on this, I think it would be interesting to see the dungeon floors randomized like the Infinite Layers of the Abyss from Dungeons and Dragons Grayhawk cosmology. Instead of having the floor's identities set in stone, just have the decor and name reflect each other and randomly generated (ie, acid themed floor ""The Acrid Hive"" or flesh walls/floors ""Hall of Goosebumps."") Another roguelike game that has this element somewhat is a bullet hell  called Shoot First. Music reflecting the decor would be awesome too.  And one last request.. please implement a monster that's like the Devil from Heroes of Might and Magic 3 http://www.heroesofmightandmagic.com/heroes3/h3px/archdevil.gifThey are able to enter a burst of flame and teleport across the battle grid... maybe area damage when enter/exit the flames? The scythe would be awesome flavor too. Thanks for reading!~			"

								Awesome couch multiplayer game. Great music and visual imo. Gameplay is in a top down dungeaon crawling game. Main advantage it has is that it is very different compared to other couch multiplayer games. One person is the ""hero"" whilst others are ghosts going down levels of a dungeon. HeroThe aim of the hero is to level up to level 10, activate the portal and defeat the boss monster. The hero can also buy stuff from the black smith and store including weapons, buffs and special ability items. GhostsThe aim of the ghosts is to kill the hero and therefroe become the new hero. They do this by possessing traps and activating pentagrams to become monsters in the dungeon. The ghosts get viae points by other heroes leveling up to spend on evolving their monsters. Their is a good variety of monsters as of v0.3 with more to come. When the monsters hurt the hero they earn blood which they convert to gold to buy stuff when they are the hero.BossOnce a hero reaches level 10 they can activate a portal on a dungeon floor, with each floor's portal only allowed to be activated once, to fight the boss. The boss is controlled by the ghost players, eg one boss hass two tentacles and a head  making three control points and one boss has three different heads. If the hero dies they are shunted out. The boss can be fought three times total in a match until the games end.NO signs of online multiplayer anytime soon but I don't mind as the game has decent AI and I prefer them spend time adding more environements, creatures and bosses.In the end I would recommend this game if you want a multiplayer game such as towerfall, samurai gun, gang beasts etc mixed with dungeon crawling rouguelike gameplay and assymetric multiplayer like evolve or nintendo land games.

For 10$ anyone who enjoys rouge like or lite games would be stupid to at least not take a serious look at this game. I cannot wait to see what will become of this.			"

								I'm a career author, and I want to steal this game's ideas.I mean, holy ♥♥♥♥ are you kidding me?  Watch the trailer, with audio - listen to this man.  Listen to him rant like a mad god trapped beneath the earth.  MARK HIM.The thematics of this game are on point!  The whole thing has this 'cursed NES cartridge' motif going that I think is brilliant.  It's honestly inspiring a horror novel in my head as we speak.  We'll see where that goes.The gameplay is brilliant and unique, intense with just one friend to play local with a controller.  Even alone, it's bizarre and beautiful.  This is another indie Dark Fantasy title that's joining a few others in squirming out from the depths - oh, I could not be happier for this black tide.  You'll see.  You'll all see.			"

								HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥THIS GAME! I have been looking for a good couch co-op kinda game for a long time since they seems to be a dying breed. This game is less of a co-op and more a rowdy brawl! The nostalgic 8-bit graphics that give you the feel of crowding around an arcade upright while eldowing your friends in the ribs to try and make them slip up. The controls are smooth and item system has real impact and monster leveling gives you a feeling of individuality as a ghost rather than just another bit of fodder. I cannot wait to see what this game becomes with more time. Totally recomend this game as an early buy if you have the friends to play it with and some controllers.			"

You and three other people fight for a body as spirits, when you are in the body, you have your own individual experience, health, money and items. The other three have to kill you as monsters and traps. It's so much fun but the only downside is that it's local multiplayer only, I would much rather enjoy it online since (I don't have any friends.) and that I'm a lazy♥♥♥♥♥ Really wish this game had online multiplayer.

								Whether you're looking for a rogue-like dungeon crawl to play with family/freinds locally or by yourself, this is definitely a game you wouldn't want to skip over. This game has simplistic but very fun gameplay, mixed together with a very, very interesting twist of constantly playing back and forth as a human or monsters/traps as you perish within the duengeon.The gameplay is quick, choatic, and can be quite thrilling! You'll be screaming at your undead friends when they kill you, or they somehow manage to get the kill on the human before you. You'll have a laugh or two when a crate is randomly thrown at the alive player in a completely quite room. You also will curse the slimes your friends constantly spawn over and over, one at a time, in a single room to keep you trapped in there for a short while.There are countless different monsters with very different attack moves, which can change over the course of the game through upgrades. The same can be said about the weapons, items, and abilities for the human player, as there are numerous weapons with random bonuses, stat leveling (through drinking potions), trinkets that effect gameplay, and abilities for them to purchase as well. There are various monster sets to choose from, that come along with a deity that will grant the players bonus effects through out their game.Overall, it's a fantastic game with very few issues. Mainly, the only issue I have is that it can be insanely difficult, if not near impossible, to defeat the boss(es) if they are played by skilled players. Of course, that is only an issue with the people I play with, and not the game itself, but never-the-less, be prepared to have a very, very challenging fight if you play this game with other skilled players.

								This game revolutionizes 1v3 asymetrical gameplay by relying on an old game genre and reimagining it as a multiplayer experience. Basically, this game uses the dungeon crawler formula to pit one human or ""hero"" against 3 vengeful spirits. These teams are, however, not static. Ghosts can become monsters and control traps to attempt to defeat the human and steal his body for themselves.At it's core, this is  not a dungeon crawler or an asymmetrical team game, but a cut-throat free for all game (often only really seen in boardgames or table-top games) where you must work together with your fellow players whilst plotting how you want to take them down at the same time. Thus, the race to salvation begins.You need to reach lvl 10.You need to defeat the boss.You need to survive the pit.But how can you defeat the hero without working together?But are you able to defeat the boss with just the stats/equipment you have now?But why are there no female hero sprites??? #triggered #ermahgerd #triggered			"

								This game is fliptasticly fun. My ""hrs on record"" isn't going to be correct since I play this game with my kids on an offline machine in living room with controllers.Speaking of which, if you have some spare people and a machine in living room with controllers, you're in for a treat. Combat feels fluid and perfect. You only have two buttons to press and it all starts with a sinister beginning where everyone fights for their life. Along the way you pick up gold, buy new weapons and gear, and level up as you work towards fighting the big boss at the end that the other players can take control of.If you're not the hero, you gather wrath along the way and level up monsters of the form you take during play, take control of traps, or just do some general haunting like 20+ hrs in flinging a crate at the hero's face and killing them for as a first.5/7 perfect score, will continue flinging random objects at hero.

I've not played another game in my life with the mechanics this game instigates in a multiplayer setting, and yet I feel completely at home within those mechanics.All this being said, a warning:This game supports local co-op only, and the bots are just simply a poor substitute for a human player. Crawl is at it's peak with 4 human players. 3 works out okay, but I personally wouldn't recommend 2 or fewer real players.			"

								PROS:The easiest way I can describe it is that it's concept reminds me of The Legend of Zelda but only if one character plays as Link where you're a little guy with a sword and the other plays as Ganon where you summon monsters of all kind after the little guy with the sword. It's a really fun concept and I can see Powerhoof is trying to take as much advantage of this as they can, which of coarse is FREAKING AWESOME! I like how you don't even need to power up all the eldritch stones to activate the portal to the boss and how it's a different monster with it's own unique mechanics depending on how many you have powered up.This game is also a good example of how a video game doesn't need a real story what so ever to be enjoyable because it could leave your imagination up to do that if you wanted to like how it does for a silent protagonist's personality or motives. You can imagine the human as a hero and the ghost(s) as the villain, or the human as the villain or the ghost(s) as the hero(s), or there could be no good guy here at all but instead just poor souls fighting over a change at freedom and riches like a bunch of hungry wolves fighting over a dead rabbit. The possibilities are endless to what it could be happening down in the caverns.CONS:As fun as the game is and as much as I hate to admit it, the only thing that could make it complete is if they do put together a little online feature where you can play with friends from all over. Sure it's got local co-op AND I know that it's still on there to do list, but my point still stands that online is the only thing that's missing. But even with online still yet to be a reality, the game is pretty solid even when playing by yourself. Though when I played it by myself, I couldn't help but notice there's some slight kinks in the ghosts' AI. But it's still early access and these kinks do seem pretty minor like sometimes the ghosts would stay stuck in a corner for some reason, interracting with a trap that you're no where near which only happened once for me and they stopped obviously as soon as I left the room.ALL IN ALL:Really solid game, enjoyable even when playing by yourself, still waiting on that online even after a year and a bit but they can take there times since I'm sure they're getting to that soon.

								Supposedly, I have 30 minutes in this game. I've wasted so much more time than that. As of now, it is a great game, even though it only has 2 bosses. I can't wait for even more content updates. With a couple friends, this game is amazing. For you who don't have friends, I'm sorry, but you'll never be able to experience this game, so don't buy it.			"

								OK WHY WASNT THIS DONE BEFORE THIS GAME!?!?! i mean its the perfect idea how has not a single big gaming company done this idea before. I mean come on a dungeon crawler where your friend (or an AI) control the monsters and traps as ghost. it seems like such a no brainer yould think someone would have done that already. Either way even with this being early access and multiplayer oriented it is wortgh every penny. the AI is supprisingly good. even on easy they dont make a lot of realy stupid desicions like you would expect. you cant let your guard down against the AI or your freinds for a single second. be the ghost.kill your freinds!Steal there humainity!!WIN THE GAME!!!!!!!

								Crawl is a retro 8 bit pixel throwback with quite a gameplay twist. The controls on gamepads are very simple, being the traditional A=attack and B=special, like a true child of the '80s. The gameplay is superb, though a bit tricky to get used to at first. (But hey, they're doing something new, so it will take a little bit of getting used to).The ability of the player mobs to spawn on pentagrams is well thought out, but they also have the ability to take control of traps to further inhibit the Dungeoneer. This can become a bit of a cluster♥♥♥♥ if you have 3 enemy players, as some of the rooms are very small in regards to the amount of anti-hero objects in them.The leveling up features seem pretty smooth, as well as the Wrath mechanics, and the shop. The Boss pentagram that appears on each level (accessible at lvl 10) sends you to a room where you battle one of many huge bosses. This can feel a bit like an attack-spam sometimes, but only if you are significantly prepared for the boss through the purchase of upgrades. It does still feel like a retro boss battle.Overall I would give Crawl an 8/10They are bringing something new and interesting to the table in the form of something familiar. It is a great game to play  alone, or with friends, and it's a great excuse to cuss your friends out when they booby trap kill you before the final room.			"

Early Access Review
								Here's a multi-part review discussing how the game works and then information about how my kids of various ages interact with the game.-- How it Works -- The game is gorgeous and we all really love how it looks and sounds. Up to 4 players play locally (2 minimum). 1 person plays as a human, the other 3 play as ghosts. The human is seeking gold and experience. Once the human grows up to experience level 10, they make go into a special realm and fight a final end-boss. If they win against the boss, they are the dungeon survivor.The ghosts, on the other hand fly around grabbing orbs. Once they collect enough orbs they're able to drop simple slime monsters into the map. If ANY monster is in a room, then the doors lock and the human must slay them. In some rooms the ghosts may be able to use Monster Symbols to take control of a larger monster and directly fight against the human. In some rooms, the ghosts can possess traps and trigger them against the human. If a ghost kills the human, they come into the game as the human and the dead player returns as a ghost.Here and there you'll find a shop where you can upgrade your spells, weapons, or passive abilities.The entire purpose of the game is to play as a human long enough to get to level 10, then escape the dungeon by killing the boss.What's really fun, is that you only get 1 chance to fight a boss monster per dungeon floor. If you fail, or are not a high enough level, then you most descend further into the dungeon before you can try again. Between each floor in the dungeon, the players can exchange the power they've gained (granted when the human levels up) to evolve their selections of monsters, to effectively increase the difficulty of the next floor of the dungeon. This is definitely a lot of fun.The final boss is a large beast that 3-players can take control of simultaneously against the human. If the players are on point, it's VERY HARD.With only a few players, this game is very very simple. With 4-players actually trying to do a good job, the game is hectic and REALLY shines.-- Family --My 4-year old is a little unsure of the exact goals. But, she does like possessing items in the maps.  But, she gets tired of the game after 1 run-through.The 9-year old has it all figured out and she does a great job. We really like playing this game 4-player as a family. The 4-year old gets a BIT distracted sometimes. But, overall she's ok. I definitely had to take her through the game a few times 2-player with the explicit purpose of showing her around before she could understand it.-- Overall --I can't wait till they add more boss types and dungeon diversity. This game has fantastic style and I trust these developers to make the right decisions for the game.			"

								This game approaches multiplayer dungeon crawling in a very unique way. There's a really good balance that makes sure that if one side gets stronger, the other side will get stronger too so there's no one sided games based on early advantage.

								A very refreshing game that is great fun to play with people who are not that used to video games.Crawl is pretty beginner friendly with only 2 buttons and the 3 vs 1 gameplay with an elegant method of handicapping better players so the others stand a chance. Every content update has me stocked and even the art design and music are great for a game that I only expected to shine on gameplay.The only criticism I have is that while the 2 button style seems intuitive, people new to video games seem to have more difficulties with understand when what button does what than using 4 buttons. It was obvious to me as a gamer but to uninitiated folks the semantic category of what the buttons do seems to be harder to grasp. Still, it is a very fun game to play on couch coop and I can't wait for new cute monsters and chains to rattle.			"

I'm very excited to see where this game is going and have high hopes and dreams in my head of diffrent bosses, diffrent themes, more music, all of which is already in is great of course. but this game gave me a very fresh gaming experience and hope this game gets popular. plus for ten dollars its a steal.

								Warning : this game is a friendship breaker x) :I had the opportunity to play this game with some friends on the account of one of them and we spent quite a bit of time on it.This is a game that has good basics for an early access so I give him a positive note to encourage him ^^.However some deficiencies this presents:- a bestiary that still needs to be poffined (more creatures, lack of boss, and balancing has to do) but it seems to be on track.- after some games, for the experienced player, it often comes back to the same build for his hero: for my friends and me was the skill of the spectral arc which is ""god-tier"" so it becomes repetitive and for new Player face has experienced it quickly becomes frustrating to take a spanking as violent to begin.- In the case of an experienced player, it is often the case that once a hero stand out , it is difficult for monsters to be able to return to the game because either they die quickly against the hero or after change of hero this last is too weak against monsters that evolved a lot ...Maybe creates random events could allow some rolling between roles more frequently and break this never dying hero? I only quote flew to this game in this review however it is a very good games to play between friends at lan party and which I think needs to be refined but that is promising.Own my ""Friendship Breaker"" steam award  for this versus style :)			"

								This is the kind of game that brings us back to an erra where we could have people gathering in a living room wich controllers to play video games. its a solid yet simple concept . i read a lot of people are complaining over the lack of online multiplayer mode. however you have to understand that supporting an online multiplayer game like this would require some serious ressources and not every video game compagny is called riot games... for what it is it is an arcade game i strongly recommend.

								This is a great couch co-ompetitive game! I've been playing it pretty much during the holidays since its release, will be third year in a row now! This is the time of the year when I have people to play with as I visit family... uhm. The game itself has you battling to be the hero to kill the boss, you become the hero by killing the current hero with one of your possessed/summoned monsters or a possessed trap, this as you are a ghost. You level up both hero and monsters and the hero can equip various items bought in the shop. There are plenty of unlocks along the way, like new kinds of monsters and things that will appear on the map. While running around there are lots of things for the ghosts to interact with to hamper the progress of the hero. It's almost like a multiplayer rouge-lite. I like it in any case.To shake things up your group can set house rules, like how early (level) you are allowed to try and kill the boss, if you get multiple tries, etc.			"

								Giant statue of Gabe Newell kills me and steals my wallet. But seriously, local is great - got this game specifically for the Link. The trailers don't show half of the satisfying content this game contains. Buy this game purely on gut feeling, it seems the gameplay is boring to watch, but exciting to play. The lack of online isn't a problem - the singleplayer still thrills me, although with friends and a couple of remotes, this game is excellent. Trailer is pretty boss though. This game seems hardly like any other early access game - only thing missing is a variety of bosses.			"

Early Access Review
								What an incredibly well done couch/party game!Pretty quick, entertaining runs; easy to learn, (moderately) hard to master; weird ideas; very different monsters, traps and items; excellent retro style.The game might not seem fair every moment, because sometimes the hero gets bashed without a chance or monsters squished like bugs, but fairness comes back by the game's leveling system: the more the enemy heros level up, the more you can improve your monsters. That way even players with bad luck or lower skills advance.Even in Early Access Crawl already is more enjoyable and has a higher replay value than many (if not most!) finished games. One of the few things that should be improved (especially concerning balance) are the boss fights, but even if the game stayed exactly as it is, I'd still love it. (In fact, I wonder how much better it can possibly get...)			"

Either way even with this being early access and multiplayer oriented it is wortgh every penny. the AI is supprisingly good. even on easy they dont make a lot of realy stupid desicions like you would expect. you cant let your guard down against the AI or your freinds for a single second. be the ghost.kill your freinds!Steal there humainity!!WIN THE GAME!!!!!!!

The absolute best way to play this is to grab a few friends and crawl through the dungeons together. I could (and have) played this for hours at a time, which is very rare for me these days.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is an example of Early Access working, it is extremely replayable and feels more complete than most games at launch as is. I have been playing this 2 player couch coop with no Bots and it is an absolute blast, the combat for the hero is fluid and responsive with  the the upgrades from the shop and frequent gold snowball into making you feel massive progression even though each game is pretty quick.Early game for us the monster player felt a bit too weak if they do not have AI to support (AI is very dull - some ways incredible other absolutely stupid) and initial monster choices are very poor so you just have to grind them down with traps and attrition unless you have a flying eyeball - all hail the flying eyeball!The game does a great job of sorting itself out by linking player progress to your monster evolution and becomes a pretty tense duel around the mid game, (or more reason to disrupt your coop partner irl) so maybe it will be optimised around 4 player but dont let that stop you if you have no interest in bots and often play with less people. The biggest critisisms of course is the current monster balancing and few unique path choices on their growth, this is what makes a game meaningful and replayable, its not quite there yet but this is where its going to grow I imagine. Online multiplayer and a console release would make this instant indie GOTY and print money, as it is an absolutely incredible game that everyone should buy!			"

Early Access Review
								One of the best local multiplayer games I have ever played, perhaps the best if I exclude tekken nostalgia. The core idea of this game is just THAT good. And it is executed brilliantly. Easy to pick up and play, it thrusts up to four players into a dungeon full of traps and doors to the unknown. One player is always the human, trying to stay alive and gain levels by fighting monsters. The monsters, however, are controlled by your ""friends"" - many rooms have pentagrams on the floor, which, when approached by a ghost player, allow the summoning of a ghastly creature from the depths. As the player character gains strength, the monster players gain ""wrath"" - which in turn allows them to upgrade their monsters to a new, unique form. This way, the 1-3 players that are not currently the human constantly gain strength, which usually means it's just a matter of time until the human falls...And when he does, the ""ghost"" that struck the final blow trades places with the human, and gains XP and gold in his stead. The goal is to reach level 10 and challenge the boss of the dungeon. If you beat him, you win. If you lose, there are 2 more tries ANY player has to get out. Else, everyone loses. After a game you unlock more items to buy, more dungeon objects to encounter and use (at your own risk..) and more deities. At the beginning of each game, each player picks a deity, which will 1) determine what base monsters / upgrade paths are available to that player and 2) what passive ability / starting item the human form of that player has. There is a lot more diversity to this game than initially meets the eye, which is great. Dungeons are also procedually genereated, the intro varies a lot- it really tries hard not to get old anytime soon.And on that it succeeds in my opinion. If you have any opportunity to get friends in on this - do it. You wont regret it. There are simple yet interesting combat mechanics to master, and every game unfolds differently, depending on deities and what the shop has to offer on each stage. It's really good. As for the early access, it's hardly noticable - I actually only remebered because of the frequent updates.			"

								Crawl has become, unexpectedly, one of my favorite games Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155. As an indie game, it will be money well spent (privded you have people to play with for some fantastic couch co-op). Get it, its great.I own a lot of shared/split-screen games. I tend to organize a bunch of team sports, and pre-drinking is mandatory. To this end, having simple to play, local co-op games is a must for some good rowdy entertainemt. Crawl is simple to play (moderately hard to master). There are only two buttons, attack and special but the hook is that it is dynamic 3v1 set up. A 'human' player competes against three 'ghosts' to gain enough levels to be the one that challenges the boss. Ghosts inhabit monsters to kill the 'human'. The one that lands the deadly blow becomes 'human'. As 'human' players level, ghosts get currency to in turn level up their mosters. Thus, if you can't get a kill on a human and everyone levels around you, you will have more to spen on leveling monsters, ergo a higher chance of getting the kill. As monsters do damage to humans they gain currency they can use if they become human in a shop to increase their effectiveness. Once someone reaches enough power to challenge a boss, the 3 ghots comibine to controll that boss to fight. Overall, the game design is solid, unique, and super fun. If there are no monsters to inhabit, ghost characters can controll various traps and jump into items to harrass the 'human'.I've had this game for a long time and the developers are still providing updates with more monster evolutions, more items to purchas in the shop, and more trap dynamics. The only even remotely (possibly)negative thing is they have yet to add to the roster of end game bosses (currently there are only 2).While the overall this is a simple game there is a slight learning curve (mainly what are the monster attack/specials, possible human specials). There is progression (unlocking monster evolves/items), but it is pretty quick. Super casual players may be turned off by this, but overall, whenever I bust this game out, response is always positive.			"

Early Access Review
								good gameNo but srsly in the recent years of degrading game depth/skill ceiling, increasing focus on pretty graphics and simply catering to the average person, this game is what you and your group of competitive gaming oldones need. It's easy to pick up, since its basically only two action buttons, but the sheer amount of movement, item and monster mechanics allow it to be played in uncountable ways. To cut to the point: This piece of software right here is pretty much a top-down twin-stick rpg/shooter versus/co-op game, currently only supporting local multiplayer. Controls are basically L-stick to move/aim, A to shoot/slash, B to dodge/special move.The goal for every player is the same, kill the boss after reaching lvl10 in human form, to be released from the dungeon. A sudden-death at the start determines the first ''runner'' to enter the dungeon in human form, your slaughtered companions souls steadily haunting your every step to kill you and take away your humanity for themselves i.e. their try at defeating the dungeon. The dungeon in itself is harmless, but every trap and contraption can be used by the ghosts of the other players to make your run a living bullethell. Furthermore each room contains a differing amount of pentagrams which can be used as a ghost to spawn into a monster, each with its own unique moveset. These creeps can be lvled after every floor, levels in human form of enemy player determine your evolution points. Human Form spends picked up cash to get new weapons, artifacts, moves etc. each weapon with its own moveset, each ability with its own uses. After a human form hits lvl 10 they can enter the boss portal on every floor to have one of the three tries at defeating the boss, problem is, the boss is also controlled by the enemy players, making this whole game a really competitive experience best enjoyed if all players have the gitgud mentality.Soundtrack is amazing, fits the game perfect, really raw dark 8bit sounds whose rhythm still keeps you looped into the game.Graphics can be seen on screens.Only missing feature is online-multiplayer, in other aspects this is a game I support in every way and would buy again just to support development and show my gratitude for creating this piece of art. Definitely worth more than 10bucks.p.s. gitgud, dodge moves only, abuse the MoI, take the bow, crush the boss			"

								I bought this way back when it very first came out for I think it was 69p and to watch this game evolve over this period of time is amazing. This is a brilliant dungeon clrawler that was vvry thought out and has that retro/ arcade style to it to make it feel more like a classic dungeon crawler. I love the idea of taking control of monsters to kill your friends with and the progression based evolution of your monsters as you can choose what you want to evolve. This choices of evolvution are pretty wide making each playthrough feel dyanamic and unqiue. All in all this game is hours of fun with alot of replayability and I definetly reccommend that you buy it.			"

								Very fun multiplayer bash. Awesome concept.I played through it once on single player, but I haven't played single-player any more than that because I don't want to get too good at the game for fear of it not being fun when playing with others who are playing for the first time.I had to borrow a couple of controllers in order to play 4-player but it was definitely worth it.

								I cannot even begin to explain how amazing this game is. I bought it yesterday because the idea of the game seemed amazingly interesting! (It's amazing!) and it truly is super interesting. The amount of detail and creativity put into this game blows my mind. Just the concept alone is cool. Then you unlock things as you play and there are new bosses and so much more. It adds a whole nother level of greatness. My only complaint is if you play this game with 4 players then only three tries are given (total or between all characters) to fight the boss. This makes it more grindy due to the fact that everyone else is controlling the boss and it's a 3v1. I love the challenge but maybe there could be an option for how many tries you get so it doesn't get so grindy. Anyways I love the game. It's fantastic and I recommend it to everyone. Amazing job on this game and thank you for making this game. Defiantly a favorite forever			"

This game brought me back to gaming outside of LoL.This game breaths life into the dungeon crawler genre with its smooth controls and original playstyle. There are only a couple monsters that feel remotly similar, but other than those few every monster is unique in its playstyle and every move you make counts. It's fast paced and as fun as advertised. What sold me for this game before purchase was the monolouge, and the actual game has no shortage of pre battle monolouges with that amazingly ghastly voices. I legitimatly get shivers on some of them. Every game that you start has a completely new monolouge that you have most likely not heard in any of your previous games.The combat is very fair and you know what you did wrong if you die. The mosters have very cut and dry strengths and weaknesses. Though some of them require that you have a certain type of weapon to counter, or you're good at using special spells.Very original and very fun. Worth every cent even in single player mode and once multiplayer comes out it is worth even more!			"

								Crawl is a single or up to four player local co-op game. The retro style and the pixel art is flawless. This games concept is interesting and well executed. You can play as the monsters or the hero. Who ever lands the final blow on the hero becomes the hero. If one player is really good at the hero the other player will have leveled up their monster meaning they can take over. Another great point is that when it comes to the boss fight the other three players get to each control a part of the boss while the fourth player tries to beat the game. The different upgrade paths in the monsters keeps the game diverse and intersenting.Cons: one thing this game is missing is online co-opThis game is looking up to become a well polished multiplayer game. This game is great with friends and is a fun quick burst of gameplay.			"

								The developers are little overly fond of the phrase ""torn apart"" and variants in their release notes.I mean it's kind of understandable. Everybody gets torn apart in this game. A lot.Oh, you might be wondering, what stops the player in the human flesh bag from just dawdling around and wasting everybody's time? You can do that but when the ghost players aren't otherwise occupied, they're always zooming back and forth gathering up ambient ectoplasm blobs which they can spend to summon slimes. Slimes are pretty pathetic but you can summon them in numbers as a distraction in larger fights and the hero doesn't get rewarded for killing them. Best of all slimes lock the doors when you summon them, which is good fun when the hero is just about to rush out of a trap room.I was surprised though, I was worried being a ghost would feel like wasted time but honestly not only is it fun to be a ghost but you still feel like you're in the running and pushing to win, and as a session progresses humanity starts flipping back and forth between people with hilarious frequencyIdk I'll write a real review later maybe, basically it's good and you should get it. It's wonderfully competitive enough that even when playing against bots you forget that you're playing against bots			"

								I can't remember if I have ever left a review for any game in all the years I've been on steam.  If I did, it wasn't a good enough one for me to remember.  I'm leaving one now.Simply put:  This game is awesome.  This is one of THOSE games:  Games that I break out in a party setting with my friends and we play it over and over and over.  The idea behind this game is simple enough, but there's enough under the hood to add some depth and variety that it doesn't make the game boring at all or feel repetitive.  Nothing is more satisfying in the world than closing off a room from the hero (as he tries to dash to the portal),  stealing a kill from another monster player (while already at level 10) and race into the adjacent room, open the portal, and attempt to kill the boss.This game will test friendships, no doubt.  It is worth every penny and I can't wait to see what else they add to it.  I'm not crying for lack of on-line multiplayer.  And, the game has some AI in it, so you can even play solo if you want.  (I also really like the 'drop in' / 'drop out' feature A LOT.  Very handy.)  I realize that a lot of people like that component and want it... but the magic here is playing with 3 other friends all in the same room.			"

								This game is a wonderful example of a group of developers who continue to make their game better and better, and are not total moneygrubbers! I mean this is one of those games i have come back and played for HOURS on end (i did however play it mostly on a different account.) This game is super unique and super fun, with a really excellent 4v1 system(wish they could have implemented something half as good as this in Evolve.) And there are so many things to unlock. New challenges. Et cetera. This game is AMAZING! I honestly can't think of a single thing wrong with it. For 9.99, this is an excellent buy to play on your own, to play with a friend, or as i use it a really great game for game night when you have a nice group coming in. Powerhoof, Thank you SOO much and i look forward to seeing much more from you.			"

								Crawl is one of the most refreshing, yet reminescent 4 man vs game ive played in a long time. the controls and play design are intuitive yet manage to have both an arcade feel, and the finesse of a highskillcap game. Additionally the art style and game direction is absolutely inspired, monsters slerp and skitter about, while the hero brandishes his weapon with strength and purpose. the hero/monsters feel menacing and involved yet there mechanics are intuitive enough to pick up and play for any gamer. The game is very well composed and every aspect of its art style feels very appropriate and contributory. there are (as always with early access) a handful more game options id like to see, but i have confidence they will come in time. overall a heartfelt loveletter to gaming days of yore, a must buy for any one who remembers a videogame arcade.8/10 in early access			"

								Giant statue of Gabe Newell kills me and steals my wallet. But seriously, local is great - got this game specifically for the Link. The trailers don't show half of the satisfying content this game contains. Buy this game purely on gut feeling, it seems the gameplay is boring to watch, but exciting to play. The lack of online isn't a problem - the singleplayer still thrills me, although with friends and a couple of remotes, this game is excellent. Trailer is pretty boss though. This game seems hardly like any other early access game - only thing missing is a variety of bosses.			"

								I have had this game for quite a while now, basically  the moment I saw it I bought it  and it has  Not  been a disappointment! Although I think this game is really awesome I sure hope there are a few things I hope they add to the game either with the release or I hope they continue to develope it afterwards.A list of my concerns:  The current game has only 2 bosses, from what I've seen with the full release on 04/11/17 that there should be at least one more, I hope there is more than 3 bosses it would be nice to have around 10 for a vast diversity and challange. Some of the elements in the game are not really used all that much, especially the ice element, which there is an item that helps a human character when they are afflicted by this element. To my knowledge there are only two ways to inflict an icy affect on a human character and that is with one of the more advanced monsters and with one of the two current bosses. A huge concern is that they are going to keep the same floor pattern as they have now. What I mean by this is that everytime you advanced through the dungeon onto another floor, its just another randomly generated floor. It would be nice to have themed floors, like an icy floor zone, or acid, spikes, fire, death, blood, etc. the list could go on.  This game very well could end up feeling like an unfinished game if some care isn't considered and implemented. It almost feels that the developers are tired of working on this project and just want to release it and move onto the next project. I may be wrong about this, but either way it will still be an amazing game!     I don't know what they will all be adding to the game when it is finally out of early acces, but I sure hope the developers don't stop developing this game besides the occasional hotfix or small update since it really needs so much more. It would be sad if they leave this game a little lack luster when it could be an all time classic and an absolute amazing adventure that I want to cherish for many more years to come with my friends and family.

								What an incredibly well done couch/party game!Pretty quick, entertaining runs; easy to learn, (moderately) hard to master; weird ideas; very different monsters, traps and items; excellent retro style.The game might not seem fair every moment, because sometimes the hero gets bashed without a chance or monsters squished like bugs, but fairness comes back by the game's leveling system: the more the enemy heros level up, the more you can improve your monsters. That way even players with bad luck or lower skills advance.Even in Early Access Crawl already is more enjoyable and has a higher replay value than many (if not most!) finished games. One of the few things that should be improved (especially concerning balance) are the boss fights, but even if the game stayed exactly as it is, I'd still love it. (In fact, I wonder how much better it can possibly get...)			"

Early Access Review
								This game is an example of Early Access working, it is extremely replayable and feels more complete than most games at launch as is. I have been playing this 2 player couch coop with no Bots and it is an absolute blast, the combat for the hero is fluid and responsive with  the the upgrades from the shop and frequent gold snowball into making you feel massive progression even though each game is pretty quick.Early game for us the monster player felt a bit too weak if they do not have AI to support (AI is very dull - some ways incredible other absolutely stupid) and initial monster choices are very poor so you just have to grind them down with traps and attrition unless you have a flying eyeball - all hail the flying eyeball!The game does a great job of sorting itself out by linking player progress to your monster evolution and becomes a pretty tense duel around the mid game, (or more reason to disrupt your coop partner irl) so maybe it will be optimised around 4 player but dont let that stop you if you have no interest in bots and often play with less people. The biggest critisisms of course is the current monster balancing and few unique path choices on their growth, this is what makes a game meaningful and replayable, its not quite there yet but this is where its going to grow I imagine. Online multiplayer and a console release would make this instant indie GOTY and print money, as it is an absolutely incredible game that everyone should buy!			"

								Very fun when you get four people playing it.Gets ridiculous when you switch heroes three times in one room because of the slime things that are dropped by ghosts.Hilarious when one of them goes to fight the boss three times, almost beating it the first time, but ultimately lose the game because the boss won all three times. Now whenever that guy sees Crawl on the screen, he just says no and walks away.			"

Early Access Review
								One of the best local multiplayer games I have ever played, perhaps the best if I exclude tekken nostalgia. The core idea of this game is just THAT good. And it is executed brilliantly. Easy to pick up and play, it thrusts up to four players into a dungeon full of traps and doors to the unknown. One player is always the human, trying to stay alive and gain levels by fighting monsters. The monsters, however, are controlled by your ""friends"" - many rooms have pentagrams on the floor, which, when approached by a ghost player, allow the summoning of a ghastly creature from the depths. As the player character gains strength, the monster players gain ""wrath"" - which in turn allows them to upgrade their monsters to a new, unique form. This way, the 1-3 players that are not currently the human constantly gain strength, which usually means it's just a matter of time until the human falls...And when he does, the ""ghost"" that struck the final blow trades places with the human, and gains XP and gold in his stead. The goal is to reach level 10 and challenge the boss of the dungeon. If you beat him, you win. If you lose, there are 2 more tries ANY player has to get out. Else, everyone loses. After a game you unlock more items to buy, more dungeon objects to encounter and use (at your own risk..) and more deities. At the beginning of each game, each player picks a deity, which will 1) determine what base monsters / upgrade paths are available to that player and 2) what passive ability / starting item the human form of that player has. There is a lot more diversity to this game than initially meets the eye, which is great. Dungeons are also procedually genereated, the intro varies a lot- it really tries hard not to get old anytime soon.And on that it succeeds in my opinion. If you have any opportunity to get friends in on this - do it. You wont regret it. There are simple yet interesting combat mechanics to master, and every game unfolds differently, depending on deities and what the shop has to offer on each stage. It's really good. As for the early access, it's hardly noticable - I actually only remebered because of the frequent updates.			"

								absolutely love the game especially for it still being in alpha. I personally think this game is on an incredible track already and most people seem to want online multiplayer which would be very nice but not totally neccessary since the game works so well already. As far as imporovement I think its features, overall concepts, and objectives are all on point, I just think it needs more of the content that's already there to capture a truly randomly generated experience every time; things like new maps, new bosses, new monsters, more human equipment possibly even armor or clothing for customization/defense etc. As a fan of The Binding of Isaac, I love that feeling of starting up a new game (again) and not having a single clue what kind of map or monsters you'll be dealing with down to each individual room and item, and Crawl even in its early alpha stages with limited content nearly captures that up to par already.

								To me the most important aspect of the game as a whole is the amazing concept that it embodies. I bought this game expecting a regular rougelike-ish dungeon crawler, I was, however, surprised to find it brought a whole new level to a already existing genre. Crawl assembles rougelike elements together with fast-paced and skillbased combat between the different players competing. Solo play is only possible against bot(s), but this is still a large amount of fun.			"

								I have to really say that I thoroughly enjoy every time I play this game. Within the two times I brought 3 friends along we've alloted 7 accumulative hours, roughly 5 of them being in the first sitting we had. Gameplay wise it's literally a game where one person is the main human and the other players try killing that one person. Whoever gets the killing blow turns into the human and the cycle continues until someone defeats the main boss (after reaching level 10) or until three separate occassions players lose to the boss. Overall I'd say pick it up, even in early access.			"

								If I where to describe this game in one word it would be ""Epic!"" Crawl is a insanely entertaining game with loads of things to explain. So I'll jump right into it. Crawl is a really fun game especailly when playing with freinds, and even if you are forever alone. Its still pretty fun ( But not for long. ) Anyway I am getting way off track here. In Crawl you either play as the human, who travels through a massive dungeon collecting gold and XP and buying tons of new weapons and sub-weapons which brings you to the final show down. With either a three-headed dragon or some weird chubby alein thing. However playing the human wont be easy because your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ freinds. ( Or CPU's. ) will be playing as ghosts trying to beat every last clump of living poo out of you. As a ghost you can posses traps to make them attack the human, which is supprisingly effective. Or you can go the more aggresive and entertaining way. Turning into a monster. Playing as the bad guy never felt so good but you wont be laughing for long, because if you are the one to deliver the finishing blow to the puny mortal. You basicly switch spots with the person you killed, so now they get to have ajolly old time chasing you around. Putting twice as much stress on you, however if you the human become level 10 and defeat the final boss. Then you unlock new stuff and earn bragging rights. So yeah... I would recomend it!			"

								My friends and I wanted a good game to play splitscreen while over at each others houses and this was quiet thew find for us. The gameplay is simple enough that people can pick it up pretty well on their first play and rarely does it feel unbalanced. The most unbalanced it ever gets is when someone makes a really lucky find at a shop and has a nice magic effect or always has the most money to buy out the passives on the far left table. My only complaint is the lack of bosses as their are only 2 and one is much easier than the other but more are promised.  It's a great split screen for 4 or less people to sit down on a couch and kill a few hours.			"

Main advantage it has is that it is very different compared to other couch multiplayer games. One person is the ""hero"" whilst others are ghosts going down levels of a dungeon. HeroThe aim of the hero is to level up to level 10, activate the portal and defeat the boss monster. The hero can also buy stuff from the black smith and store including weapons, buffs and special ability items. GhostsThe aim of the ghosts is to kill the hero and therefroe become the new hero. They do this by possessing traps and activating pentagrams to become monsters in the dungeon. The ghosts get viae points by other heroes leveling up to spend on evolving their monsters. Their is a good variety of monsters as of v0.3 with more to come. When the monsters hurt the hero they earn blood which they convert to gold to buy stuff when they are the hero.BossOnce a hero reaches level 10 they can activate a portal on a dungeon floor, with each floor's portal only allowed to be activated once, to fight the boss. The boss is controlled by the ghost players, eg one boss hass two tentacles and a head  making three control points and one boss has three different heads. If the hero dies they are shunted out. The boss can be fought three times total in a match until the games end.NO signs of online multiplayer anytime soon but I don't mind as the game has decent AI and I prefer them spend time adding more environements, creatures and bosses.In the end I would recommend this game if you want a multiplayer game such as towerfall, samurai gun, gang beasts etc mixed with dungeon crawling rouguelike gameplay and assymetric multiplayer like evolve or nintendo land games.

								Crawl is definitely one of the greatest local multiplayer experiences I have ever had. It is a fun arcade dungeon-crawling combat game with a great depth for something that you can pick up without having to explain a ton of mechanics. The combat feels fluid and diverse due to its wide array of weapons for the human and much greater cast of monsters. This game is always fun, and it has had some outstanding free updates. It feels very polished even when playing with bots and it has entertained a couch full of guests who knows how many times!If you want a fun and competetitive game for you and your friends I cannot reccomend tthis game enough!

								If you ever played the original Zelda and thought gee I wish the monsters were more difficult and controlled by my three friends sitting around then this is the answer to your wish. It's got a dnd feel mixed with smash brothers mixed with $hit talking your friends. Great drinking game if you die you drink! You'll drink enough to end up in the emergency room in no time! Local multiplayer is great but I only wish that it was online multiplayer too. Fast paced action and adventure, you will die many times but it's a good thing because you'll become ghosts, monsters, and traps to kill your friends and re-animate your poor dead human to die again at the hands of your friends.

								Amazing game when played with others. Gets dull a bit quickly on your own, but then again, the entire purpose of the game is to be played with others. The devs seem to be quite active and continue to release new content. As it stands, the bosses are a little bit too easy... Its harder to get to a portal than it is to beat the boss itself. Other than that, a nearly flawless game, well worth $10.			"

								I love this game, and I am excited for its final release. The only thing i owuld like to see is possibly some more enemy types and the abiity to change the level to fight the final boss. Sometimes im just gettting rolling when im level 10 and id like to explore a little more, so changing the level to enter the boss would be great. Also i would love a couple more final bosses. Those aren't complaints by the way, just things id like to see. 10/10			"

								Last night I had some friends over at my place for dinner and afterwards we decided to play a round of Crawl. We had such a load of fun! We had 4 players, 2 with xbox controller, 1 with the xbox controller from the guitar hero drumkit and one (who despises controllers) on the keyboard. First they made the mandatory jokes about the pixely graphics and how it made their eyes bleed, but in the end the gameplay really made up for it. So, in this rogue-like game you are an adventurer trying to survive a maze of rooms and monsters (your friends) on a quest to defeat Kurok, the final boss. So while you are making your way through the rooms, your friends control incorporeal ghosts that can spawn monsters and possess traps. In some rooms pentagrams appear that allow a ghost to materialize into one of his monsters (randomly chosen) and try to gain back his mortality by defeating the hero. The one who delivers the final blow gets to play the hero.Overall, everyone got to play the hero for a while.. except me. But that's actually not a bad thing! Once you reach the trapdoor of a floor you get to the next stage and before starting, every player can upgrade his monsters. You get upgrade points (or ""vitae"") based on how many levels the other players gained, which means that if you didn't get to play the hero, you should get a lot of vitae to make your monsters a lot stronger. I really like this mechanic, but it didn't work out that well for us, since my friends still had pretty strong monsters as well (until I got the dragon, muahahah).With 4 players the game is pretty intense and we had a great laugh. I really recommend playing this game couch-coop.			"

								This game revolutionizes 1v3 asymetrical gameplay by relying on an old game genre and reimagining it as a multiplayer experience. Basically, this game uses the dungeon crawler formula to pit one human or ""hero"" against 3 vengeful spirits. These teams are, however, not static. Ghosts can become monsters and control traps to attempt to defeat the human and steal his body for themselves.At it's core, this is  not a dungeon crawler or an asymmetrical team game, but a cut-throat free for all game (often only really seen in boardgames or table-top games) where you must work together with your fellow players whilst plotting how you want to take them down at the same time. Thus, the race to salvation begins.You need to reach lvl 10.You need to defeat the boss.You need to survive the pit.But how can you defeat the hero without working together?But are you able to defeat the boss with just the stats/equipment you have now?But why are there no female hero sprites??? #triggered #ermahgerd #triggered			"

								Probably one of the only early access games that I would recommend anyone to buy.Fun to play alone, but even more fun with a group of friends. The mechanic of dying/killing the human is pretty unique for an arcade style game such as this and I think it was executed very well. It can become intense when you're the human low on health and three of your friends are trying to be the one to murder you.As a couple of other reviews I saw said, this game needs a bit more variety on the bosses. I think right now there is only 2 or 3. Hopefully the developers will include a few more. Also I, along with most others I think, really hope for the possibility of an online matchmaking system.Crawl is a fun little time waster by yourself, and a really fun game to spend an hour or two with your friends on the couch. I would definately recommend. "

								Probably the best couch co-op* came I've played in the last decade.Like killing your friends? Like cooperating until you can go in and steal the kill for yourself? Like controlling not only the monsters, but also the traps and the bosses? This game is for you.Every time you unlock a new monster, see it in the upgrade screen, and go ""whoa, what's that?!"" you'll be happy you got this game. Exploring different monster combos with your friends (spider webs that slow the human player down + any ranged baddie, for example) creates a ton of fun. I don't know what else to say. Get this game, it's a really really good time. Just make sure you play it with friends.Best played with a controller.*(It's only kind of co-op, but I couldn't think of a better phrase)			"

								I've only played three hours of this game but lemme tell ya, it's amazing. From the monster levelling system, to the actual combat and the traps. It's one of the best local multiplayer games I've ever played; it's thoroughly enjoyable and you're not upset when you die to one of your pals. Alright, update, after TWENTY HOURS of this game I still absolutely adore it! I bought the Crawl bundle off of the Humble store and put the DRM free copy on a usb drive so I can run it off the drive (without installing it) on any computer. I'm super stoked for the official release and I wanted to adress some comments I've been seeing written by others. 1. If you think gameplay gets stale you've probably never tried out all the gods or different monsters. I finished unlocking all the gods at hours 17 so you can't complain if you've only got like 8 minutes on this game.2. For those demanding online multiplayer and leaving bad reviews because of it; this is a local co-op game. Not online? If you read the steam tags you would have known that, its unfair to leave negative reviews because you didnt read the damn tags.			"

Holy crap, this game is amazing.First of all, the pixel art is awesome, no doubt about that. Love the art style in general, it's a nice homage to the old arcade classics, while at the same time having a unique theme and atmosphere. The music is also great.In terms of gameplay, it's a really fun game. You unlock more and more things as you go, so you always have new things being introduced. But for the real fun, you need to get a bunch of friends over and just play this game. It is amazing. The mechanic that anyone who is ""dead"" is the monster is awesome, because it is not only fun to try out all the different monsters, traps, etc., but it also means that even after you ""die"", you always have something to do.I highly recommend this game and I hope you enjoy.

								This game is fliptasticly fun. My ""hrs on record"" isn't going to be correct since I play this game with my kids on an offline machine in living room with controllers.Speaking of which, if you have some spare people and a machine in living room with controllers, you're in for a treat. Combat feels fluid and perfect. You only have two buttons to press and it all starts with a sinister beginning where everyone fights for their life. Along the way you pick up gold, buy new weapons and gear, and level up as you work towards fighting the big boss at the end that the other players can take control of.If you're not the hero, you gather wrath along the way and level up monsters of the form you take during play, take control of traps, or just do some general haunting like 20+ hrs in flinging a crate at the hero's face and killing them for as a first.5/7 perfect score, will continue flinging random objects at hero.

Also I, along with most others I think, really hope for the possibility of an online matchmaking system.Crawl is a fun little time waster by yourself, and a really fun game to spend an hour or two with your friends on the couch. I would definately recommend. "

								Crawl revives good old couch co-op and supercharges it.One of the best games i played in a long time, and the devs try really hard to update as often as possible.Every Update brings new enemies and a bunch of new interesting items.All in all a really well thought out game.If you have 1-2 Friends, who like dungeon crawling and being angry at each other, give it a try!

								This game is a beauty. Though I may have not been able to test out the co-op mode, it is still fun. Keep in mind this is still Early Access, It's content is far from finished. There is currently so much replayability with this game, that even after doing almost 15 rounds I havn't unlocked everything and still have no clue how much more there is.Currently there is only one boss: kourok, a one eyed, laser-shooting, bubble-throwing, acid-spitting, tentacle Boss. He is so much fun to verse and play as; having three controllable parts to support the 3 v 1 mechanic. One person is the human the other three are the dungeon monsters that can also summon slimes and control traps.I feel like my gameplay video would help you get a better idea of the game:

								Review Written on 25/01/2015 (Subject to change) Scroll for Pro's,Cons and Summary.Do you cherish your relationship with your friends?THEN DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!Crawl was made  with the intentions of turning even the strongest of bonds in to heated rivalries; One moment you will find yourself working with others to lower the heroes health, the next you're viciously scrambling to ensure you are the one who delivers  the final blow to take his place.Crawl offers that which seems to be a rareity in modern games: 4 player local multiplayer. Bringing back the golden days of real couch co-op. The game practically comes gift-wrapped in nostalgia, with its retro-arcade visuals,8-bit audio, two-button combat system and fast-paced gameplay.Gameplay:To begin with, you are greeted with an ""Insert coin screen"" where you must create a character name consisting of three letters. As simple as it sounds, it immediately welcomes you. Players  must then  select a god to worhsip. Each offering three different monsters with their own evolution path and starting conditions.The premise is simple; One player starts as the hero, who must reach level 10 by descending floors to defeat the boss and claim salvation.  Sounds easy eh? This would be the case, if you didn't have three other players , in ghost form, competing to become the hero in the process, by possessing traps, summoning monsters and deploying slimes. This makes survival as the hero extremely difficult, even more so as the other players gain ""Vitae"" a currency used to evolve their monsters each time the hero levels up or they draw blood from him.Fear not though! All is not lost, as each floor contains a blacksmith, where the Hero is able to spend gold they have accumilated through killing monsters, to purchase new weapons, trinkets and powers . However, getting to the shop first on each floor is essential if you want to claim all the best gear before anyone else.This is where Crawl really shines, it offers a sense of progression. The amount of purchaseable gear is satisfactory, and even after death, any itmes purchased are not lost.  The monsters don't lose out either, as between floors, players are prompted to evolve their monsters, becoming stronger and increasing their chances of killing the hero.Now, let's discuss one of my favourite aspects of the game: Bosses.Once players have reached level 10, they are able to face a boss, should they choose to do so, by entering the boss room and standing on a glyph. However, you can only have one attempt at the boss per floor, and three overall between everyone. This is when things become interesting, as you need to ensure you are well equipped for the battle, but have to accept the fact that persuing better gear always comes with the risk of dying and not becoming the hero again, allowing others to face the boss. Here's the brilliant part; Once the boss fight begins, any player who is not the hero is able to possess one of the bosses body parts such as the arms and head. Each limb will have a different attack, meaning cooperation and coordination is essential. If the hero prevails, the player wins the game, If the hero is to fail, he will be sent back to the floor with little health and the game continues. If all boss attempts have been used and the hero dies on the final attempt, it's game over. The winner being decided by whoever has accumilated the most XP during the game...Oh and the hero's character is permanently lost, although there seems to be no real penalty for this as there is nothing tying you to your character post-game. You can literally create another character with the same name straight after. To counter this, me and my buddies came up with a system where if your character dies, you can no longer use that three letter name again. Not much of a loss, but better than what the system currently offers.With the completion of each game, win or fail, you earn unlocks. Wether it be new traps, new evolutions for your monsters, weapons , tomes etc.... This adds to the games already enormous amount of replayability. (After 15 hours of play I still haven't unlocked everything!)Mechanics:The game plays best with a controller, although a mouse and keyboard is entirely useable. The two-button system is easy to use; you have a primary and secondary attack and a stick for movement, although the mouse can also used for movement; your character will move to where the cursor is pointed. I found the mouse a little more tedious and difficult to use as opposed to the gamepad. The fighting system is easy to understand, the difficulty comes from avoiding attacks and timing.  Personally, I'd like to be able to carry a ranged and a melee weapon and have another button to switch between the two. All in all, due to the simplicity of the controls, combat feels fluent and tight, with the animations complimenting and completing the system. Multiplayer:Be prepared for cursing, shouting, physical violence and possibly a heart attack-enduced death as you work extremely hard to bring the heroes health down only to have a friend steal the kill and become the hero. This game is best experienced with friends. You can of course play solo, the A.I is more than capable of providing a decent challenge, and is surpringly believeable, making human-like errors. But local couch multiplayer is the heart and soul of this game, and besides, there's no better feeling than defeating your friends and claiming salvation.Unfortunately, at the time of this review, Online multiplayer is not currently implemented. This is a shame because me and my buddies aren't always together, and we'd love to get some Crawl on when this is the case. Fingers crossed though!Another feature I would love to see in this game is Steam Workshop intergration. I'm sure modders would have a blast creating massive amounts of content. This would no doubt increase the lifespan of Crawl.Graphics and audio:Crawl is certainly a pretty game. From the intentional graphical glitches at the main menu, to the colourful displays of attacks ,traps, monsters and blood spills. The pixelated aesthetics feel right at home and sit comfortably amongst the haunting 8-bit track that accompanies them. The randomly generted dungeons  can get a little samey, but there is enough diversity to keep things interesting and the developers have confirmed that dungeon generation, music,  monsters, traps, items and a whole plethora of content will be added. IssuesNaturally, being in early access, Crawl is not without it's flaws; Ghosts being dragged too quickly from the last room into the next when the hero is running through them, sometimes resulting in the inability to utilise a room filled with traps. The occasional door refusing to let you pass or objects disappearing and reappearing. But these are problems that can easily be ironed out; over the 15 hours I've played, I had only encountered a few of these issues and rarely did they hinder the experience.Pro's:-4 playerLocal multiplayer-Progression system/RPG Elements-Brilliant premise; friends play as monsters -Fast-paced gameplay-Lot's of content-Replayiblity-Feels polished-Easy to jump straight in-Gorgeous pixel art-Strong mechanics-Low system requirements-More content to comeCons:-No Steam Workshop-No online Multiplayer-You will put Friendships to the test-Occasional bugsSummary:Crawl feels incredibly well-polished for an early access game, offering fast-paced gameplay, a unique take on the genre and a level of competitiveness that could only be achieved within it's own universe. 8.5/10  ""Must Buy""			"

								Crawl is quite obviously a game made by people who love games. Everything about it is well done. The humor, the animation, the music, the smooth controls, the fun little upgrades, the epic explosions of gore! It's a refreshingly original experience, best played with a couch full of friends and a controller to clench in your sweaty hands. Can't wait for more content. Keep it up Powerhoof!			"

								Crawl is a fun and unique local multiplayer experience.  In short, it's a king-of-the-hill style dungeon crawler, with players constantly swapping roles as either the plucky hero or one of the three ghosts attempting to take them down.  The way that the ghosts team up against the human is best described as ""formalized trolling.""The asymmetry of play helps to keep the game fresh, as well as make differences in skill less pivotal in one's ability to enjoy the game.  While the graphics are blocky (unsurprising coming from a two-person team), the animations are superb.			"

								Crawl has become, unexpectedly, one of my favorite games Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155. As an indie game, it will be money well spent (privded you have people to play with for some fantastic couch co-op). Get it, its great.I own a lot of shared/split-screen games. I tend to organize a bunch of team sports, and pre-drinking is mandatory. To this end, having simple to play, local co-op games is a must for some good rowdy entertainemt. Crawl is simple to play (moderately hard to master). There are only two buttons, attack and special but the hook is that it is dynamic 3v1 set up. A 'human' player competes against three 'ghosts' to gain enough levels to be the one that challenges the boss. Ghosts inhabit monsters to kill the 'human'. The one that lands the deadly blow becomes 'human'. As 'human' players level, ghosts get currency to in turn level up their mosters. Thus, if you can't get a kill on a human and everyone levels around you, you will have more to spen on leveling monsters, ergo a higher chance of getting the kill. As monsters do damage to humans they gain currency they can use if they become human in a shop to increase their effectiveness. Once someone reaches enough power to challenge a boss, the 3 ghots comibine to controll that boss to fight. Overall, the game design is solid, unique, and super fun. If there are no monsters to inhabit, ghost characters can controll various traps and jump into items to harrass the 'human'.I've had this game for a long time and the developers are still providing updates with more monster evolutions, more items to purchas in the shop, and more trap dynamics. The only even remotely (possibly)negative thing is they have yet to add to the roster of end game bosses (currently there are only 2).While the overall this is a simple game there is a slight learning curve (mainly what are the monster attack/specials, possible human specials). There is progression (unlocking monster evolves/items), but it is pretty quick. Super casual players may be turned off by this, but overall, whenever I bust this game out, response is always positive.			"

								Incredible game. I fully recommend buying. And if you're off-put by the lack of online multiplayer, don't be. Because playing with the AIs is basically the same experience you'd get from online multiplayer, except no lag, no cheaters, and more consistantly fun to play with enemies.The game is amazing about balance, and it makes it virtually impossible for one person to fall behind and end up not having a good time. Here's how it works:There's always one person who plays as the ""Hero"", with the other three (or other two or other one) playing as ""Ghosts"" who summon and inhabit monsters, as well as using traps and throwing objects at the player. Whoever kills the current Hero becomes the Hero, with the dead one becoming a Ghost. When the Hero levels up, each of the Ghosts gains 5 wrath. At the end of each floor, players can spend wrath to level up the monsters that they summon during the level. So if you spent most of the last floor as a Hero, you'll be stronger in that aspect, whereas your monsters will be struggling (it's generally better to have a strong human though, as that's how you actually win the game). So even if you're doing terribly and haven't killed the Hero once, you still have a decent shot since you will have the strongest monsters in the game, and so the best chance of becoming the next Hero. Ghosts also gain gold passively through their interactions with the Hero (although the Hero gets more), so weak Heroes can still afford to upgrade their gear once they get to a shop.Overall this game is just wonderfully balanced, both by the premise as a whole, and the amazing level of detail the developers have gone into to ensure that the scales never tip too far in one direction. You'll also never find a more attentive and responsive development team, just looking at their forums or their community page alone would be enough for me to buy this game, regardless of the amazing fun that it is.

								The developers are little overly fond of the phrase ""torn apart"" and variants in their release notes.I mean it's kind of understandable. Everybody gets torn apart in this game. A lot.Oh, you might be wondering, what stops the player in the human flesh bag from just dawdling around and wasting everybody's time? You can do that but when the ghost players aren't otherwise occupied, they're always zooming back and forth gathering up ambient ectoplasm blobs which they can spend to summon slimes. Slimes are pretty pathetic but you can summon them in numbers as a distraction in larger fights and the hero doesn't get rewarded for killing them. Best of all slimes lock the doors when you summon them, which is good fun when the hero is just about to rush out of a trap room.I was surprised though, I was worried being a ghost would feel like wasted time but honestly not only is it fun to be a ghost but you still feel like you're in the running and pushing to win, and as a session progresses humanity starts flipping back and forth between people with hilarious frequencyIdk I'll write a real review later maybe, basically it's good and you should get it. It's wonderfully competitive enough that even when playing against bots you forget that you're playing against bots			"

								I can't remember if I have ever left a review for any game in all the years I've been on steam.  If I did, it wasn't a good enough one for me to remember.  I'm leaving one now.Simply put:  This game is awesome.  This is one of THOSE games:  Games that I break out in a party setting with my friends and we play it over and over and over.  The idea behind this game is simple enough, but there's enough under the hood to add some depth and variety that it doesn't make the game boring at all or feel repetitive.  Nothing is more satisfying in the world than closing off a room from the hero (as he tries to dash to the portal),  stealing a kill from another monster player (while already at level 10) and race into the adjacent room, open the portal, and attempt to kill the boss.This game will test friendships, no doubt.  It is worth every penny and I can't wait to see what else they add to it.  I'm not crying for lack of on-line multiplayer.  And, the game has some AI in it, so you can even play solo if you want.  (I also really like the 'drop in' / 'drop out' feature A LOT.  Very handy.)  I realize that a lot of people like that component and want it... but the magic here is playing with 3 other friends all in the same room.			"

								I saw the trailer for this game a year or to ago on chezeburger and I knew this this game would be monster stabingly amasing. Killing time on your own or with frends this game can do it, after all you only need one copy of the game and keybord (or a mouse) for up to four pepole to play. Unlocks to keep you playing and storys and jokes with your frends like my favrots the choclate chathu crismas old fart guy and the dim knight.			"

								This game is exceedingly entertaining. This is one of the only games that finds my friends, family, and me huddled around a computer laughing and cursing at each other in glee. I bought an extra controller just to be able to play this game with more people! I look forward to further updates and developments.There is little value to this game in singleplayer. And, it currently supports only LOCAL multiplayer. Co-op is a misnomer, because thats the furthest thing you will be doing with your friends when you jump into this game. This game has tight, responsive combat. Some of the monsters feel worthless, but most just take some getting used to in order to be effective. You can level up the monsters between the stages with experience gained while you were the monsters/ghosts. The sounds and utility of choosing which monsters to level up and what branch in their evolution to pick is great. Playing as the hero is gritty and fun. The more monsters you kill, the higher you can level up and also gain gold. Gold is spent at the shopkeeper to buy new weapons, skills, and upgrades. Make sure to pick the right ones! One charm makes you powerful.....but also turns you into a harmless, weak frog! Once you have reached a high enough level, you can choose to attempt to defeat the boss. Be careful! If you die enough times, it's game over and you can even lose your name and progress, having to start your file over! There are some truly intense moments in this game. When you and a few of your ghost friends have been able to possess monsters and traps to get the friend playing the hero down to the last few hits, it gets crazy, Whomever lands the LAST HIT becomes the hero, despite who harmed them the most! I love that feature! I really can't recommend this game enough, as long as you have friends to play with you! Even for $10 this game is a bargain, much less if you catch it on sale!			"

								This game is def a treat to play with bots or with other friends in the room.You have a total of 4 players. One player starts off as The HeroThe other 3 players act as Ghosts that are tasked with killing the Hero player so that they, in turn, can become The Hero Themselves.The first person of the 4 players to reach level 10, go through the portal and kill the Final Boss wins!The gameplay is some of the best MP fun to be had, the only big downsides I found was that it's Local-Only Multiplayer..on PC which may break the purchase for a lot of people understandably. Thankfully you can play with Bots who have 3 different difficulties.The other issue I found was a bit of unbalanced gameplay when there are 4 players. There just isn't enough resources gained with the 4 players to max out your monsters or really get powerful with your Hero character some of the time.Here's a review of the game if you'd like to see more!

								This game is a wonderful example of a group of developers who continue to make their game better and better, and are not total moneygrubbers! I mean this is one of those games i have come back and played for HOURS on end (i did however play it mostly on a different account.) This game is super unique and super fun, with a really excellent 4v1 system(wish they could have implemented something half as good as this in Evolve.) And there are so many things to unlock. New challenges. Et cetera. This game is AMAZING! I honestly can't think of a single thing wrong with it. For 9.99, this is an excellent buy to play on your own, to play with a friend, or as i use it a really great game for game night when you have a nice group coming in. Powerhoof, Thank you SOO much and i look forward to seeing much more from you.			"

Holy crap, this game is amazing.First of all, the pixel art is awesome, no doubt about that. Love the art style in general, it's a nice homage to the old arcade classics, while at the same time having a unique theme and atmosphere. The music is also great.In terms of gameplay, it's a really fun game. You unlock more and more things as you go, so you always have new things being introduced. But for the real fun, you need to get a bunch of friends over and just play this game. It is amazing. The mechanic that anyone who is ""dead"" is the monster is awesome, because it is not only fun to try out all the different monsters, traps, etc., but it also means that even after you ""die"", you always have something to do.I highly recommend this game and I hope you enjoy.

								This game revolutionizes 1v3 asymetrical gameplay by relying on an old game genre and reimagining it as a multiplayer experience. Basically, this game uses the dungeon crawler formula to pit one human or ""hero"" against 3 vengeful spirits. These teams are, however, not static. Ghosts can become monsters and control traps to attempt to defeat the human and steal his body for themselves.At it's core, this is  not a dungeon crawler or an asymmetrical team game, but a cut-throat free for all game (often only really seen in boardgames or table-top games) where you must work together with your fellow players whilst plotting how you want to take them down at the same time. Thus, the race to salvation begins.You need to reach lvl 10.You need to defeat the boss.You need to survive the pit.But how can you defeat the hero without working together?But are you able to defeat the boss with just the stats/equipment you have now?But why are there no female hero sprites??? #triggered #ermahgerd #triggered			"

								This is a great couch co-ompetitive game! I've been playing it pretty much during the holidays since its release, will be third year in a row now! This is the time of the year when I have people to play with as I visit family... uhm. The game itself has you battling to be the hero to kill the boss, you become the hero by killing the current hero with one of your possessed/summoned monsters or a possessed trap, this as you are a ghost. You level up both hero and monsters and the hero can equip various items bought in the shop. There are plenty of unlocks along the way, like new kinds of monsters and things that will appear on the map. While running around there are lots of things for the ghosts to interact with to hamper the progress of the hero. It's almost like a multiplayer rouge-lite. I like it in any case.To shake things up your group can set house rules, like how early (level) you are allowed to try and kill the boss, if you get multiple tries, etc.			"

								I'm not normaly a big fan of frantic hack and slash games mostly because my skills are found lacking in that area,However the concept this game offers was just too good to passs up. I think the best way I could sum up the concept is 'co-op' king of the hill. Basicly the vengfull ghosts players are trying to work together to kill the 'hero' which in turn helps level the hero up.  Of course this team work is really just a set up to try and land the last hit so you get to take the spot as the hero. The longer you play as the hero the better chance you have of being the one to take out the final boss of the level.I find the leveling system pretty nice as there is options for both the hero and the monster aspects for each player. The hero gains gold for wepons and spells while the ghosts wrath points for better monsters to use spend to long with the hero and it might be awhile before you get a shot and playing that roll again meanwhile as a ghost you arn't gaining as much gold and the items in the shop might all have been grabbed leaving you less likely to live much longer. so far I've only tried the solo player but I'm positive with a couple of friends the game gets that much better.

								Probably the best couch co-op* came I've played in the last decade.Like killing your friends? Like cooperating until you can go in and steal the kill for yourself? Like controlling not only the monsters, but also the traps and the bosses? This game is for you.Every time you unlock a new monster, see it in the upgrade screen, and go ""whoa, what's that?!"" you'll be happy you got this game. Exploring different monster combos with your friends (spider webs that slow the human player down + any ranged baddie, for example) creates a ton of fun. I don't know what else to say. Get this game, it's a really really good time. Just make sure you play it with friends.Best played with a controller.*(It's only kind of co-op, but I couldn't think of a better phrase)			"

								Probably one of the only early access games that I would recommend anyone to buy.Fun to play alone, but even more fun with a group of friends. The mechanic of dying/killing the human is pretty unique for an arcade style game such as this and I think it was executed very well. It can become intense when you're the human low on health and three of your friends are trying to be the one to murder you.As a couple of other reviews I saw said, this game needs a bit more variety on the bosses. I think right now there is only 2 or 3. Hopefully the developers will include a few more. Also I, along with most others I think, really hope for the possibility of an online matchmaking system.Crawl is a fun little time waster by yourself, and a really fun game to spend an hour or two with your friends on the couch. I would definately recommend. "

								A very refreshing game that is great fun to play with people who are not that used to video games.Crawl is pretty beginner friendly with only 2 buttons and the 3 vs 1 gameplay with an elegant method of handicapping better players so the others stand a chance. Every content update has me stocked and even the art design and music are great for a game that I only expected to shine on gameplay.The only criticism I have is that while the 2 button style seems intuitive, people new to video games seem to have more difficulties with understand when what button does what than using 4 buttons. It was obvious to me as a gamer but to uninitiated folks the semantic category of what the buttons do seems to be harder to grasp. Still, it is a very fun game to play on couch coop and I can't wait for new cute monsters and chains to rattle.			"

								Incredible game. I fully recommend buying. And if you're off-put by the lack of online multiplayer, don't be. Because playing with the AIs is basically the same experience you'd get from online multiplayer, except no lag, no cheaters, and more consistantly fun to play with enemies.The game is amazing about balance, and it makes it virtually impossible for one person to fall behind and end up not having a good time. Here's how it works:There's always one person who plays as the ""Hero"", with the other three (or other two or other one) playing as ""Ghosts"" who summon and inhabit monsters, as well as using traps and throwing objects at the player. Whoever kills the current Hero becomes the Hero, with the dead one becoming a Ghost. When the Hero levels up, each of the Ghosts gains 5 wrath. At the end of each floor, players can spend wrath to level up the monsters that they summon during the level. So if you spent most of the last floor as a Hero, you'll be stronger in that aspect, whereas your monsters will be struggling (it's generally better to have a strong human though, as that's how you actually win the game). So even if you're doing terribly and haven't killed the Hero once, you still have a decent shot since you will have the strongest monsters in the game, and so the best chance of becoming the next Hero. Ghosts also gain gold passively through their interactions with the Hero (although the Hero gets more), so weak Heroes can still afford to upgrade their gear once they get to a shop.Overall this game is just wonderfully balanced, both by the premise as a whole, and the amazing level of detail the developers have gone into to ensure that the scales never tip too far in one direction. You'll also never find a more attentive and responsive development team, just looking at their forums or their community page alone would be enough for me to buy this game, regardless of the amazing fun that it is.

Local multiplayer is great but I only wish that it was online multiplayer too. Fast paced action and adventure, you will die many times but it's a good thing because you'll become ghosts, monsters, and traps to kill your friends and re-animate your poor dead human to die again at the hands of your friends.

Mate kills the boss - you weren't the hero once. I don't care. So much fun either way. Love this game.But don't play with AI.

								I watch Stumpt's channel a lot, and when they played Crawl, I knew I had to get it. This was the first game I bought when I got Steam. I'd had it for a week and already logged 17 hours. During that 17 hours, I suffered many humiliating deaths, including:- Getting hit in the face with a barrel.- Being poisoned by Pepto-Bismol.- Defeating the necromancer but then getting stuck in green goop and dying to the leftover crowd of zombies.- Getting stuck in spider web so I can't do anything and watching helplessly as the spider kills me.- Defeating the current hero as a fish wizard, killing every other monster in the room with a sliver of health left, then running into a bubble shot by my own fish head turret.- Thinking that a ring that heals me when I'm on fire will make me immune to it and running face-first into dragon's breath.Oh yes. I have visited Lava Steve's Lava Emporium many times now.			"

Early Access Review
								Extremely polished and brimming with content even in its Beta.The 'Local Co-op Only' turned me off from buying it until I could ensure that I had people to play with but once that was sorted, it became a game I constantly show to new players and invite old players to play in sessions as much as I can.It can be played with up to four players which is the best experience, however three works just fine. Two-player experience can be a bit stale and adding AI isn't optimal as it doesn't allow you to reach across the table and slap the person who just killed you, but it's still there!Note that if you only have one controller, it is still possible to play smoothly with four players. Due to the simplicity of controls, you can have two players on the keyboard and one using the mouse whilst another can manage the controller.Overall I recommend this game to anyone who can manage to get a few people over for a session. It looks beautiful, is constantly updated with more content and the content already in it is polished and functional.			"

								Usually 8-bit graphics turn me instanyl off to games for 2 reasons. Usually little to no story or incrediblliy steep difficulty curve. So when my friend who absolutly loves this type of game told me about it I had not interest in it....10 minute into the first game and I was hooked! This game is an amazingingly fun multi-player game with a classic arcade vibe in both art and controlls. You literally have 2 buttons to press and you can move, thats all you hav eto work with and its more than enough.A shared scrren multi-player rough-like straig out of the early days of gaming, Even if you only have 20-30 minutes at a time, thats usually enough time to beat a whole run.Lots of fun, highly recommned this one!

								This is a game that I would see popping up in my discovery queue and elsewhere on steam every now and then, and I was always on the fence about getting it. Over christmas I bought it on a whim, and oh boy am I glad I did that. This is probably the funnest couch co-op games I've played, and I'm constantly searching for local co-op games to test out with family and friends.Standout Pros for me:-Really fun take on 'king of the hill' style gameplay-Plenty of diversity each round due to upgrades and monster variety changing things up constantly-Awesome catchy soundtrack-Great competetive couch co-op fun with friends-Interesting monster and gear upgrades to look forward to each gameCons:-No online multiplayer currentlyHopefully online will come in the future, but it's no big deal if it doesn't. I'm really looking forward to more updates and features in the future. Even in the current state this is definitely worth the $10 if you're looking for something to play on the couch with friends.

								A fun and inventive game to play with your friends and/or family (Assuming you have enough controllers). The monster leveling (Which makes it so whenever a hero levels up every ghost/monster gets points that they can put into evolving their monsters) is a clever method of balancing Hero level with monster level. And while it is a really cool game, if you're anything like my family you'll be at each others necks by the end, either from one of you getting a crossbow or some overpowered combination or one of them gets that monster they KNOW you hate. (Also if you like the spell 'Hyperdash', good luck getting it, it doesn't seem to spawn in the shop as often as the others)			"

								Crawl is really fun to play with a few friends. The last few updates have been good, and have definitely improved the game greatly. However, this game desperately needs another boss (or even two) to fight at the end of the game.I'd still recommend the game, but it's a pity that the ending feels so shallow, the rest of the game has a lot of depth.

								Probably one of the only early access games that I would recommend anyone to buy.Fun to play alone, but even more fun with a group of friends. The mechanic of dying/killing the human is pretty unique for an arcade style game such as this and I think it was executed very well. It can become intense when you're the human low on health and three of your friends are trying to be the one to murder you.As a couple of other reviews I saw said, this game needs a bit more variety on the bosses. I think right now there is only 2 or 3. Hopefully the developers will include a few more. Also I, along with most others I think, really hope for the possibility of an online matchmaking system.Crawl is a fun little time waster by yourself, and a really fun game to spend an hour or two with your friends on the couch. I would definately recommend. "

								To me the most important aspect of the game as a whole is the amazing concept that it embodies. I bought this game expecting a regular rougelike-ish dungeon crawler, I was, however, surprised to find it brought a whole new level to a already existing genre. Crawl assembles rougelike elements together with fast-paced and skillbased combat between the different players competing. Solo play is only possible against bot(s), but this is still a large amount of fun.			"

								Whether you're looking for a rogue-like dungeon crawl to play with family/freinds locally or by yourself, this is definitely a game you wouldn't want to skip over. This game has simplistic but very fun gameplay, mixed together with a very, very interesting twist of constantly playing back and forth as a human or monsters/traps as you perish within the duengeon.The gameplay is quick, choatic, and can be quite thrilling! You'll be screaming at your undead friends when they kill you, or they somehow manage to get the kill on the human before you. You'll have a laugh or two when a crate is randomly thrown at the alive player in a completely quite room. You also will curse the slimes your friends constantly spawn over and over, one at a time, in a single room to keep you trapped in there for a short while.There are countless different monsters with very different attack moves, which can change over the course of the game through upgrades. The same can be said about the weapons, items, and abilities for the human player, as there are numerous weapons with random bonuses, stat leveling (through drinking potions), trinkets that effect gameplay, and abilities for them to purchase as well. There are various monster sets to choose from, that come along with a deity that will grant the players bonus effects through out their game.Overall, it's a fantastic game with very few issues. Mainly, the only issue I have is that it can be insanely difficult, if not near impossible, to defeat the boss(es) if they are played by skilled players. Of course, that is only an issue with the people I play with, and not the game itself, but never-the-less, be prepared to have a very, very challenging fight if you play this game with other skilled players.

								Having alot of fun with this one! I love the bit where you have to hit a bomb creature into a wall to unlock the door to one of the bosses, because you fight the boss in the same way and it basically teaches the player without having to tell them which is always appreciated. The challenge mode is fantastic, and all of the monster designs are pretty cool and you can tell and feel that they are upgrades to the starting monster which makes their kits feel familiar. I only had a few gripes with this game. one of the minor ones, is the title screen because the glitchy look you are going for just really hurts the eyes and doesnt fit with the game at all. A bigger gripe i had was that the monsters arent colored to match the player, so if a friend and i were playing the same monster or monsters we both had in our loadouts it got really confusing. Also when you first get the game you should have 4 monsters instead of 3 to start with so if you bought it to play with 3 other friends everyone could have a different character to use. overall i really liked this game and it is very promising and i highly reccomend it to anyone. one of the best early access games ive personally ever played!

								After playing with Crawl for a few hours I was torn between to sides. I personally think the game is amazing with friends, a simple 2 button battle system with in depth items, traps and layouts. What really helps improve this games lastability is the fact that you are able to slowly unlock new monsters, weapons and parts of the game.What has to be my favorite part of this game is that it gets updtated so frequently I often find myself coming back to it just to see whats new.The main offput of this game is that it is MADE for playing with friends. If you dont its just a CRAWL to the end of each stage fighting against, pretty decent AI. In the end this confinement  combined with the fact that it only works with local multiplayer is the main offput. But if you wanna group up with some friends and play with some controllers or on the same computer. I reccomend this game, *definetally if its on sale XD "

Really sets the tone for the rest of the game as you play a  uneasy alliance of 3 ppl vs the dude who is the dungeon crawler. The game is great and the fact that its still being updated with content (FO FREE) makes it even amazing, the polish on it is so nice and the mechanics are so unique, it's definitly one of my fav. games.IF the game had ONLINE co-op it'd be perfect.

								Really great local multiplayer party game. Hack and slash, roguelike, action rpg with magic abilities and all the fixings! The great hook with this game is that you and your friends play AGAINST each other.Gameplay:This game is usually played with four players, and if you're short on players you can use bots instead. One character can be the ""hero"" at a time, while the others play as disembodied ghosts whose objective is to strike a killing blow on the ""hero."" Once a ghost accomplishes this, they then become the ""hero."" Ghost players can possess traps, objects, and summon playable monsters in an effort to kill the hero. With every creature the hero kills, that player receives experience and can level up. Once a player reaches level 10, they can go through a portal and fight the boss, and if successful, win the match.After every playthrough you unlock more traps, monsters, and bosses.Verdict:Great party game to play together with friends on the couch, and a great way to end friendships :)			"

								A very fun game that seems to have lots of content, and the developers frequently add even more monsters and items through many updates. Some easter eggs are a little but significant detail to make the game even more enjoyable. The only thing I regret is the fact that there are currently two bosses, and would love to see more; but considering this game is still in early access, it has a huge potential. Even though playing with friends is indeed the best way to enjoy it, the AI can bring some decent and interesting challenge to play or pratice !			"

												Definitively one of the best couch ""co-op"" games ever made. Killing your friends again and again and then dying and killing them once more to take their place is one of the most intense and desperate experiences you can have in a video game, full stop. The animation is some of the best I've ever seen and unlike most local multiplayer games, it does not exhaust its content quickly. You will be constantly unlocking new tricks and traps to your dungeon as you escape from the depths again and again, or lay trapped there forever. New gods, new monsters and weapons abound. Even I haven't seen the end of it. "

								Crawl is one of the best local multiplayer games I've played. Simple and intuitive mechanics make up for the lack of information about each weapon, boss, and monster. Unlockables encourage replayability, but different scenery/trap themes would make the game more colorful and make it feel less like you're on the same floor over and over. The deity concept is brilliant to select 3 monsters from an array of summoners, brawlers, archers, and everywhere in between. The only request I have for further development is more information about the gameplay, the monsters, and their abilities. I'd rather have a little idea about the monster choices before upgrading to one branch or the other.			"

												I've followed Crawl before it was on early access, and it really is quite amazing to how they delivered what they promised within the game.Pros: Amazing unique gameplay, that feels fresh and interesting wether you are playing single player or with your friends!Great balance (especially the release version), all monsters feel relevant and useable, all the questionable weapons have been given tweaks to make them great. The game no longer punishes you for trying different things out and as a result the game feels a lot more open.Great graphics !!!Easy to play, Crawl probably has some of the best controller support I've ever witnessed in a game. Furthermore you can have multiple people on keyboards, someone can use a mouse. Heck I've even used a drawing tablet.Cons:It is (a lot) more fun to play local co-op than against the AI. It Is a dungeon crawl (hence the title of the game), and that can become repetitive if its not your thing.Playing Crawl with my friends is probably the most fun I've ever had playing a video game ever.

												Great game for some competitive couch action. I enjoy the overall premis of Crawl, its simple but full of content and fun. I'm a big fan of dungeon crawlers and this gives the right mix of that, beautifly dark pixle art, co-op/competitive 1v3 action, intense boss fights, and lots of different items to find and beasts to unlock.The whole point of the game? To be the one adventurer to kill the boss and escape the dungeon, leaving your poor friends lost souls to rot! Whilist the rest of the of the players work together to bring you down, steal your humanity, and make a break for the exit theirselves.Well enjoyed, thank you			"

Early Access Review
								[EARLY ACCESS REVIEW: So far this game absolutely lives up to it's trailer. Even against 'bots, the frenetic pacing and the mentality of ""I WANT TO BE FLESH AND BLOOD AGAIN!"" while you obsessively stalk your living prey from room to room is definitely there.And once you do step back into mortality, the race to survive is on again as the disembodied spirits claw and gnash to take you down and walk the mortal plain once again.The old school arcade feel is perfect, had me smiling from the 'Insert coin' screen to the 'game over screen'. Nice twitchy beat 'em up, with some really great animations.Highly recommend even in this Early Access state.]POST-RELEASE REVIEW.Everything above, and SO MUCH MORE. Powerhoof went and added the narrator to the game, randomized the scenes at the beginning of the game (along with the narrator setting up the premise for that match) which really help build on the already fantastic mood, more music changes, additional ways for your disembodied adversaries to antagonize you, more monsters, more weapons, more everything.GET IT. GET IT. GET IT!Don't let the lack of online play discourage you from experiencing this awesome game. Even against the AI it's a blast, and against buddies in couch play it's fantastic. Crank it up, grab a controller and have at it.			"

Not to mention the very interesting and unseen mechanic of killing the hero to become him, with your friends as the monsters. Just try it.			"

								Crawl is one of the best local multiplayer games I've played. Simple and intuitive mechanics make up for the lack of information about each weapon, boss, and monster. Unlockables encourage replayability, but different scenery/trap themes would make the game more colorful and make it feel less like you're on the same floor over and over. The deity concept is brilliant to select 3 monsters from an array of summoners, brawlers, archers, and everywhere in between. The only request I have for further development is more information about the gameplay, the monsters, and their abilities. I'd rather have a little idea about the monster choices before upgrading to one branch or the other.			"

								Not gonna lie, this is genuinely one of, if not the absolute best, party game I've played in a while, maybe ever. It's so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun, I can't even put it into words. The flow of gameplay is fantastic, the way the interaction between friends goes from Cooperative -> Competitive Co-op -> Straight Up PvP is perfect. The games can last really long which makes every game feel like a worthwhile investment of time. The only problem is the fact that it's only really fun with friends. I don't suggest getting this unless you have 3 other people to have a full game of 4. If you have the ability to have a game full of friends, then this is a must buy.			"

Early Access Review
								Probably one of the best local multiplayers in gaming history. Awesome, awesome stuff.PvP with a campaign and a twist. Mix of a roguelite, ARPG where both players attempt to slay the same boss. The twist is - only one player can be the hero. Other controls the monster(s) and traps. As you kill the hero as monsters, you'll turn the human instead. Players can attempt killing the boss at level 10. Trick is, you only gain XP as human.As the player delves deeper in to the dungeons, both players get to upgrade their unique monsters and are forced to make choices on how to level up them as well.The game has surprisingly much complexity, considering the controls have just movement, ATTACK and SPECIAL buttons.Add randomized gear/trinkets/spells, and trikle gorgeous pixel art & animation on top. It even sounds awesome.Highly recommended!			"

								This is one of the most fun games that I have ever played. Crawl is a fun arcade-style game where the game shifts from co-op to survival and is completely competitive.  They could inhabit furniture and throw it, they could command traps to aim and activate, they could interact with pictures and holes in the walls, and of course, summon and inhabit upgradable monsters on pentagrams. Once a monster, or even a trap or furniture kills the hero, that ghost will take his place leading the exploration. The goal in this game is to reach level 10 and challenge the player-controlled boss.			"

								Absolutely Amazing co-op game. Great for parties or get-togethers with friends and family. Get some controllers, grab some friends, and enjoy this. Lots of unlockables, in-game evolution trees (which are very well balanced) and a large variety of monsters and traps. It's total chaos and is by far the best with 4 players. I can personally attest to the content they've added since I purchased the game almost a year ago, and I'm excited to see what comes next. Definitely recommend.			"

								Completely surprised by how incredibly fun this is! If you like local multiplayer games, this is pretty much a must!At first glance, this looked like a funny concept that would be amusing for a game or two. Little did I realize how addicting this game can be!Pros:+Very simple controls (only two buttons)+Tons of unlocks and reasons to grind. There's a very large amount of content to unlock through continued gameplay, and what feels like virtually unlimited, Mugen-esque mod potential.+ AI bots - you can play this alone with AI bots tagging in for other players. No need for friends to enjoy it!+ Excellent balance system - Your hero levels up by killing monsters, and your monsters level up by other players' heroes leveling up... meaning in one player is dominating, everyone else gets stronger monsters to try and beat them back down+ Out-of-game challenges - Practice with monsters between games and see what you've unlocked+ Large variety of spells and equipment - Get awesome powers and cool weapons with both magic abilities and even cursed gear+ Cool boss battle concept - Try to win the game with 1vAll boss fightsCons (with suggestions): - The game has the potential to drag - With random gear in the shop, a hero can get powerful quickly or struggle to survive a few rooms in a row. Bosses can be rough without good gear, so there's no easy way to predict if a single playthrough will last 30 minutes or 90. There could probably be some sort of adjustable gold/XP/item-power/wrath settings that would allow players to customize for faster or slower playthroughs.- Only two buttons - Your ghosts have an Inhabit/Attack button, and a Special Attack/Exit button. Many a fight has been thrown at a critical moment by checking for a special attack only to basically forfeit the fight by leaving a monster/object. Just adding a third button for Inhabit/Exit would solve this- No online play - I really, really hope this is something they look into. I would buy a half dozen copies of this in a heartbeat if they added this feature.- Endgame item shopping is often a buyout - As you get to deeper levels, gold accumulates quickly and being the character alive when you enter the item shop usually turns into a shopping spree as you buyout most of the floor. It can be rough to keep your hero alive in endgame without proper gear. The game has a great mechanic of letting a new player teleport to the item shop after reviving his hero AND clearing the room, but that often doesn't help much if you're the second or third person to get to the shop that floor. And if you're undergeared, you probably won't live to the next floor/shop. I should stress, though... while this is an annoyance, it IS NOT game-breakingly bad by any means. This could be fixed with some sort of minimum item system per-player per-floor.Neutral notes:o The game is 1-4 players, and the mood of it changes a lot based on how many there are. 1v1 is a game of slow whittling and constant annoyance. Monster fights are sniping and kiting and trying to break them down over the course of rooms. 4-player games are basically royal rumbles every-other room, and the hero is swarmed with monsters, dies, is replaced by another player's hero who now still has to deal with the leftovers. Control often changes hands twice in a single room. 3-players is my favorite balance so far. Some sort of optional monster handicap setting could add more variety (option to boost in 1v1 for easier turnover, option to weaken in 4-player to make surviving longer easier) "

								If you have a bunch of friends over looking for something to do, this is probably the best solution. Normal I think pixel graphics are cancer, but they work well here. The game plays out almost like a board game in terms of rules and style. However the actual gameplay is fun and action packed. The narrorator that you see in the trailer is ever present and gives you a nice tale of why the four friends tried to kill each other at the begining of a round. It just adds a nice depth to it. I wish that there was more bosses, but it doesn't really take away much from the gameplay. For 15$ this game is a purchase I don't regret. This game is a perfect 10, which I can't say very often about games. Keep up the good work devs!P.S. With the two-button/joystick layout and focus on multiplayer, why hasn't this game been released for the Nintendo Switch? The joycons seem like they were made for this game. I don't even like the switch and this seems like it would be a perfect port for it...			"

												Much more re-playability than I expected! Definitely worth the cost.			"

												Unity game depicting a dirty, bloody, monster-infested cave, through the screen of a decrepit arcade cabinet. This aesthetic is just horrid. But the concept of ""vie for the human body then try to escape"" is interesting.			"

												Get this game, it's easy to lose a few hours in good company. The mechanics are fresh and it can be an ongoing thrill-ride at times, when everyone is trying their hardest to kill you first.It does well as ""easy to pick-up single-player"" and heathy-frustration is part of the game:""Just when you wanted to... X happens"" allot. Other: PG-young and GF-applicable approved. Fun learning curve. Absurd and grotesque, but well done.			"

												this is an amazing game with a neat concept that I have never seen before. the combat is smooth and the unlockables and bosses are unique and interesting. even though it can be played multiplayer it is still fun single player because the difficulty is set very well. give this game a try its worth it.
