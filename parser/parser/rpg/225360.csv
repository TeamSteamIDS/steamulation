												Dark is a truly terrible game. It offers about 5 hours of gameplay, a mediocre story as well as some of the worst combat and stealth ever seen in a video game. If it drops from its $40 asking price, I would still recommend avoiding it.For a more indepth review, here's a video I did for it:

												1. Don't get high expectations, its made by a small 19 person team and it shows. Animation, voicing, writing, its all sub-par. That being said its pretty fun (and hard) gameplay wise. 2. It is not a RPG. It has small RPG elements, but its more a action/third person stealth fighter. 3. Do not get at full price. At the time of this writing its on sale at 19.99, that is a decent price if you like challenging stealth games, if not, wait till it hits 10 or you will feel like you over-paid.Just please, if you do get it, play longer than chapter 2. I see sooooo many people saying the game sucks and only making through (or to) chapter 2. If your going to knock a game, at least beat it............			"

												I had high hopes for Dark. Not high as in, let's say, Skyrim high, but you know, for a budget game. Once again, this game turned out to be failure. Yes, the game is all about stealth, the trailer and screenshots showed me that much, but when you spam enemies and keep the guards alerted for minutes whenever they find a body is just insane. It becomes literally impossible to get through the level so you might as well restart or lower the difficulty. It's too damn unbalanced.One thing the game does at least partially right is that it has a certain gothic feel to it and it looks alright, with the blur filter turned off. The voice acting on the other hand is, unforuntately, mediocre.Also, don't think of Dark as an RPG with stealth elements, but rather as an action-stealth game with RPG elements. There are quite a few powers you can unlock, but except for a few of these most of them are useless. You'll earn XP for taking down enemies, collecting messages or getting through an area undetected but leveling up is slow and you won't be able to unlock the powers you originally wanted near the end of the game. That's what happened to me, anyway.There are a few sidequests, but these are linear and can be completed within a few minutes. They're often located near your primary objectives. They're not any fun to and they just require you to go to an area and press a button. Unchallenging and boring.The story is ok, and the game is too long for its own good. Normally, for 'an RPG like this', I would consider 8 hours too short. But if it frustrates or annoys I can't finish it fast enough.I'm glad I finished it, even if I didn't have to, but I never want to see or play this game again. Games like this make me want a trade-in feature for Steam. Maybe someday...[Rating: 52/100]			"

												I'm just going to say this right now, clear as daylight and leave no room for misinterpretation:This game is bloody horrible and I do not want to play another minute of this mess.The graphics aren't flattering, the animations are unpolished and stiff, the voice acting is an atrocity, the controls are clunky and difficult to use, the story is lax and just about everything is bad.Starting with the graphics, they use cell-shading like in Borderlands, but because of the stiff, robotic and lazy animations they do zero favors to the immersion. The voice acting is flat and monotone, which destroys any immersion that wasn't already squished flat by the animations. It doesn't help that the protagonist sounds like Shadow the Hedgehog after smoking six cartons of cigarettes. Eric Bane (the boring robot you play as) has amnesia, keeps getting random headaches that initiate a horrible cliche and unfinished ""omg im so sick"" animation cycle and you keep seeing some angel made out of light, that's all there is to Eric. He has no measurable personality whatsoever and he only exists to be bossed around by other bland and dislikeable NPCs. As evidenced by the scene where he learns he is a vampire, which pretty much goes like this: ""Bro you're a vampire"" ""no I'm not"" ""yes you are"" ""oh okay"".  Enemies in levels repeat the same two lines over and over, adding to the sensation that everyone in this game is an emotionless robot with unfinished programming. I haven't played very far into the game, but because it's so bad I'm never going to continue with it. Basically, you're a vampire and you're out to become a ""full-fledged vampire"" by finding and drinking the blood of the vampire who turned you into a vampire or some ridiculous rubbish like that. All the while that ""angel"" occasionally comes in and tries to give you words of encouragement, but basically she's another unfinished robot that bosses you around.The gameplay is even worse. Enemies can spot you almost instantly as you try to move from cover to cover, making stealth near impossible at some points while at others they are completely clueless. The Shadow Leap, which is DARK's version of Dishonored's Blink, is uneffective, has a terribly long cooldown, a painfully short range, attracts nearby enemies and the indicator is impossible to control. The ""vampiric powers"" all suffer from this same design flaw, they're all unecessarily difficult to control and in the long run are completely useless as a majority of them create noise that attracts all the patrolling robot-men in the area. So in summary, dissapointing comes nowhere near to describing DARK. It's a shameless and unfinished mess and there is no way that this heap of a game is worth $40.00. Do yourself a favor and play Dishonored if you want a good stealth game.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: DARK Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Stealth; RPG; Third Person; Action; Vampires; Noir My Overall Grade: B- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 8-16 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseursREVIEWDARK is one of those games that certainly isn’t great, it definitely isn’t innovatively groundbreaking, and it positively is lacking that something special to set it apart from the crowd.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed my playthrough of the campaign.  While there is nothing inherent in this game that will “wow” you, it certainly isn’t as bad as all the “Negative Nancy” types would have you believe.  In fact, it is actually pretty entertaining.Sure the acting isn’t amazing, the AI isn’t hyper-intelligent, and the animations aren’t perfect; but I experienced no glitches or crashing, and the gameplay felt mostly fluid and proper to me.  All of the mechanics are borrowed from other games, but they all worked properly.  Basically, some of the supplemental mechanics and cosmetic details weren’t great, but I didn’t find any serious problems with the core game. Maybe I’m crazy, but I’ll take working mediocrity over polished dysfunction any day.Mediocrity is the key.  The game is only mediocre, but it certainly isn’t bad.  If you don’t have much time to play games, you possibly shouldn’t invest time in this one.  There are many other games similar to this one that you should probably play instead.  But, if you play many games, enjoy stealth games, and just want something different to play: then this will offer a novel experience and story.  And as long as you don’t go into it wanting to hate it (because of what you may have heard), it actually can be pretty fun.The story is cliché, but entertaining.  It tells a compact and interesting tale of a vampire protagonist with classic “heroes’ amnesia,” and is mildly reminiscent of other vampire stories, like: Blade, Underworld, and True Blood.  The gameplay is linear, and extremely stealth-based, where “going loud” is not really an option. There is a leveling system and various abilities/upgrades to cater to your playstyle.  The campaign will take about 8-10 hours to complete, on average; but it can also likely be done much faster if you avoid combat.  DARK can be enjoyable. However, if you like action over story, don’t like stealth, or are new to stealth, this probably isn’t for you.  I recommend it to anyone who likes true stealth games and is looking to experience something different, perhaps having already played the classics.  It tells an interesting enough story, and should appeal to anyone who enjoys the narrative experience of games.  If you enjoy vampire fiction, it will probably serve as an added bonus.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												I wanted to like this game. I wanted to recommend it. I really did... but I can't. I just can't. When I first heard about DARK, prior to it's release, I was extremely excited. It was a promising concept... a vampire game that focused more on stealth than outright combat, but alas, it was not meant to be. DARK is a short, clunky trek through 6 chapters of repetition. It took me about 12 hours to complete the game my first time through (which I did on Hard), but I took my time through the chapters trying to kill every enemy, and left the game sitting paused several times, so my real time was probably closer to 10 hours or so. Again, that's my first playthrough, and on Hard, so make of that what you will. The game is exclusively single-player, and there's really no incentive whatsoever to play through the game a second time as there are no branching paths or decisions, and the individual ""challenges"" accessible from the main menu are pointless unless you're interested in leaderboards. The game features no real combat system. It's allllllllll stealth and stealth kills, unless you use your vampiric powers, but those are intended to be used from stealth as well. Speaking of powers, while they're fun to use for a while, they're largely irrelevant. You could make it through the game fairly easily without using any of them. When you do use them, they're incredibly powerful when maxed out (which can be done rather fast) despite having cooldowns, and make the game very easy. The AI is very, very simple and easy to out-maneuver throughout the entire game, and they all follow a set patrol pattern with no real variation. The story is poorly written and honestly barely even there. You're a vampire, with classic hero amnesia, and you have to find the person who turned you (or a powerful elder vampire) in order to avoid a horrible fate. Between the opening and the ending, there's very little else. Almost no character development whatsoever, not even for the main character, and a forced sort of last minute romance between your character and only other person in the game you know more than 2 or 3 things about. It's an odd feeling to listen to these characters and know that they're voiced by talented people, but have the writing be so bad. The protagonist Eric is voiced by none other than Doug Cockle, who voiced Geralt in the Witcher games, but even he can't hide the terrible writing. It's all rushed, vague, short, and flat out generic. Not to mention there is a colossal plot hole at the end of the game. Huge. I won't say it here for obvious reasons, but it's such a huge plot hole it's astounding they didn't notice, or didn't care. The other sounds aren't anything too special, but nothing really stood out as bad to me, except for a couple character's voices. Music is very meh, and I can't remember a single bit of it except for the same song that plays on a loop in the pseudo-hub you enter in the beginning of the game. It also features probably the lamest, easiest, most pathetic final boss any game has ever had ever. The graphics are stylized in a comic-book style, but are pretty bland outside of 3-4 fairly interesting areas. Outside of those limited sections, most of what you'll be going through are large rooms of offices or similar obstacles connected by small hallways or elevators. That is most of the game. The animations are absolutely atrocious. Your character's walking, crouching, running, etc animations aren't that bad, but everything else is. It all feels and looks clunky. Anytime you stealth kill a character it's there. If you feed on someone, every. single. time. you can see that Eric's lips aren't anywhere near the victims neck. It's just bad. Lip sync is also pretty off. With that said... I really liked the vampire vision. It's hard to describe, but the world is viewed in shades of white, purple, and black in this view, and you can see living things through walls and such as red silhouettes, and it kind of looks almost on fire, with everything moving and... well, it just looks cool. It also slows down time when you're using it, and there's no limit to it. It's probably the best thing about the game, but as cool as it is, that's kind of sad.Lastly, I have to mention the save system. The game auto-saves at certain parts thoughout the game, but it also gives you the option of manually saving a limited number of times. Two times, actually. Seems like a strange number of saves, but hey, once you get the hang of the game it's not too hard to rely on the auto-saves. Granted, it can be annoying to redo sections of the map because you made one mistake, but it's not too hard and with only two manual saves, what can you do? Well... press F5, actually. Yeah. Despite you having a limit on how many times you can save through the pause menu, you have unlimited use of the F5 quicksave. The game never tells you about F5, and it isn't anywhere in the options. Why? Why are there two separate ways of saving the game manually? Why is one way obvious and limited, and the other completely hidden but unlimited? It's a mystifying decision on the part of the developers and just another indicator of a rushed, sloppy game. Overall, DARK is a very underwhelming experience, and very disappointing to me personally. It's not necessarily a bad game... but it's very, very sub-par, and not worth anywhere near what it's priced at. I did have fun at some parts, but it was almost in a trance like state, like I had been tricked into not being bored. It's hard to describe. I can say that I don't regret my purchase, as I do like stealth games and vampire lore quite a lot, but I can't recommend anyone purchase it unless the game is around $10.			"

												Let me just start out by saying that I have a very high tolerance for pain when it comes to bad entertainment. I enjoy bad B and Z movies like Slugs and anything on the SYFY channel. The very first computer games I owned were Phantasmagoria 1 & 2. I love it, no I live for it. I have bad taste and make no apologies for it. So when I saw that Dark was on sale for a little over 7 dollars I thought to myself ""How bad can it be, it's only 7 dollars."" How wrong I was. It would have been less of a waste of money if I went out and bought a Mc rib, and less ♥♥♥♥ too. I still can't believe that the makers of Tropico published this.Eric Bane starts the game by doing what he does best, never shutting up. Going on and on in his Rorschach like repetitive inner monologue that can be boiled down to ""I can't believe this, Is this really happening, Is this true?"" He finds out that he is a vampire with supper Nightcrawler powers the are kind of neat once you learn how to use them. But wait he's not a real vampire he's a half vampire, because he was drained of blood and didn't get blood form the one that made him. Also if he doesn't get this blood he will become an animal and have to be killed, but if he drinks the blood of an ancient vampire he will be fine. So vampires are made when a human has all of their blood drained? Then how are the vampires a secret? There must be thousands of these ghouls as they call them running a round, because they can only drink human blood. Are you telling me that all these years no vampire slipped up and drained a human while feeding? It's ok, because Rose, who wears lights in her hair for awesome fashion taste, tells me that she knows of an ancient vampire that runs the museum. He is decades old. DECADES OLD! I'm decades old, my dad is decades old, my grandma I guess would be supper ancient because she is going to be 100 this year. We also find out that becoming a vampire conveniently erases all memories of you pass. How all vampires aren't drooling idiots is anyone's guess.Eric then goes to talk to the other vampire whose name I have already forgotten, all I remember is that his accent was kind of like, sort of, maybe European, or Californian? I couldn't tell. It' bugged me. Mr. I don't know what kind of white person I want to be shows me how to use my powers by asking me to take care of a gang that is bothering the club members. This is a gang of old men bums. They stand around barrels with fire on them to keep warm with guns and mug people. So it was here that I learned how to use my powers and how to feed off of people, and that this is a stealth game and if I do not stealth really good I will get killed. Because everyone has guns in this world even the bums, I'm sorry GANG! It's really easy to miss or mess up a stealth kill and get everyone with in 5 miles to come kill you. I did kind of like the ideas of the  powers a bit, but from what I could see only 2 or 3 of them would really be useful in the end so no need for a replay to try out other powers. Not that I would ever what a replay. Yes the powers are kind of neat and I would have kept playing if not for the bad story and game play. Finding out how to drag a corpses was a pain. I guess Agent 47 is more of a vampire then Eric, because he can pick up bodies with ease, carry them, and put them in places where they can not be found. Eric on the other had has to be pushed form 3rd person view to 3rd person and drag the body to a place like behind a box. You can do this one of two ways facing to body to make sure that it doesn't get stuck on anything but risk getting stuck yourself, or with you back to the body so you can see where you are going risking having the body get stuck on something and spazzing out flopping around making nose that WILL alert anyone near by so they can come and shoot you.One thing I really hated in the tutorial was that while I was sneaking about I would suddenly have control taken from me and put where they wanted me to get the tutorial moving with out any warning. This was really bad with the healing part. Not just in how it was done, but also in how it looked. I was sneaking about when I am suddenly pulled with my back to the wall so I can peaked around it. A gang bum sees me and starts to shoot at me. It looks like me misses not because I see his bullets miss but because Eric didn't react at all. Then Eric rolls to behind a box and I am told I am hurt and need to heal. So I guess that all those bullets did hit Eric but he was to busy with his inner monologue to notice that he had been shot.Like I said before I like bad games. I'm not one to really rag on things like graphics and what not. If the game play or story are good I'll let it slide. Too bad Dark didn't have any thing good in it to distract me from the fact that everyone talks like they have their teeth wired shut. Even with that the lip movement didn't come close to matching what was being said. The camera had a bad habit of cutting to a new angle after every new line of badly voiced and written dialog sometimes jerking about in such a way that I didn't know what was going on. It gave me a headache talking to people and I don't know if it was the bad writing, the cheesy voice acting, or the spazzy camera work. Nothing about anything people do in this game feels natural or smooth. People stand in unnatural poses talking to you with mouth movements like they had just gotten back form the dentist and had teeth pulled, while their lips flap around in a way that would suggest they want to kiss you but chicken out at the last minute. Eric stands there with his fingers clawed and walks around like a gorilla on two legs. I don't know if his forearm is too long or if his elbow is broken because when he bends it it stick out a little to far. THIS GAME WAS MADE IN 2012! I have games that are almost a decade old that look more natural!After what felt like forever I was suddenly warped to museum. The pacing in this game is schizophrenic. Too slow then too fast with no build up. Eric started to monolog and then he was talking on the radio to Rose. I could not tell where the monolog ended and the conversation started. I turned off the game, and thought about how I had wasted 7 dollars and what I could have bought that would have been better. After a bit of reflection I uninstalled the game and went to play Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines.			"

												Aug 14 2014 EDIT: It seems this review is getting downvoted a lot, most likely because of the humorous way I attempted to describe the game. In a more serious tone, I would like to add just this; This game is a huge combination of MULTIPLE things I like: Vamps, Stealth, Proggression, Doug Cockle (Voice Actor) and a few other things. It doesn't matter HOW low of standards you have, or how many things you think you can overlook in this game. I PROMISE that you WILL find something that makes you regret ANY amount of money you spent on this game. If you don't believe me, buy it and comment with your own review. I would have rather spent $2.39 on off brand Wal-Mart Strawberry Preserves, in the glass jar, (which is roughly 7 dollars less than I wasted on this game), cover it in Astroglide lubricant, and stick it in my ♥♥♥. Then I'd squeeze my cheeks until the glass shattered in my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and caused internal hemorrhaging. As I lay there in pain, I'm 100% certain that I'd have enjoyed spending that money on an INFINITLEY better experience and product than I had/spent on this game. I wanted this game so badly, but could never afford it. Finally, I grabbed it on sale for 9.99. I'm an impulse buyer when it comes to Steam, and I've bought a crap ton of games that I've been less than pleased with. This fuc*ing game though. THEY DIDN'T EVEN MAKE AN ANIMATION FOR YOU TO CHANGE DIRECTIONS WHEN YOU RUN. You think its not a big deal until you play. The first 10 minutes of the game takes you through a club, that has all types of graffiti and hipster soccer moms dancing in it. During this part of the sequence, I realized that the entire game is one giant runon sentence. Like, as soon as one sentence ends, the next character IMMEDIATELY starts talking. Its so damn annoying. Why even pay voice actors to voice it when you just ruin it. Next, (also in the club, since its the only part I could bring myself to waste my life on) I danced with a blonde girl in a black dress. I felt good about myself. THEN, I SAW THE SAME BLONDE GIRL'S MODEL RECYCLED 11 TIMES WITHIN 20 FEET OF EACHOTHER. THEY AREN'T EVEN FUC*ING ZOMBIES!!!! RESIDENT EVIL 2 ON THE N64 DIDN'T EVEN RECYCLE MODELS THAT BAD!!!tl;dr - The only good part about this game is closing it out and uninstalling it.			"

												So, as you can see, I have played VERY little of this game. Why is that? Because honestly, this is probably the sh*tiest game I have played since Herdy Gerdy, back on PS2. Actually, I would prefer to play through that game than suffer through another mission in this one.To be fair though, lets take a look at the pros and cons:Pros:+You're a vampireCons:-Every cutscene moves extremely fast; often there is no pause between speakers, so everyone talks very quickly, AND over each other. Very hard to follow, and extremely annoying.-No vertical movement--save for a few ledges you can teleport to.-Terrible AI: Seriously, I've played older indie games with better AI than this game. And seriously, the game BRAGS about how bad the AI is. There's  tool tip which reads along the lines of ""We're too lazy to make stealth hard, so some AI don't actually move; they merely stare off into the distance until you kill them.-Stealth: It's forced, but broken. Your character feels bulky, slow, and extremely cumbersome.-Combat: Or not. You can only stealth kill people. And then it's a one-hit-kill. There is no combat to speak of, no fun to be had of it. -Balanced Progression: Or not. Seriously. You unlock powers and upgrades much too quickly.Overall, I write this because I don't want anyone to waste their time or money on this game. It had such potential, but alas, it's just an expensive piece of sh*t.			"

												What's the most important part of a stealth game? It's not the stealth, oddly enough. It's what happens when stealth fails. Great stealth games like Thief and Dishonored give you fun and creative tools to resort to when things go badly. Conversely, some of the most reviled sequences in gaming are stealth sections where getting caught is an instant game over. Imagine how horrible it would be to make an entire game like that, one that falls apart the moment you make a mistake. Now imagine why I'm bringing this up.DARK chronicles the third-person adventures of Eric Bane, a fresh vampire who is all too ready to murder a million hobos and security guards to get his memory back. He wakes up in a club so goth it still has its own LiveJournal and is immediately persuaded into breaking, entering, and exsanguinating a whole host of people he's never met. The dialogue is distractingly awkward, both in writing and delivery, and the intro sequence is very much long enough to thoroughly embarrass itself.Once the missions start, you job is to stealth around the levels and execute as many guards as possible. I mean, you need experience to unlock new powers, and you only get experience from killing people and progressing, so total genocide is the order of the day. You also get 4x the experience for stealth killing people, which turns every room into a puzzle of how to extinguish every life present in a way that alerts none of them. But even if you hit upon a clever enough plan, there's no guarantee you can execute it. The hit detection is absolutely appalling, your powers may or may not decide to work when you need them, the sticky cover does more harm than good, and your teleport is basically the one from Dishonored except it gets stuck on walls and sometimes just doesn't feel like doing anything.All of these issues mean you're going to get spotted, and when that happens you might as well give up. Guards stay on alert for whole minutes, with the timer refreshing if they notice anything suspicious. Some rooms have upwards of two dozen guards that must be picked off in specific sequence, and if you are caught and killed, enjoy doing that whole production over. You can still fight back against alert guards, but the garbage hit detection means every encounter might end up with you humping air while the guard two feet away replaces your brain matter with bullets.I don't think I've ever seen a game miss the mark as hard as DARK does. I can't even pretend to be even-handed about it, because this thing straight-up fails at everything it sets out to do. The stealth is unfairly demanding, the controls are crap, the powers are unreliable, the cutscenes are laughable, and the graphics are a mess. There is absolutely nothing DARK does that hasn't been done better by another game, and absolutely nothing that could justify time or money spent on it.			"

												Its rare that a game has any significant effect on the way I go about doing things. As you can likely guess, this game is one of those select few that managed to do so.As a result of purchasing this game (an impulse buy for 6USD), I've completely stopped buying games without throughly investigating the quality beforehand. It physically hurts to play this game. I've recorded the first hour and put it up on YouTube as well as linking the videos to the Steam Community Page, give them a look and spare yourself the pain of having to look at those four taunting letters in your Library.EDIT**Here's a link to the gameplay:

												Like a lot of others, I really really wanted to like this game.  I've always enjoyed the dark vampire mystique and setting a lot, and stealth games are one of my favorite genres.However the game has lots of repetition to it, and some very simple mechanics which don't add to it's overall variety.  My character has maxed out around 6 skill trees now, and still only has a single primary attack (outside of the basic melee attack).  You sneak around, try to get into position to either kill an enemy or drink their blood without alerting others, rinse, repeat..  ad infinitum.It does have a story, passable enough to keep you in tune with what is going on.  And it has some really nice visuals - vampire vision is one of those.  On the whole however the sum of the parts doesn't quite make a whole that is enjoyable and engaging enough to keep you entertained.  You will either be bored of repetition, detatched while watching cutscenes, or frustrated due to the difficulty changing between levels.. often from overly easy to horribly hard.  And most objects in the game world aren't something you can interact with, which gives it all a very sterile and pale feeling.Combine those elements with a save system that (on normal difficulty) only gives you two saves per area, which can be maddening if you save too early and have to end up playing a large chunk over and over due to mistakes, without benefit of a save.If you can get it on the cheap like I did in a bundle, it might be worth looking at.  Or if you're just a complete vampire nut and need one more thing to consume (pun intended).  Otherwise buy with caution - watch a few let's play videos first.  Chances are what you see in the first ten minutes will be what you see through to the end of the game.			"

												Dark stars Eric Bane, a newly turned vampire who wakes up in a night club called Sanctuary. In the world of Dark, those that are turned into vampire have to then drink the blood of their sires in order to complete their transformation. If they fail to do so, they become mindless beasts. Unfortunately for Eric, he can’t remember anything and thus has to venture out to find out who turned him into a vampire. Until the last two levels, that’s as complicated as Dark’s plot gets, which is a good thing because the dialogue is terrible but in an incredibly odd and endearing way. It inadvertently makes the game less serious and a little goofy, which I found rather refreshing. Instead of getting bloated down with too many story details or an emphasis on the dark and gritty, Dark’s plot is really only there to give you a reason to go to different locals and murder people.The heart of Dark’s gameplay is stealth. Being such, it is not a good idea to try to play it like an action game. One of my pet peeves in modern stealth games that they enable characters too much; making it too easy to run-and-gun or bash you’re way through a scenario. Dark resists this trend but does so to its own detriment. While Eric Bane may be under-powered compared to his stealthy counter-parts, he’s not powerless by any means. His powers are simply all geared toward enabling him to dispatch foes stealthily and no other way. Eric can acquire or enhance a total of 16 abilities through the course of the game.Being a vampire, Eric uses blood to perform these feats and must get up close and personal in order to replenish that blood.While most of the powers in Dark require the use of said blood, Shadow Leap does not. Shadow Leap allows Eric to teleport short distances and climb ledges. Like other abilities it can be upgrade to reduce the sound made and decrease cool down time.While Dark actively rewards players for playing stealthily and staying hidden it also contains one of the sparsest check pointing systems in recent memory. In Dark checkpoints are generally only at the beginning of each room. Rooms often contain somewhere in the neighborhood of 7 enemies while some can contain as many 20. On top of that, once enemies are alerted, they stay alerted for a quite a while, making evasion or restarting from the last checkpoint the best options. Needless to say, it can get quite frustrating. Even with experience points and despite being billed as a “stealth action RPG”, Dark is a stealth game with a progression system. It is not an RPG. While it has some of the trappings of an RPG, none of it is very meaningful.Visually Dark is an interesting game. It is not terribly impressive technically or artistically. It employs an art-style that very reminiscent of the Crackdown games. For the most part everything is drawn as it normally would be except that everything has a black outline around it.In the end, Dark is an incredibly hard game to judge. While it may be rough around the edges, Dark is the kind of game that has heart. Yes, the animations, voice-acting and checkpoints could all use a massive overhaul but I found myself enjoying its brand of stealth.			"

												From the wonky controls, brain destroying sound track, and annoying dialogs this game will have you quitting in the first few moments. Even if you can stick with it just past the intro, you are not rewarded. Instead you are punished with terrible combat. The idea is great, but thats about it. This game has literaly turned me off Kaylpso. If you are a fan of the firm, stay away, or you will probably hate them for what they've done to you.			"

												Before I purchased this game I had set my expectation for it super low, because even the most positive reviews came to conclusions that it's a passable stealth game at best. And that's what it is. It's an mediocre stealth game.The movement is a bit clunky, vertical movement is very limited, non-stealth combat is just stealth takedowns but with enemies shooting at you, enemy dead body physics are bad. The story is probably the worst part of the game (so if story is important for you stay as far away from this game as you can).But when it came to actually playing the game all those things didn't get in the way of me enjoying sneaking through the shadows, peaking around corners and taking down guards one by one while their buddies don't suspect a single thing.The only bit of the game that is above average is it's visuals (if we don't count the animations since those get real bad sometimes). The environments are nice and colorful and character designs aren't all that bad either. In the end, DARK is not a good game. But it's also not a bad game. If you like stealth games and have nothing else to do AND this game is on sale, go for it. Just don't expect it to be the best thing ever.			"

												I felt compelled to write a review for Dark mostly because I saw so many bad reviews. From what I can tell, there are primarily two types of people that hate this game: People who paid $50 for it and stealth game enthusiasts who were looking for another stealth game to play. While stealth is the primary combat tactic in Dark, Dark should be described as a vampire game that happens to use some stealth... rather than a stealth game where you happen to be a vampire. So if you are reading this review and you don't play a lot of stealth games, but you like Vampire games, then you will probably like Dark.  Overall, this is a solid game if you can get it for $10. I would say $20, but with a 7 to 9 hour campaign, it is really hard to justify $20. Especially when you can buy Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines for $20 and it will give you 140+ hours easy. Details:Sound:The protagonist is voiced by Doug Cockle, the same guy who did Geralt of The Witcher series. Personally, I think he makes a great vampire: dark and mostly devoid of emotion. However, people looking for an emotional vampire that sparkles are not going to be happy. Overall Voice audio and acting quality were fine. (English version of the game). The main issue with the voice acting came into play when you had dialogues between the Protagonist and NPCs. The voice audio was recorded in sentences and when they played back those sentences during the game, they didn't put in any pause between them. Thus most conversations have the NPC responding way too quickly to sound natural. Like 1 gigantic run-on sentence spoken by two different people. This could probably be fixed with a patch.Graphics: Texture wise, Dark has a comic book like styling, with a thick black border around every object and NPC.  (Borderlands style). It gives the game a retro feel. Some people like it, some people don't. The developers put a LOT of detail into the environments. Each map is also relatively unique: High tech sky rises, Gothic Churches, Ancient Crypts, Woods, Modern Museums, Castles... . This helps keep the game from getting old. NPC models and animations are one of the games main weakness. The models feel like they are low quality, though that may be a side effect of the texture styling.Plot:The plot, at a cliff notes level, was actually better than most games I have played. I don't know if that means Dark has a good story or if most video games simply have horrible plots. Unfortunately the presentation of the plot was not done as well as it could have been. I already talked about the dialogue issues above. Plot also arrives in the form of intercepted PDAs and Emails during missions (Deus Ex style). But the game has no means of accessing the old messages. And then there are a number of Bink video that summarize  events I would have rather played through than seen in a video. Game play:Dark is a linear, mission based game. You start off the game in a night-club called Sanctuary. Sanctuary becomes your ""home base"", and you return to it between missions throughout the game. Within Sanctuary you find 4 other friendly vampire NPC's who give you your missions. Then you teleport off to a mission map. When the mission is over, you get a Bink video showing you a comic book like rendering of events with the protagonists voice describing what happened and then you re-appear in Sanctuary. Rinse and repeat.The game takes about 9 hours to complete (12 if you reload a lot). For people looking for a VTMB type game, know this: While Dark pays homage to VTMB through some of its environments and background music, it is not like VTMB at all. Dark is very linear. There is no city to wonder around in and find side-tasks. The dialogues are sparse and have no impact on the games events or ending. Combat:At the end of each map, you get an XP bonus equivalent to killing about 30 NPCs if you manage to complete the map without setting off an alarm. If someone so much as consciously registers your presence, that sets off an alarm. So there is big incentive to play stealth (and reload when you get caught), though technically you don't HAVE to. I played stealth and really enjoyed the combat. Then again, I do not normally play stealth games.Other:Game natively supports various 3D rendering modes, many of which don't even require any special hardware. Even has an option for the old school Red/Blue movie glasses.  I suspect the game is much cooler when taking advantage of this feature. "

												The idea is decent but the story itself is just horrible. Every few feet, there's a new monotone narration that has no reason for being there at all. Every voice actor sounds bored or tired, and the dialogue alternates between pointless and cliche. And there's a lot of dialogue. Or maybe it's so bad it just feels like a lot. The controls handle okay and some of the powers are pretty great, but it's all dragged down whenever anyone's lips start flapping like a bad anime dub. You end up rolling your eyes at most of the characters just because what they say, and how, is so ridiculous.Stay away from this one. Save your money. Unless you want a great example of okay gameplay dragged down by dreadful writing.			"

												DARK is one of those titles that shows so much promise but falls just short of being a the solid stealth game it could be.  The core mechanics are actually quite enjoyable and reminiscint of the considerably better Dishonored.  Your character is easily dispatched if discovered, but has an assortment of skills that aid in remaining undetected and moving quickly.  Unfortunately the game is marred by some very poor voice acting by several of the npc characters as well as having a narrative that seems to meander while presenting dubious motivations for the main character to continue onward.  The challenge mode is a nice extra, but considerably difficult for even experienced stealth players.  Widescreen, controller steam overlay and achievements are natively supported.  DARK is a worthwhile game for fans of the genre, but probably not worth full price.			"

												DON'T BUY THIS... seriously it's not worth 40 bucks, not even worth the discount I got pre-ordering this game. I wanted to like it I really did but the controls felt clunky, I suppose I could try a controller but it's hard enough to aim my teleport ability... The cutscenes feel messy, with the camera not seeming to know if it should stay in one place or not. On normal difficulty you can barely even make so much as one mistake without having 4 guards pin you down in a corner. Oh and don't even think about using teleport to clsoe the gap since you know they have guns and you don't and you need to be at the perfect range staring right at them to kill them. I can't stress this enough, this game is not worth 40 bucks or even 30... The story seemed decent I suppose but I couldn't focus on it since the controls were driving me mad!			"

												You play as Eric Kane, a man who wakes in a nightclub with extreme vertigo and nausea and no knowledge of his past except for his name, he is quickly informed that he has become a vampire and must find his creator before he descends into a feral ghoul, but frequent extreme headaches accompanied by a mysterious angelic creature giving him advice hints at something even more important going on.If you think this is interesting, you're going to be disappointed. This game has a LOT of problems.Firstly, there's absolutely nothing inventive about it, the stealth mechanics, amnesiac story line, revolving around vampires, you have likely seen every single thing in it in other works before, that can be fine if it's all implemented correctly, it isn't.While is game is pretty, there's a lot of points where it seems they just decided not to fix obvious graphical issues, when Eric is running(his normal movement) and you turn, he instantly is facing the direction you wanted to turn to, yes, there is seriously no turning animation while running, it appears rather comical and completely undermines any serious moments.The developers just seemed to not care what the dialog portions looked like, most of the points when you're talking face to face with Rose have the camera jumping around the room suddenly and frequently, it is very disorienting, there was one point when Rose was suddenly levitated off the floor for about a foot and then proceeded to land and keep talking like nothing happened. When guards rush into a room Eric will instantly teleport to a point where they can't immediately see him, but will exit stealth, I know it takes me to a place where they can't spot me instantly but I really just want to shout at Eric and tell him to stop standing up right when his enemies show up in a stealth based game.The characters are...just there, they obviously tried to give them something to set them apart, but they end up falling into tropes anyway, the security manager at the club talks like a frat boy for some reason, I kept watching for him to try and haze me. Rose is basically your support through the game, she's not only a beautiful vampire with large breasts and only wears very revealing clothing, but is the owner of a night club AND a super hacker, immediately wants to help you with all of your troubles upon meeting you and starts flirting with you within the same night you met her(admittedly, the last two there happen in a lot of games, and movies, and everything), have you heard anything that sounds more like a nerd fantasy woman? I haven't.The main character is an amnesiac who talks like Christian Bale's Batman, every line has to forcefully be uttered in the lowest voice possible for whatever reason, though, Deus Ex: Human Revolution had the same fault(minus the amnesiac factor) so I guess I can't really judge it on this too harshly, but there's absolutely no depth to him, he wakes up, decides to not die, that's it. EXCEPT for his reluctance to kill unarmed humanas, for some reason he's absolutely fine with slaughtering a hundred security guards, but a guy with no gun? That's morally reprehensable! There were a few guys near the end of the first area that showed they were complicit in terrible things, but you don't know that beforehand, and it certainly doesn't apply everywhere, you just kill guys that are at work. Maybe the developers were trying to make a point somewhere in there, but it just turns out hypocritical, two people hired by the same company, one given a gun, another isn't, it's fine to kill one of them, though the other is a danger too(unarmed npcs will alert armed ones if they spot you).The writing ranges from not very good to absolutely terrible, with characters responding like someone said a different line every so often, two examples of ""What were they thinking when writing this?"" are when Eric first finds a UV lamp, he immediately calls in to Rose and asks what it is, she immediately tells him to stay far away from it, so he proceeds to stick his hand in, remark that it hurts a lot, and asks how dangerous it is. I don't understand this, my niece repeatedly wanted to touch an open flame when she was 5 years old, she has since grown out of that, the writers perhaps have not?There's a PDA in the Geocorp building that has someone suspicious of activity in the garden area...his only proof? That it was cleaned without guests coming by, is he from Planet Slob?While there really isn't much depth or interesting material in the story, if you're still interested in finding every little tidbit, well too bad for you, there's a bug that causes the PDAs you pick up to (very often)close instantly and prevent you from reading them, there's no codex or anything to go into in order to read collected ones either, I suppose you could just keep reloading until it decides to display the content of the PDA, but I suggest just taking XP and moving on.As for the combat...there isn't any, it's all stealth, despite being a super fast(not really) and strong(nope) vampire(well, half-vampire) you have absolutely zero melee attacks except for biting, you never pick up guns or any other weapons, either sneak and kill them without alerting anybody or reload, because a single guy with a gun with absolutely ruin you(you are still as fragile as a normal human, I guess).What you DO have on your side are the powers, and my god Shadow Grip is so overpowered, when fully upgraded you will instantly kill someone across the room without making any noise and the body is instantly disposed of.Shadow Leap is your basic power, but I found it slow and lacking in range, also very difficult to target it on the position you want, I wanted to teleport down a floor off the edge of a balcony, but the cursor kept snapping to the wall nearby on the floor I was on.Possibly the worst thing in the game is the weirdly placed invisible walls, why have them in a stealth game? Large open areas under staircases are completely impassable(despite being clearly great hiding spots), when over halfway down a staircase with no railing you aren't allowed to just walk off the side of it as a slight shortcut, I don't know why.Another gripe I have about it is the angelic visions subplot *Spoilers* It goes absolutely nowhere, you're getting hints from this angelic figure of pure light through the course of almost the entire game, then at one point the visions change so the angel's wings are no longer connected, but segmented and floating a distance away from it, I thought this had some kind of significant meaning to it, but after two of the segmented wing angel appearances it went back to the normal angel. I had assumed at one point the M-17 organization was somehow sending Erik orders via this apparition, which was backed up by the end of the first Steiner event, but I realized the glowing white figure between the M-17 agents didn't have wings then, during all the chats with the boss lady of M-17 there's absolutely no reference to sending him messages, so it effectively opens up this big theme of the game and just never follows up. *End Spoilers*So...yeah, this game has a large number of flaws to it, but even with that sneaking through an area really feels genuinely rewarding, my verdict is to get it if you like stealth but not if you want a story.

												NEUTRAL RECOMMENDATION.I really wish Steam has a neutral rating for games that fall somewhere b/t Not Recommended + Recommended.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------REVIEW:DARK is a 3rd person stealth/action game focused around vampires. Taking some cues from many other games in certain ways (such as Dishonored & Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines), DARK also tries to bring its own spin on things here with vampires; especially since this game is primarily a stealth-orientated game. In some ways (such as atmosphere + art direction), it succeeds. In other ways (such as stilted writing), it doesn't succeed. For every hit (such as Doug Cockle doing a lot of voice-acting), there's also a miss (such as almost everybody else's voice-acting). In this game, the player is Eric Bane - who has amnesia, recently got turned into a half-vampire, and must find a vampire's blood to try to become a flood-blooded vampire. If he doesn't, things get much worse i.e. he could turn into a wild vampire and lose total control of himself. This certainly isn't even the half of the story, but I don't want to really spoil too much here.Two things this game gets right is the atmosphere + art direction. Sure, the art is not the best-looking art, on the technical side of things. But the cel-shaded look & vibrant use of colors makes up for a lot of that. A lot of the areas do have a good amount of textures in the game-world & the direction of them look quite good. The game is absolutely loaded with atmosphere, as an easy way to get lost into world. The Sanctuary is one of the stand-outs of this game, as this is the nightclub Eric frequently visits, loaded with stuff happening: people on the dance floor (and yes, you can join in) and people are everywhere doing things (making-out, chatting, having dialogue, having drinks, etc etc). The club just oozes cool and it feels like you really are there. Even the music played there - and any other original music played throughout the game, for that matter - sounds great + fits this vampire-themed game. Another thing this game gets right, it's having Doug Cockle on board here, who did the voice for Geralt in the Witcher series. Cockle does the voice-acting for Eric Bane and delivers. While most of the voice-acting is all over the place, Cockle is the glue that holds the game together - always making the player want to press forward, to see what he says next and what happens next. His voice, his delivery, and everything is the best part of the voice-acting in this game. Sure, while a few other characters do a decent job (i.e. the voice-actresses for Rose + The Angel) - that pretty much is the end of that. Most of the other voice-acting in the game is all over the place.The writing often feels like its right out of the Spiders camp of games (i.e. think Mars: War Logs). The story, writing + dialogue one moment can be dead-on and surprise you, being actually quite good. At other times, it's completely stilted, odd, and just doesn't look + sound natural at all. At some times, the game actually delivers something that feels like it is its own and is quite good; yet at other times it feels like its out of The Book Of Predictable Plot Elements, Twists + Turns 101. If you're going to play this game, it's going to be very stealthy. This is a full-on stealth game - or else, you will likely get slaughtered. Most of your attacks and moves, especially early-on, are going to be melee moves. Early on, you're going to be basically sneaking up behind enemies and knocking them out or feeding on them. Most attacks here are one-hit kills, by the way. You gain experience points (XP) in the game, which you can use to upgrade and unlock abilties of your choosing. Later on, you might learn a few distance stealth kills and other cool moves. You can do a teleport move, which feels like it was in Dishonored. You can feed on certain enemies, which can replish your abilities - which sounds right out of Vampire: Bloodlines. One cool move (Shadow Grip) is you can grab an enemy from a distance and then slam them to the ground.One problem here is the save system + difficulty system, which pretty much go hand-in-hand. This game is not an easy game, by any means - especially early on, when you don't have many abilities. Players should know this: that even on Easy, the game's tough. On Easy, you also get extra XP per kill and for what you do in the game-world (finding data in the game-world, doing the very few side-quests in the game, getting kills without being noticed, etc etc). On Easy, you have an unlimited number of Saves. On Normal (which should've been labeled Hard), the game only gives you 2 Saves. At some points, though - you might generate back another Save, once when you reach a certain point. Though, auto-saves (which won't cost a Save on you) are spaced-out quite a bit. While I didn't touch Hard, it's said that you cannot manually save period. Many players will likely start on Normal (like you should, in most games). But in this game - especially for a first-time run through, you're better off going with Easy. It's unfortunate that the terms of this game when selecting difficulty are not explained up-front and out-right, unlike say other stealth games like Hitman: Absolution. Luckily, you can change the difficulty while in-game, if need be. I spent around 17 hours with game, but it probably should've been anywhere from 7-10 hours - since I began on Normal, yet somewhere in the middle of the game switched over to Easy because what was a hard game was getting insanely hard. When it's all said and done, DARK delivers an experience that is all over the place. Its execution isn't always the best at times, yet other times it's down-right great. Sometimes certain elements deliver, yet at other times that same element doesn't. DARK is a game that I wanted to utterly love because of its cool premise of a stealth-based game with vampires + its excellent atmosphere, but it would up as a disappointment because of other things (i.e. all over the place voice-acting; some stilted dialogue + writing; and some not-so-good voice-acting). Its consistently great art direction, atmosphere + music are worth experiencing alone, if you can find the game on sale dirt-cheap somewhere. But as it stands at its $40 MSRP currently on Steam, I can't recommend DARK at that price. Final Grade = C-.			"

												Got this game in a bundle that cost me about $0.60 each. That being said, this is a game worth gettign at 50% off or more. The powers you get are occasionally useless...I mean completely. The stealth aspect at times is overly challenging (I only ever played on hard) and yet it still seems lacking. there are roughly 3 kinds of enemies and a variety of traps on each level. The story was interesting and finding the PDA's in game that expand hte story are rewarding to collect.TL;DR I'd be willing to have paid $9.99 for this, but either way grab it on sale.  "

												Personal Rating: 3.5 of 10This game is beautiful, has unique art style and you are able to skip cut scenes and dialogues. Unfortunately those are the only positive remark I could give.The voice acting, gameplay, soundtrack and story are terrible with an underused skill system. This game had so much potential but I think most of the budget went into graphics development. The game is so slow and repetitive I had to use cheat (YES! CHEAT) to speed things up. This game is more like a puzzle genre game rather than stealth. You basically travel from one area to another trying to figure out how to proceed to the next (which is the easier way out) or up the ante by slaughtering everyone. Plot in this game was actually okay as I was motivated to complete the game just to see the ending, but the way the game presents the story with the bland and emotionless voice and acting with the frustrating repetitive gameplay slowly kills off my interest.If you are the kind of person who really enjoys a challenging yet simplistic stealth game, this could really do you good. Being the kind of person that enjoys more diversified and options of gameplay with immersive story I cannot really recommend it.Another thing that really grind my gears is the physics when you drag a body. Taking corners, moving up stairs and pulling bodies off balconies may sometimes causes the bodies to get stuck and expose them. When killing enemies beside corridors will automatically push them down and this will again easily expose them.			"

												not expected much as only 43% of the reviews was positive about this game but i realised this game is fun. whoever made 41 metacritic about this and most of those negative reviews probably from shooter CS addict kids. This is a stealther game and its good for that. Yes, graphic isnt like in deus ex but its not bad at all. Those who wrote negative review only because of that, well, they should head to borderlands and write negative review aswell then.In this game you need stealth and kill your enemies silently, loud mission not an option at all, because you dont have weapons, items or anything. The game is all about STEALTH. Yes, vampires should be able to beat humans in face to face aswell, but why is it issue that others think, that vampires could be very vulnerable aswell?This game isnt easy, some areas crowded with enemies, you need be careful, you need to think and be patient.The game isnt flawless, but definetly underrated and got too much hate. Dragging bodies sometimes very flawed. The game start to be easy, then in first chapter gets to be hard at siege map and in second chapter still very hard. After that, well, you should have unlocked many abilities by that time.... so its gets easier and faster. Still, if you, dear review reader, like games where you need hide and neutralize enemies without making any noise, then you should try this game. BUT! the game isnt that long, perhaps a good 8-12 hours or a bit more if you try on harder difficulties. I definetly recommend the game, but not for the price they want to sell for. Wait for a big sale or get from a bundle like i did. This game really entertained me.			"

												DARK... Good idea but bad gameplay. The product let you play a stealth game as a vampire. Interesting, that change a bit of the classic soldiers or spies.You ""wake up"" in a night club without any memories, and you met peoples explain you you're a vampire. But the guy who turned you made the job wrong : you're half vampire and you have to catch your creator to become a real vampire or you'll turn into ghoul. Classic, you probably already seen or read something like that before. But why not after all. The problems are the game itself. You need few things to make a good stealth game : AI, level design and good balance in difficulty. All 3 are missed. You need to guess what the developers want you to make, in a perfect timing if you don't want to be spotted. It's funny because in the introduction you avoid bullets naturally, but in the game 3 of them will kill you. So, if you're spotted, you'll die. You better restart from the last checkpoint, faster.You can unlock few powers, your new vampire skills. The problem is sometimes you need a specific power to pass. What about if you don't unlock that power ? You'll be spotted of course. Same for that stupid wallhack : you can view where your ennemies are, but can't know if there is a wall or something to hide. So often you go ahead and get in front of a gurad. Guess what ? Yeah, spotted, killed, restarting once again.I spend two hours of playing. I couldn't finish the first level. Two hours of trying to find a safe way to the exit of that incredibly guarded museum. I think they hired 10 or 15 guards for every museum pieces ! I turned the game to ""easy"" but TBH I don't see any difference with the normal mode...I'm very upset because I was very hyped by this game, and it's very expensive. Thankfully I got it by a bundle, but I regret the money spend in that horrible game.			"

												Okay, so this game isn't as terrible as many reviewers have tried to paint it to be. That said, its not that good either. Everything this game tries to do, from atmosphere and graphics on down, Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines did 500% better ten years earlier.Frustrating? Yes. Horrible Voice Actor for the main character? Gods yes.Stiff animations? Yes.Clunky controls? Yes.Laughable AI? Most definitely. But past that there is still fun to be had here. The story isn't overly original thus far, and uses as many classic Vampire tropes as it can wedge in, but its just interesting enough to make it worth playing. I'd never suggest anyone paying the full $15 for it, there is just not enough good about it to warrant that price. I could see spending $5 or less on it if you're looking for something new to kill time on and enjoy a plot. Honestly I would suggest flipping it on easy, looking up a cheat program and just playing for the story, otherwise this game will likely make you want to put your fist through your monitor and sue Kalypso for having lost sanity and IQ points permanently to the flaws.

												This game isn't perfect, far from it. But I like it. I can't put my finger on it. But it has charm.The environments are nice, the level design is acceptable, stealth is needed (for the most part). It's fun. It has it's problems. Some skills are awfully overpowered, and make the game too easy. Their strength is offset by charges. Charges must be regained through melee attacks, which can take a few moments to perform. It also requires that you isolate your target, otherwise you'll be alerting gaurds. Still though, there is an impressive list of skills you can purchase. You should be able to get all of them by the end of the game. But as I said, some are much, much more powerful than others. Some are practically useless.I still give this game a positive rating, however.			"

												DARK is not worth it's full asking price. Only get it if it is 50% or more off. It is very short and the story is sub-par. DARK's story suffers plot holes everywhere. (sort of spoiler) One example being that Eric was turned into vampire by having all the blood drain from him. Yet through the course of the game I probably drain 50+ enemies and they did not turn into vampires. As the gameplay element is entirely stealth.This is makes the game very challenging and the only reason I played through to the end. (spoilerish) The final boss fight is more like you just running around trying not to die before a big friendly button appears that you push and win. It is a very anticlimatic and terrible ending. The only two reasons I would recommend this game is if you have absolutely run out of games to play and there is a steam sale on; The second reason is the difficulty, clearing a room while remaining undetected is a very rewarding feeling. Mostly because of how many bloody time you have relaoded a save file.			"

												I always feel sad when looking at expectations of gamers/reviewers now days, most people put every game on same level and sometimes, devs just cant stand the backlash and close doors, some still survive but if you look at future projects, they change to the common thing we have on the market bc its what most people buy/like (doesnt really worth it to try anything diferent was developer tbh).About this game, this isnt the common stealth game were you dont need effort to advance in the story, in fact, it was the dificulty that pushed me to the game, at least at start, when you dont have abilities, the game is actually very challenging bc the AI easly spot you and there is always many enemies in the level, they are very close to each other and you have to plan your moves wisely (later you are so powerfull that with 2 abilities you blast to the levels, and thats the only thing that seem unbalanced to me, im on run on Hard only using shadow grip maxed, hilarious how easy everything become).The graphics are cartoonish and that give a somewhat nice feeling to the game, the characters are good and voice acting does a good job, the sound is good but very few tracks to be honest.The gameplay complement the game, the moment you get used to the mechanics, its very fun to play levels with diferent aproach, combining your abilities to try new things, since there is a few options.The dificulty curve is like i already stated, hard at start and easy later, but you can still change the aproach and make it challenging to you, and on Hard, you cant manually save unless the game checkpoints, wich add more effort for you to reach the goal.I recommend this game to players that like stealth games, if you can get it on sale better, but even at normal price, worth it if you like the theme, besides, we should support the devs for trying something diferent from what we already have so much offer on the store.

												DARK was, for me, at least, one of those impulse buys that payed off. You get it on sale, give it a chance, and it turns out to be pretty good. The story is decent, the characters look, sound and act like proper characters, and the gameplay is alright.The overall visual aesthetic is what drew me, as well as, you know, vampires. This game is more modern than, say, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, a lot more user-friendly, but plays much more differently. For example, you really aren't supposed to fight. Combat is bad news bears. You can't just go around exploding guys without attracting inordinate trouble. Although, that is where I feel the game struggles: you're meant to avoid all conflict, except for some mandatory fights. This means a lot of pattern memorization and trial-and-error saving. And that's alright, if you like that sort of thing, but it's considerably less forgiving than a lot of other stealth games, as, well, the enemies seem to know what they're doing.Most reviews seem to be in the realm of, ""I played for five minutes and was repulsed."" Well, to be fair, this was one of the first games I ""perfected"" on Steam, and it was worth it. It wasn't amazing, it wasn't a triple-A title, but the art style was fantastic (Especially that blood fountain. Eenf.), the graphics were pleasing, finding all the little collectables felt fairly rewarding, and the Steam rewards (Badges, Backgrounds) are hawt.I'm just saying, if this is on sale, and you like dark settings mixed with pretty lights, it may appeal to you.

												It's worth it if it's on sale. Dark looks great and has an interesting but short story. Gameplay is alright. Stealth is good for the most part but not as in depth as it should be. Vampire powers are very fun to use but towards the end of the game you're pretty much invincible. Voice acting and dialouge can be pretty bad at times but not enough to quit playing. I would love to see a sequel and more lore about this world.			"

												An otherwise decent idea for a game executed quite poorly. AI that sometimes doesn't do what it's meant to (an objective is being watched, you fail if you are seen, and they won't walk away as designed consistently etc) I've also experienced numerous technical glitches like crashes and audio freezing entirely for no reason that simply requires additional restarts. The voice acting is unfortunately as bad as the actual written lines are. There are words that are misused entirely in fact... Makes listening to it difficult and worse paying attention to the characters and story difficult.The other problem with the narrative is this game right off the bat relies on the ""Sorry Mario, the Princess is in another castle,"" line that I was tired of by the 3rd game of that same series. At least Mario is endearing... This is just tough.On the bright side, the powers are cool ideas and work relatively effectively when everything is going smoothly. The leveling system is basically what you find in Deus Ex: HR in so you earn experience to get points which are spent in a square grid tree of upgrades. There are 3 trees, but only 1 has more than 4 basic abilities in it. Each does have numerous upgrades though which aid in the ease of gameplay significantly. This is helpful because, this game is actually quite challenging. Early on you are offered little strengths against the massive waves of enemies you face, making it easy to be seen and get killed. Over time, overcoming the obstacles becomes much easier in general, however the game at times likes to strip away the strength you have gained in favor of rechallenging you.All in all due to the series of bugs, poor dialogue and story, and gameplay that only works sometimes, I wouldn't really recommend DARK to anyone but the most intrepid of collectors of vampire based stealth/action genre.

												I wanted to like this game, really, even with the poor reviews.  It went on sale so I bought it.  I have to say, I actually like most aspects of the game, however you should still pass on this game!  The stealth mechanic is fine, but once you are spotted you are almost guaranteed to die.  There are no checkpoint saves and you get limited save games per level.  This turns what should be a fun challenge into an impossible nightmare, even on normal difficulty!Tried, tried, and tried again - once you get past the first couple of levels, your powers definitely make things easier, although I often still died regularly!  I actually pushed through and finished the game; odd final boss battle!Overall I give it a 4/10.  If you have patience and are willing to suffer through the early game, then this could be for you - as long as it is on sale!			"

												Pros:Vampire powersStory maybe? (I’m not done and it is okay so far but the con.s of this game doesn’t make me want to play it that much anymore)Cons:The ""Stealth"" in this game is almost impossible (Ex. You stealth kill a guard 5 feet away from another guard nothing happens but walks 10 feet away from a guard then everyone heard you because why not.)I would like to use the “Vampire powers” more often than 2 times at full charge, 4 times if you get the two upgrades.The “Vision” power is too blurry to be that useful and it is hard to gauge distance with it.The pace of the game is somewhat slow and movements feels chucky (not really smooth movements)The saves are limit to 2 saves per section of the map, ( for me this is extremely frustrating when doing a stealth approach, because you don’t want to use up your saves you try to move around the guards without saving but then you die and have to restart from the beginning again)2/10Too many things I don’t like about the game and very few points that I do like,  I’ll try to finish this game and update this review.

												DARK is ostenisbly a game in the same vein (ha! puns) as Troika Games 2004 ""Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines"". To the point it borrows heavily in both premise and gameplay.Bloodlines, while buggy and shipped too early, is arguably one of the greatest shooty RPGs ever, along with Deus Ex. It featured a deeply woven narrative, excellent writing, strong characters, intrigue and politics - all dark themes with just the right amount of black comedy. There was a heavy emphasis on character customisation allowing for numerous solutions and pathways, from combat to stealth to social interaction.DARK is essentially the stealthy bits of VTM:B made into a full game - and it doesn't quite work.It's a serviceable stealth game, many of the powers aid strongly with traversing and avoiding enemy line of site, and there's some ""updates"" to the mechanics of VTM:B that tailor it heavily in this fashion, eg the Auspex ability in DARK blows Bloodline's out of the water. There's even a Dishonored-style teleport jump to close in on enemies and get around their line of site, and all attacks from stealth are a 1-hit-kill.But without the ""other options"" of social, straight combat, etc that VTM:B had, there's a lot of redundancy in the playstyle and this is especially typified in the skill tree. An example - for the same investment of experience points, you can have an ability that insta-kills an enemy and hides the body. Or that puts the enemy temporarily to sleep.Unlike VTM:B there's no in-game benefit for sparing lives, and greater experience rewards are earned from killing enemies, especially unalerted enemies. So why take the power that lets you sneak up on an enemy to kill them, when you can just kill them outright, stealthily, AND hide the body?Little lack-of-thought moments like this are rife through the game and many of the stealth-sections are arduous guard-watching. Not a lot of thought or planning, just wait the seconds until the guard turns his back and snap his neck before continuing.The voice acting's terrible, the plot is weak, the characters are one note and the general format is borrowed so heavily from VTM:B that it might as well not be its own game but a mod and collection of maps.On the positive, the art-style's nice and overall the stylized toon-shader gives the whole thing a comic-book feeling, and when the stealth works, it really does work, it just so rarely works.Really, it isn't a bad game, it's just that there's better out there. Play through VTM:B as a Nosferatu instead and get a better game experience overall.			"

												Has a wonderful concept, that makes vampires hardcore again. Pretty standard for stealth games, however it doesnt give you much of a way to defend yourself if you are discovered. I would not recommend paying full price for it, as there are better stealth games out there that are better done, and cheaper. If you are really into vampire and/or stealth games, then it may be worth looking into, otherwise your time and money are better spent elsewhere.			"

 Are you angry cause ...   ... you dont know what Stealth means ?  ... you didnt found a Guide that take you by the hand ?  ... you prefer to watch Lets Plays instead of playing Games youself ? Dont trust all the bad Reviews !Yes, DARK is challenging on normal difficulty.The Guards dont forgive you any mistake (when you dont hide or forgot to hide dead enemies / if you are to loud / ... )You dont have infinite Save-Points  between the Checkpoints you get two DARK rewards you for cleaning a section without trigger the alarm (more EP - more abilities) clean the first Chapter without alarm / kill all guards and you are way to op for the rest of the Game Some bugs, nothing that ruin the Game (one time a dead Guard moving over the ground cause his leg hangs in the wall)But a bad Review is faster written then asking yourself if you did something wrong ^^""to much enemies / enemies see you to fast"" :D when you rob a bank, the Guards dont wait 5 minutes till they shoot or did i get something wrong ?+++ Awesome graphic-style ++ Challenging   for example Vlad, dont give a Vampire a Sniper-Rifle :D + Good Story+- Conversations / Voices-  between Chapter 3 & 4 something missed --  the last Boss was a joke ---  there was no real end, two are possible but after you choose one of them the game-credits come and its over Overall 7/10 , i recommend this Game to all who dont get frustrated to fast :P "

												  What makes me really sad about this game, is that it had huge potential. It could have been on the same level with Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines, if the developers had only put more effort into fight mechanics and storyline.  The visuals of the game are great. Areas are quite large, which is a good thing. The sneaking system is well done- no complains there. You have to be sneaky in order to survive and multiple upgradable abilities make this task easier.  But that is all that was good about the game. While sneaking around and alert sytems were well executed, the rest was not. If you get caught by an enemy- you are doomed. There is no normal, non-stealth combat whatsoever. You have to get close to an enemy to hit them, which can often lead to them  alerting everyone and killing you before you even get to them. It feels clumsy and unifinished- as if the developers simply ran out of time and decided to focus on sneaking around and stealth, completely ignoring normal combat.   Another bad thing about this was the story. It seems to me that whoever created this played a little bit of Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines and wrote the story in 5 minutes. The characters are bland and boring, dialogues are badly written. Although you have dialogue options, they are useless.they are sidequests, but most of them are just small grab-an-item-and-return-it quests, which give you little bit of exp.    Overall, the look of the game is nice and the stealth system is great, but the rest is horrible. I finished this game once and gave it another try for the trading cards, but it is quite hard to play it, as it seems so unfinished. With more time and recources, it could have been a great game. A shame really...			"

												For a game with graphics that arent as amazing as some games out there, it runs sort of laggy, but i can work with that. But im not sure, it didnt seem like it drew me in right away. Whether it be story or the actors themselves. And when it comes to action or fighting, yea the idea is cool; Vampires in a world of humans, fighting them. But when it comes to fighting, if your are blown and they see you, you feel trapped when it comes to combat. You are there as a meat shield, taking bullets, until you get close and then you attack them. Granted there might be more powers in the long run, i didnt get far into it, but again the feeling of beeing trapped in combat.			"

												Once again, the critics have no clue what they are talking about.I was skeptical to buy this, even though it was less than $5, due to the gameplay being stealth/action ( which I enjoy ) and an awesome texture design ( reminds me of Borderlands, or a Telltale game ).I am sure glad I did.Sure the controls can be a little faulty, the voice acting at times a little bland, and certain areas only including 4-5 of the same character models.But, this game has an interesting feel.Including various ability/power traits, guards that spot you somewhat realistically, and certain obstacles that can make it challenging and interesting.The storyline I am still working on, ( after restarting to reset my ability points and multiple real life delays ) but I will come back to update and let you know if it was worth the trouble.

												Dark is an uniquely unco action game with a skill tree progression system that we think qualifies as 'RPG elements'. The quality of the animation in cut scenes, along with the low budget voice overs, make this game truly horrifying. 10/10 wouldn't play again.			"

												It's as if they realized that it was too short and up'd the difficulty to make you have to try and try again.  Some of the pasive 'powers' are functionally null...as in they seem to do nothing.  Even at the strongest level some of the active powers are just barely useable.			"

												This game is a sad waste of potential. For the first 30 minutes I wondered why everyone had given it such terrible reviews. Then I got to the museum (the first real scenario) and realized why. You are a vampire, right? Well, don't expect to suck any ♥♥♥♥ing blood, because the feed mechanics are TERRIBLE. If an enemy sees you at all, it's next to impossible to feed on them. This means that all those pretty vampire abilities that require blood points are useless.Do NOT expect any cool combat. There is no punching or kicking, and no way to engage in any combat. You cannot jump. If the enemy notices you, they simply move out of range of your left-click-instakill, and you are dead after about 3 bullets. This should almost be lumped in with puzzle games since the only way to succeed is to not be noticed. EVER. Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines has far better combat than this game, and that is saying a lot. I wanted to like this game so bad, and it had SO much potential, but you will hate yourself forever if you pay more than $10 for this game, because you are going to enjoy it for about 10 minutes tops.

												So, this guy is supposed to be a superhuman vampire, but for some reason he can't sprint, jump, punch, kick, or use combat in any way. Like many of what other reviewers said, this game fails on the stealth department. That's a shame because that is what this game is supposed to be (technically, it has some RPG elements, but it certainly is not an action game because you can't kick/punch/beat the living hell out of an opponent). The enemy AI is too smart; what I mean is that they seem to know where you are even after you hide in the shadows. Also, many of the AI simply stand next to the exit, so you have no choice but to take them out. Also, one of the characters says that they wouldn't be able to shoot anything from 10 feet away, yet every time the security guards shoot at me, they are 100% accurate. When 3 or more converge on you, you're pretty much done for. This makes the game more frustrating and is nothing more than a trial-and-error type of game. It should've taken more notes from a game like Splinter Cell if they wanted to get the stealth portion right.			"

												I got this game for very cheap through a Bundle Star's Dark Reboot Bundle. I wish I payed more and bought it sooner, but all the bad reviews and low scores kept me from getting it before it got too cheap to miss.This game just shines at gameplay. That's if you like sneaking around and killing unsuspecting enemies with your bare arms and drinking their blood. The hero must have suffered some (never mentioned) brain damage that stops him from picking up and using weapons dropped by the enemies, but that's alright, because that would make the game way too easy combined with all his awesome vampire powers. If superheroes don't need guns, why would vampires? Sure, chances of survival are very slim once you get detected, but not impossible. Anyway, the game can be pretty challenging at times and requires a lot of patience and retries because of the limited amount of saves between checkpoints, but you can always play it on easy where no such limitations exist. It does get easier once you learn how to sneak around, avoid detection, approach your enemies at appropriate times, places and angles and use your powers efficently and without attracting attention.Cell-shading was a perfect choice for this dark vampiric world, although the atmosphere could be darker. The music is nothing special. Sounds effects and voice acting are great. The story is nothing special, a bit predictable at times, but original enough for you to want to know how it ends.The only annoying part are checkpoints just before long unskipabble cutscenes that sometimes forced me to make a save just so I could skip them and limiting me to one less save before next checkpoint.

												   Definitely good on a sale for 5 bucks plus DLC. Sad that the DLC isn't continuing off the original storyline stats. Both stories could have gone on longer, I loved this game. When I close my eyes I can still see the fighting under my eyelids. The song in the preview video is the only one in the game which just repeats itself. Had some bugs which was frustrating with the first boss. Had to get a hang of which vampire perks were the best in order to pass the game which I got the hang of on my first restart of the adventure. Had me on edge, wanting that 5 bucks to count. The ending. I need more. I cri.   So, I am waiting for a Dark II please. PLEASE. And, the adventure really did take longer. I was so afraid that the first boss was the last boss and that I couldn't return to the club (like home sweet home). But no. There were, like, 4. Smooth story gameplay. Maybe a challange for battling the elder vampire, but one thing that I thought conflicted was how in controlled storymode of the game he could apparate more quickly than the stats allowed me to do. Major glitch that was horrible and a (female dog) was the click to kill mechanism. That, sometimes, the game control gave up on me when I tried to use it. Thus I was stuck using:The Blood Capacity MAXShadow Grip w/o touching the louder moves like click to hit and kill..No confusion or other mental abilities such as distraction, confusion, which sounded cool if it actually functioned.Having to kill only with shadow grip or feed, occassionally the right-click-to-kill when there was only one opponent left.Treading with MAX stealth on the footwork.Sucking with MAX stats on it to add quietness because why not.Vampiric vision upgrades: seeing ghouls but don't need to see sensors and electricity -- they aren't invisible on my sights.Wishing that I could control how he killed people or if he could drag the human he was drankin' from with him.The shrubs saved my god dmn life -- those leaves were fkkin nanotube strong asf to have rended the bullets of the lackeys on the second boss -- useless! Too bad there weren't any more shrub-like things for the other zones. I am impressed by the castle in the museum, was really atmospheric. All the areas you gotta move around in... got their puzzles. Enjoyable and different routes may be taken in battle that way.Also, you don't have to kill everyone when you gotta keep moving on.I should have used my save slots more because then I could go back and go crazy by the time I finished the adventure.The choices on the social interactions didn't affect the story at all.SPOILER DISCRETION ADVISED (This is mostly for the game makers or those who have already played or don't care)I was forced to do tutorial before leaving, also meeting the human girl with the fettish for vampires. She was nice. Enjoyed the scene where she got sucked in that VIP lounge by the main character.OH! I wish there was a customizable character selection, or a female role. Don't make it switch during storyline, I just mean to play throughout with a customized female character along with the availability of the main.That might be much to ask, but his role also sunk in well along with the dialogue. At times, laughable with how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ serious he always was v. our buddy Tom who actually wore that vampiric tribal face tat. His voice was refreshing to talk to, though his role wasn't emphasized as much on the final boss. That's okay.Also, it was pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ funny that on the first time you suckin on someone and all the buddies come over they cant shoot unless you try that again. ""Yah, u watch me."" And now I think that the homeless guy in the tutorial who was backing up had it smart. I couldn't drink fast enough to get closer to him or kill my prey because I needed the blood for the meter?It was uncermonious for what happened to Stein. How could I just accept this new random group? ""SO IT WAS YOU?"" I thought. Pfsht. That guy became HULK, he wasn't no street fighter teleportation guy from that one episode including Vega and Chun Li in Spain, and Eliza. . . so couldn't he have just dug himself out of the rummage then? The ending was easy, like, (since I played on easy mode -- thank god) since vampiric visoin stopped time and I had no trouble running away from Stein the Hulk (makes me feel more guilty having checked what happened to Rose when I tried the Revenge ending). It is certainly best when you save Rose. But what in the world was that ""Kiss"" scene? It was a hug. Did I survive? Would I not become a ghoul? Did Rose's blood save me? I really wanted a second part to this story! Could I just wreak havock in the city? Get an underground sewer home with Rose? What?Vlad was too rich for his own good. Saving before he moved to the first place he'd appear at helped me sneak up on him even when he barely caught me and I had been holding the feed button.No glitches on the most important moments otherwise. But choosing your own saves are the most imporant than auto saves, god! Shocking to restart the fkkin first boss adventure. Also, good, there is a fast foward. Almost fast fowarded dialogue from Rose while in a hall but that save let me hear it. What happened to Tom afterward? I only saw Rose and my main character. :/Anyway. That themesong? Fkk yahh I listen to it all the goddmn time now! Dancing in the club? Ehh it was good for the mood of your serious character but looking at him it's like, ""He must be really thirsty to be humiliating himself like this LMFAO.""			"

												So I have seen numerous reviews on here for this game, and for the most part, they have been negative? Why? Yes, this is a hard game(most Stealth games are), and not meant to be a run/gun action game.

												Ok game with cool ""comic book styled"" graphics and action sequences but is a bit lackluster for me personally. I did find the controls a bit complicated and frequently had to pause and double check how to do certain sequences. The thing that I hate about this game is the main characters voice. It drives me crazy because to me he sounds monotone and bored rather than rough and tough like the voice actor was trying to come across as. That is clearly a personal preference though. I think it's worth buying on sale or as part of a package.			"

												Could have been great, if the controls were more refined. The animations are awful, but the rest of the art design is very nice. And the puzzle-like feel of predictable enemy positions/movements reminded me of the original Splinter Cell. However, while the action in Splinter Cell felt smooth and natural, Dark makes simply moving from spot to spot feel like a struggle. If you're very into stealth, and also incredibly patient, then it's worth picking up the next time it's on sale for cheap. Otherwise give it a pass.			"

												I bought this game cheap in a sale and  enjoyed it.It borrows a bit of Thief and a bit of Vampire Masquerade although it isn't the equal of either game.To put this review in perspective, my fondest memory of playing Deus Ex: Human Revolution was sneaking around a police station, quietly throttling everyone unconscious one by one without raising the alarm and stuffing the air vents full of bodies. There was no need to do it, no mission objective, I just like to quietly nobble people and drag them off into a big pile of nobbled people. Those air vents were so full of bodies there was no air in them, they were body vents.  If sneaking around quietly nobbling people and making a big pile of bodies in a dark corner is your thing (like it's mine),  you will enjoy this game. The game is all about stealth, and although you can continue if you raise an alarm you will miss out on big EXP point bonuses on the completion of levels and probably complete the game in a fraction of the time it took me.The pros -- There are some cool vampire skills to level up like a Darth Vader style force grip that picks people up by the throat and kills them. The skills can all be upgraded too, so for example the death grip can be upgraded to quietly kill people without all that inconvenient attention getting gargling and choking, and a further upgrade completely destroys the body which is great if you don't like dragging corpses around (but sad if you are into making big piles of bodies).- The nightclub brought back fond memories of Vampire Masquerade- The story line is decent.- The voice acting is mostly much better than I expected, with the exception of one guy who says ""man"" waaaay too much man.- If you play the game like I did and restart at any point you raise the alarm you will get a very decent amount of playing time for your money.- Did I mention that you can drag bodies into dark corners and make huge piles of them?The cons:- The graphics are serviceable but not great. Not a real con, you soon get used to them.- I really wish that there had been weapons that you could pick up and use. All combat is either done with your vampire powers or fangs and fists. A crossbow would have been a lovely addition.- A couple of the bosses were annoying. The end ""fight""  is best summed up as lame. - You never know how close you are to an automatic save point. You are allowed to make 2 manual save games between each automatic save point, but not knowing how much further you have to go before you reach that point means making a manual save game is a really tough decision. If you are playing for maximum stealth you can have to replay a big chunk of game if the alarm is raised.- There are no non-lethal take down options. You can temporarily stun people, but you can't knock anyone unconscious. There are some pesky civilians who you aren't allowed to kill or even use non-lethal stunning vampire powers on. These inconvenient but they can't wait to raise the alarm if they see you or your handywork. In summary - its a decent nobbling simulator, nice storyline, not AAA rated but a good budget title. Currently on offer in a sale for £0.90, it's a bargain.			"

												I remember reading about this game in GameInformer months before this game came out. I was so excited about it. They made this game look great. But that's all they did. Made it look great. In theory. All of their great reviews are from before the game even came out. I bought it while it was on sale and I regret that. I wish I could get a refund for it. The game mechanics are awful, the dialogue is crap, the narration is even worse. The stealth aspect of it is so broken. I'm hunched next to a pillar that is shaped so I am clearly visible, but the guards don't notice me. Sometimes it's the other way around. I'm hidden, crouched, behind a desk out of sight, yet they still know exactly where I am. There's no jumping. The shadow leap is ♥♥♥♥. Can't use it over a stair ledge.

												You notice the faults a little less after playing it for a while but don't buy it for more than 6.99. The ending is very "" ...ok...that's it?"" asking you to make a choice between the 'love interest' who has been helping you throughout the game (which is like the span of 48 hours or something?) and this character who is apparently the bad person. The game doesn't have a lot of content or replayability. I can't believe once upon a time I paid full price for this game.- This game feels more like it was released in 2007 than 2013. Visually, the style had promise (a tell-tale like picture), but the animation and models are so atrocious that nothing could truly save it (honestly it could only be improved if the mouths didn't do that weird thing, and the teeth, what's up with that? Also apparently the people who designed this have no idea what people look like while they are standing, or even perhaps what a person looks like, because protags hands have definitely been trod on by a horse).- The voice acting is alright (passable, but far from noteable). The speech and dialogue itself however, is bizarre. In a bad way. Why provide immersive dialogue when you could instead explain everything in just the way conversation doesn't work. The conversation system feels like a thrown in feature used simply to break up the actual game, rather than a necessary part of the story.- The control system isn't friendly to remapping (you can, just don't expect to be able to remap to custom keys), and the game either doesn't seem to recognise a click at all or just straight up takes a double.- The story is nothing new (honestly what is about this game), classic 'who am I/what's going on/how did I get here' hero learning about his new powers. Stealth based, though after a few chapters of stealth kills and racking up the points, you'll be powerful enough to forgo and just charge through to be honest, so fair to call the skills overpowered.

												Bought in a sale for 10 bucks. I was realy looking forward to play this game, but alas I was deeply disapointed. I liked the comic style grafics, but thats about the only thing I liked. I've played loads of stealth games, the whole Splinter Cell series, all parts of Thief, Dishonered, Vampire the Masquerade, Deus Ex (all), several Hitman, so I've got a bit of experience in the genre. Dark was the worst I've ever tried my hands on. Balancing is non existence. The character is so weak, that (at least on standard difficulty) to be spotted is to die. The Guards sometimes spot you even though you are nowhere near them and not moving at all. Worst of all you can't save but have to reach checkpoints for automatic saving. Especially the end parts of a level are extremly frusttrating. You evaded literally hordes of guards, then one spots you whithout cause, at once all know where you are and invariably you die. And you have to replay the last 30 to 45 minutes again. Do that 10 to 15 times and maybe you reach the next enfuriating level. So if your frustration threshhold is extremly high and you really want to sink your teeth into a game that keeps on frustrating you without reason, than I can really recommend the game. Otherwise I recommend any of the above mentioned titels.			"

												The video made it seem amazing but this game was very obviously not tested. There were crashes and glitches constantly, I couldn't even get through the first cutscene without something going wrong. I even read of forums other people having these issues. As soon as I started I heard everything but saw nothing, so I thought, ""Oh, I get it cause it's called dark!"" but no it turns out the game is just a total mess. Leave this game in the dark, that's where it belongs.			"

												Wow...  I thought this would be a great game.  I would have accepted decent even.  Nope...  controls were really horrible across the board.  If you think you will bypass them by plugging in a controller, don't.  The second mission proved that was a bad idea.  They get swapped with NO way to correct it.  The controller map only shows what is SUPPOSED to be where.  Guess that's part of the challenge is to figure out how to not only face enemies but to run in the appropriate direction using the triggers instead of the analog sticks.  Good luck navigating menus that way too...  Best advice: stay away!!!!			"

												First twenty minutes of the game... Voice acting is alright, but there are a few fine details that bug me.. One of them being the amount of time between one piece of dialogue to another. The other part, the main character makes it VERY clear that he ""has no choice"" when talking to one of the characters.Some of the dialogue seems very cliché.Something that really irks me: Limited save amounts per level.After about an hour of gameplay, it's okay *at best* for a stealth rpg with powers. I'm not too impressed, but I'll keep playing it just because I like stealth.I do not recommend this game. You're better off buying Dishonored.			"

												This game was a huge disappointment and certainly not worth the price they want for it. I was foolish enough to buy it when it was still $50, because at the time there was a shortage of new options. The graphics are poor. The style and design are cheap. The writing and voice acting is laughable. Which brings me to the fact that unlike other rpg's that have dialog choices that matter, they are a virtually pointless and pathetic mechanism they just threw in here in a sad attempt to create the illusion of choice and depth. Even the stealth aspect is poorly done. Trust me. Pass on this waste.			"

												Despite the bad press this game has received, I think it definitely has its charms and deserves a recommendation, at least when on sale. Its strongest point is probably something many players overlooked due to the steep learning curve:Pros:+ The sense of achievement the player gains from beating tough areas and reaching a save point is amazing and the game's strongest point. This only comes into effect on hard difficulty and when playing the way the game wants you to play, namely as a pure stealth game.+ Feel truly like a very powerful vampire.+ Story with twists and turns.+ Aesthetics, environmental level design and atmosphere.Cons:- Weak universe that is not particularly fleshed out or believably developed.- Very linear, hardly any sidequests.- Bugs, mainly relating to the AI, the ragdoll physics of the enemy bodies and the display of collectible PDAs.- Easy difficulty and openly fighting enemies makes the flaws in the AI very easily apparent and makes the game very easy. - Unfair learning curve.- Occasionally feel like a vampire with two left feet.In general, DARK would have benefitted from larger hubs to flesh out the world and characters, making it more like Deus Ex and intensifying its atmosphere. The first level is also disproportionately hard, since you have very few tools at your disposal and there are too many enemies, reversing the learning curve in a rather painful way.			"

												When I heard that there is a vampire themed stealth game, I got pretty excited. I was picturing a ""Vampire: Masquerede"" kind of game with modern visuals and lots of features, but what I found instead is...A linear vampire-themed Deus-Ex-Like stealth game with clumsy animations, poor dialogs and dull main story. Yeah, there are couple of cool features in this game, but what is the point if you can't use any weapon at all besides your skills for silent takedowns only? No alternative routes on stages, just follow the bread-crumbs to get from point A to point B. Once I got spotted by the stairs by a group of guards ""Oh, snap! I am dead"", I though... But, they obediently came 1 by 1 for a silent takedowns to me. ""Oh snap, he just came out of cover and knocked out the guy we sent after him... My turn, I want to check the stairs"". So... AI isn't quite a top-notch mastermind, which ruins the game as well.And the game itself is pretty short. So, I would not reccomend it to you, guys. It's a half-♥♥♥♥♥ product. 4/10.			"

I tried playing the game anyway and gave it a fair chance and yes, it really does suck as bad as some reviews say.

												Dark, what can I say about Dark? Possibly the most annoying and enticing stealth gamplay I've played since Deus Ex. Make of that what you will. Dark is not polished, Dark is not deep, Dark aspires to one day have the writing quality of a b-grade 80's action movie, But Dark does actually manage to do stealth halfway decent in its own way. But that way is definitely not for everyone. . .I bought Dark on Steam because it was on sale, and THEN I heard what people were saying about it, oh WHY do I bother to listen? But the interesting thing about the reviews were the comparisons to Thief and Deus Ex, and how Dark falls short, being frustrating, boring and repetitive. I'm sorry? frustrating, boring and repetitive? That pretty much describes my experience of those two games, yet I somehow managed to finish them despite spending hours trying and failing to stay stealthy. Still, the comparisons are apt, I was five minutes into the game, and I found myself thinking: 'okay the story and voice acting are predictable as heck, but why do I feel like I'm playing Deus-Ex?' Granted, Dark will never be either of those shining jewels of adolescent nostalgia that many of us remember as 'Deus Ex' or 'Thief', but saying it falls short merely because it is difficult just reads like nostalgia bias to me.Let me digress for a moment by leaping sideways into a comparison... When Rise of the Triad recently got a reboot, what emerged from the rebooting process was a graphical update with all the misshapen heart, and twisted soul of the original: lame jokes, drug references and all. Yet what I was left with, was the sense that a perfect recreation of my schoolday afternoons in a modern graphical engine laid bare just how small and easily entertained my 10-year-old mind was. In much the same way, Dark's gameplay calls to mind the stealth FPS games of the late 90's and early 00's: Thief, Deus Ex, Hit Man, etc. but this time in a good way. Clearly I've lost 80% of the audience right off the bat with that one, but nostalgia is a funny thing...You see. I've save scummed my way through the first two missions, carefully rationing out my two saves per area, stealth-killing my way through enemies, and resetting time and time again. I have rage quit at least two dozen times and taken seven hours of real time to get through four hours of gameplay. But at no point in all my failed attempts at silently taking down a couple-hundred armed mooks have I been able to honestly say: 'that one was the game's fault.' and that's what keeps me coming back, that's the thing that reminds me of Deus Ex (at least, how I played it). I'm not being coddled, in fact I'm being threatened with deadly weapons, but Dark neither blames me for failure nor rubs my face in it when it beats me again and again and again. Success in Dark is its own reward, and failure is a learning experience.In this day and age of short attention spans and shorter patience, Dark IS frustrating and repetitive, because you will be frustrated at how often you're repeating the same sequence over and over and over. But that is the lot with any true Stealth game: if you screw up prepeare to reload. This is a major reason why any game that involves stealth as a mechanic these days refers to itself as having 'stealth elements' because it will give you a way to fight your way out of the pickles you'll get yourself into. But as soon as you give a stealth game a 'violence parachute' then stealth immediately takes a second seat to the alternative. Why? because it's easier.I honestly haven't had a problem racking up XP, nor have I had an issue with the controlls, but I think that Dark is made for a particular style of play, and a certain kind of player. That player is definitely me and the play style is 'creeping death': Slowly and painstakingly working your way from room to room picking off all the enemies one at a time. As a stealth action game Dark is also a puzzle room game probably MORE of a puzzle room game than a Stealth action game. Only all the puzzle elements are also ambulatory and packing automatic weapons and supernatural powers. When taken in this context and played in this manner, Dark is actually FUN. The goal of each little segment of level is not to simply get to the next one, the goal is to cut a hole into the web of mutual surveillence the guards are wrapped up in. Isolating and neutralising as you go until you can sneak on through, and it IS possible.I think however, that there is a better comparison to be made for Dark, the game I am reminded of is even older than Deus Ex, Older than Thief. That game is Robot Rooms. I don't know if obscure shareware games for win 3.1 needed rebooting, but there it is.If you don't like puzzle games, or if your idea of stealth is more in the vein of Assassin's Creed or Dishonored, Dark is not for you. If you expect AAA voice acting and a complex, deep storyline, Dark is not for you. If however you're something of a completionist, if you're a patient and methodical hunter in FPS games, leaving nothing but corpses with surprised looks on their faces behind you, and if you enjoy a challenge, then you might just like Dark.

												Graphics: As far as graphics go, this game has some GLARING issues. I did like the art style, but the models and their interactions didnt always mesh correctly. For example one of the bosses is cutting up a body with a bone saw, but rather than the saw actually touching the body, it was floating a good foot above it. However the game has a borderlands kind of feel to the art style and i found it quite fitting for the type of game it is.Gameplay: This game was designed first and foremost as a stealth game, when you finish an area without being spotted you got a MASSIVE xp boost, which allowed me to finish out the skill tree before i finished the game. While that does take out some of the ""gameplay path"" structure of games like this, it didnt detract from the gameplay; merely gave you more stuff to work with as you played more. On the nore of gameplay, i saw a review that said that while the game was a stealth game that you could bruteforce your way through the game. While this is true for the first 1/3 of the game, newer units that are introduced into the game prevent you from doing that and require you to be stealthy about your approach. But remember, this game is FIRST and FOREMOST a stealth game, play it as one. This also rings true for those people who complained that there was no CQB for your character, Its a stealth game... many people have been too babied by games like assasins creed, which allow you to fight off 6+ people at the same time and come out without taking any damage. Story: Here i do have to say the story is kind of weak, it doesnt do a good job of fleshing out the intention of the story up until the very end. The motives for moving from area to area are flimsy ""oh we found this guy"" then ""well maybe this guy???"" However the story arc as a whole does come together quite nicely, though the final boss totally breaks the idea of a stealth game...TL;DR: IF and ONLY IF you actually enjoy a challenge where you ACTUALLY try and stealth the whole game, then this game is a must have (play it on hard!), because it breaks the tedium of the current market of stealth games being ""stealth until you mess up then go beastmode on them instead""			"

“Dark” is a third person stealth game, conceived and rendered in the tradition of games like the Thief series and the Splinter Cell series.  The gameplay, basics of operation, and plot points most closely resemble the Splinter Cell series.  The storyline contains the ghost of the Vampire the Masquerade Series.  In an effort to fairly review, I’ll compare the elements of other games like it and what made them successful with the elements of “Dark.”Story:You are Eric Bane.  (Incidentally, the name Eric means “ruler” and Bane, of course means Death or destruction).  Eric finds himself wondering through a club with no idea how he got there, and he discovers quickly that he has become a vampire, and if he doesn’t feed from the blood of his sire soon, he will become a mindless ghoul.  Thus begins his search for the person who turned him or someone powerful enough to suffice.Here’s the deal:  The story is derivative.  It doesn’t add anything to any body of work that pertains to vampires – not even in the game medium.  I had the feeling that someone took elements of Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines, plot points from the “Blade” movies and “Underworld,” threw in a little bit of Max Payne’s noir style, stuck it all in a blender, and made a smoothie.Stealth games are all about plot, ambiance, and wowing the player with the intricacy of a very well developed world.  These games are usually either hyper-realistic or achieve high levels of verisimilitude with straight-up good writing and strong voice talent.  This game immediately took me out of it with the graphic design.  I got the feeling that I was playing an electronic comic book.  I like comic books, but if I’m playing a game, I prefer realistic graphics.The dialogue is not bad, but a distinct lack of characterization plagues the story.  We never find out who Rose is, where she comes from, or how old she is.  The game simply drops us into a world that forces us to accept that we’re a vampire, and we have to find our sire.  Another missing element of this title is the sensuality associated with the Vampire genre.  In one part of the story, the game flirts with the idea of it, but never realizes it.  That’s always a let-down in a vampire story.One of my issues with this game is that the designers created a kind of Max Payne beginning with a vampire twist, and as soon as you leave the nightclub, you suddenly find yourself playing Splinter Cell.  If the hokey comic book graphics hadn’t glued it together, I would have sworn I was playing a different game.  The design of the stealth engine and the way Eric – sneaks – is more consistent with a mortal than an all-powerful vampire.The bosses in this game are all ridiculous and unbelievable with the only exception being Steiner.  First, you have the Museum Curator who owns and operates a very well-organized and sculpted museum in a large city.  Oh, but he’s so nuts that he dismembers his patron in the basement.  Second we meet Vlad – a corporate CEO in charge of GeoForge.  However, he talks like Dracula, and spends his evenings hunting real people with his guards and ghouls in the Biome.  Funny how no one seems to notice.  Then, of course, you have Steiner who is the only good bad guy – though the game designers totally screwed him up at the end.  And the central baddie is the head of the research and development department at Cryoform – a front company for an elite group of vampire hunters.  She’s pretty much your stereotypical brilliant psychopath, though she is much more realized than Hardeman or Vlad.Put all of these elements in a pot and mix them all together and you have a recipe for a flat plot and a forgettable game.  I actually bought the game when it first came out, played it for a few hours, forgot I had it, and only recently came back to it.The interesting elements of it were the easter eggs.  I found everything about CryoForm’s operation fascinating.  I’ll not spoil that in case you’re planning on playing the game.  I liked the idea behind GeoForge although I’m not certain how they made their billions simply building giant indoor parks that seem like the outdoors.The only other bit of criticism is the size of the game.  Most really good vampire games and stealth games take weeks to traverse.  This one has only six chapters, and I beat it in a day and two hours.Graphics:Yuck!  The worlds inside the missions are fairly large and diverse and would have been extra cool if they hadn’t spoiled it with the whole noir thing.Gameplay / Character Advancement:The game controls are simple compared with the convoluted controls gamers often have to take a class to figure out before playing games such as these, but we don’t run into anything oversimplified like point and click.  I like the interface system.The character advancement in this story works on a normal point-based system.  The player spends points earned based on his achievements to increase his powers.  This is a fairly user-friendly system.  My only concern is that you run out of stuff to spend your points on toward the end of the game if you are good at not getting caught.Summary:If I were recommending it to a friend or telling him or her not to bother, I’d say “It’s not worth sixty bucks, but if you can get it for free or at a deep discount, go ahead.”  It was kind of interesting in places, but it’s not the type of game I will play over and over like some of the other titles I mentioned.

												The game is great fun, required lots of stealth and skills, no matter what others say, its a great game. just because they cant figure out how to pass a level without getting caught and killed does not mean the game sucks, just means they cant play this type of game.i give it a 5 star rating for all but amount of time it takes to beat it... that gets a 4 because the game was too short in that regards :)			"

												Just finished this including the DLC pack, I'll just start with the bad, the voice acting, script, cut scenes were all bile inducing crap. The actual game-play was pretty good, the stealth mechanics worked well and the powers you get eventually make you feel like a vampire ninja. The game kinda ends abruptly without bringing everything to a closure, story was weak anyways. I played this on easy because the checkpoint system was ♥♥♥♥ and you have limited saves on a difficulty higher then easy, a stupid attempt to make the game harder. It was still challenging on easy though. Also a FOV slider, fully customizable controls and pretty cool cell shaded graphics, props for a low budget title. Worth the $2.75 I paid for it. Took about 8-9 hours to complete, only had one crash. I don't expect anyone where will give a ♥♥♥♥ about this game but get it on the REAL cheap and try it out if your curious. Hopefully you can make it past the bad acting			"

												Just un-installed the game. Since I did not finish the game I am not going to comment on its storyline, but the gameplay is a complete disaster. Though being a stealth game, not killing enemies is virtually impossible due to the large number of enemy (in comprison with the size of map) and the need to replenish blood for vampire abilities. But the absence of weapons means without vampire abilities the only choice to kill enemy is close combat, the worst part of this game. You have to walk very close to execute order, and the protagonist's reaction is bloody slow and inconsistant (possibly because the ""kill"" option and the ""drink blood"" option shares the same button, varying only in holding the button or not).  If you are unfortunately discovered because of that, there is no option to roll or sprint. Even if you can escape for once, the alarm system means the enemies will swarm you and it is just difficult to fight back.This game can be considered difficult and challenging but I am sure it is not going to be entertaining with that use-hostile control.

												There are different kinds of stealth games. There's the gentle stealth game, like those mini stealth runs in LoZ that require no challenge at all. Then there's Skyrim stealth, which is ludicrous and meh. Then there's Dishonored stealth, where enemies actually react and show off how a person reacts to stealth, and pay attention to things. And then there's DARK.This game's stealth is INCREDIBLY difficult! And enjoyable. DARK is a challenging stealth game, putting you into the role of a vampire (you do not sparkle) trying to find his creator so he doesn't end up a mindless ghoul. The AI is well done; they follow good pathways and block exits normally, and during hostile moments they wander, and work well together. They cover each other. THEY GIVE COVER!Overall, worth the buy, but only if you enjoy stealth games. Otherwise, you'll spend hours just sitting in the same spot going ""ffs move you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ guard.""			"

												DARK is a nice game. It is not a perfect game, the developers could improve a few things. Some of those things are the cut scenes (some could be playable instead), the length of the story as well as the depth and dialog. Also, characters may have more (micro) expressions and such. That would improve the game a lot visually.But; the story is nice, powers too and overall I think they are on to something.			"

												There were a lot of problems with DARK, but it was more fun to play than the meta-score suggested it would be. I picked it up on one of the sales for like 50% off or something, and I got my money's worth from it. It is on the short side, and if you play it well, you get enough skill points to have all the skills by the time you get to the last level or two, so you don't HAVE to pick and choose what to develop-- just the order in which you want to play with them.That said, some of the animations were a bit weird, the story wasn't a blockbuster or award winner, the voice acting for many of the characters was fairly cheesy-- not the voice acting itself, but the way it felt when spliced together with the other characters, and the soundtrack was a bit repetetive. Those were the biggest detractors for me. The gameplay itself wasn't terrible, and I enjoyed playing it through even though it was fairly short.I'd say if it seems like an interesting game to you and you can pick it up for $20 or so, give it a try. I've played A LOT of worse games, and some of them had higher critic scores than this one too. I think this one had an overly harsh critical response. It's not that bad, and it was a pretty sweet game conceptually-- it was kind of like Mirror's Edge in terms of cool concepts that aren't quite perfectly executed. I don't feel like my money was wasted on it, and I may even play through it again just to try a few different strategies with it. If it were truly awful, I'd never feel that way.			"

DARK - ( STEALTH & SHADOW )Fantastic game for the fans of stealth ( thinking&patience ) genre  -  i like the atmosphere , music and the color palette chosen for the levels maze like design wich is very good - uses  cel-shaded graphics similar to The Darkness 2/Escape Dead Island - also lower the brightness for more effect  - it offers quite a challenge if you choose not to upgrade your powers / play on HARD difficulty ( i only upgraded shadow leap - similar to swoop in Thief but more powerful almost like a instant teleportation in the shadows ) and get past undetected by the enemies - the game rewards you with more XP ( not kill them or feed on them - but in some points of the levels you are constraint in killing or feed because of no other possible choice - mostly on your secondary objective like server terminals which are obstructed by soldiers )  and turn off the objective marker ( your primary objective is to reach your in game targets ) ! - i will try in my second playthrough ( this is when i discovered accidentally the adjustable FOV setting i was playing with default 70 - but you can raise to 110 - very nice -  big difference :) it feels like playing another game - i opted for 90 not too narrow or too wide !) to get past the levels undetected using only in extreme situations shadow leap level 1 ( the enemy AI has predictable patterns ) - also you can not jump and i used as distractions an alternative to powers - walking straight wich gives away your position by the noise made - great replay value if you choose to take the violent route by upgrading all vampire powers  !HUGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL THE FANS OF STEALTH GENRE - 10/10!-my only complaint is that the game is short in length :(-i will definitely try to get all the achievements in this game :)-the bigest stength - very hard  - they dont make games like this anymore !

												Holy ♥♥♥♥, this game sucks so much i'm going to make a short review!Game looks like it's completly broken first thing you will likely notice when you start, some of the animations look ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Storyline in the beginning is so damn boring that i ended up quitting 30 minutes in the game.Gameplay controls are OK. Voice acting is horrible, game is like in constant derp mode.This game is so awfull i couldn't even bother to finish the tutorial, the game is this good.DO NOT BUY! You have been warned.(unless it's bundled for 1 buck)			"

												If you're into vampire games and sneak-em-ups, this will be a satisfying experience in the way that a few drops of blood in the desert will feel like a feast. It's an enjoyable game that could probably be considered mediocre had the genre not been so woefully underserved. When you're done with it, you'll want to play Bloodlines again.			"

												There are different kinds of stealth games. There's the gentle stealth game, like those mini stealth runs in LoZ that require no challenge at all. Then there's Skyrim stealth, which is ludicrous and meh. Then there's Dishonored stealth, where enemies actually react and show off how a person reacts to stealth, and pay attention to things. And then there's DARK.This game's stealth is INCREDIBLY difficult! And enjoyable. DARK is a challenging stealth game, putting you into the role of a vampire (you do not sparkle) trying to find his creator so he doesn't end up a mindless ghoul. The AI is well done; they follow good pathways and block exits normally, and during hostile moments they wander, and work well together. They cover each other. THEY GIVE COVER!Overall, worth the buy, but only if you enjoy stealth games. Otherwise, you'll spend hours just sitting in the same spot going ""ffs move you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ guard.""			"

												Even on a sale this game would get a 4/10 at best from me.This game gives you two options of play, Stealth or Death.Many people think that the stealth is actual bs and its effin impossible to do-it's not, it's just stupid as ♥♥♥♥.I found my self a good amount of the time having to stop and think outside the box when I actually needed to finish a levelI never really found anyway of the gameplay fun, not to mention the voice acting as stoic and the subtitles were wrong.The powers you gain through level up are extremely imbalanced half of them don't even have a use because the other skill does the same thing but better.Long story short-because it's 4 AM in the morning this game isn't worth buying, if you ever beat it you will never play it again.

												I actually loved this game. I don't understand why it's getting so many negative reviews. I thought the game was really fun, I thoroughly enjoyed playing it. If you like stealthy games, vampires or cel shading then I highly recommend this game. Go watch a YouTube video of its gameplay before purchasing Dark so you can decide whether or not this game is something you'd enjoy. I give it a 10/10.			"

												It's a hard and unforgiving stealth game. If you don't like to sneak around and remain unseen, go play Prototype instead.I was hesitant to buy the game because of the poor reviews, and I went into the game without high expectations, but I'm enjoying the game very much (14 hours played at the time of writing) and really don't think the score of 42 % is fair to the game. There's not much RPG in it; you get to spend power points on skills now and then and that's about it. You can talk to just a few people, but the story is very straight forward so no choices to be made. This is just an action game :)I do enjoy sneaking around, observe the enemies and come up with my master plan to take them all out one by one. You have a couple of different skills you can use in order to do just that.If you mess up and raise an alarm, mostly it's the end for you. Like some other reviews have pointed out, combat in the open doesn't work very well, but I believe that's on purpose - you really are supposed to remain hidden in the dark. Even if sometimes you wish you could just go an a rampage and unleash those vampiric powers!			"

												Ok, first against the haters:- whine: ""you should be able to save everywhere, stupid console port""There is a quicksave with F5 for all difficulties, and you do not need more than the quicksave.But if you are really not able to play that way, use easy difficulty stupid, there you have normal slots as you like them.- whine: silly videos each time I dieUse quicksave stupid or just skip the videos the 2nd time with the right mouse button.- whine: the graphics are so bad, is that a joke?I am playing with 1920x1200, the graphics are not super but hey, I am playing Minecraft (TekkitLit) and there all these ""retro graphics"" games, these graphics do REALLY look bad. I AM playing these games, I love MineCraft, but do not say DARK has bad graphics, you have no idea what you are talking about, you stupid.The graphics are NOT great, not even good. But they are so bad that you don't want to play the game. At least if you are interested in games because of the mechanisms, not just because of the screenshots.- whine: the Game is too shortI needed 12 hours for a playthrough on easy with lots of save/loads. Of course I wanted to get through most rooms without alarms and I wanted to kill as many of the enemies as possible. That is not too short. These were the things I saw in the forum I just think you guys who say these things are stupid. Sorry.Aehm, no, not sorry. Now about the game:You just became a vampire, you have no idea how. You have no idea about your lost life but the night club you ""awake"" in is full of friendly vampires which will try to help you. And they are good looking too. You will be using your powers as a vampire all the time.There three kinds of powers. - Abilities which you can use all the time with cooldowns, you can upgrade them, one ability gives you blood- Skills/Spells which use blood- passive abilities which are active all the timeThe abilties are pretty cool by themselves, teleporting, vampiric view, blood drinking whatever.You can just play a very large part of the game without spells if you wish to.I cleaned whole areas only with crouching, teleporting and killing silently.Avoid the guards, kill them, drag the bodies to the corners.It is like the game Commandos sometimes.You observe the pattern of the guards, then you start killing them.But if you start using spells, then the game starts to get different.You can go totally different ways.Confuse the target, go there and drink its blood?Remote kill a guard and vanish its body at the same time?Teleport behind an enemy and kill him with one spell?Create a distraction somewhere so you can a new situation and can kill certain guards more easily? Or just slip through?This game is fun if you play it as stealth character.I imagine, it is fun too, if you play it as fight character. But I did not really try that.The story is ok enough, the sounds are ok enough, the graphics are ok enough and the killing is fun.If you can get the game for a discount, you might love it.I regret to say, that 45 Euros (current price on 2014-11-01) is too much.The game is good, but please get it for cheap. Otherwise you will be expecting too much from it.But if you like stealth games (real stealth games, not like in Skyrim or the like) then this game is a must.The rooms are kind of ... repeating, no idea why it seems that way to me. There are some different levels, but after a while I just thought: next copy-paste room, which is not correct, because the rooms are all different and nice to look at.It is just... don't know, perhaps the game was too long for me? Again: ok to good game, get it, but not for 45 Euros! Short: Clean the level from enemies or just get to the exit, it depends on the mission. But I love to clean the rooms :)			"

												THIS ISN'T RECOMMEDATIONIt's stupid that Steam doesn't let you just review a game for your friends.  ANYWAYS.I play Stealth given any opportunity when I can.  I love using Stealth in any game.  So, in case any of you are big steath fans, let me say, THIS IS NOT A STEALTH BASED GAME.  The focus is not actually on the Stealth elements, but rather on the powers you get as a Vampire.You receive points to level up various passive and active powers.  I, loving to use stealth like I do, focused on all the powers that make you more stealthy, my reasoning being that it is a stealth game.  Don't do it.  The stealth mechanics are sloppy.Please, allow me to cite some bad things about this game.  It's a bad PC port, which is something I'm personally getting tired of seeing.  You can't skip cinematics.  So for those of you who want to be Stealth purists, as I do, plan on seeing all the same cinematics a dozen times when it just sets you up to die.  Alerting anyone at all eliminates your stealth bonus at the end of a map - so if you wait around a corner to ambush someone (waiting for them to round a corner, popping out and making a new corpse), you screw yourself out of more experience.  They give you the option of hiding bodies, but it's usually not an issue, as they leave you with no good place to hide them unless you want to completely break up the game flow and drag them backwards for half an hour.  The list can go on, but this is a long paragraph already.I'm not saying this isn't a decent game, but don't buy it expecting awesome stealth game play.  It may be decent when you use a mix of straight combat and stealth (NOT WHAT IT ADVERTISES), but I don't know.  I got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off listening to Eric Bane (♥♥♥♥ your name) rip off the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed Max Payne line about 15 times and promptly lit my house on fire to destroy my computer.If you want good stealth game play I recommend Arkham City, Far Cry 3 (really) and Skyrim with or without mods.  Just don't waste 40 dollars on this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Get a better game.Or 2 reasonably priced handjobs.			"

												DARK is a stealth action game that has some great ideas, but fails to deliver. The cel-shaded graphics are decently done, while its poor AI, weak plot,  poor controls, and repetitive gameplay run a garlic infused stake through the heart of its entertainment value. It may look asthetically pleasing, but severely lacks substance and is more frusterating than entertaining. Eric, the main character, is weak, boring, and dies way to easy.

												I wanted this game when it came out for some reason.  I finally bought it coming off my Castlevania: LoS high.  I should of not listened to myself on this one.  The faults in this game overexceeds the playablity unfortunately.  I got this game on a great xmas sale, but still feel like I shouldn't have paid over $5 for it.  First off, lets start with the graffics which appear out of date and poorly mocapped for a game that came out this year.  You add the extremely poor voice acting and this game just seems very 'cheap'.  And believe it or not, that's not the worst parts of the game!  The difficulty is unbalanced with the AI (even tho they are just humans) overpowering you very quickly and unfairly.  But get this, even though your a 'powerful' vampire, YOU CAN'T EVEN ATTACK THEM.  Once spotted you're pretty much dead and then you have to start the section of the level over again, killing the 15 humans you've worked so hard to kill OVER AGAIN.  Which makes it even worst is the controls for this game which are loose and clunky, some moves actually having no use at all.  If you spent your last once of money to buy this game and are stuck with it, then you've got to have the patience of a monk to play it.  I wanted to compare this game to Tenchu which I grew up loving as a stealth ninja series, but even in Tenchu you were able to attack once spotted and the AI wasn't so 'cheezy' and overwelming.  The only good things I can say about this game is that the power ups are very interesting and make the game 'slightly' fun, but it's definitely not enough to make it not 'suck'.  <---C'mon you knew that was coming lol.If you want to play a 'newborn vampire' game, I would recommend Vampire Masquerade: Bloodlines instead of this.  Even though VM:B is much older it has a better story, character options, choices, adventures, playablity......let's just say that it's an all around better newborn vampire game than this mediocre attempt.

												Honestly, i went into this game without high expectacions. I picked it up for 10 dollars during the halloween sale, and expexted it to be a budget stealth game with some vamire gimmicks. what i got was a budget stealth game with vampire Theme and habit of referencing vampire:the masquerade-bloodlines. If you like stealth games pick this game up on sale, it might be a little easy, but it should waste a bit of your time. If you like vampires, pick this game up on sale, the theme serves the game pretty well. If you dont like either and are looking to get into them, go play Vampire: the masquerade-bloodlines, this game wont sell you on either but that game might.			"

												The game although good with story lacked a true realness with its combat mechanics.Mainly the fact that you can kill any enemy with one hit and maximize your health at the start.So you can simply just tank them all to continue with the story.All in all I give it a 7/10 because the story is good, character devolpment is good, combat system needs work.If you want a video review to my thoughts on this game.

												What a damn bad game we have here.Stealth action game playing as a vampire, setting is not original but pretty, regrettable story, some nice environments, bad audio.What makes this game terrible? A.I.You basically throw away all the gameplay because enemies are so stupid and act like they are on rail. Never worry to light up an alarm, they will search you for a (little) while and then all returns as if nothing ever happened.A nice game to have for about 1 dollar i think, deserves no more.I am very disappointed because this game had a great potential and I can see efforts made by the developers but this is simply not enjoyable.

												I made the mistake of buying into this game when it was brand new, believing the claims of action RPG, when in fact it has a lot more sitting around and waiting than action and does not qualify as an RPG at all. This is a stealth game with almost nothing to offer other than it's art style, which you can surely find samples of in videos without needing to play the game.The story is bad. Other than some conversation treas and a skill tree, any semblemce to an RPG is non-existant. It is also exceptionally short with most of the time spent playing spent hiding and waiting.It best, this game would be okay as a budget stealth-adventure. At worst, it's a total ripoff. As is, it's not worth what they charge, not what it claims to be and not really worth playing.			"

												I had such high hopes for this game, the trailer enthralled me - and I will admit I am a vampire junkey.  Some of the voice acting is a bit - trying, but the initial plot premise isnt bad.  But the game play - oh so lacking in fluidity, functionality and dare i say balance.  The game gives you the option of playing on cakewalk, normal and hard modes... but I have a hard time finding any difference between the three.  Even on the Cake Setting (and with some naughty cheets that gave me unlimited blood and access to all powers) the 3rd act is almost impossible and the 4th is a steaming pain in the fangs.If they could improve the AI and better scale the difficulties so someone who is not a finger accrobat who lives for speed runs can complete the game I may re-install it, but currently its just too hard for a casual gamer like me, and too frustrating and poorly scripted for a hard core gamer.

												A good game with great idea but not many things to do. Story makes sense. Controls are ok.Some people may complain about the graphics but personally I think it's ok, if compared with Borderlands. Well, I'm not saying that Borderlands has worse graphics, it's just about people's own likings. Some people like Minecraft's pixel graphics, some others prefer Crysis 3's graphic cards burning quality.The main story feels like unfinished (or that should be the proper ending), and It definitely gave me the impression that this game could have more DLCs and expansions to play, but sadly no. The only thing you may enjoy after beaten the whole story is racing against the clock and completing some difficult challenges. There is a leaderboard for these challenges, but does it really matter? Ask yourself after a glance on people's review and release date.Oh and, although I think this game is okay, it's still a little bit overpriced. I recommend anyone who's interested in this game buy it when it's on sale, with at least 25% off discount.			"

												it's ok, not as bad as these reviewers make, mostly because i don't think they take the time to learn it. Read guide, you'll be fine, it's not a bad so-so game.I didn't look at the reviews when i bought the game, i just looked at some pictures, and a gameplay trailer, and i said, meh, let's get it. Then after buying it i saw so many bad reviews and that really got me thinking, but then i played it, almost hit my new keyboard for like an hour when i started playing this, before i learnt the game system, and how to play as supposed.Just cover, cover, cover, sneak, kill or feed. You also have plenty of powers and skills, which can be purchased with skillpoints you earn really easy while playing.It's sad that we don't have many vampire games these days.If you catch this game at a sale, get it. It has glitches and bugs, but it's not as bad as these reviews might make you think. I think it's pretty cool, and deserves to be played.			"

												Tedious and repetitive combat with a main character that doesn't feel or look like a vampire. Abilities seem like they were picked at random out of a hat and controls are clunky. Character progression is unsatisfying, and the plot is so slapstick it hurts. Comfy graphics (cartoon realism, similar to The Darkness 2 or DCUO) and a good idea at its core give this game 2.5 out of 5 stars. I think with a DLC that made it easier to choose alternate playstyles early on, the game could be more like a 3.5 at least and more likely to recommend. Right now, that DLC doesn't exist.			"

												Buying this game I knew that it is weak everything than it is only possible. Yes the miracle didn't happen. Realmforge Studios rose in one number of studios which wanted to jump above the head, and as a result sprained feet at a landing. Subject peripetias begin with news that if Beyn won't drink blood of the founder or simply ancient and powerful vampire, in some days will address in the stupid ghoul. For this purpose we break to all notable representatives of a sort vampire that live in the city.The FRAGILE IMMORTAL: As well as in the Universe of ""Masquerade"", all action happens under the screen of night — children of darkness hide the existence from ordinary people, and evil spirits hunters don't allow to drink others blood quietly. But this world is dead, you don't trust in it at all. Any study and depth. Any rough dabs then, there, and as a result of the whole picture it doesn't develop. Developers that try to frighten us patients on all head with villains, tell absolutely unnecessary and boring stories by means of the notes scattered on levels.Advantages:    club music;    closer to the end it becomes more or less interesting to play.Shortcomings:    mostly boring gameplay;    mediocre appearance;    dreadful animation;    flat plot which two thirds on the level of an intrigue remind Mario's adventures;    study of the world is absent in principle. In general game was pleasant to me, to kill the founder it is positive. Always I loved such endings, for example as similar in HITMAN. Well you understand.			"

												Oh my lord. Where do I start. unskippable, long, dialogue. Many, many lines of boring, cheesy text.... forced to push through a hobblingly slow character, boring dialogue, run-here-run-there gopher nonsense that you don't care about, all without getting to see if you will like the stealth mechanics or not, for about 20 minutes. Very, very poorly optimized. I had to nerf the graphics settings into the ground in order for this sham to not melt my gpu. Granted my gpu is old and kind of sucky, but the level of graphics were no where NEAR good enough to justify the massive system resources being used. However, I can say that even at low settings, the graphics looked almost exactly the same as on high. The voice acting is horrible... some of the worst...The voice acting in this game seems like a Saturday Night Live sketch making fun of bad voice acting. It's more humorous than real. The sad part is it isnt charmingly bad, it's just bad. And the characters seem boring, unoriginal tropes, and unrealistic too. When have you ever known an owner of a club to be like 24 years old? Being a vampire game doesnt mean you have to make EVERYTHING outside of believeability. How about street bums, who all pack automatic handguns... who always keep them in their hands... who try to mug you by asking for spare change? wtf? This game feels like it was written by a 9 year old who thinks they know what the world is like, but is way off. Have these people ever been in a real night club? You don't talk in nightclubs; if you need to communicate you shout right into the persons ear, and usually have to repeat it 3 times. Thankfully in this game, the club music automatically goes to half volume when you talk. Lol. Yea how immersion breaking is that. And then they just tell you they dont have time to talk anyway. Everything in this game just wants to waste your time and not move forward. I'm sure things happen later but... I'm not going to stick around to see what they are. DESPITE ALL THIS, I waited to see how the stealth would be. And the first thing they tell you is ""If you enter an opponent's field of vision, your vampiric powers will prevent him from noticing you immediately""   ..............this has to be the stupidest 'stealth' mechanic I ever heard of. So if they see you, they dont see you for a few seconds?   Again... a 9 year old wrote this game. And it shows. The game has very bad presentation, and wishy-washy stealth mechanics that make you achieve no real stealth. It's just nothing. The characters suck, the optimization sucks, and there is so much boring text.I really think this is not worth anyone's time. I'm glad I got this in a bundle and didn't pay much for it. Do not buy.

												The first time I started this game I got about a minute into it. I stumbled drunkenly down some stairs and the game locked up and forced my computer to restart. The second time I tried this game I stumbled drunkenly down some stairs and the game locked up and forced my computer to restart. The third time I tried this game I advised the main character to stop drinking and then uninstalled it.			"

												An interesting ideea underdeveloped with a nice presentation. The art style reminds me of TellTale games while the gameplay is a bit too rigid for a stealth game. The atmosphere is nice, the powers are fun to use however you are limited by how the game was designed. Most of the levels are very basic with just going from A to B and sneaking behind the AI which, at times, can be very funny to watch. Overall it's a slightly above average game simply due to the fun powers that you can have and level up with a light RPG element attached to the game and the nice art style. The voices are ok and the story does feature a nice twist near the end however it is all a bit rushed.I suggest playing this game in small bits and not all at once as it does get very repetitive.

												i'm a Kalypso ♥♥♥♥♥, i'll admit it easily. Loved Dungeons. Loved Disciples. Loved Tropico. i even liked Darkstar One. You remember? The space opera ""Elite"" clone w/ the Aussie-accented aliens?That is why i tried so hard w/ Dark. There was very little visible marketing for the game; i found it during a Steam sale and ignored the bad reviews, rationalising that if i could enjoy Darkstar One, i could very likely enjoy anything. Funny, how optimism creeps up.i could tell you what everyone else has, how horribly the characters are written and voiced, how many times the control scheme will get you killed, how badly textured and animated the cutscenes and levels are. Instead, i'll simply say that Kalypso apparently hired a bored office temp to create this game, so you should ignore the industry cache their studio has, throw this game in the nearest trashcan or recycle bin (depends on how you bought it), and save your hard-earned for the next Tropico instead.

												Well unfortunately I have no really positive comments about his one ... Apart from the fact that it WAS a hard game, and the graphics were kinda great, it did not impress me ...Gameplay had some bugs, movement was not natural, and character faces and bodies were poorly designed .. Compared for example to the AC series even AC1 had better movement and motion, that was released in '07 . I found similar ""difficulties"" and ""bugs"" with the ""Last Templar"" game from Kalypso. Nonetheless i spent 10 hours respawning a thousand times and trying new ways to be stealthy. As a general remark I would not recommend it. If a game wants to be stealthy it should provide players with the possibillity to go un-stealthy at any time and just walz in. This game    punished me so many times for not being stealthy...I have to admit thought that the music was addictive!! On the contrary spoken dialogues were poor and too ""american"" using all the slang like, ""like"" , ""whatever"" , ""kinda"" and what na that was really low level. I would give it a 4 out of 10 for the graphics and music.			"

												The combat is not fluid, in any sense of the word. With the limit of four blood - after you've dumped 3 levels of points into a passive - you can't use the super powers that you see the trailers spamming. The hostility meter takes three minutes to disappate AS LONG AS they don't find a corpse - that can be 10 minutes cold - or get a peek at you. There are 8 skills you can put points into, but only one action slot (besides Jump and Vision), and they don't make HOW TO INTERCHANGE THEM readily obvious. I dug around for a couple minutes, with no luck, before giving up on it. The time it takes to feed off someone is horrendously long, and the inability to even backpeddle to pull your victim into a corner is incredibly annoying. For ten seconds, you're just sitting there hoping that one guard doesn't look around the corner - which he always does - and then you have a damned hostility meter going for 10 seconds while he walks forward, then is immediately refreshed when he sends out an alarm on the corpse. The reviews I read, fawning over ""hours of playtime to be had"" neglected to mention that 90% of it was spent sitting in a corner waiting for a patrol to break up, so you could pick one off only to wait again. The least of this games sins was the horrendous targeting for non-stealth melee attacks (really? 6 ft guy needs to be on top of someone to land a punch?) and the fact that I had to target predetermined ""hidey-holes"" that didn't even give me cover for my shadow jump. And God forbid I get shot, or my wrist move AT ALL, because I'd probably end up targeting the wrong spot right as I clicked. Only thing I found fun in this game was the Shadow Kill - when I had the blood to use it - specifically in the situation of effectively poofing past a gaggle of guards, onto the second floor of a building and getting a kill.

												From the trailer and the whole idea of the game it looks really good and like a good purchase. After playing around 10 minutes, I can tell you this ain't the case. The graphics are kinda cool, being a tad comic-book stylish but the animations, voice acting and just general gameplay seem like they're from a game released in 2001.

												This could have been a great game but much to my dissapointment it's not. I liked the art style, the graphics, and especially the game mechanics. Unfortunately the painful voice acting spoils the atmosphere and the tuning of the game mechanics ruins everything else. This really played like an Alpha build of a game and could really use about a month of solid testing and tuning to allow this game to reach its potential.

												However i had spent a wonderful 12 hours playing it to the end, i feel like i had not gotten teh chance to unravel all of the possible wonders of the game, mostly because the lack of a new game plus option. the enemies are most of the time too overpowered and placed badly for any strategic maneuver, getting seen basically doing anything, and the fact that they took away the boss fights with cutscenes had me deeply disappointed. The AI is mostly stupid, and even though the npc-s are placed so they would notice you anywhere, they stillamange to forget about a freekin' vampire in the room they just left. If there was a new game plus, and some of the AI and the npc placement had been worked on more thoroughly, i might as well recommedn it, but since none of these useful features became enjoyable, i must say don't waste your money on this.

DARK's atrocious writing, unadorned cell-shading, and doofy AI make me nostalgic for the days before every video game had to be a cinematic spectacle. It's a middle-of-the-road PS2 stealth game and should have been a budget title at release. It's no Daikatana goes stealth, as some ubersampling-coddled critics would have us believe. It's cute in the way an ugly, broken thing can be cute at last call on a rainy Tuesday night.			"

												I'll put a disclaimer in that I never finished the game and writing this review 3 months after I last played. But here's my short and general experience.From what I remember, the gameplay was good with some neat abilities to upgrade that help you in your missions. I do distinctly recall that this game is repetitive. It gets challenging to eliminate all of the enemies using stealth and not having them discover each other’s bodies. One big annoyance was the save feature. You could only save once or twice each chapter. It was a defined amount which was not appreciated because the game mechanics were not always straight forward and I felt were to blame instead of me for some deaths.I would recommend this if it's on sale or in a bundle and you enjoy stealth games "

												Great concept, Nice special abilities, but I'm dissapointed and frustrated with this game.  A vampire/person should be able to drop over railings a few feet below them. Instead you are forced to follow a linear ""Stay on the sidewalk"" type movement that makes you have to confront many of your enemies.  Not much of a stealth game if I have to fight all the time.  Even in shadows the people can see my dark clothed character from unnatural distances.You need to rely on your vampire abilities, which uses greatly limited blood power, too often at game staart. Even on the easiest level of difficulty. I've been playing it to get a better feel for its design. I'm on the third mission now and the vampire skills do help.  I still think the need to rely on them as a new vampire make the game start difficult.			"

												I don't understand why so many negative reviews. Basically, this is a good entry into the STEALTH genre of games. I think the problem is everyone thinks that Vampires are OP and should be able to run-and-stomp. Well, I'm sorry but you're new, lost, and venerable right now. And the guys that are hunting you know your weaknesses.The only thinig I really missed from the game is a decent knife-kill animation. I'm so used to having these epic mini-cinematics (Far-cry, Styx, Mordor (best kills ever) Dishonoured, Blood Dragon, Mark Of The Ninja (2D vesrion of Dishonoured!  So awesome!) That it feels somehow lacking when you backflip someone into a headlock and then just snap their neck. But, the no-knife has a purpose - stealth kills grant you something more importaint... blood to use your abilities. Each ability uses blood, and you will find yourself calcuting who to use abiolity kills on, and who to stealth-drain to restore your presious ability reserves. I enjoyed it, as it prevented youfrom being too over powered. I never flet like I coud walk into a room and clean up.Enemy AI is basic, but good. Their patrol routes cover each other, making the hardest ting in a room being ""who to take first"" - leading to a gap to take the next guy..... they look /follow  with guns drawn if they hear something (you), walking on broken glas makes a sound... they call eachother for help (there is a huge ability point bonus for not raising the alarm by the end of the level). The problem with this AI though, like all AI, in all stealth games, ever,  is they don't realy notice when all of their buddies have gone ""missing"". you can drag and hide bodies. Bodies trigger alarms. Alarms put everyone on high alert, guns drawn, actively and systematically hunting you out. AI has a 'range of sight', rather than a 'line of sight' so get 20 meters away from you and they won't see you dragging their patrol partner down the stairs.I played it with quicksave and considered getting caught as an instant restart of the area. I enjoyed it, quite a bit. It filled a gap in the Stealth genre for a bit, until I find something else sneaky-sneaky-stabby-stab-stab. Get it on a sale, I did, and I am happy with my buy.If you go the Stealth Route, it makes no difference if the game is on Easy or Hard - that setting only affects the amount of damage they do to you, which won't be a problem if they never see you....

												It's a shame to see wasted potential. If this had a better team of developers or maybe just better animators, there's a chance it could've been a decent game.DARK is a 3rd person stealth-action game where you play as a modern-day vampire on a manhunt for the person that changed him into the brooding, blood-sucking monster that he is.The overall story is very generic and poorly put together. There are so many plot holes, the story that's leftover is almost nonexistent. Every event basically says, ""Well, this is happening just because.""Controls, while slightly responsive, are still clunky and all over the place. All these upgrades and special moves, and you'll just run around one-punching enemies. Run around? Yes. The enemy AI is so terrible, I managed to duck behind a corner and kill EVERY SINGLE GUARD one at a time. I was left with a pile of maybe 20 - 25 dead guards next to me. On the plus side, the abilities are okay. Not extremely innovated by any means, but they're neat. However, when you can simply run around and one punch everything to death, there's not really a need to use any of them.Don't even get me started on the voice acting though. I understand good talent is hard to come by, but PLEASE. I could find more believable dialouge in an old insane asylum. Bottom line, if you enjoy wonky PS2 games, this would make a nice addition to your collection. It's part of the reason I have the game in the first place. Other than that, I suggest putting your money elsewhere. See my video of this game HERE. "

If you play this game a few hours you will be bored because there wont be something new you have to do its always the same way. The steering wont define to you very well. You have to find out a few steering elements by yourself. This wont be easier for you to play this game and you will be bored soon. Another point is that you have to play long parts of the game again  if you die on the severity ""hard"", whats getting on your nerves after a while.

Checked options and it says WASD for movement.... 4th issue ""Press any key"" means to them Press the mouse button, unless for some reason this game is disabling my keyboard on my laptop, this would also explain why i can't move after opening cutscene.

												First off, don't buy it at full price, not worth it: Wait for Steam Sales. I was just getting used to the good sides (and the many bad sides) of the game when whoops... Final boss and tadaa. The End. The ingame counter says ~5 hours. I know I've spent ~3 more hours failing and trying again to get 100% objectives and XP.The game was surprisingly hard in the beginning yet way too easy towards the end. I felt like level design and difficulty were pretty much the same during whole game which leads to a problem as you lack some vital skills and abilities to get through the first missions. By the end of the game you should have unlocked all the abilities but won't have had time to try them all which is a shame.The non existant melee combat system makes ""boss fights"" simply ridiculous and also forces you into one single play style. I do enjoy the sneaky way. But I sometimes found myself willing to rush into the pack of soldiers and slice the heck out of em. Not possible (okay for the rushing part it ""sort of"" is). Such a short story brings along other issues as for example poor lead character personalities. You won't miss them at all and you'll also forget about the game pretty quickly.To sum this up, IF you :- Are not fond of melee combat- Like the Vampire - Bloodlines kind of story and atmosphere- Have patience for sale, lots of it - YET don't want to spend too many hours on the game- Don't have high expectationsThen you might wanna give it a try. But then again, wait for Steam Sales. It's absolutely not worth the current 44,99€.			"

I'm the type of person who loves Splinter Cell type games where you can utilize stealth, but if you felt like it you can have a firefight.  Well, in this game, it seemed that I was really only limited to stealth, but done in the wrong way.  I'd always get spotted and killed in a short time span, so I would retry from checkpoint and get the same result, time and time again.  No matter how much I personally wanted to do the mission purely with stealth, it was just plain impossible.  Don't waste your money on this one.			"

												Well unfortunately I have no really positive comments about his one ... Apart from the fact that it WAS a hard game, and the graphics were kinda great, it did not impress me ...Gameplay had some bugs, movement was not natural, and character faces and bodies were poorly designed .. Compared for example to the AC series even AC1 had better movement and motion, that was released in '07 . I found similar ""difficulties"" and ""bugs"" with the ""Last Templar"" game from Kalypso. Nonetheless i spent 10 hours respawning a thousand times and trying new ways to be stealthy. As a general remark I would not recommend it. If a game wants to be stealthy it should provide players with the possibillity to go un-stealthy at any time and just walz in. This game    punished me so many times for not being stealthy...I have to admit thought that the music was addictive!! On the contrary spoken dialogues were poor and too ""american"" using all the slang like, ""like"" , ""whatever"" , ""kinda"" and what na that was really low level. I would give it a 4 out of 10 for the graphics and music.			"

												I was incredibly excited about this game when I first heard about it. A game where you get to play as a vampire? Slunking around the dark city, drinking blood in the shadows, and trying not to allert anyone....then I bought it.Horrible game. The art style is questionable, and the cut scenese are jittery and makes it hard to watch. The dialogue is really awkward and stiff. I was very disappointed there was really no free-roam in the game. Even between missions. Although I enjoyed all the superpowers you could get in the game. I feel as though time enough to play it on our own terms would have been a really good addition. Or the ability to better use the environments.I enjoy the concept. I wish they could make a better game out of this, and not to scrap the concept, never to be used again.			"

												it wouldnt be fair to say this is a bad game, I wanted really badly to like this game because of the skills and mechanics, however I lost interest after the first hour after realizing this game destroyed the whole ""stealth"" part (by essentially making the entire game ""you'll be fine if your not seen"") its a fun time waster perhaps, but I'll be honest, I didnt appreciate what it did with what it had,			"

												Well i like the game but to be honest the ai is pretty bad then theres the combat which is pretty bad when you get discovered you cant hit for nothin then theres the fact that unless you run away (which is pretty much your only answer in that situation) you die. Over all the game had alot of promise. From the looks to the skills, (which really needed to be better balanced). The story is ok but would have been alot better if it was more indept and far longer. Each lvl is pretty much the same thing over and over again. Making the game openworld would have been a nice add to it and made it at least bearable so there was something else to do when you dont want to do missions. Over all the game was really nice when it came to the ideas, but fell short in the long run. If the game was maybe 2 or 3 dollars i would say go for it, but any more then that and your not gonna want to spend the money on it. If they come out with a sequel ill be happy to check it out but they have alot of fixing to do before i would seriously consider it.			"

												Being a fun of white wolf's Vampire the Masquerade, i was really looking forward to getting this thinking it would be something similar to Bloodlines in terms of style......boy was i mistaken......The game was terrible, the writing was atrocious, to get an idea the name of the main character was .......Eric Bane, a name that feels like it was picked by a 10 year old like Phoenix Steel or Damian Dark or something as pretentious. The dialogue was equally laughable with very poor plot (at least up to the part i played but i doubt it gets any better after the tutorial unless the first team died in a mysterious accident was replaced by a team of actually competent developers). The final nail to the coffin that made me say ""enough is enough"" and urged me to kill my character and put him out of his misery was the terrible and unimpressive gameplay. The only thing i enjoyed in the game was to discover that the first mentor to the character was a club owner who, judging by her face, was based on Rose McGowan and is coincidentally named Rose  :P "

												Fails at being a stealth game and unfortunately that's all it's trying to be. It becomes slightly more enjoyable after you get some upgrades but not enough to make the game worth the buy.

												Run it in compatibility mode (windows XP Pack 2) and you'll avoid jaggies. DARK's atrocious writing, unadorned cell-shading, and doofy AI make me nostalgic for the days before every video game had to be a cinematic spectacle. It's a middle-of-the-road PS2 stealth game and should have been a budget title at release. It's no Daikatana goes stealth, as some ubersampling-coddled critics would have us believe. It's cute in the way an ugly, broken thing can be cute at last call on a rainy Tuesday night.			"

												I'll put a disclaimer in that I never finished the game and writing this review 3 months after I last played. But here's my short and general experience.From what I remember, the gameplay was good with some neat abilities to upgrade that help you in your missions. I do distinctly recall that this game is repetitive. It gets challenging to eliminate all of the enemies using stealth and not having them discover each other’s bodies. One big annoyance was the save feature. You could only save once or twice each chapter. It was a defined amount which was not appreciated because the game mechanics were not always straight forward and I felt were to blame instead of me for some deaths.I would recommend this if it's on sale or in a bundle and you enjoy stealth games "

												From the trailer and the whole idea of the game it looks really good and like a good purchase. After playing around 10 minutes, I can tell you this ain't the case. The graphics are kinda cool, being a tad comic-book stylish but the animations, voice acting and just general gameplay seem like they're from a game released in 2001. Again, the idea of the game is great, just the gameplay that lets it down. Wouldn't recommend.			"

												i'm a Kalypso ♥♥♥♥♥, i'll admit it easily. Loved Dungeons. Loved Disciples. Loved Tropico. i even liked Darkstar One. You remember? The space opera ""Elite"" clone w/ the Aussie-accented aliens?That is why i tried so hard w/ Dark. There was very little visible marketing for the game; i found it during a Steam sale and ignored the bad reviews, rationalising that if i could enjoy Darkstar One, i could very likely enjoy anything. Funny, how optimism creeps up.i could tell you what everyone else has, how horribly the characters are written and voiced, how many times the control scheme will get you killed, how badly textured and animated the cutscenes and levels are. Instead, i'll simply say that Kalypso apparently hired a bored office temp to create this game, so you should ignore the industry cache their studio has, throw this game in the nearest trashcan or recycle bin (depends on how you bought it), and save your hard-earned for the next Tropico instead.

												The combat is not fluid, in any sense of the word. With the limit of four blood - after you've dumped 3 levels of points into a passive - you can't use the super powers that you see the trailers spamming. The hostility meter takes three minutes to disappate AS LONG AS they don't find a corpse - that can be 10 minutes cold - or get a peek at you. There are 8 skills you can put points into, but only one action slot (besides Jump and Vision), and they don't make HOW TO INTERCHANGE THEM readily obvious. I dug around for a couple minutes, with no luck, before giving up on it. The time it takes to feed off someone is horrendously long, and the inability to even backpeddle to pull your victim into a corner is incredibly annoying. For ten seconds, you're just sitting there hoping that one guard doesn't look around the corner - which he always does - and then you have a damned hostility meter going for 10 seconds while he walks forward, then is immediately refreshed when he sends out an alarm on the corpse. The reviews I read, fawning over ""hours of playtime to be had"" neglected to mention that 90% of it was spent sitting in a corner waiting for a patrol to break up, so you could pick one off only to wait again. The least of this games sins was the horrendous targeting for non-stealth melee attacks (really? 6 ft guy needs to be on top of someone to land a punch?) and the fact that I had to target predetermined ""hidey-holes"" that didn't even give me cover for my shadow jump. And God forbid I get shot, or my wrist move AT ALL, because I'd probably end up targeting the wrong spot right as I clicked. Only thing I found fun in this game was the Shadow Kill - when I had the blood to use it - specifically in the situation of effectively poofing past a gaggle of guards, onto the second floor of a building and getting a kill.

												The Style is fun, story is B movie stock, arbitrary love interest is arbitrary. Generally a good idea thats suffered in delivery. Worth a play if you want a budget, alternative take on Tenchu or Thief gameplay but with Neon Vampires. Starts off slow paced stealth game and after the first two acts suddenly starts to speed up as your powers develope (teleport, force choke, mind powers, turn into a shadow, predator vision etc.). Clearly the begining of the game was the last thing they worked on. This game is brutal and punnishing at times but once a level's mastered it makes you feel like a mofo Night crawler vampire Jedi. I love some of the ideas but hate the application, needed more play testing and more time to tighten the bolts. Otherwise a good game.			"

VERY OVERPRICED on steam (but quite good at the $10 range)PROS:-Good stealth abilities (Its basically the ""Predator"" stealth parts of Batman Arkham without much of the combat)-Good RPG aspects (but they are useless at lvl 1 and overpowered at max lvl...)NEUTRAL:-Difficulty implementation seems good at first, but I'm not sure if it really makes much of a difference.-Graphics are good enough.-Can be save scummed (slightly encourages it due to variant enemy behavior, see below)CONS:-NOT WORTH $40-Level design gets very repetitive due to boring AI.-Enemy behavior is occasionally slightly different even when reloading+doing the same thing.-Combat isn't very good (but I played on hard so I only got exp for stealth...so I only used stealth)-Enemies spot you at somewhat awkward distances. 10 feet he sees you! 10 feet, 1 inch...doesn't see you anymore! -Enemies have extremely rigid patrol paths with no variation.-A couple animations are almost verbatim copied from Batman Arkham seriesAll in all, if you enjoyed the ""Predator"" components of Batman, this is it's well done lower budget cousin.

VERY OVERPRICED on steam (but quite good at the $10 range)PROS:-Good stealth abilities (Its basically the ""Predator"" stealth parts of Batman Arkham without much of the combat)-Good RPG aspects (but they are useless at lvl 1 and overpowered at max lvl...)NEUTRAL:-Difficulty implementation seems good at first, but I'm not sure if it really makes much of a difference.-Graphics are good enough.-Can be save scummed (slightly encourages it due to variant enemy behavior, see below)CONS:-NOT WORTH $40-Level design gets very repetitive due to boring AI.-Enemy behavior is occasionally slightly different even when reloading+doing the same thing.-Combat isn't very good (but I played on hard so I only got exp for stealth...so I only used stealth)-Enemies spot you at somewhat awkward distances. 10 feet he sees you! 10 feet, 1 inch...doesn't see you anymore! -Enemies have extremely rigid patrol paths with no variation.-A couple animations are almost verbatim copied from Batman Arkham seriesAll in all, if you enjoyed the ""Predator"" components of Batman, this is it's well done lower budget cousin.

												It's a shame to see wasted potential. If this had a better team of developers or maybe just better animators, there's a chance it could've been a decent game.DARK is a 3rd person stealth-action game where you play as a modern-day vampire on a manhunt for the person that changed him into the brooding, blood-sucking monster that he is.The overall story is very generic and poorly put together. There are so many plot holes, the story that's leftover is almost nonexistent. Every event basically says, ""Well, this is happening just because.""Controls, while slightly responsive, are still clunky and all over the place. All these upgrades and special moves, and you'll just run around one-punching enemies. Run around? Yes. The enemy AI is so terrible, I managed to duck behind a corner and kill EVERY SINGLE GUARD one at a time. I was left with a pile of maybe 20 - 25 dead guards next to me. On the plus side, the abilities are okay. Not extremely innovated by any means, but they're neat. However, when you can simply run around and one punch everything to death, there's not really a need to use any of them.Don't even get me started on the voice acting though. I understand good talent is hard to come by, but PLEASE. I could find more believable dialouge in an old insane asylum. Bottom line, if you enjoy wonky PS2 games, this would make a nice addition to your collection. It's part of the reason I have the game in the first place. Other than that, I suggest putting your money elsewhere. See my video of this game HERE. "

												The Style is fun, story is B movie stock, arbitrary love interest is arbitrary. Generally a good idea thats suffered in delivery. Worth a play if you want a budget, alternative take on Tenchu or Thief gameplay but with Neon Vampires. Starts off slow paced stealth game and after the first two acts suddenly starts to speed up as your powers develope (teleport, force choke, mind powers, turn into a shadow, predator vision etc.). Clearly the begining of the game was the last thing they worked on. This game is brutal and punnishing at times but once a level's mastered it makes you feel like a mofo Night crawler vampire Jedi. I love some of the ideas but hate the application, needed more play testing and more time to tighten the bolts. Otherwise a good game.			"

												Pro tip-if you are going to play the game it has limited saves but if you use the F5 key your aloud to save as many times as you wantI finished the game but overall was disapointed.  The game is extremely repetitive.  I good example of this game is dishonered but dishonered did it ten times better.  I started the game on hard and killed everyone on the levels, but once you get about half way through it gets really tiring so i would just rush through the levels to finish the game very disapointing.

												This game is a stealth action game which doesent have a special story. If you play this game a few hours you will be bored because there wont be something new you have to do its always the same way. The steering wont define to you very well. You have to find out a few steering elements by yourself. This wont be easier for you to play this game and you will be bored soon. Another point is that you have to play long parts of the game again  if you die on the severity ""hard"", whats getting on your nerves after a while. All in All i would say that you only should buy this game, if you are a hardcore stealth action fan player. If you arent i wont  buy this game for this price.			"

												This is a fun stealth game.  It definitely has it's flaws, mostly the mediocre voice acting and predictable story.  The graphics are pretty good, but an option to turn off the cell shading would of been nice.  It does have fun powers to learn and use, which at points do let you feel like a bad ♥♥♥ vampire.			"
