												It used to bea  nice game, but only ever worth playing becasue of the community, which is now completly dead.The first 60ish levels are fine, 60-100 are a bore, then its just pay to win. Gamigo are also a joke of a company, it's honestly like they want to drive their paying customers away.Honestly would not even bother.			"

												Now theres many reasons why you should and shouldn't play this game. The first is Gamigo. Gamigo has plenty to learn about what made this game popular, they do however, seem to be asking the community on what to do. They have picked up where OutSpark left off, and they left it in a pretty shoddy state. The once party based mmo where friendships were made and broken online had become a PvP brawler with very little friendship left in the game. The whole academy, towers and apprenticeship system punish those who casually play and pushes those who don't to 60 in a matter of days. But for a game boasting such a high level cap (level 115), its major that I mention the half way mark.The half way mark is bs, its around a 100th mark in a completely incorrect number form. If you go for the 115 cap prepare to spend time (and money if impatient). They hit you down with distant spawns when you die, exp is pathetic, and grinding areas are limited (only supporting approximately 3 grinding parties on a bad day). You will give up. The game isn't nice at any level above 60. With some levels easier then others. But notice its still a thumbs up. Change hasn't happened, and though promised, is still unlikely. The ONLY way this will change is with support, and ontop of that factor. Support isnt available. And please, I may not be rushing to 115 but give me someone to talk to in game. I have friends from 5-6 years ago who I met through a Kingdom Quest (Raid), without those people this game is PvP Online not the ironically named Fiesta Online (meaning Party Online). Play this game, meet new people, play with new people, bond with new people, raid with new people. THAT is what made this game great 6 years ago, not the PvP or 115 cap, play it and keep playing with others and you wont get bored. Play by yourself with no one else and you will die of boredom, your choice.I recommend this game only to those who care for the community, avoid if you hate people (which alot of the MMO bait hounds of current tend to). Come in groups and you will be proof that I wont regret recommending this, the majority ignore this and no one will enjoy this game.Also for the anime lovers, you will LOVE this game.			"

												Horribly unbalanced with a company and publishers that cater to and babysit the fighter class, terrible community with a few exceptions.I have personally played this game almost since it's release, however on the US version of Fiesta.This is 100% pay to win game once u get past 105 with horribly unbalanced quests that only give you 30 - 40 % progress and leaves u having to beg for help and/or do tedious and repetitive repeats for less than 1% every turn. Customer service is almost non-existant even tho volunteers do care and try their best, most times the company is not involved and leave players hanging with unsolved issues and fail to listen to the players.Reason I stay? nostalgia, due to this being the first mmo I ever played I still enjoy some of the gameplay, but every time I log in I eventually get horribly reminded that if you got the cash you are someone, if you however lack the cash and/or do not wanna spend 100's of dollars to enhance your gears and/or get weapon skins, charms, extenders, etc. you are left out of the loop 90% of the time. now good aspects? yes there are kingdom quests that are meant to be played as a team and dungeons that require you to enter as a team, unfortunately the paying vs. non-paying customer divide gets even more apparent here, because who wants a person that does his best but due to lacking gear dies more? oh and on the note of dying, on higher levels, each rep gives you perhaps 0.3% progress each turn. if you die? you loose 1% progress every time.. ofc again the pay to win comes into action where you can buy a teva to prevent exp loss,.. so, question is, why should you play this game? well it is ""free to play"" so, if you wanna give it a shot, go for it, you will soon discover however that 99% of what I have stated above is true. Fiesta = pay pay pay or go home!			"

												I played this game since Alpha on 2006 until 2010, then played on private servers until 2013. If I mash it up I have arrount 2000 hours of playtime extimately, so I have bases to tell you this. Even if you feel like it's not right, the retail game is pretty much dead, and almost all the pservers too. So if you are really looking forward to this, find yourself a populated pserver, there's where almost all the community who still hasn't given up on the game lays, I was once one of those people. I can say I know alot of people from this community and it has a place I hold dear in my heart. But the game's dead to me already.. This game's main issue is that it's OLD. We have plenty of other choices that are way more fun than pointing and clicking arround. MMORPGs with way more immersive combat systems and playstyles, yet they lack what made MMORPGs so fun.. the sense of community this game once held.I guess we can't have everything at once, or I'm just getting old. Whatever you chose, I warned you.			"

												I've played this game for about 2 years, even before it came to Europe. It was my first Mmorpg and I really enjoyed it, mainly because of the community, the events they were holding and truthfully, because of the characters and gear. I've went through 2 lvl caps, at 60 and 80. Leveling to 60 was pretty ok; of course losing XP upon death was not fun, but it could have been avoided with a good cleric and in-game scrolls.But going to level 80 was a total different story, because the XP lost here was counted in 7 digit numbers. And that was not fun at all. Yes, I did spend some good bucks on this game, but I've never regret it, since the community was making up for it. I've came back to the game in 2010, after 1 year break, to sadly see things got downhill, the groups I was circling in started to disappear, people stopped playing the game. The ""new generation"" of players were all pumped up with store items and they would not party with people who didn't have store items or upgraded gear/weapons. Sickened, I stopped playing.When I saw the announcement on Steam, I nostalgically logged back in, but what a disappointment it was when I saw the ""once all day populated places"" being now deserted.

												Very traditional MMO that doesn't try to be anything it isn't.Most of the negative reviews call it ""boring"" because it's just fighting one monster after the other and although it is repetitive, so are most games and above all it's F2P. There is no need to get so furious about a game you didn't spend anything on other than time. I've spent £40 on games far more tedious.No denying though that the high points are the visuals and sounds. Great soundtrack and a nice atmosphere due to the art style.I also don't get the connection issues people are getting. I've had this PC since 06 and this is one of the very few games that doesn't lag. I think it's time to swap the potato you're using for a PC or a Mac (If this plays on a Mac)			"

												i've played this game back in 2007, before it was on steam.It was my first MmorpgThings have changed a lot.""scroll based quests"" allow you to  just accept and finish quests from your questlog. Wich makes questing realy easy.There's also autowalk now, wich automaticly walks you to a destination (like enemies you need to kill for a quest)The combat is still the same. rightclick and spam your skills.Character customination is STILL realy poor if you don't want to spend money: 3 hairstyles, 3(unatural) haircolors and 5 (bland)faces.For some reason they locked the crusader class for lvl 60+, wich is the only class that can wield a greatsword.Too bad, i like greatswords.The enemies can vary from badass looking(higher level areas) to stuipidly cute things you wouldn't want to attack.Now instead of shouting things like ""i will end you!"" , like they did before.They now will  say things like: ""i have no chace against you, please don't kill me"".Wich is kind of strange.There are many reviews saying that this game is pay to win now. I don't know yet, i've only gotten to level 15 so far. i've had a level 78 priest/cleric (forgot the name of the class) on my old account and i never felt any pay2win elements.But i guess that has changedThis game wasn't realy pay2win for me but pay to properly customize your character.There are no special Mechanics in Fiesta that aren't in other mmorpgs  , so...there isn't really a point in playing this game now.That's why all the servers are almost empty.It's an old game, and it doesn't hold up with most other mmorpgs nowadays.Sad to say but everything has to come to an end.i'd still recommend it for people who just want to have an easy and simple mmorpg with almost no community left.

												I started playing Fiesta right back in the OBT on Outspark nearly ten years ago. It was a very pretty game even if the first thing I did was rage quit after fifteen minutes of not finding a single monster. But after an hour being offline and realising I was looking in the wrong place, I got into the game. I got very much into the game; making new friends and beating up crap all the time was a hoot.If you want a representation of how I see the game, then consider WOW, consider a less complicated and more enjoyable WOW and you're well on the way. I'm sure it's trying to emulate the Blizzard behemoth, and yes it does it rather well and doesn't need the crazy subscription fee! But the game leans heavily on teamwork. Me a Brit and OutSpark an American company with American players and those whom have a lot more time, money and an inclination to spend time in the game made it hard for me, personally, to compete... so I quit around level 66 or so; with a cap of 79, I suppose I did myself out of an achievement. BOOOOO!Then Gamigo announced that they were stepping in with the same game for all the European Fiestophiles. I can't say whether it was a good thing they did or not; but I'd say it was good because the servers were now closer, meaning less drag on bandwidth and delays in getting stuff done, but bad because there were naff all other players as the game was so damn new to them, and old to OutSpark! Plus with them not moving accounts from one company to another, obvious reasons of privacy, you had to start again at level 1!So I bit the bullet. Met even more friends and again got up to level 60 or so before... well something happened, I can't say what it was, life if you will. A company called fkmylife at the time approached me to GM and code for their own copy of Fiesta, so I jumped at the idea, and for a time all was good.Then poo hit fans. Gamigo got hacked, Outspark went under and Gamigo took it over and now we're in 2017. I was amazed when I saw the game on Steam, so I wondered whether it was a good idea to download it or not. Turns out; no. The game servers, rather the English game servers were barren when I logged back in. No merchents, no players, none of the banter I remember and of text scrolling so fast through chatlogs that you could miss out on a conversation. It made me sad and it made me depressed.So, the tl;dr of all this; it's a good game, we just need something of a resurgance in the player base, but as it's going to be a good ten years old soon, I remember playing it at university and now I'm 30, maybe newer games are taking it over. I would love to see it back in its glorious days again. Going online today was just depressing.In closing, I could recommend it because of what it is, I'm not going to recommend it because of the lack of community. However, do have a play; get your friends in it, and if you want to have a party with me any time, I have a level 66 character (BOOO! UNDERLEVELLED!) and can always pop in for an hour or so on occasions.Peace to all.P.s. Steam requires me to give it a yay or nay, so it's a yay for all the memories!			"

You can't skip conversations  If you speak with an NPC you have to click here and then there and then here again and... it takes so much time and nerves just to accept a quest!  You are running.

Look at the ground! You. Are. Running. No matter how much time is passing by while you...run... (Soooo... I don't think you could actually run faster in real life than your character is running in game, but, you know, sometimes things can be a bit too realistic and close to rl. This really shouldn't be one of those things.)  The graphics, ooooh the graphics x_x "

												This game is fun, has a friendly community, alot of grinding, but that is to be expected in all MMORPG's. Not a bad game and is Free to play, so you can't really complain, it's like Grand Fantasia but less annoying ;) ... It does not take long to download at all, it's good. It's worth trying it out and giving it a proper go and u might just suprise urself and love it.			"

												(I will put this as a recomended game, but its more neutral)Don't mind the houres i put in it with Steam, I started the game when it was first released.I realy LOVED this game *_* . It was the first i played. Great community, nice story, it was just fun.So i thought, lets go back to memorylane and try it again and as you can see I quiet soon again. From the short time i was there I've seen 2 other players. I thought, where the hell are all the others, where are the stalls? The day i took a (very long break) it was packed with people, but now... its dead, and thats a shame. I asked in the chat if anyone was still alive. well i dont think so, did'nt get a single answer.So for the short time i was online, the best thing was to see all my old characters. From my starter character to all the way to my last character i created before i went away.So... if you love a game where you dont have to be afraid to play with others, this will be your game.No seriously, this game is still beautiful, but the lack of players is the problem (in the starterworld). If Aeria could come with a plan to get more new players to try out the game (and i truly mean try out and not quieting after an hour) it can be a beautiful Fiesta world again.So as it stands now, i wont say this game is great, but if to many people will give this an F there wont be a chance that new players would try out this game, so it will be an endles loop of an empty world.If you want to try out the game, I wont stop you, its free after all, but remember that you will feel isolated untill more new players will come.

												An instant option to allow the game to run into windowed would be great. As it is right now, I can't even play this game on my notebook.I remember the first day I ever got my hands on Fiesta. It was a great experience. I played this well into the night, and kept me busy for many hours during the day when I had nothing to do.I'd like to experience those times again.So please, if it' not too much to ask, could you implement an options menu that allows you to choose the game window resolution before launching the game? Or maybe even in-game so I can see what I'm doing?  "

												I've been playing this game for ages outside of steam, and while there were many times where I had left and deleted the game I always seemed to come back. Sadly, steam downloads the Europe version for me which, to my experiences, is mostly empty. The North American version is a lot busier. Fiesta Online has lost what made me come back, and that what they lost was the friendly community. This sort of started happening once Gamigo took over from Outspark (while I am sure they are trying their best; many players may have left because of the new company without giving it that much of a try). Friends were actually very easily made, especially through things like the Kingdom Quests. But now nobody enters those anymore, and to my opinion those things made the game fun. Now the main city is mostly filled with shops and people that very obviously spend a lot of money in the online store. While I have loved this game for many years, I don't think I will be coming back now. However, I would still recommend this game, as the community may still change.			"

												The game was great back in the day, huge community, i mean seriously huge, you would have trouble doing lvl 1 quests because all the monsters would be dead cause there was about 20 other people doing the same thing. Party for any quest, KQ(Kingdong Quest) was almos always full, form A to Z you would always have people in them. Now its DEAD, community is i would say about 10% of what it used to be, people are still really friendly and nice, but most of them are high lvls, get yourself to lvl60 to catch up at least a little bit. Sure the game is dated and the character creation is VERY limited( 4 hair colours, 3-4 hair styles...and so on), but this game had spirit, i would spend hours on this game every day. Its a shame it died, nows its just a rotten carcass laying there barely an image of what it used to be. *le cry*			"

												I started to play this game in 2008.This is one of my favourite games  and i cant stop playing and returning to it.Yes, there are many changes now if we compare to back then when Outspark was the publisher.When Gamigo came they probably failed a bit becouse Fiesta lost a lot of players.I have played this game so many hours ( not talking for the 40 hours on steam) and i still know about 40-50% of the game! Let me  make it easier for you guys to understand: PROS:-6 classes to choose from ( crusader is the class that u can play if u have a lvl60  character) -They added a lot of quests and increased the exp so its easier to lvl up ( just in the early levels 1-60/ depends on how hardcore you play)-almost all the time you get addicted and this is one of these games where you lvl up just  before you go to bed and you say to yourself "" why not another level""-There are different builds for your character( for example if you are a fighter you can go tank or dmg dealer with high crit ratio )-The community is the best.Just join a guild acadamy and make friends.Almost everyone will help you with anything if you need a hand.Also some people will give you the gear you need for free.-There are many instances and dungeons to go in and play with your friends.-Good news are that recently Gamigo got the rights of the development of the game ,so they now make the game literaly(expecting new patches with lots of new stuff)-A lot stuff to do..Now the bad part! Cons:-Altho' there are many quests they get a little bit boring becouse they are almost the same everytime(kill that,get this).-If you decide to play alone it is often boring,but ofc thats your choice.-The community of players has decreased,so its a little bit hard to find lots of players in different levels(Dont worry this is easily fixable,just add to friends people who you find playing with interesting and are the same level as you)-Almost no use of KQ( kingdom quests) becouse no one joins most of them. ( dont worry you dont need the in my oppinion becouse you still level up fast and good in the early stages ...think of them like a bonus )Basically thats all i can say.People love and hate this game but i just cant.Despite the fact that there are fewer people i still enjoy to play,chat with my guild and do quests and dungeons with friends! In the end you should atleast try it or even better- try it with friends!Have a wonderful time playing Fiesta!   "
