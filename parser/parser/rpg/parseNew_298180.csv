												This has easily become one of my favorite games. A good story told over the course of Metroid/Megaman-esque overworld gameplay, zelda-esque mini dungeons & seizure inducing RPG boss battles. This has been one of the few games I've purchased and did not feel disappointment with in years.Update: This game is free now. PLAY IT.			"

												Yes, Freddy. You're good at what you do and you have an enormous fan-following. But I think I'm gonna step aside for a sec and admire Scott's lesser appreciated work, and a game which has quickly become one of my favourite games of all time.Sadly, I cannot remember if I came across this game by browsing ""Games under £4"" or if I only heard about it through Five Nights at Freddy's. But I'm so glad I found this game either way.So what's the thingy happening, then? Well, you play as the re-programmed CPU of a video game controlling the body of a feisty coffee-pot with legs. You're stranded in a space station an unknown distance from Earth with 4 (once 5) super-computer robots who are trying to find a way to perfectly colonize distant planets for humans. Viruses are starting to take their toll on the simulations and the space station is on it's last shred of power, so it's up to you (and the AI of the coffee-pot) to gather as much resources as you can to take out the viruses before they ruin the mission.Just like FNaF, this is a really original concept.The gameplay is broken up into several segments, all being from different genres of games, and you're constantly under a time limit; something you don't see in a lot of games. It's very reminiscent of Majora's Mask, in a way. This kind of gameplay mechanic would work in so many games which ignore it, like all the games where a big event is about to happen, but you could do a lap of the world before it even begins.Some may argue that the gameplay gets very repetitive after a short while, and I'll admit there are a few places that get rather tedious, but fortunately it's much more engaging than FNaF. Also, just like FNaF, it's feels amazing to beat the game because of how much work goes into it.And as for Scott's signature art-style, this game is gorgeous! Scott captures the creativity, the vision and the desires of the Derelicts perfectly in their simulations. And as for the space station and surrounding area, it's awe-inspiring how lonely it feels. Don't even get me started on how good the soundtrack is.You get all this, and a ton of depth and story, for just £3.99. It's a longer game than the Freddy Trilogy as a whole, and it's perfect for what it's trying to acomplish. I just finished this game clocking in 7 hours of gameplay and I can't wait to play it again.

												For such an addictive and unique game, I fail to see the reason why I should not recommend this to other people, especially for other RPGers looking to taste a new ""flare"" from the genre.Pros:-The combat system is unique and enjoyably fast-paced.-Memorable characters, riding within a very compelling story.-An atmosphere that isn't exactly ""spectacular"", but the vibe it gives off just makes you stop and think: ""Woah, this looks pretty obscure. (In a good way)""Cons:-Gameplay may get repetitive, especially since a huge portion of it is basically a collectathon.-A part of the game's world has your character walking really slow. (While this issue isn't necessarily bothersome to all, it *may* drain your interest as the game progresses)-Lack of tutorials and intros for the mechanics which will lead you to experiment, not in a fun way. (According to a comment on this review, there's a manual in the game directory, but who reads a manual before playing a game anymore anyways?)The Desolate Hope isn't perfect, the game may ""lag"" and/or freeze in a millisecond (I don't know if it's my PC, but I've tried it on another PC and it still has that issue). Other than the lag, the game is basically a work of art; eerie, different, and reminiscent of ""computer personality"" sci-fi tropes.The game is also a ""hybrid"" with its genre, though as it stands, I perceive it more as an ""RPG"" with ""Platforming"" elements, than an essentially ""hybrid"" game.Score: Walking Coffee Maker out of Decaf CoffeeThe game is fine and enjoyable. I just have a feeling that it could be better than what it is.The game gets repetitive, but at the same time addictive.Overall, the game is good and it's on my list of ""favorite unappreciated games.""P.S.: Even though it's free now, it's still the best $5 I've ever spent.

												I am less than affluent (i.e. broke), therefore I will wait for anything and everything I want to play to go on sale.  Yes, even already cheap, obscure indie titles go on my wishlist until I see old man Steam is having one of his episodes and will trade me games for the unnamed contents of my pockets.  It also doesn't help that the obscure titles are less reliable in their overall ratings, so that I find myself owning games that give Steam refunds their raison d'etre.  The Desolate Hope, however, is not one of these.  The Desolate Hope is a game that, after playing it, I felt guilty for not kicking a couple bucks to before it became free.  To wish I had paid money for a thing I got for free is easily the highest praise a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like me can give.Alright, so what is The Desolate Hope?  Every time I try to explain its premise to someone, I come off sounding like a kid that's upended a forty of Pixy Stix.  So here goes:Imagine that you are playing as Minesweeper.  No, not playing Minesweeper.  You are the computer program, Minesweeper.  You came preinstalled and have been idling in memory for someone to enjoy your frustrating trial-and-error gameplay.  Finally, you are activated; not by an eager player, but by a greater intelligence, the likes of which you can barely begin to circumscribe with your puny Minesweeper brain:  the AI for a robotic coffee pot.Your new coffee pot overlord has downloaded you into its body, while it oversees the vital functions of the space base you both occupy.  Your mission is to explore the base (long abandoned by humanity), gain the trust of several derelict robots that were once in charge of terraforming the planet, and seek out and eliminate a virus stealing data from the simulations they are running.  And you must do all of this before the station runs out of power in only a few days time.During the day, you will explore the Derelicts' dream worlds, the visualization of their efforts to build a home for humanity: their simulations.  At night, you will roam the barren wasteland of the forgotten planet the base rests on, looking for lost artifacts of humanity to offer up to the Derelicts so that they might offer their help to fight the virus.You will face challenges that lesser coffee pots would buckle before and uncover the hidden secrets of the base, for all is not as it seems.  Also, there's a magic wrench and a spider named Sigfried.Truly, a tale as old as time.The visual aesthetic is quite impressive. Though it does have that Sega CD/Saturn era pre-rendered style that looks kind of old and janky now, I hadn't realized that I do have some nostalgia for that. Regardless, the character models and environments in the simulations are very imaginative.  The Derelicts and viruses appear almost like something out of Aztec or Hindu mythology; towering over their private realms that are certainly science fiction, but have a magical feel about them.  But it wasn't until I was walking on the planet's surface as a tiny, lone silhouette against the void of space that it really hit me what a beautiful game this is.Of course, you want to talk gameplay.  Like the premise, it's hard to describe the gameplay without sounding like I'm vomiting up the product of a the orgy between a big pile of ideas (eww).  I have a feeling the game design document reads something like this:""Yo dawg, I heard you like video games.  So we put some video games in your video game so you can play video games while you game.""Outside the simulations, the game is at its most reserved.  Your coffee pot body is exceptional in that it can move around.  But that's all.  At this level, the game is an adventure game where you explore and collect items... and play Space Invaders at certain times, but that's neither here nor there.Inside of the simulations, you are playing a free-roaming platformer where you can jump and shoot energy blasts and other such feats of percolation heretofore unknown to coffee pots.  You can dive into sub-simulations where the game becomes a top down vector-based shooter where you kill enemies to gain cabbages.  Makes sense? What if I told you a vector rabbit follows you around and translates them into free memory you can use to upgrade yourself?When you locate the virus, the screen swirls into a disco wonderland and the game becomes real-time JRPG style  combat where you control the four Derelicts against the virus.  And if that wasn't enough, we can go one deeper.  Within the real-time JRPG combats, one of the best moves for each Derelict is to call up a mini-game (each of the four gets a different one and you can have them all running simultaneously) that you can play to get buffs.Some would say that sounds schizophrenic.  Normally, I'd agree, but the Deolate Hope manages to take these disparate gameplay styles and use them to inform, further, and juxtapose the others.  It creates complexity, where I would label something else randomness.Your lonely sojourns on the planet's surface are quiet, somber, and low on action.  It gives the player a break from the intensity of the platforming and RPG combat while also giving us a stark ""real"" world to stand against the fantastic dreamscapes of the Derelicts and the psychedelic fury of the RPG segments.  And ""leveling-up"" the Derelicts is a matter of earning their trust so they will dedicate more system resources to your task.Gathering free memory in the sub-simulations will allow you to purchase upgrades from vendors you find by exploring the main simulations.   And these upgrades and other power-ups you find are your ticket to success in the menu-driven battles against the virus.  You will need to gather every resource and have a full understanding of all systems to have any hope of success when suing the 1% - err, defeating the late game bossesUnlike some computer RPGs where combat is a placeholder for action until the boss fights, The Desolate Hope's RPG combat is fixture of strategy and challenge.  You will need to master buffs, debuffs, status effects, running mini-games, storing points, using hack items, and a slew of other systems before taking on the later bosses.In fact, this is one of the few complaints I have.  I do love that I'm being challenged, when other titles in the genre often don't.  However, there is so much going on in these RPG segments that are the center pieces of the game and no explanation to guide you through them.  It becomes overwhelming.  I felt like an outsider taking a journey to the depths of superhero fandom message boards: just one incomprehensible wall of text describing powers and systems and the interconnectedness of it all that made me want to back out slowly and cry.Here's a tip: you won't figure it out for yourself.  Go get a guide.  There's a lovely one in the Steam Community pages.My only other criticism is that the game is badly lacking in polish.  It's clear that this is Scott Cawthon's early work and there are some things missing that I expect in a paid release.  The game doesn't adjust itself to suit my native resolation, but rather resets my resolution to make itself fullscreen.  And there's no volume control or pause button.  Pressing escape just instantly closes the entire game.  You get the idea.Still, I obviously really like The Desolate Hope and would have been almost as enthusiastic if I had paid.  There's nothing game-breaking missing, though it would have been nice to see this one get just a little bit more love before being published.Ultimately, The Desolate Hope is unique, compelling, fun, and free.  So why aren't you playing it?P.S. If you know or are Scott Cawthon, please tell him I will play Five Nights at Freddy's even though I don't like resource management or jump scares.  But I would like him to make another big sci-fi cluster♥♥♥♥ of whimsical ideas and gameplay.			"

												Though Scott Cawthon is known for making Five Nights at Freddys, it isn't the only gem he has made as The Desolate Hope is another piece of work that is as good as FNAF. Best way to describeThe Desolate Hope is Megaman/Metroid meets the timed battle system you would find in a JRPG, complete with nice looking pre-rendered backgrounds and characters. Bought the game after seeing it was on sale. Needless to say, it was worth the $1.24 spent on it. Most of the time, you'll be controlling an autonomous coffee-pot, entering the simulations of AI's in the day, and the surface of a planet at night. Within the simulations, the gameplay centers on the likes similar to Metroid and Megaman, jumping over pits and shooting bad guys. When it comes to fighting bosses however, control switches to the four AI's, switching perspective towards that of a JRPG like Final Fantasy VII. Combat as the AI's at first will seem a bit intimidating at first but once you understand each moves the AI's have, you can try to steer the odds to your end, so as long as you pick the right skills. Levelling up the AI's is also rather simple as the night segments as the coffee pot lets you find certain items to give to the AI's, allowing them to level up as opposed to the grinding you'd find in other RPG's. Though Scott Cawthon's fame may lie with Five Nights at Freddys, The Desolate Hope is another gem of Cawthon's work, one that is good mixture a platforming, turn-based fights, and artistic design.tl;dr The Desolate Hope is a gem from Cawthon like FNAF, but instead of evil animatronics, it's platforming, turn-based fights like FFVII, and nice pre-rendered scenery.

												It's kind of a JRPG/Platformer hybrid with metroidvania elements.You control a coffee machine on an outpost on a distant planet that's inhabited by 4 large robots that are supposed to run simulations and figure out ways for colonizing the planet, but a virus is interfering with the project and it's your task to enter each robot's simulation and defeat the virus.The game is split in two sections: Day and night.The main part happens during the day. Here you enter the simulations, which are the platforner/metroidvania segments. You jump around, shoot enemies and collect stuff. You can also enter system panels to close security holes the virus may use. The game then switches to a zelda-ish style with topdown view and each screen representing a room with enemies in it.Throughout all this you collect system resources you can spend on various upgrades.During the night you just go outside the base, walk around the barren surface of the planet and collect items that you can give to the robots which will increase their levels.All that leads up to the battles against the virus, which are semi-turn based battles akin to common JRPGS, but the battle system also has it's own unique twists and turns. These battles are the center of the gameplay, as nearly everything you do is to prepare for them. They can get a bit frustrating towards the end because of some pretty nasty enemy abilities, but overall they are fun and challenging and I didn't need to do any grinding to get through them (not counting the night segments, which are basically just that... plus a little bonus :P) The art and music are amazing, and I really enjoyed the story. The gameplay is fluent, but in itself nothing too special. Basic platforming for the most part, but the JRPG battles really stick out though. The only other thing worth mentioning might be that the game is relatively short. I got through it in 6 hours. I *might* do a second run to get those 200% (only had 168% this time), but there doesn't seem to be any major replayability. So if you want something epic, don't look here. If you want a really nice, atmospheric and uniqe sci-fi short story, get this.			"

												Game is separated into distinct parts where the gameplay is different. There's the platforming to navigate the world,  4-direction top-down shooter in a mini-game to get unlock upgrades, and real-time turn-based hybrid RPG-like combat as boss fights. The platforming and the shooting are simple while the boss fights can pose a challenge and look intimidating, but there's a reasonable learning curve from the first boss to the end of the game.There's no restriction or linearity to dictate where and when to progress; so, some trial and error to find which boss is the party as is, is equipped and upgraded enough to handle.Aside from the aspects of gameplay, The Desolate Hope strays a bit from the standard with user interaction. Pausing is bound to unconventional keys (F2 or ALT) [while ESC immediately closes the game]. The manual makes no mention of this; minor-ish issue, but more significant than usual as the game is under a time limit, ticking down in most areas of the game.  Misc. Info   Bought At Full price ($4.99)   Expectations My first exposure to the game was a YouTube video demonstrating a boss fight. Though I think the boss fights are very entertaining (but leaning to the same strategy of applying all party buffs and chaining high damage moves), replaying encounters is limited to the two final bosses for a save.   Steam Features Steam Overlay doesn't work with the game, which means taking screenshots and broadcasting must be done by other applications.  "

												Five Nights at Freddy's, feel free to remove yourself from the spotlight.Welcome to The Desolate Hope. I've only played .8 hours at the time that I'm writing this, but from what I've played so far, this game is amazing. Its varied visuals allure the player into the many themes that this game has running through it. The simulation mechanics reminiscient of Inception fit perfectly into the game, allowing it to flow smoothly. The FNAF-like aspects of the game are just enough to make the player think about the game in a deeper sense, rather than making them feel like Scott just copy/pasted a bunch of stuff. The amount of these aspects also prohibits MatPat and nine year olds on reddit from getting in a big screamfest over how the two games exist in the same universe. Cause they don't. (Sorry MatPat, you're still awesome.) The story and diolouge of the game causes you to think, rather than just rushing through it. Also the soundtrack is so good, you might even play the game just for that. Which I don't recommend. Cause this game is awesome. And you play as a coffeepot. No other comment needed. I've encountered a few minor bugs, but nothing game-breaking. Other than that, I deeply recommend this game. 10/10Update: Don't get me wrong, I still love fnaf. But this game is definitely better; it's a work of art.			"

												What is the world going toooooo ;w;How can a game about ""Techno epilepsy flash party omg what the fudge is going on so many colors and stuff happening on the screen"" Robots be so depressing. It's so weird and yet so compelling and enticing, showing you so much bizaare things and concepts. The main reason why I think I like it... it is dripping with athmosphere, showing you a small robutt ecosystem with the simple task of fending of some viruses... and it slowly turns into a desperate struggle against slow, but almost unstoppable decay. It might be just me, but I quickly learned to love the 4 Robutts/Derelects, which are all simulating their own vision of colonizing the planet. They all followed a unique path, which suited them best... but despite being machines, showing a lot of personality, avoking emotions.  Malenz, probably my favourite as the spider rowbutt. Tried his hardest to build a world with very ambitious methods, probably way too much. I think the fight with the viruses and the certain failure of his simulation made him retreat into his own little world... almost like a child with toys. At the beginning nice and friendly, thanking for your efforts to help, even if he doesn't think you will succeed. And slowly becoming more and more depressive... isolative... in the end not even bothering anymore to talk with you... just sad... retreating in a dreamworld to forget about his drawing closer demise... Denial	  Mirad, dunno about her, but probably the least interresting D: She still very cool. Store supporter in combat, which probably is the most unique way of a role in a RPG like combat system. Always so uncertain about the purpose of life... probably their creators/humans have destroyed themselves and that is the reason they have been abandoned. Even philosphing about people... maybe even machines having spirits. She accepted her upcoming death already and even shows understanding for the viruses actions... maybe its a living thing too that craves something.  Alphus! Hah! He is kinda the big bro... always happy to see you and very talkative. He thanks you for the most neglectable things and takes his mission very serious. He is the only one of the Robutts, that suck to the original purpose of the simulations and created a world, suitable for humans to live in... protected in big biodomes. I think he cares for everything else more than for himself... explaining why he asks you to stop bringing yourself in danger with fighting the viruses... and try to make use of the little time left.  Bio Beta... he got so close to finding out what was going on... secretly afraid of death, he tried to escape his form of an now immoblie simulation computer and ascent up to the next level... becoming human? Well... a sentinent being with a real body... either organic or machinistic... but he failed to either transfer functioning intelligence into a new body or creating new... something was always missing. He knows that something was going on behind the scenes, that nothing was as it seemed... asking you to investigate... before his time was running out as well. The fact that the game kept me guessing for the story and the twist the entire game was baffling... usually most modern games love to resort to the same old thropes. I guess this one has an standard thrope as well, but I didn't got behind it till short before the end. You get clues here and there, but they could point to multiple possible solutions.I am merely trying to process my troubled mind in the end... the game left me empty.I rarely ever cry from media or games, but this one hit me quite hard.Just the ending... yeah... not really what I was hoping or expecting... very very unfortunate the game didn't just stop at the words ""The End""			"

												This game is FREE. It's also an important game to see the kind of work Scott Cawthon is capable of. Don't skip past the dialogue too quickly, and DO take a moment to talk to those minor background NPC's at least once as you move through levels. Find a useful guide, particularly the one by Viddaric which I will link below, to help you figure certain things out. A big tip involves: go out at night, pick up and turn in your six total rewards for the night as quickly as you can, then walk left as far as you can to get the wrench! I think this game is useful for people who are interested in the medium of video games so that they know a little more about the background and capabilities of Scott, whose FNAF games can be a common topic in video game discussions. Link to Viddaric's helpful guide.

												The first trailor doesn't make it obvious, but The Desolate Hope is a semi-real-time RPG, similar to Final Fantasy games before the tenth one.  The trailor makes it out to be a sidescrolling platformer, but the sidescrolling shooter/platformer part is just the overworld.In TDH, there are no random encounters.  The regular overworld goons can just be shot by the Coffee robot.  The JRPG stuff comes from just 16 difficult, fast-paced, and strategy heavy bossfights.  During a battle, the player has to coordinate four slightly paranoid, hyper-intelligent AIs against a virus which the player is trying to purge from the four AIs shared network.Also, the story is really great, and the visual style is ridiculous.

												I feel like I should give an honest review on this game... Ok, this game has lots of action in it, day/night cycles, and it FEELS like Mega Man, but with more story and RPG elements, and that's what makes it fun for me! It's free as well, so you can also experience this masterpiece that we have here! In this game, you play as a coffee machine, but he plays an important role, and there are four (five?) derelicts that will help you try to destroy and wipe out each and every virus in each simulation. Scott Cawthon may have a lot of popularity just because of FNaF, but I feel that The Desolate Hope is very underrated. Though the bad part about it would be that it doesn't cost money, and I want to support the developer with as much money as he needs, because he made this all by himself, and that gives me hope to know that games can be good, even if developed by one person. Scott Cawthon, you have earned all of my respect. Thank you.			"

												You play as an AI uploaded into a walking coffeemaker, who then cooperates with a bunch of robots that are infected by viruses and everything takes place on a nameless, uninhabited planet far away from Earth. And unlike my other reviews I'm actually serious. The game is pretty good and the graphics are very surreal. It's quite short and sometimes tedious, but I loved every single minute of it.			"

												What you have here is: A Metroidvania / Active-Time-Battle RPG / adventure / action-adventure / minigame-a-thon game with BEAUTIFUL prerendered backgrounds and models. The ""real world"" consists of walking between 6 rooms and the outside landscape in order to get to different levels or collect earth memorabilia in order to level up your RPG party members. Going into one of the party members simulation worlds plays like a metroid or megaman game, one of the easiest ways to earn chips (spent on power ups for both metroid-mode and the RPG battles) is by entering a sub-simulation that plays like the original Zelda. Boss Battles are in the style of Turn Based RPGs that use an Active Time Battle such as Final Fantasy 7 or 8, where certain abilities and power ups come in the form of minigames like space invaders or a rudimentary RPG.Yeah, it really sounds like a cluster♥♥♥♥, but it just plain works.

												I seriously feel sorry for epileptics. Also this game is REALLY hard to get into due to a distinct absence of instructions, so be prepared to learn things the hard way.This game is divided into four systems of gameplay. A megaman-style platformer where you manuever your character through a field of enemies that you shoot down with one button, a feverish JRPG with nineteen encounters which you'll probably redo several times as you learn how to fight, a simplistic dungeon crawler where you shoot wireframe enemies with beepy boopy bullets and get cash, and a walk across a serene, pitch-black landscape with a starry sky and a smoldering moon rising in the sky as you look for items to upgrade your party and extend the time you have to complete the game.Oh, did I mention this game is fast?The entire game took me eight hours of play, though I don't think I could have completed it without the extra time that was given due to finding power cells in the night. You have but a fortnight to complete your mission of purging the station of the virus that inhabits it. You play as an impromptu antivirus software controlling the body of the coffee machine who's AI awoke you from dormancy, and due to the fact that the act of running a game takes an ungodly number of commands and resources, you overwhelm the virus easily using digital representations of the four robots that act as supercomputers on the space station. The night is when you go out and search for gifts to give them, so that they give you more of their power during battle. Each robot, known as derelicts, has a unique set of skills in battle, and all of them are essential to your survival and success. This is where the main draw of the game comes in. During these short seventeen battles, you will need to use every skill that your team has to bolster your defenses and overwhelm the ♥♥♥♥ out of your enemy until they crumble before your prowess. Combat encounters are modified by contingencies you obtain by completing the dungeon crawler segments; activating commands upon certain conditions in the battle being met such as stunning the enemy whenever points are scored in a minigame that each of the four derelicts can activate, or even having these minigames play themselves when they launch. During the megaman-ish platformer, defeated enemies drop powerups that will contribute stat bonuses during battle as a vital headstart. Pretty much everything you do outside of battle contributes to your party's performance, which is great, and it's actually quite hard to genuinely waste time unless you're idling, due ot the sheer number of upgrades you can find in each mode. Platformer mode is also how you buy upgrades, some of which will contribute to your performance in that mode, as well. These upgrades to your presence in this state are also simple, but I feel they're enough to make you feel like you're still getting somewhere, and getting stronger as you go.Unfortunately I can't think of a way to talk about the story without giving anything away. It's about a good number of things, pertaining to existencialism and spiritualism, the meaning and sanctity of life. Fortunately, despite the author being christian, I feel that he managed to make his viewpoint independent of religion, barring the ending. And the ending wasn't even bad, I feel it was a logical conclusion to everything that was building up, at the same time managing to still be surprising. Nobody is the villain here, because they all give you their own, valid reasons for how they're doing what they're doing.I know the way I described the story is vaugue, but if you can't play the game, you could easily find a transcript of what everyone says online.8/10 you play a coffee pot on an existencial journey through other robot's imaginations.

												Essentially two games in one, The Desolate Hope combines familiar gameplay elements from vastly different genres to create something greater than the whole of its parts. While clunky at times, it feels refreshingly creative despite doing little new. Normal levels play out like a simple sidescrolling platformer where you collect resources and unlock & upgrade abilities. Every map has one boss that you have to beat four times; although it sounds tedious, they mix things up by moving the boss entrance around the map and drastically increasing the difficulty of boss tiers (which essentially forcing you to play through other levels and then backtrack). This helps breaks up the flow and promotes exploration, instead of just steamrolling through the maps one at a time. The bosses that you are preparing for during the platforming segments are the crux of the gameplay; it is really refreshing to look forward to a boss battle in a western game. These play out like JRPG battles, with your party of AIs on the right throwing their ""spells"" at the boss on the left. It took me a while to get used to it because its very fast and click-happy, with bosses often acting faster than your whole party can. Eventually the combat gets so fast that you have to use special abilities to automate certain functions (trying to avoid spoilers here!). Herein lies my biggest complaint because once the combat gets truly challenging and gives you all your tools & toys, the game just plays itself. While I really enjoyed this game, I don't see it getting a sequel anytime soon considering how it ends. Hopefully once the devs are done milking FNAF we will get a spiritual successor because The Desolate Hope is a very creative and colorful take on a futuristic apocalypse.			"

												This game has a lot of charm and feels like a relic of 90's western PC games. It has fantastic music, and fantastic gameplay elements that all mesh together, from platforming to RPG action.Unfortunately, it also runs like a relic from the 90's; there's no other settings other than making the game take over full screen and changing resolution, even disabling Windows Aero. There's even no pause as well, which seems terrible, given how pressed for time the game will put on you. And to top it off, pressing the Esc key will close the game. If only the game was built a little better, this would be perfect.But if you want to have fun for manner hours besides that, this is the game for you, at such a very reasonable price.			"

												I honestly have mixed feelings about this game.While I ADORE the graphics, soundtrack and story, the gameplay is kinda on the, well, unlikeable side.The platforming is slow and the controls are confusing. The boss battles are fun, but the thing is, since you can play the levels in any order you want, you can go up against a boss way too strong for you and die instantly, not to mention there's a lot of grinding and looking for money. Sooooo...Recommended for people who are more interested in a game's story, not recommended to people who are more interested in a game's gameplay.			"

												I walk around outside the space station at night, my coffeemaker robot silouetted against a starry sky. A somber tune plays. I'm looking for items. No platforming in this area. Just left and right to move and down to interact with a sparkle on the ground. Suddenly, the game turns into space invaders. Green aliens appear above me and the game prompts me to press ""x"" to shoot them down. Why? Why here? I don't know. It just happens randomly. I feel like this scenario sums up my experience with The Desolate Hope fairly well. The items I'm searching for are given to other robots. Our cause is to destroy a virus that plagues our space station. These robots are extremely intelligent and were designed to simulate human life on this unnamed planet. It makes sense that they each robot fondly collects particular human items given their mission. One hoards clocks, another stashes paintings. They ""devote more of their resources to the cause"" the more you give them objects they like -- in other words, they level up. I like games that bewilder me. I like games that are surreal. Why am I a coffeemaker? I don't know why I'm a coffeemaker. With a full coffee pot, at that. Coffee sloshes around in your pot with each step you take. You'd think such a fragile thing would make a poor protagonist in the platformer parts of the game, what with enemies shooting at you, but I guess it's made of reinforced glass. There's platforming, RPG battles, and more. Take the ATB system from Final Fantasy games and inject it with steroids. That's exactly what you get during the RPG virus battles. They're probably the most frantic, explosive turn-based battles I've ever played. It's hard to really grasp what's going on at times, but I found myself doing well enough to win most of the time. The game isn't harsh if you fail; it simply kicks you out of the simulation you were battling in.The game is somewhat dragged down by the lack of an options menu, long loading times, and choppy gameplay during the RPG bits of the game. The thing that I find most baffling is that the escape key exits the game completely. It's such a standard way to pause computer games that I accidently exited out of the game twice. As far as I can tell, there's no way to pause the game.Do the game's wildly disparate gameplay types coalesce well? Probably not. But I think the ""throw things at a wall and see what sticks"" approach works for this particular game. I definitely recommend the game if you want something unique and with good character and environmental design. The platforming aspect of the game is pretty standard, but the rest of it is not.			"

												The Desolate Hope at first glance will seem like a very strange game, but after playing through it for a bit the game really shows how much of a gem it really is. You play as a coffee pot tasked with removing a virus from 4 robot's internal systems in order to keep the station running. While inside the robot's programming/system the gameplay functions as a platformer while you look for the virus to fight. The platforming is pretty fun giving you plenty of mobility allowing you to explore the numerous environments. When you encounter the virus the game changes to a rpg style real time turn based fighting system. The boss fights are super fun and very fast paced which can be great and enjoyable, or very deadly if you are not paying attention. There is a time limit represented by a day/night cycle which does add some tension, but more time can be added on during the night cycle if you find battery packs. The night cylce is when you can leave the hub world and search for items to level up the robots which are the memebers of your party during boss fights. One of my favorite aspects of this game are the graphics, the robots look great and really look intimidating while also looking somewhat cartooney. The Desolate hope is a great game that you can enjoy even if you dont like the five nights at freddys games, and the best part? Its FREE.			"

												First I was thinking that it's another production so weak to give it for free. But not this one.Game with RPG and little metroidvania elements.Story takes place on cosmic station in middle of nowhere (kind of asteroid). Coffee robot writes a program and gives it his own body (walking coffee machine ;p) to deal with strange virus which is attacking station and its residents (other robots). And here story begins. Why station was built? What are its residents and what are they doing there? What is the virus and how it got to the station system? Why it continues to steal certain data? And what is real purpose of your existance? This is a mystery you're gonna solve during gameplay.			"

I just don't know why Scott is following the FNAF Saga and not this. I know it had a prequel that was destructingly criticized, but he now has a good amount of money, enough to do other game of the THD Saga. But none of this is really important.

												An odd 2D, or turn-based RPG in an even more odd setting (a science fiction, real world-based one where you fight viruses, in this case), which sees you enter metroidvania type worlds with several stages and a boss at the end of each stage, through a melancholic, sad hub, in order to avert an incoming crisis which will affect you and the other characters. Also, the game doesn't let you save your progress at will, and instead auto saves most actions and forces you to deal with failure. Yes, it does sound like Demon's Souls, and while there are no gameplay similarities, I felt it was worth mentioning how similar the atmosphere and pacing of the game was; the difficulty, too. Even if I didn't consciously acknowledge it at the time thanks to all the differences in gameplay, the atmosphere, pacing and structure of the game are basically identical to Demon's Souls, and that similarity really drew me in, and might draw you in. Anyways, the gameplay is unique, in that there are three sorts of gameplay (and small Zelda 1 dungeon style mini-dungeons); the solemn management and searching of the hub world night time management, when you enter a robot's simulated world, with the ruleset of a metroidvania shooter, and when you enter a boss battle, where you go into a turn-based RPG battle where accumulated, I guess I'd say, 'stat tokens' which you've picked up in the metroidvania gameplay add to the stats of all your characters during the fight. I have to say that the story, pacing, atmosphere and enigmatic nature of the game drew me in at the start, but I think that the game escalates the difficulty carelessly. You get some fast-paced challenging fights early on, but the game quickly makes literally every RPG battle consist entirely of one-shot attacks very quickly, ruining the chance to have a more sensible difficulty curve, and also making some boss fights simply too unforgiving.I would have liked this game, but the boss fights feel far too difficult. Seriously, it feels like you have to do things perfectly to win some of the mid-game and late-game fights, and it feels like the sort of design that is only intuitive to the developer.In conclusion, I really, really wanted to love this game. The bleak atmosphere and story, the spectacular characterisations of the Derelicts (the robots), their virtual worlds, and their fall from grace, the surprisingly great, if odd and idiosyncratic presentation, set in a world where humans have already died out, the combination of several genres, the lack of hand holding, and the very compelling story. I just think that the game's too hard, and personally, I can't say whether I recommend this game or not. I think I recommend it, solely because I want a sequel to the game so badly; just, hopefully next time, the boss fights aren't so ridiculous, and the metroidvania areas slightly more distinguishable and less maze-like.

												The Desolate Hope is an excellent example of one of Scott Cawthon's previous works before the ever so popular, Five Nights at Freddy's.The game has an interesting sci-fi story with an interesting main character, a coffee pot. However, the story can be a little jumpy sometimes and you can easily get lost along the way.The battle system is confusingly layed out and seems like button mashing half the time and reminds me of an anime boss battle but nevertheless it's an enjoyable experience.The game is separated into two phases, day and night. They are timed pretty well and give you enough time to trek a whole simulation.The scenery is pleasant, Miradmoore being my personal favourite.This game is a great game for any kind of audience, especially those following Scott Cawthon's works.

												The Desolate Hope is a unique, non-traditional RPG that's really great. Sometimes. Okay, a large portion of the game is pretty meh (platforming, mundane fetch quests, and overhead adventure) but the RPG battles... They're absolutely insane. You have your standard buff/debuff/attack/defend/etc but then there's things like minigames you have to play during the battle that help you if you do well, by providing buffs, attacks, etc. On top of that, you can store different moves, such as attacks, heals, revives, and even one that auto-plays the minigames for you for later use upon click. I will say again, the other parts of the game are pretty... meh. They get less painful with upgrades, but the RPG battles are what makes this game memorable. (Also, avoid anything that talks about the meaning of the game until after you beat it if you plan on playing it. It ruined the story a bit for me, but other people may feel differently about it.)

			Full review of Scott Cawthon's The Desolate Hope. I am heavily biased towards the game because the main character is a mechanical coffee pot and I have an unhealthy addiction to hot, caffeinated dirt...		

There are few things I love more than a game striving to be something unique and succeding in that goal. While nowadays we know Scott Cawthon as the man behind the smash-hit, near pop-culture, Five Nights At Freddy's series one of his first releases was The Desolate Hope.The Desolate Hope is a multi-genre game about a space station with only artificial intelligences around. The station was originally planned to house humans but there was never any contact made to say the humans were coming. Years after the expedition was supposed to happen a lone coffee pot robot is in charge of eliminating a virus thats attacking the remaning robots.TDH is a very extreme game, some things are very good and some things are very bad. The platforming sequences are (for the most part) rather bland and unengaging, the only exciting level would be Betagrid 0.9 but even it suffers from some poor design. Miradmoore is the absolute bottom of the barrel however, being an underwater stage with extremely slow movedment and exploration. This is made worse by the game's world timer, making it very easy to be booted from Miradmoore before you finish what you set out to do. The dungeon crawling segements fare no better, being extremely basic, rather unenjoyable or worthwhile, and feel more like just time wastes.In contrast, the JRPG boss battles soar high above the other gameplay faults. The combat system in the JRPG segments is extremely innovate as it contextualizes the use of keyboard and mouse, not only that but it's frantic and fast paced with some of the game's very best music.The real king of the game is the graphical presentation, Scott Cawthon has a unique, if not signature, design to his games and its originality is breathtaking. Even the most basic of worthless enemies have such a flair of animation that it comes off as a wholely different type of video game experience. Sadly there are some graphical misteps along the way.The Desolate Hope does not get everything right. It's story could use a little more fleshing out, perhaps a bit more explination of some of the item shops, and maybe a bit better design of some gameplay segments. But when the game is good the game is golden, shining far past it's sometimes below-average moments and offering a very memorable experience.Pros:- Some of the most wonderful graphics you'll see- JRPG battles are innovative and amazing- Fun cast of characters with a pretty good story attached- Otherworldly atmosphereCons:- Platforming and Dungeon Crawling segments are below average- Some graphical missteps along the way- Occasional poor level design- Can be quite a sporadic game at times, your milage may varyFor a more in-depth look at The Desolate Hope, please watch my video review linked above.- Mr. u Suk			"

												Full review here: http://somecrapgamer.blogspot.com/2014/06/keurig-would-be-proud-desolate-hope.htmlTL;DR version: The Desolate Hope takes three different genres that you wouldn't expect to work together, and somehow manages to pull it off. It looks good, has an interesting story, and manages to be just long enough to do what it needs to without overstaying it's welcome. Definatly worth a playthrough.			"

												The Desolate Hope is a very unique mix of platformer and JRPG from the creator of Five Nights at Freddy's. It has a great aesthetic and an engaging science fiction premise. The game is relatively simple and provides for some decent challenge, and a fun story to playthrough that provides for some interesting contemplation afterwards.It's a fun and free game that is graphically better, and has a superior story than many pay to play games on the market.

												It's a weird game. It combines together a lot of novel game mechanics into an adventure platformer with interspersed JRPG battles. The art style and story is pretty cool. It kept me interested until the end. Quite impressive for a game made by one person. My total playtime was 3 hours.If you get this game, make sure to read the manual (it's in a .RTF file in the game directory). There are a lot of stats and buyable items that don't have an obvious purpose in-game, but a quick read of the manual will explain everything. "

												The Desolate Hope is a difficult game to both explain and recommend, but I fully recommend it. I only know of The Desolate Hope because of Cawthon's work, Five Nights At Freddy's. I didn't care for that, but I'm sincerely glad that it was made just so I was able to play this fantastic but flawed game.Flawed is even an understatement, it doesn't have a shortage of problems. The gameplay is split into 4 sections and 3 of them are boring to actively horrible. The levels are short and it takes only a few hours to explore them thoroughly. The game's progression is about grinding for currency to purchase every upgrade in the game - and every upgrade is needed.Gameplay sections in this game are neatly split into the following:• A ATB (Active Time Battle, think Final Fantasy VII) system used to combat a total of 17 enemies (18 if you count the training dummy)• Platforming levels used to navigate each Derelict's simulation and gain access to each of the battles, as well as purchase items from vendors hidden and not• Overhead battle arenas that are also hidden in the platforming levels to various degrees, but no less vital• A mandatory side-scrolling collection minigame in order to level-up your party membersComing to grips with each section requires experimentation and exploration. Unfortunately the game's own (largely forgiving but still present) time limit works against this, but without experimenting and trying new things constantly you can find yourself going around in circles unable to do jack squat.The ATB sections naturally steal the show, despite their relatively small amount of gametime compared to the other sections. There's a fantastic amount of depth, even taken on its own merit -  the buff/debuff based strategy means blitzing your way through the battles just isn't an option, and experimentation is forced to the point where I was coming up with cascading choices the likes of which I hadn't seen since Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey. Constant meter management lends the pressure needed to keep things hype, and the pacing between battles is ramped up perfectly - with the final boss requiring a ridiculous amount of strategy that incorporates everything that you've learned so far (and then some, it's a right ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥). Despite the game giving you every skill from the get-go, the pacing manages to thrive in spite of that, an impressive feat. The combat is just fantastically-designed overall. The rest of the gameplay is boring. Even actively bad at points. Platforming sections are simple scrolling events. There's no difficult or demanding platforming, no interesting or particularly varied enemy types, the movement itself feels slow and clunky with minimal animations and stop-n-go momentum. Even the upgrades that affect the platforming just alter it so you spend as little time as possible there.Overhead battle arenas are even worse. There's 3 enemy types, no interesting formations, and the mechanics themselves are horrible. More so if you don't find the hidden vendor. You shoot in the direction you're facing and move at the speed of a snail - it's not twinstick, it's not shmup, and it's not fun.Finally there's the collection minigame which isn't anything. Moving in the one direction and collecting token items.It's difficult to recommend this game because for most of it, you'll be slogging through one of those 3 terrible gameplay modes. You won't be coming to grips with the hectic, insanely indepth ATB system, you won't be admiring the fantastic art direction (which is the best art direction I've seen in an indie game, period), you won't even be stopping to admire the layered plot and the well-defined Derelicts, who make for interesting, distinct and likable characters. But if you're even slightly willing to force your way through those slow parts to get to the meaty core of this gem, then I wholeheartedly recommend you buy The Desolate Hope.			"

												I was going to buy this game 2 days ago and its free now for some reason. It would have been worth every penny but now there is no excuse not to try this game.its a platformer, top down shooter, real-time fast jRPG actiony game. The screenshots do NOT do the game justice. Its not even high-res and it looks fantastic. (running on a 60'' screen).I'm absoultely blown away that Scott Did this by himself? (Tried looking for credits but didn't find any until I beat the game I guess). The gameplay is fun, lots of exploration. Every upgade you find is useful, and progress you make is worth it.The ONLY problem I have is that it doesn't have gamepad support.			"

												Interesting, quirky little game that combines aspects from a few different genres.  At one point it felt like a strategy game, another it was a simple platformer, and at times it even provided a calming, relatively peaceful explorer.  It can take a while to figure out what's going on, but it's by no means a bad game.			"

												Great graphics, wild story, and immeasurably fun. The designs of the levels and characters are very creative with extreme attention to detail. Clearly inspired by great games like Metroid and Megaman. If you like those, you will not be disappointed. A small warning, however: this game does have flashing lights and the backgrounds are super detailed, making it a little difficult to make out what's going on sometimes, but the impact on gameplay is negligable.

I honestly didn't even realize Scott Cawthon made this game until I played Fnaf World and saw the little coffee robot and I was like ""Hey that's from Desolate Hope."" Now that I think back I don't know why I didn't realize he made this game I looked at the developer of this game when I got it. XD Still even now I love every bit of this game :)			"

												This is an interesting game.  It combines a platforming, dungeon-crawling, and active turn-based boss battles with an intrigueing art style.  The only aspect of the gameplay that I think was really great was the boss battles, with the platforming and dungeon-crawling sections being somewhat boring, but I still ended up really enjoying the game.  The music was also a high point.My biggest complaint was that I ended up needing to grind some towards the end to beat the penultimate boss, and grinding in this game is very boring, but luckily that didn't take too long.

												This is one of the best indie games I have ever played. It's the first original game I have seen in a long long time. Everything about it is unique, music, desgin, story, gameplay graphics, It's a real hidden gem. It has oldschool sequences, and awesome turn based battles. Everything you do makes your fighting stronger. The story and characters are thought provoking and interesting to boot. It's definately worth the $5.00 and I got it for less. The controls are a little weird but, nothing than you cant get used to.			"

												Still working on finishing the game at this time of writing this, on the home stretch currently.This is a curious little title, with unusual characters, setting, premise, among other things. You play as an AI from a video game system being repurposed for exterminating digital viruses, and you have a physical body on loan from a space station's coffee machine. The stated goal is to purge the viruses springing up in the simulations some of the robots on the planetary outpost/station which other AIs before you have generally failed. To do so, you need to work on numerous layers of your surroundings. As fair warning, this game really doesn't hold your hand, but does give you some room to experiment and learn what it is exactly that you need to do and how.As for genre, it's pretty hard to classify this as any single genre as it's a mashup of several, while not feeling particularly broken. There's meatspace (physical space, rather), where it's closest to an adventure title similar to King's Quest, in that you have direct control over a character with limited actions rather than click and point like, say, Monkey Island 1-3. In simulations, it's more of a platformer/shooter, to sum it up. When you get into the source code segments (I don't recall the exact explanation to what these are, though I'm sure the game mentions it somewhere early on) it's more adventure/shooter like the original Legend of Zelda. And when you fight bosses, it's sort of an Active Time Battle RPG but also upwards of 5 or 6 games going on at once, and this is where the game may be completely overwhelming while also being an amazing spectacle. It's almost beyond words to describe boss fights, I suppose the closest is what 80s movies predicted games in the 90's to be like? Either way, very unique, in a positive way. Character designs are also wonderful and range from beauty in simplicity to visually overwhelming and I love them all, honestly. The audio is pleasant and mostly appropriate for each area and segment, the game also does a great job of setting up just how grim the situation is without explicitly stating it.For criticisms, the game has pacing issues similar to a roller coaster, slow build up before going extremely fast until the bottom of the next hill. As for graphics, very subjective to whether folks will like them, I find em charming personally, but some may not enjoy the mid 90's-style pre-rendered sprites and animations akin to Donkey Kong Country. Difficulty for each part of game is also VERY drastically different, which can cause a little bit of whiplash. I apologize in advance if there is a manual that explains everything somewhere, but there's parts of the game and characters that feel as though there's probably context given in something extraneously, such as in a manual with a little blurb about the character and maybe backstory, but there's quite a few NPCs who seem to just be there with the only context being ""Hey, this NPC performs function X or sells Y or sells Z for a small fortune.""Overall, it's a rather unique experience and I'd suggest folks give it a fair shake. I've enjoyed what I've played thus far, and hope others enjoy it as well!			"

												The Desolate Hope is a turn-based RPG that bypasses leveling and grinding with platforming and adventuring. The main character is a coffee pot (seriously) and it explores the simulations of the four Derelicts to scout for powerups, purchase abilities and prepare them for fighting the virus that threatens their existance. The game feels right at home with DOS classics like Fallout and Space Quest, despite coming out over a decade after those titles. The pre-rendered graphics and fantastic synth soundtrack are both phenominal and lightweight, and the RPG battles are some of the most visually stunning things I've seen in gaming. It's a carefully orchestrated combination of elements that binds the game together beautifully.The guy who made this game also made The Pilgrim's Progress, Five Nights at Freddy's, and the instant classic Fart Hotel. So, I mean, he's covered a lot of ground.			"

												The Desolate Hope is a really neat underrated gem with a very unique plot and art style.I'm halfway through the game and I love it to death, but alas curiosity killed the cat and I read about the ending over the internet...Nonetheless I didn't expect a coffee pot to be able to have so much power and to do that kind of act just for sample 217.While the game is almost perfect it lacks into directing you to your objectives such as when you try to get to the fall dome, but you have to look around back at malwastes to get the hoverpack. Another little downgrade is having to repeat night processes and getting objects for the Derelicts.Otherwise the game is flawless and I hope to get to the ending soon, I would recommend this game to anyone that loves the FNaF art style and rpg and platform aspect of games.Major Pros-Soundtrack-Plot-Gameplay-Art-Mixed Genres-Coffee Pots "

												Before Scott Cawthon had everyone cowering in terror from creepy looking robot things, he had them assisting and being assisted by... creepy looking robot things. In The Desolate Hope, you are a computer program originally designed to run video games. Coffee, a walking, sentient coffee maker, activates you and explains that you are to take over his body and use it to fight off a virus that is attacking the simulations maintained by the other robots of Lun Infinus. Coffee would do so itself, but it's far too busy maintaining things and flagging the viruses for you. And with that, you're off on a very unique adventure.There are four working robots running simulations on Lun Infinus, and you will have to enter each one and defeat four viruses within. Do not be afraid. They may look intimidating and even dangerous as you enter their respective chambers, but they're all on your side, and they're all quite friendly. Their simulations, on the other hand, have gotten a little... weird. Originally sent out into space to run these simulations for five years, they've now gone thirty years without contact.The gameplay is rather varied. Although much of your time will be spent wandering and shooting. In reality, Coffee's body can't do much more than walk around and pick stuff up. You'll use the real world to walk between the robots' chambers and collect knick-knacks to give to the A.I.s within. Inside of the simulations, the game plays out as a sidescrolling jump-'n'-shoot game. You'll shoot enemies, find secrets, collect eggs which will help you against the virus boss fights, talk to things, and hunt for the viruses. You can find computer screens which will dump you into some sort of sub-simulation, an overhead wander-'n'-shoot game. Here you can collect resource chips (The Desolate Hope's currency) and destroy the rift-looking whatsit that's hidden away in one of the rooms to unlock a new conditional for later. Then you have the virus fights.The fights against the viruses are where the game really shines. These are flashy, fast-paced RPG battles. They are turn based, but with an active time system (think PlayStation-era Final Fantasy). Your party consists of the four A.I.s that you've been helping, each of whom has a unique set of skills. Every time one of their menus pops up, you can use one of these skills, or charge. What skills you have access to depends on that A.I.'s level of charge, and keeping them charged is an important part of the fight. The viruses get tougher as you go, and you'll need more tricks up your sleeve to see this game through.The A.I.s don't level up with experience. Instead, each trinket you bring back from your nightly expeditions outside will convince one to devote more of its resources to your cause, which is represented by the A.I. leveling up. You can purchase a variety of useful abilities from various robots within the simulations. And then you have those conditionals I mentioned. You can set one of a number of useful actions (healing, for instance) to occur when certain other events (like opening a mini game or getting a combo) occur within battles. The catch is, while you have the entire list of ""then""s from the get-go, you have to find and unlock the ""if""s yourself.So, let's talk quality. The review part of the review.The art in this game is really weird, but in a good way. You can tell it was created by the same guy who did 5 Nights at Freddy's. It's the way things are modeled and some of the textures, and it's also some of the weirdness and the robots. There's a giant robot in the background of one of the simulations that reminds me an awful lot of Freddy Fazbear. The way Coffee walks down the hallway of Lun Infinus seems like it probably directly inspired the shot of Foxy hauling♥♥♥♥♥down the hallway in the first 5NaF. The simulations all have different looks and feels to them. The sub-simulations look completely different from anything else, and the virus battles are flashy and remind me a bit of anime, only without the... y'know, anime. Even wandering outside at night is lovely and mysterious.A major contributing factor to that lovely mysteriousness is the gorgeous music. I can't give Scott credit with creating it, as he says he bought it all through a website called NEO Sounds. But I can absolutely credit Scott with taking the care and effort to find, purchase, and use the perfect tracks to complement each scene. I have no complaints about the music.The story is one that kept me paying attention. The core plot isn't overly complex, but it's presented well and supplemented with backstory and information about the world and A.I.s. As with everything else in this game, the story's got that air of mystery that draws you in.As for the gameplay, I like it. The jump and shoot sections aren't exactly Mega Man, but they're not boring and they offer exploration and an engaging way to get from point A to point B. The overhead sections are neat if you're just trying to find the rift thing and destroy it, but if you wind up grinding for resource chips the game becomes pretty boring. Good news is, you don't have to grind. Bad news is, intentionally or not, you're kind of encouraged to. See, the entire game operates on this day/night cycle, and the days and nights go by pretty darn quickly and you only have so many of them. You have plenty of ways to get resource chips as you go about your ordinary business, but the overhead sections are the only place where time doesn't pass (other than dialogue windows, I believe). Add to this the fact that you can buy the ability to earn resource chips even faster in these sections, and you'll probably decide it's easier to just grind for awhile rather than waste time.This brings me to the time limit itself. It does add an element of pressure to the game, which is nice. But you'll need to figure things out for yourself, you'll have no idea what order to fight which viruses in, and if you're like me, you might waste a couple days trying to explore simulations which are open to you, but which you can't actually do much in until you have the right items. That said, even if you do wander aimlessly for awhile, you will probably eventually hit a stride where you can take out two or three viruses a day, making up for lost time. I still wound up completing the game like six-ish days ahead of schedule. And I hear you can find items outside which will grant you extra days, once you start cutting it close.As I said before, though, the active RPG virus boss battles are where the game truly shines, and they'll be what you're striving for. Not the shooty bits, but the flashy, fast paced (the RPG battles are actually faster paced than the shooting sections, can you believe it?), try-to-even-begin-to-keep-track-of-all-this♥♥♥♥♥♥at-once-lol sections.With the sort of creepy but mostly cool art, the fitting audio, and the sweet battles, I recommend The Desolate Hope. I don't know if it's free forever, but it seems like it probably is. And free is more than generous for a quality game like this.			"

												Let's face it, this game has some flaws, balancing issues being the most prominent. Seriously, I was able to just mow over every boss in the game by simply unlocking all the conditionals and setting them all to stun the boss for one second. Except for one conditional, which I set to ""Charge Tweak"" the boss every ten seconds. However, when trying to play the game with a diverse set of conditionals, I found myself being constantly mowed over. So yeah, there are flaws.I will admit that there is a lot of room for forgiveness here because the game is completely free to play, no signup or anything. You simply download the game and play. I feel like I would probably still recommend this game to people if it cost money, but only if it didn't cost more than $5.So what exactly is ""The Desolate Hope""? It is a game made by Scott Cawthon, who is best known as the mastermind behind the ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" franchise. He made this game two years before the first FNaF was released, but it apparently didn't get onto Steam until 2014.This game is a blend of three different game genres: 2D platformer, top-down dungeon-crawler, and JRPG (kinda). You start in the ""real world"", then gain access to four different digital worlds to explore. The ""real world"" and the four digital worlds are the ""2D platformer"" part of the formula. While you are within these digital worlds, there are terminals scattered about that you can access. When you access them, you are dropped into a digital world within the digital world where you can farm for money and unlock conditionals for boss battles. This is the ""top-down dungeon-crawler"" part of the formula. After speaking to a respective digital world's Derelict, you can find and confront the boss in what is basically a JRPG-style battle, but without the turn-based element. This is the ""JRPG (kinda)"" part of the formula.Since I've only played through it once, I'm a bit unsure what I would have to say about the game in terms of replay value. While I'm not eager to jump right back in and play through it again, there isn't anything preventing me from playing it again.Also, let me just say that the demonstrational videos on the store page don't do the game's aesthetic justice. Seriously, this is actually a very pretty game. And that soundtrack! Tasty!The story is suprisingly engaging, regardless of the fact that you are kept in the dark about what is actually happening for pretty much the entire game, right up to the final boss. The ending is definitely interesting to say the least.So would I recommend it? Yes. I would definitely say this is something you should at least try. No money changing hands, no signup, nothing to make you regret downloading the game if you don't end up liking it.			"

												I wish there was an inbetweeen button to say 'maybe' I recommend this.  Rather than give you a giant wall of text like some reviewers, I'll try and sum it up as best I can:Pros:-Gorgeous:  Some of the visuals are absolutely stunning.-Fantastic soundtrack:  Worth a listen in or out of game.-Charm:  You're a damn coffee pot, man.  A COFFEE POT.-Novelty: This game is a platformer with a unique story and JRPG boss batles.  Wha-?Cons:-What the hell is this?: This game explains almost nothing. Most of the upgrades you can get have vague names that don't help you determine what they do or even what aspect of the game they help you with. I like games that don't hold your hand, but with the following problems (scroll down) this is almost intolerable.-GRINDY.  This is the worst part.  You must kill enemies in the platformer part of the game to collect colored eggs that help you in the JRPG battles.  Also, you must grind either in the simulations or in the terminals, going through the same enemies again and again in order to get bits for your VERY NECESSARY and OBTUSELY NAMED upgrades that you aren't even sure will help you because YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT THEY DO.TLDR: I found the game very charming at first with its visuals and good soundtrack...but the gameplay really brings it down.  If you find it enjoyable enough, however, there is enough there to keep you occupied for a while.  Your choice. Give it a shot and see for yourself.It is free afterall, and I would probably not recommend it otherwise.			"

												Yes, yes, we all by now have heard of Five Nights at Freddy's. That's honestly probably the reason we even know this game exists in the first place, thanks to update 2 of FNAF World. But that aside, I'm here to say something. Sure, Scott may be the overlord of FNAF, but he's more than that. He's a good man. He has so many other games that are really worth giving a try! Honestly, I like FNAF and all, but this game deserves some credit too. It's a great storyline upfront, much better than FNAF's (unless you take time to dig and figure out what the heck is going on. Then FNAF wins by a landslide) and I think that its truly a good game for what it is. All in all:I like it.Good job, Scott.Good job.			"

												I was eying this before it became free, some time around when it was first released. It seemed different.After getting this when it was made free to play, I suggest anyone curious to give it a shot. By no means is this quirky little game a masterpiece, but it is interesting and different, by its own right. And it is undeniably different than Scott's claim to fame in FNAF - in a great way.The controls are a little stiff, and could be better. And having no options to pause the game, nor settings available that I can see is a little odd. It just wants you to hop in and play. The graphics are really nicely done, and have an older feel to them. The gameplay is a mix of resource management and metroidvania exploration. The boss fights seem bizarre old school JRPG style with a lot of colors, flashing lights, and strange techniques. The story and setting are the biggest draw, a cyberpunk style throughout it all, with an aloof humor in the machines and their visions of a perfect human habitat, in a forgetten corner of space.I could probably play through the whole thing in one sitting, and this is based off my initial impressions. I forgot what the price was originally, but I would have regretted paying more than 2 bucks max for this. But for free, it's worth a shot.			"

												It feels definitively amateurish in terms of gameplay*The platforming segments have nice backgrounds and soundtrack, but they are dull (little more to do than spamming your shooting and collecting chips that are just laying there), the enemies have cool designs but all of them just have one form of attack which is shooting pathetic energy balls at you, and since the simulations are actually pretty small it gets really repetitive in the late game*The wireframe top-down segments are even more bare, its just looking for hidden corridors while shooting down mostly static enemies, it is somewhat more challenging than the platforming tho since bullets are harder to dodge and healing is not as easy, but overall they feel more like a tacked-on feature that was added onto the game to make it a little more varied rather than an actual part of it*The boss battles are definitively the best part of the game, they are fun, challenging, and confusing in a good way that makes you interested in learning better how they work, but I think they are unbalanced, enemy moves are disproportionately stronger than yours even taking in account it's 4 vs 1, sometimes the bosses destroy you if you even drop your guard one second, sometimes you destroy them 10 seconds into the battle if you get a little too strong for them and late in the game hacking chips practically become mandatory in order to beat them*There is little to do on the base other than go look for stuff on the outside and bringing it back to the Derelicts, it would have been nice if this part of the game was handled in a more interactive wayIt might just be suited for people looking for something unusual and up to tolerate the clunky gameplay for it, but despite all it's shortcomings I think it was pretty good and ambitious for a free game made by one person, it makes me wish Scott did more than endlessly milk FNAF because this shows a lot of promise			"

												When it comes to games packed full of different types of genres, many people have trouble making it seem like a natural fit. Scott Cawthon got it so very right. Now, I bought this game a while ago. Back when it cost money.As sad as I was to find out that it became a free to play later on, it's actually a good thing.Seriously, share this game with every gamer you know. This is an experience you can not pass up on.And while you're at it, look up the previous Desolate game, called the Desolate Room. And experience such as these games shouldn't be spoiled. So now that it's free, what's holding you back from trying it out?			"

												I haven't played it enough yet, but so far this game rules. It's like something that fell out of time, some displaced game from another era only just found. The music and visuals are great, and evoke some strange sense of distant longing for yesterday. The variety of gameplay is great, and takes me back to DOS era games that tried to do too much, but were incredible and engaging regardless. The platforming is a bit clunky at times, but you ARE a coffee pot...I hope that my reccomendation only becomes stronger as I progress further in this game.			"

												Admittedly I didn't play the game for very long. Cons:First, the game doesn't tell you what the controls are.  So I fumbled around pressing all sorts of buttons just trying to advance dialog. There is not a settings menu to show you, nor does the game explain it. Left and Right Arrow keys to move, and Down arrow to advance dialog or interact with things.Z and X control jumping and shooting. The game is glitchy, and I've been stuck in blocks I had to ""jump"" out of.There are no explanations on the various ""powerups"" and what they do, or what selecting a different option will do ""On- Charge"" or some nonsense.The underwater simulation is unforgiving and soooooo slow.No warning that you have days to complete something, the game just sorta changed into Night Phase for the first time, without me knowing I should be paying attention to time. Virus battle was weird. Now, That's probably my fault as I didn't go do the battle sim like I was supposed to (still won anyways.)Pros: The game is funny. Whomever wrote this did an excellent job. There is a coffee pot. As. A. Hero. The game has gorgeous backgrounds and art. Seriously that alone goes a long way to making me want to play it.The game is unique. Did I mention gorgeous?It's Free!Conclusion:Overall I want to like this game, but certain aspects of it are frustrating me at the moment. Perhaps I'll come back to it, when I'm in a more patient mood. For now, 7/10. I would definitely recommend people try it.			"

												For once the steam recommendations came up with something good this. And I can say that though I played it for free, this game would've been worth paying for, even though I finished in precisely 6 hours game time. The story is mostly well thought through (aside from the occasional tiny plot-hole) and the art-style, while usually not what I like, is pretty cool and well executed. You can feel that someone put a lot of effort into this.Pros:-3 (actually 4) different gameplay types: platformer, top-down dungeons, real time RPG fights (well, and the exploration part)-Atmospheric and beautiful graphics, crafted with care-The story is immersive, and though you get dozens of tips throughout the game the actual course of things is only revealed at the very end-I've noticed no bugs whatsoever-The RPG fights are flashy and intense, and you'll need to do several things at once, and that really fast-The soundtrack is also good (in my opinion at least)Cons:-No options or settings in any way, and the used buttons for jumping shooting are Z and X, which means if you have a keyboard layout where Z and X are not next to each other you'll have to play in an awkward hand position, or you'll need to temporarily change the assigned keyboard layout (or fix it with autohotkey like I did)-I think with different decisions of the protagonists the end could've been nicer/more interesting (though mind you it was still plenty fine)-Humans look god-awful in the games artstyle (though this is obviously subjective)			"

												A very charming multi-genre game with beautiful yet surreal enviroments and a nice soundtrack. You play as a coffee machine named Coffee (or rather, a thing in the body of Coffee) in a space station named ""Lun Infinus"". You enter the rooms in it to find the ""Derelicts"" (giant robots). In the rooms of them you can also enter a simulation in which they are also present. Simulations are the 2D platformer sections of the game. Each simulation has different goals and upgrades you can buy from the robots. In some more hidden sections within these simulations are sub-simulations (a simulation within a simulation). Sub-simulations have wireframe graphics and work similarly to the original The Legend of Zelda (and look kinda like FNaF minigames). You and your rabbit (which only appears here, may I add) go from room to room until some monsters start appearing. Defeating a monster will make a cabbage patch appear which your rabbit then eats and you get some bits for it (bits are the currency of this game). There's also a place to buy upgrades here but I won't go too much into it. The main goal of sub-simulations is actually to unlock conditionals for battles.Speaking of battles, they're probably the best part of the game! Within these JRPG-like battles, your creepy Derelicts fight against even creepier viruses. I won't go too much into getting to battles because I don't really want to spoil much. If you want to level up your derelicts for said battles, you'll need to go outside during the night phase when simulations are disabled and find some items they happen to collect.CONCLUSION: C'mon, it's a free game, why are you still reading this?

At the peak of a technological boom, an unmanned science vessel was sent to construct a research base on a far away planet, deploying four sentient computers to research and simulate the prospect of a society outside Earth. The mission was supposed to last five years, and probes with new research samples arrived regularily. With no warning, the probe cargo changed from research supplies to clocks, toys, paintings, snowglobes and other sentimental junk, they started crashing into the planet instead of landing at the base....then they stopped coming altogether. It has been thirty years since the last probe came. The station's power supplies are running low, and a virus is ravaging the AI simulations. You are a simple AI supplanted into a mechanized coffee pot - which was included on an unmanned mission by mistake, but is now the last chassis on the station capable of movement, - and tasked with fixing the disaster by entering each simulation and cleaning out the infection. Things get complicated from here.This game is a true hidden gem that meshes together a small adventure overworld, a metroidvania, an Active Time Battle boss rush and several minigames, wrapped in an intriguing premise with interesting characters, catchy 90's-style soundtrack and awe-inspiring prerendered backgrounds. You can play a minigame inside of a boss fight inside of a simulation inside of a game. It's bizarre that it was Five Night at Freddy's that brought Scott Cawthon fame instead of this.The game is not perfect, of course. The platforming sections are mediocre, the metroidvania part is a bit repetitive and there is some grinding required to gear up for the final bosses. However, the unique setting, atmosphere, graphics and characters more than make up for it.			"

												Yes, I only played this game for 30 minutes but I just couldn't enjoy it. It wore thin for me really quickly. It is interesting and I was intrigued about the frozen Desolate but I just didn't like the gameplay.I'm recommending it because it's free and other people may like it but other than that, I can't really say much. (Mainly because I barely played it but as I said, it just wasn't enjoyable).			"

												This game is incredible.I had never seen several different kinds of game blended together in such a clever way.This game has everything. Except for an option screen.The story is inspiring and unusual and shares similar themes as Interstellar, but light-years away from any human consciousness.You will find its flaws, but you will learn to accept them as part of a unique, brilliant gem that sets an example of how ideas should be put into a game.And it was made by one guy.Strongly recommended to anyone.

												The Desolate Hope, whilst not created by Arcen, ought to be worthy of an Arcen title. It has a delicious mish mash of genres and a wonderful streak of originality that pervades a goal based objective game. In all aspects, this feels very much like it -could- have come from an Arcen stable. That is high praise for a game, make no mistake. I regard Arcen as one of the few true shining lights, and whilst their attempts are hit and miss, their willingness to try new things makes them a publisher to always be interested in, regardless of what they do.In this case the mishmash starts with a simple enough side scrolling platform style game (valley of wind style approach), then evolves into some top down exploration minigames with a sprinkling of shooting, and underscored by utterly over the top JRPG style active time battle boss fights complete with over the top animations and explosions and vivid colours. In between all this as a form of palette cleanser, there's a lovely 3D pre-rendered set of screens forming the backbone of the derelict space ship that your avatar, in this case, a mobile coffee machine (best, protaganonist, ever), tootles around, and during the night phases, you wander over a desolate planetary surface, lit in sillouette form to some wonderfully atmospheric music.It's rough around the edges, the graphics are very much ""indie"", and the entire project feels very arthouse, but in a sense like most Arcen games, that's what gives it the charm. The fact that someone is able to bring so much to the table with limited resources and to show what games -can- be when they stop adhering to the boring AAA norms. It's not a game that will appeal to everyone, and I do recommend you read up on it from other sources, because like games like A.I. War, A valley without wind, or Bionic Dues, it's a game that'll appeal to a niche audience. But to those who it -will- appeal to, this is without doubt an instabuy, and for the price asked, you won't regret a single second of it.			"

												While the story seems goo enough, the gameplay fails in many respects. First of all, thne visuals are so overwhelming that you often can not even see the character. Ok, once you played a while you get used to it, but when you start the game, the game graphics looks pretty much the same as the loading screens, so when I first started it, I was waiting for the game to start, until after some time I realized that it already has.The controls are also pretty bad. You can't reconfigure, so if you don't have an englisch keyboard layout, you may end up with a pretty weirt control scheme. I'm using a german keyboard, where x and z are exchanged, so playing with that means that I always have to cross over for shooting and jumping. This means that for faster gameplay it would be pretty impossible to play. Only way is to swith to an english keyboard layout.The user interface in general is pretty badly done, so you don't have a clue with what objects you can interact and what is just decoration, especially since, most of the time you play with the keyboard, but sometimes there are menus where you have to switch to the mouse. The whole game is controlled with the cursor keys except the menus, which can be only controlled with the mouse, which is quite unintuite in this context, especially as there is no visual clue (again) that the cursor keys wont work here.Graphics and sounds are good, but as already mentioned, the graphics in particular is so heavily overloaded and colourfull that it's hard to discern your character.So all in all, I can't really recommend this game.

												So what to say about The Desolate Hope ?An alien / sci-fi styled mashup could be one thingthe game is setup up a world with 4 characters al doing there own thing waiting for it al to fail...Also my experience with the game. Your on a timmer to start, but you have to lvl up to defeat the opponent, that doesnt work well together. The game element are mixed, kinda fun , but not compatible.And so i gave up and checked youtube for the ending, and that made me happy i did add all my playtime in this gamePRO:Very intresting art styles, multipleFree gameCons:to many game elements, side scroll shooter with platforming, but boss with RPG turnbased fights :sGrinds, to long to notice advancement, becomes tediouslvl by collecting in nightmode, by walking and more walkingplay it to enjoy the style, or check the screenshots, skip it for the gameplay "

												Was a little hard to get into, because it reminded me of the really old games you get out of a cereal box.Once I actually managed to figure out what I was doing, it was really fun.I beat the game in about 6 hours. It's not a very long game. It's also made with an old engine that decides to save progress when you close it, and closing it is as simple as Escape.I ran into some frame issues. I imagine it was the engine itself. The amount of action on the screen, especially in boss battles at any one time is absolutely amazing and exciting to play.It should be good for those who played Five Nights at Freddy's, since it's made by the same person.The ending was awful, but there's a thing you can do after you see the ending, anyways: Go to the Battle Sim at the front of Lun Infinus and try to survive.Worth it for the action and the soundtrack, in my opinion.

												This is a wonderful little game (clocking just over 8 hours) with a mixture of different gaming elements to please folks. We've got platforming, high-animation turn-based combat, fetch quests, and a nod to an old school classic alien shooter. The control scheme for most of the game is ridiculously simple, so it's very approachable, but it maintains its challenge in different ways. Some of the game play around the platforming and questing can feel repetitive, but it's never a waste of time, since you're on the clock. Boss battles are a spectacle, and though I wasn't exactly sure what each of my attacks might have been doing, that didn't diminish my pleasure at each victory. All these are held together by a compelling story and two unlikely characters who keep you motivated to see the ending. The graphics were rich and imaginative, and they serve to reinforce the theme of the game's title. The soundtrack is also well-tuned to each stage of the game. I was thoroughly pleased and impressed.			"

You will be at 400% or 500% if you really want to secure the game's end.""- That means even more annoying, bad platforming.""There is a lot more to it than being just a platformer.""- Yes there was even more annoying part; some top viewed cluncy, clumsy gauntlet crap			"

												I'm not too sure about this game, It has reasons as to why it sucks and why it doesn't.For starters the game can cause seizures... It can literally kill people.There's a slight interface however the game requires you to manually lower the audio (which is already super loud)No Options.Launches in fullscreen, terrible ratio, had to ♥♥♥♥ around with the steam advanced settings to get it to window.Very slow gameplay and when it comes to battling, it's fast paced, you don't know what you're doing and it's unfun.Good soundtrack I guess.Interesting enough story and very retro and quite visually appealing visuals.Maybe a 4-5/10? It's good but not great.			"

												This game is looks fun, but it's very confusing. And I mean VERY. There were too few instructions and when the tutorial was done, I wandered around, hoping that I'd trigger some sort of dialogue message. It seemed like whenever I got to something, it said I couldn't go there and I had to beat another part of the game. The whole game is wandering around and hoping you'll trigger something. I think the good part was that the game was free. Final verdict: this game is a circle that has a beginning and no end, nor clues how to get to the end. But it's free and I guess if you're a 7-year old FNAF rabbid fan that worships Scott Cawthon, you'll like this game. 3.5/10			"

												I think it should be better if it was an adventure game (point and click or walking simulator) because the story it tries to tell seems interesting, but unfortunately it's not an adventure game. it tries to be an 2D action platformer but because of no vision of the genre and bad implementation the result is a bad side scroll shooting! gameplay of this game reminds me of games that created ten years before NES games, it's absolutely outdated and not interesting. I couldn't play it for more than 30 minutes so I can't recommend it to anyone with a taste and standards in video games.			"

												First off, the game has a time limit that stresses you the ♥♥♥♥ out.and the gameplay mostly boils down to dull, simplistic platforming, where you grind for money that you can spend on upgrades so not to get blown to kingdom f*ck in the jrpg styled bossbattles.The levels can be played in any order, but there's still a hidden difficulty curve, which means that you can encounter a boss that you're way too weak to face, and will most likely kill you in one hit.But the biggest problem of all is that there's no explaination for anything, you're not even told what the controls are, what your attacks do, why you need to collect eggs or what the stats mean, nothing at all! it doesn't come off as artsy or cryptic, it's just damn frustrating.While the artstyle and complexity is something to adore, the game is simply not fun to play. Notice how most positive reviews only have about 5 hours of playtime, and how the game's actual length is about 20+ hours.Yeah, not even the people who like this game could be arsed to finish it. It's a long tedious grind that really outstays its welcome,I recommend reading some steam guides in order to get an understanding of how tiresome this game is, if you still find the game compelling after reading about it, go ahead, knock yourself out.

												This review is not only going to give you my personal feedback about The Desolate Hope, but is also going to shut up all the people who think that Scott Cawthon is a terrible game developer.Before Five Nights at Freddy's, Five Nights 2, FNAF 3, and ""The Final Chapter"", there was a little splendid title called The Desolate Hope, made by everyone's favorite cryptic, Christian, 3DS Max and Clickteam Fusion 2.5 game dev, Scott Cawthon. ;)References aside, this is a game that everyone should play at least once in their gaming lives, and if not then maybe thrice; especially because this game is FREE! Additionally, if you know someone who hates Scott Cawthon just because of Five Nights at Freddy's, let them try out this indie gem to have them rethink themselves.Gameplay.The best part about this game is hands-down the gameplay. It actually combines three types of gameplay styles; top-view, Zelda-like shooting games; Mega Man style, non-linear platforming side-scrollers; and Turn-based RPGs with a unique blend. The RPG style is what I really want to talk most about. The first two gameplay styles are fairly self-explanatory (that is if you know what I'm saying), but Scott has added a very creative twist on turn-based RPG battles. Unlike traditional RPG battles, attacks come seemingly automatically, meaning that you need to react fast to initiate an action. It's a little hard to explain, but I'll try to proceed. Furthermore, there are nice little ""microgames"" that play during the battles which provide benefits to your party. I apologize for my poor explanantion, but its quite hard for me to put this into words.Graphics.I personally enjoy the visuals of this game, then again I also personally enjoy mashed potatoes with ketchup. The game's graphics use 3D images as 2D sprites, which in turn give it a strange feeling of playing a 3D game from the early 2000s, while in reality it actually isn't. Now this feeling, this is something that I like, as it practically tickles my spine with nostalgia. GG, Mr. Cawthon.Music.While I'm under the impression that this game's music consists of royalty-free songs, they're still quite catchy and enjoyable. Scott really knows how to direct his music, even if he didn't compose it.Overall, I reccomend that everyone play this game, especially because it's free and you have nothing to lose. It's a charming and unique title that'll make you enjoy game design and almost wish you could do the same. At least, taht's what it did for me. ;)			"

												Coffee saves the day in this bizarre RPG-sidescroller hybrid, The Desolate Hope. In it, you play a small video game program tasked with exploring several unique worlds and battling viruses within as per the orders of a coffee machine tasked with maintaining the extra-planetary colony of Lum Infinis. To aid you on your quest, you have the help of four derelict robots each running their own simulation for you to explore.Gameplay is split between a megaman-style sidescrolling jump and shoot, a top down shooter where you explore cyberspace within cyberspace, and RPG-style 4 on 1 battles vs bosses. TDH features a really bizarre artstyle that I can only describe as “uniquely Scott Cawthon” and if you’ve played any of his other games (especially FNAF) you’ll see why. Another interesting feature of this game are the day-night cycles. During the night, you are relegated to exploring the surface world to scavenge for items to improve the derelicts, increase power to the station, or score a few extra credits playing a space invaders style mini-game. Daytime is considerably more busy, requiring you to dive into simulations powered by each derelict in order to seek out and destroy the viruses located within. Once you encounter a virus, you are thrust into a high speed active-time RPG battle where quick thinking and careful planning are required in order to survive.On that note I have to say that, while most of the game was a fairly interesting experience, the boss battles are incredibly confusing and I managed to clear each one without really understanding what was going on. There is just so much happening on the screen in any given moment and the bosses will interrupt everything very frequently to do a full-screen attack. In any case I won, but I have no idea how or why.Chaotic boss battles aside, I still really enjoyed The Desolate Hope and you probably will too if you like eccentric hybrid RPGs. Plus, it’s FREE (can’t beat that!)			"

												long has it been since I found such a unique and fulfilling game.The gameplay is quaint but highly diversified, at first you think your just in your average 2d platformer but then your playing an old school atari above view arena shooter then BAM! now it's jrpg Boss fight time then just when you think you've seen all theat the game has to offer it turns into Space Ivaders.What I like most about the game is the existentialist anachronism which almost every charactor seems to posses it is reflected in the simulation they have created, these don't just feel like souless mechine each one has a philosophy of its own and although that might upset some people I find it to be out of the box and quite refreshing (Favorite robot Mirad).The game does not have day and night cycles but phases during the day phase you can go into one of four very different and unique wolds A.K.A. Simulations in which the goal is to destroy a the virus,during the night phase the primary objective is to scavenge resorces out side the base on an alein world wich is indicative of leveling up your four robots to better combat the virus (Boss).This game gives you quite a bit of purpuse while at the same time personifying an atmosphire of hopelessness, if your not combating a virus your or saving your bytes (currancy)to buy some of the many upgrades your playing one of the sub games to unlock bonuses when you go after one of the five Bosses and keep an eye on that time meter its almost scavenging time, you are unabe to go into a simulation during the night phase and are unabel to go out to scavenge during the day phase which gives this game a whole other faceit making it feeling like a two differnt games, hey I dont know what a Giant simulation running robot wants with a snow globe but if he allocates more of his prosseing power and resorces to me (him leveling up) then more power to us, it's also a good idea to scavege power cells as your base runs on a power resivior and each day drains a power cell (After passing the tenth day, a few number of power cells can be found outside)I never found out what happens when you run out of power(came close though went down to 3 days of power left) but I can't help but feel somwhat sure thats when you lose and seeing as this game constanly saves there most likly wont be any ""loading up the save"" agin.The only thing I feel the game could have used was a mini map.In conclusion I give The Desolate Hope five Cyborg implants out of five (5/5) Fun gameplay, Awsome story ,Amazing Charactors and a strange well suited ending that brings it all together.

												Bought this game in an indie bundle & have to say its the best game in that bunch,cince then it has become free i guess, its still better than 89% of steams indie games. Produced by the guy who made 5nights at Fredies, so it has that depth about it alott of games miss out on yet its not a horror production...  its a single player where you play a coffie pot with an AI.  Coffie is a station maintainer whos job is to monitor & keep disinfected a space station full of robots while always keeping a pot of hot coffie at the ready just in cast humans land. coffie's other robot companions on the station have a diffrent goal that is to simulate the perfect habitat for humans to live on the world they were dumped, the problem? a bio organic virus has mutated to a stage where it can interact with the programs in harmfull ways stealing peices of each simulation and creating its own. Now coffie must fight this ever growing viral threat and save enough power & memory to keep his friends & there simulations running untill a final solution of keeping humans alive on ""this desolate hope"" ...

 The Desolate Hope	Scott Cawthon is known for the Five Nights at Freddy's series, but The Desolate Hope is another awesome game he made. It has a mix of elements from side-scrolling games, RPGs, and Top Downs. It's a really difficult game, which means it will take a long time to finish. The Desolate Hope is a really fun game and I recommend playing it.			"

												The Desolate Hope is a small little game from the same dev that created the more well-known five nights at freddies. The game is a mix of platforming and fast-paced RPG, (the game is not both, it just transitions from RPG to platformer) It can be complex at times, but you'll get the hang of it. For a small game it is very fun to play, and very nice to look at. It may not have supreme graphics but the art style is very unique. This game isn't flawless, however; It lacks an options menu, and when you beat a ""virus"" in-game, the levels start to strain on your eyes with the green static. The game has a decent soundtrack for the platforming sections and the RPG sections. The story isn't really anything special, you're a robot who has to beat up ""viruses"" to progress. The game can get a tiny bit grindy, but you don't have to get ALL the upgrades to win. All in all, it's a very fun game to play, and worth your time.			"

DON'T LOOK AT MY HOURS PLAYED, I PLAYED IT IN THE 1.00 VERSION WHEN IT WAS FREEWARE BACK IN THE EARLY 2012...So, where can I start with this game.... IT WAZ DEVELOPD BY SCAWT CAWTHON!!!!111XDDDDzeb89isgayXDDDDBut that is not your average horror game with animatronics that became followed by an autistic fanbase (despite I LIKE THE SERIES)Now serious.This game is a fast-paced platform/RPG about a CoffeeBot and his artificial Intelligence D-Co 9 trying to stop a digital Virus that is destroying 4 robots simulations, until they get tha the virus.... Well, play by yourself :PProsAmazing 80s 3d graphicsGreat gameplay (Both platform and battle system)The Battle system is really original and curatedGood music despite being royalty free tracks (which I personally hate)The story is not linear. And a bit sad :'cConsThe night phase is boringThe controls are a bit clunkyA few glitches (ex.You can play the moving animation while there is a dialog box lel)Overall: 9-/10P.S.: It's free now! Go and play it! "

												This was a charming game that combines many genres. At first it's a platformer, then it's a top-down shooter, then it's an RPG, then it's cookie clicker.The art is unique and well-crafted, providing a weird retro sci-fi feel.My main complaints are with the grinding that's practically required near the end, and the majora's-mask-styled day/night system wherein the only thing you're allowed to do at night is walk across a nearly-blank landscape looking for sparsely-placed items.Despite the grinding hurdles and repetition, I was still captivated by the game and its story. It's a hidden gem that I wish Scott Cawthon was known for rather than his Freddy's titles.			"

The gameplay was amazing and all plus you really got to pay attention to what your doing if you want to beat the bosses with ease.  2 more bosses and I'll see what happens next, so far ger garun has been the most difficult to beat but there's not much fun without a challenge. I just hope FNAF world will be somewhat similar if not better to this game. 10/10 Coffee, more like the pure embodiment of sassy.			"

												It's a really good game. The art style is beautiful, has nice (Royalty free) music, pretty good controls, some nice in-game text, and it's free. I do have some issue with this game like it would be nice if I could map the buttons to the WASD space and some other button to shoot with, it takes a while to figure out what you're suppose to do and where to go, and the level design has the copy and paste level set pieces issue like in old NES games like Metroid and Zelda1, I'd also would've liked a map system of the levels, but for a game made by one guy it's pretty good. I'd give it a 7.5/10. If you like games such as Metroid, Mega Man, and RPGs, and maybe Abe's Oddworld (Mostly because of the artstyle)? Then this is a game that's worth checking out.			"

												This was one hell of a motherfking grind. I've clocked in around 17 hours, and saw some people finish it in half the time, not exactly sure how. But yeah, the grinding. My god. Full immersion into a miserable long-forsaken space station right there.This game is amazing, and I highly recommend it as long as you have the adequate amount of time to kill grinding. The main problem here is that boss battles don't properly scale with the gameplay; so it starts out innocently enough, yet becomes more atrocious with every new one. So why do I recommend this game?Well, I don't always care about gameplay first and foremost. While it's true I will be highly attracted to original games (and this one is all over the place), I'll play anything that has a great story. You can find a shtload of mysteries to progressively dig through, along with a cast of characters with different philosophical perspectives. I couldn't ask for more. (Actually, I wished for more dialogue. There was definitely untapped potential there.)			"

												Astonishing. A work of art, both visually and story-wise. This game features some of the best visual work I've ever seen, with a real '90s hyperfuture feel. Gorgeous. Story is subtle and effective, a tale of isolation, helplessness, and the terror of uncertainty. Characters are philosophical and devastatingly tragic, doing a good job of exploring the big question: Why do we even?I know why I even. To jack up spooky cybertards with the help of my robot pals. In the not-too-distant future.Great fun game, ten out of ten, here's my firstborn.I was thrown at first by the simplistic gameplay. You derp around on rails to access the main platformer levels and eventually do some goofy top-down goofing. I eventually figured out the roles of these parts of the game: Basically you need to earn FAT STACK$ and buy hella upgrades to have any chance of winning the game, and you gotta do it fast-like before the landlord flips the breaker and things go dead. Yeah.But you're here to fight a virus, and that's the main draw of the game. The battles are intense, complicated, and unforgiving; they're the only serious or difficult parts of the gameplay. You need to derp around the research station to access all the simulated worlds and to level your characters for battle. You need to explore each simulation carefully to find upgrades for your fine robo-dudesmen to use in battle, and to actually locate and challenge the manifestations of the Virus to initiate battle. You gotta enter the source-code world to get sweet conditional buffs for your battles. You gotta GIT GUD to beat the living hell out of robotic cyber-nightmares. IN BATTLES.Found a little glowing fireball? Activate it. Pull up your big boy pants....And yes, you have to fight THAT. No, don't slam the escape key. Not that you can beat it first time. Haha, no. You gotta GIT GUD.It's time to micromanage four different characters with different move sets JRPG style, but *in real time*, trying to out-murder a terrifying robo-devil of some description while he is continuously jacking up yo boys with MIND LIGHTNING. Like a good frantic multitask in the morning? The final moves of each of your characters start little minigames *to be played at the same time* on top of the main battle in order to get some powerups. All this, and the virus is no sissy either. The difficulty ramps steeply, and the game is unforgiving if you are too slow or waste a move.Fortunately, you get a practice arena in which to learn the ropes and PLENTY of fights in which to hone your skills. And failing a fight only sets you back in time- no resources are permanently used up, and you can try again. It's a good implimentation of super-crazy death challenges.It's astoundingly addictive. Loads of fun.P.S. I note how most other reviews have either fewer than 3 or more than 10 hours of play. I reckon a first-time playthrough would take ~9 hours, so there's how you tell if somebody actually finished the thing. I definitely took a full hour to get familiar with the game, but then I was hooked good and firmly. The ending is delightfully bittersweet. I hope you enjoy the heartfeels.P.P.S. Malentz is my favorite character. His outlook on life is eerily similar to my approach to College. I like how he's the biggest, spikiest, spidery-est robot, but collects toys and spends his time tinkering in his Farmville-style hermitage. He's also got the best moves, though there's competition from that big loveable teddy bear Alphon.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine This is not your regular Five Night's at Freddy's game everyone has so lovingly fell in love withThe Desolate Hope still has its weird art style everyone has fallen in love with in the FNAF series but it has a very compelling story to follow with and very lovable characters.The game offers memorable yet some weird and scary characters along with a very compelling story which will hook you in no matter what. The atmosphere is just stunning, it take you a minute to admire the beautiful atmosphere, a few times I stopped and looked at the art style. The combat system is very unique, a bit confusing at first but you get the hang of it after a few tries and the combat music is so much fun to listen!However this game does have its fair share of problems, however none of them are game breaking. The gameplay may get repetitive, collecting chips at night and finding viruses during the day. Walking is very slow and their is no option to sprint or run a bit faster. There is a lack of tutorials to introduce you to the mechanics, which can leave you wondering for quite a while and asking yourself what on earth you have to do next.But, this game is a gem of a game and I congratulate Scott Cawthon for making such a beautiful indie game very different to his widely successful FNAF series, and hopefully this game may be given so more love, care and attention and we get a series just like FNAF fans are getting right now.The only thing I am sad to say is that although this game is very good, it is a lost gem piled from Scott Cawthon's other successful game series, which is a real shame :( RECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? :- Like some games get ""Best Game of 2014"" or ""Best Indie Game"", etc... So I have decided to make my own!)  "

												This is Scott Cathon's best game. It has charm, and as you play it you definitely can tell it's made from the same guy who made FNAF. The platforming is pretty fun for a while, but overall I've seen free flash games that offer comparable quality. The night parts are fun at first as well (and the planet in the background looks amazing), but then you get tired of slowly moving left until you find a few things, then having to drag them back to your base and give them to the appropriate machines. Despite the redundancy of the games two key playstyles, it's definitely unique enough to recommend. If you find this game for cheap, I'd advise trying it out.			"

 The Desolate Hope	Scott Cawthon is known for the Five Nights at Freddy's series, but The Desolate Hope is another awesome game he made. It has a mix of elements from side-scrolling games, RPGs, and Top Downs. It's a really difficult game, which means it will take a long time to finish. The Desolate Hope is a really fun game and I recommend playing it.			"

												The Desolate Hope is a small little game from the same dev that created the more well-known five nights at freddies. The game is a mix of platforming and fast-paced RPG, (the game is not both, it just transitions from RPG to platformer) It can be complex at times, but you'll get the hang of it. For a small game it is very fun to play, and very nice to look at. It may not have supreme graphics but the art style is very unique. This game isn't flawless, however; It lacks an options menu, and when you beat a ""virus"" in-game, the levels start to strain on your eyes with the green static. The game has a decent soundtrack for the platforming sections and the RPG sections. The story isn't really anything special, you're a robot who has to beat up ""viruses"" to progress. The game can get a tiny bit grindy, but you don't have to get ALL the upgrades to win. All in all, it's a very fun game to play, and worth your time.			"

												With a name like The Desolate Hope, you'd expect a dark, depressing game.  And then you realize you're playing as an Autonomous walking Coffee Maker... Don't get me wrong, there is definitely a feeling of desolation and despair in the story, but there's also a lot of the title's hope too. It's a platform game with minor Castlevania elements, and boss battles in active-time-mode like a Final Fantasy Game (except way more frantic). It's charming, and unique, and has moody interludes and just works really, really well.  All the more so considering it was entirely made by one person.  It's fascinating, sweet, thought-provoking, fun, and frustrating; I took about 7 hours to finish it, with a little bit of grinding.  All of the boss battles are challenging - I thought I'd be playing the final one forever before I noticed a trick that made it much easier (and came out of the game rules).  The biggest problem with the game is that it doesn't document how to do things well - I stumbled across something 2/3 of the way through the game that would have made things much easier having known about it upfront. But that's a minor quibble for what turned out to be a much better game than I had expected.			"

												Coffee saves the day in this bizarre RPG-sidescroller hybrid, The Desolate Hope. In it, you play a small video game program tasked with exploring several unique worlds and battling viruses within as per the orders of a coffee machine tasked with maintaining the extra-planetary colony of Lum Infinis. To aid you on your quest, you have the help of four derelict robots each running their own simulation for you to explore.Gameplay is split between a megaman-style sidescrolling jump and shoot, a top down shooter where you explore cyberspace within cyberspace, and RPG-style 4 on 1 battles vs bosses. TDH features a really bizarre artstyle that I can only describe as “uniquely Scott Cawthon” and if you’ve played any of his other games (especially FNAF) you’ll see why. Another interesting feature of this game are the day-night cycles. During the night, you are relegated to exploring the surface world to scavenge for items to improve the derelicts, increase power to the station, or score a few extra credits playing a space invaders style mini-game. Daytime is considerably more busy, requiring you to dive into simulations powered by each derelict in order to seek out and destroy the viruses located within. Once you encounter a virus, you are thrust into a high speed active-time RPG battle where quick thinking and careful planning are required in order to survive.On that note I have to say that, while most of the game was a fairly interesting experience, the boss battles are incredibly confusing and I managed to clear each one without really understanding what was going on. There is just so much happening on the screen in any given moment and the bosses will interrupt everything very frequently to do a full-screen attack. In any case I won, but I have no idea how or why.Chaotic boss battles aside, I still really enjoyed The Desolate Hope and you probably will too if you like eccentric hybrid RPGs. Plus, it’s FREE (can’t beat that!)			"

												It's obvious that everyone's first thoughts about this game generally compare it to FNaF, and that's understandable. As a big FNaF fan (now Scott Cawthon fan) I did the same thing, and I still do occassionally as I'm going through. However, I think it's important to note that this is not FNaF and FNaF has nothing to do with it. The Desolate Hope is an amazing game, and even though it probably will never be as popular as FNaF, I hope that someday Scott can turn out another game similar to this one (assuming that developing games is something he wants to do for a long time). The visuals are amazing, I've actually just set one of the scenes from the game as my wallpaper. The characters are loveable as hell, each having unique and interesting traits. Gameplay is, foor the most part, very fun. Music is well done, fitting to the atmosphere and easily getting into my head for hours (in a good way!). I'm a sucker for this old but beautiful graphic style, and sci-fi settings, so this game is like a little slice of gaming heaven for me. (Also I would die to have a game visually and atmospherically similar to this one, but have it be a hidden object/puzzle game rather than an RPG~)My only complaints with this would have to be some aspects of gameplay. The nights drag on, and are pretty much just a lot of holding down the left arrow key, especially after you've gotten the wrench and have no incentive to care about how efficient you are in your nightly collecting. Another thing I took issue with was the real-time combat with viruses. I often find myself flustered and frustrated, which makes strategizing difficult. Lastly, if you want more upgrades, there's a good chance you'll be grinding in those little terminal worlds for money for quite a while, which I find really annoying. tl;dr : this game is freaking awesome and beautiful, but the gameplay can be frustrating.

But on its own, this game does hold up in terms of gameplay and story, and is a fun adventure. I heavily recommend to everyone, FNAF Fanbase or not.			"

												Saw this game only a few months before the whole FNaF craze started, didn't really bother to check it out, it seemed cool though, I don't know why I didn't. Its a really good game, very megaman esque in the simulations, and its a pretty unique game overall. So far, almost an hour on it already and only 2% done with it, but I'll finish it. Eventually. Do I recommend this game? Hell yeah!			"

												An amazing mixture of a platformer, and an RPG, exploration in this game doesn't feel too forced, and you can clown around if you want. The details and overral look of the game are amazing, and it's absoluetley fun to play. I highly recommend this game, and I hope the rumor of a 3rd game are true, this was just so fantastic! The Desolate Hope is a must play!			"

												This game was described to me as 'a pot of coffee goes into the dreams of depressed robots' and it's pretty spot on, though falls way short of what I got in the end. An amazing story hidden beneath a deceptively simple shell, equal parts XBLIG platformer and ultra busy fast paced RPG combat [yeah, I didn't even know it was possible to make an active-time battle thing this damned hard], it's worth an evening to barrel through to enjoy some mad AIs rambling about their new hobbies, and to see just in how many ways you can break the combat concurrently.It also has a spider in it.

												With a name like The Desolate Hope, you'd expect a dark, depressing game.  And then you realize you're playing as an Autonomous walking Coffee Maker... Don't get me wrong, there is definitely a feeling of desolation and despair in the story, but there's also a lot of the title's hope too. It's a platform game with minor Castlevania elements, and boss battles in active-time-mode like a Final Fantasy Game (except way more frantic). It's charming, and unique, and has moody interludes and just works really, really well.  All the more so considering it was entirely made by one person.  It's fascinating, sweet, thought-provoking, fun, and frustrating; I took about 7 hours to finish it, with a little bit of grinding.  All of the boss battles are challenging - I thought I'd be playing the final one forever before I noticed a trick that made it much easier (and came out of the game rules).  The biggest problem with the game is that it doesn't document how to do things well - I stumbled across something 2/3 of the way through the game that would have made things much easier having known about it upfront. But that's a minor quibble for what turned out to be a much better game than I had expected.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine This is not your regular Five Night's at Freddy's game everyone has so lovingly fell in love withThe Desolate Hope still has its weird art style everyone has fallen in love with in the FNAF series but it has a very compelling story to follow with and very lovable characters.The game offers memorable yet some weird and scary characters along with a very compelling story which will hook you in no matter what. The atmosphere is just stunning, it take you a minute to admire the beautiful atmosphere, a few times I stopped and looked at the art style. The combat system is very unique, a bit confusing at first but you get the hang of it after a few tries and the combat music is so much fun to listen!However this game does have its fair share of problems, however none of them are game breaking. The gameplay may get repetitive, collecting chips at night and finding viruses during the day. Walking is very slow and their is no option to sprint or run a bit faster. There is a lack of tutorials to introduce you to the mechanics, which can leave you wondering for quite a while and asking yourself what on earth you have to do next.But, this game is a gem of a game and I congratulate Scott Cawthon for making such a beautiful indie game very different to his widely successful FNAF series, and hopefully this game may be given so more love, care and attention and we get a series just like FNAF fans are getting right now.The only thing I am sad to say is that although this game is very good, it is a lost gem piled from Scott Cawthon's other successful game series, which is a real shame :( RECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? :- Like some games get ""Best Game of 2014"" or ""Best Indie Game"", etc... So I have decided to make my own!)  "

												I have not played very long and I already recommend this game, which caught me off guard considering I hate Scott's other games. A Desolate Hope is a 2-D side-scrolling platformer which transitions into a rpg-maker esc-battle screen for bosses. That's only the day phase. At night you go out and collect items to level up your derelicts (the fighters for bosses) and get extra money. It also features a great soundtrack which fits each level very well. It recently turned free, but I would have gladly paid money for this game. 9/10			"

												Astonishing. A work of art, both visually and story-wise. This game features some of the best visual work I've ever seen, with a real '90s hyperfuture feel. Gorgeous. Story is subtle and effective, a tale of isolation, helplessness, and the terror of uncertainty. Characters are philosophical and devastatingly tragic, doing a good job of exploring the big question: Why do we even?I know why I even. To jack up spooky cybertards with the help of my robot pals. In the not-too-distant future.Great fun game, ten out of ten, here's my firstborn.I was thrown at first by the simplistic gameplay. You derp around on rails to access the main platformer levels and eventually do some goofy top-down goofing. I eventually figured out the roles of these parts of the game: Basically you need to earn FAT STACK$ and buy hella upgrades to have any chance of winning the game, and you gotta do it fast-like before the landlord flips the breaker and things go dead. Yeah.But you're here to fight a virus, and that's the main draw of the game. The battles are intense, complicated, and unforgiving; they're the only serious or difficult parts of the gameplay. You need to derp around the research station to access all the simulated worlds and to level your characters for battle. You need to explore each simulation carefully to find upgrades for your fine robo-dudesmen to use in battle, and to actually locate and challenge the manifestations of the Virus to initiate battle. You gotta enter the source-code world to get sweet conditional buffs for your battles. You gotta GIT GUD to beat the living hell out of robotic cyber-nightmares. IN BATTLES.Found a little glowing fireball? Activate it. Pull up your big boy pants....And yes, you have to fight THAT. No, don't slam the escape key. Not that you can beat it first time. Haha, no. You gotta GIT GUD.It's time to micromanage four different characters with different move sets JRPG style, but *in real time*, trying to out-murder a terrifying robo-devil of some description while he is continuously jacking up yo boys with MIND LIGHTNING. Like a good frantic multitask in the morning? The final moves of each of your characters start little minigames *to be played at the same time* on top of the main battle in order to get some powerups. All this, and the virus is no sissy either. The difficulty ramps steeply, and the game is unforgiving if you are too slow or waste a move.Fortunately, you get a practice arena in which to learn the ropes and PLENTY of fights in which to hone your skills. And failing a fight only sets you back in time- no resources are permanently used up, and you can try again. It's a good implimentation of super-crazy death challenges.It's astoundingly addictive. Loads of fun.P.S. I note how most other reviews have either fewer than 3 or more than 10 hours of play. I reckon a first-time playthrough would take ~9 hours, so there's how you tell if somebody actually finished the thing. I definitely took a full hour to get familiar with the game, but then I was hooked good and firmly. The ending is delightfully bittersweet. I hope you enjoy the heartfeels.P.P.S. Malentz is my favorite character. His outlook on life is eerily similar to my approach to College. I like how he's the biggest, spikiest, spidery-est robot, but collects toys and spends his time tinkering in his Farmville-style hermitage. He's also got the best moves, though there's competition from that big loveable teddy bear Alphon.			"

												This was one hell of a motherfking grind. I've clocked in around 17 hours, and saw some people finish it in half the time, not exactly sure how. But yeah, the grinding. My god. Full immersion into a miserable long-forsaken space station right there.This game is amazing, and I highly recommend it as long as you have the adequate amount of time to kill grinding. The main problem here is that boss battles don't properly scale with the gameplay; so it starts out innocently enough, yet becomes more atrocious with every new one. So why do I recommend this game?Well, I don't always care about gameplay first and foremost. While it's true I will be highly attracted to original games (and this one is all over the place), I'll play anything that has a great story. You can find a shtload of mysteries to progressively dig through, along with a cast of characters with different philosophical perspectives. I couldn't ask for more. (Actually, I wished for more dialogue. There was definitely untapped potential there.)			"

												After playing five nights at freddys and checking the scott cawthon website every day for an update, i had noticed, on the bottom of the website, something about ""The Desolate Hope"" wich drew my curiosity because i had never heard of scott cawthon before FNAF. What with a quick search on steam i had come to realize one of the most UNDERRATED games i have ever heard of. This is truly a unique idea with a wonderful story to back it up. It is honestly a shame that it comes out just like other overlooked games that are FUN and UNIQUE and INTERESTING, critics love it, but not many bought it. The boss fights are immersive and difficult, the derelicts fell as though they have personality, its such a great game. Yeah sure, its missing a little polish here and there and the platforming isnt AS mush fun as the boss fights but please support scott by playing this game, so that we might in time get a ""desolate hope"" sequel			"

												This game has so much creativity... in a weird way.  But I love how Scott Cawthon has made this ALL ON HIS OWN!!!  It's rediculous that he is able to express aqlot of his ideas into his games very well.  I love the OST and the gameplay is phenominal.  Great game!  I would pay 5 dollars for this!  So far, the story is absolutely stunning and the characters are so developed and deeply designed.  I can also see ore than enough of FNaF ideas and references from this game.  I can see where he got most of his FNaF ideas from.  Plus, the entire game runs on a 2D engine like FNaF, so you can probably run this on a potato.  The grahpic screenshots put into images and animations are what makes this game looks so damn good with no CPU lag.  the game is only about 400 megabytes, definitely empty space on my hard drive used well.11/10 GET THIS GAME!!!

												long has it been since I found such a unique and fulfilling game.The gameplay is quaint but highly diversified, at first you think your just in your average 2d platformer but then your playing an old school atari above view arena shooter then BAM! now it's jrpg Boss fight time then just when you think you've seen all theat the game has to offer it turns into Space Ivaders.What I like most about the game is the existentialist anachronism which almost every charactor seems to posses it is reflected in the simulation they have created, these don't just feel like souless mechine each one has a philosophy of its own and although that might upset some people I find it to be out of the box and quite refreshing (Favorite robot Mirad).The game does not have day and night cycles but phases during the day phase you can go into one of four very different and unique wolds A.K.A. Simulations in which the goal is to destroy a the virus,during the night phase the primary objective is to scavenge resorces out side the base on an alein world wich is indicative of leveling up your four robots to better combat the virus (Boss).This game gives you quite a bit of purpuse while at the same time personifying an atmosphire of hopelessness, if your not combating a virus your or saving your bytes (currancy)to buy some of the many upgrades your playing one of the sub games to unlock bonuses when you go after one of the five Bosses and keep an eye on that time meter its almost scavenging time, you are unabe to go into a simulation during the night phase and are unabel to go out to scavenge during the day phase which gives this game a whole other faceit making it feeling like a two differnt games, hey I dont know what a Giant simulation running robot wants with a snow globe but if he allocates more of his prosseing power and resorces to me (him leveling up) then more power to us, it's also a good idea to scavege power cells as your base runs on a power resivior and each day drains a power cell (After passing the tenth day, a few number of power cells can be found outside)I never found out what happens when you run out of power(came close though went down to 3 days of power left) but I can't help but feel somwhat sure thats when you lose and seeing as this game constanly saves there most likly wont be any ""loading up the save"" agin.The only thing I feel the game could have used was a mini map.In conclusion I give The Desolate Hope five Cyborg implants out of five (5/5) Fun gameplay, Awsome story ,Amazing Charactors and a strange well suited ending that brings it all together.

												Great game i feel pretty sorry for the creator (Scott) because his other games get no attention its only FNaF that does I like FNaF but it would be great if they looked at his other games.			"

												This was one hell of a motherfking grind. I've clocked in around 17 hours, and saw some people finish it in half the time, not exactly sure how. But yeah, the grinding. My god. Full immersion into a miserable long-forsaken space station right there.This game is amazing, and I highly recommend it as long as you have the adequate amount of time to kill grinding. The main problem here is that boss battles don't properly scale with the gameplay; so it starts out innocently enough, yet becomes more atrocious with every new one. So why do I recommend this game?Well, I don't always care about gameplay first and foremost. While it's true I will be highly attracted to original games (and this one is all over the place), I'll play anything that has a great story. You can find a shtload of mysteries to progressively dig through, along with a cast of characters with different philosophical perspectives. I couldn't ask for more. (Actually, I wished for more dialogue. There was definitely untapped potential there.)			"

												This game is extremely overlooked. The story, music, visuals, and gameplay are amazing with each other. The fanbase is rather small though, so there isn't much fan art for this hidden gem. It's free so pick it up today (FOR FREE!). Not recommended for  those with eyesight problems though (It's painful). One last thing, it's super difficult. Have fun			"

												Yeah... Five Nights At Freddy's Is Cool... But This Is Really A Hidden Gem/Work Of Art. I can bet that over half the people who know Scott Cawthon as a game creator don't know about this game. It's sad really, it's the best Free To Play game ever made. It really deserves more attention, so I hope someone reading this will install it, write a good review, tell people about it, and luv this game like I am, and will.			"

												The desolete hope is a really awsome and challenging game to play. The reason why you should play is because there are more games to scott cawthon the five nights at freddys. Dont get me wrong Five nights at freddys is a good game but you can play more then just that one. Just try the desolete hope you will love it I know I do. The only dislike i have about this game , there are no dislikes! I hope someone will read this then play the desolete hope!			"

												A lot of content for a free game. Graphics are sensational in places and very servicable everywhere else. You have to figure a lot out yourself and the battle system can be tricky to understand but enjoyable non the less. The only downside which I feel is a little grindy is the night time where you have to search for lost parts to upgrade your allies. This basically consists of going left!			"

												It's archaic, and crude, but the art is stunning, and the story is magically creative. The ambiance gives me that same fuzzy feeling that Machinarium does.  Soundtrack isn't terrible, but not great.			"

												Positive:+story is interesting and philosophic+art design is mystic, scary and creative+music is perfect for the atmosphere in this game+the round/real-time fights are really funny and complexNegative:-Platform Game and Top-Down part have bad gameplay and you have to grind-you have to search over and over again hidden shops or other places in the small Platform levels and the game has no level map-game explains far too little- Round/real-time fight enemies haven’t a KI, only a few random attacks. The fights feel often unbalanced and too fast.This game is only for experience players because it’s hard and unfair. The style of this game is special, if you don’t like the style of the trailer then i don’t confirm this game for you.			"

												This is Scott Cathon's best game. It has charm, and as you play it you definitely can tell it's made from the same guy who made FNAF. The platforming is pretty fun for a while, but overall I've seen free flash games that offer comparable quality. The night parts are fun at first as well (and the planet in the background looks amazing), but then you get tired of slowly moving left until you find a few things, then having to drag them back to your base and give them to the appropriate machines. Despite the redundancy of the games two key playstyles, it's definitely unique enough to recommend. If you find this game for cheap, I'd advise trying it out.			"
