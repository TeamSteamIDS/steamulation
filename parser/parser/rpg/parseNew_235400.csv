												Watered down, uninteresting version of King's Bounty: The Legend and its nice sequels. This started as Facebook game (which is where I tried it initially, long enough to see all the features) with microtransactions and a wait-or-pay-to-play system. Facebook login is not required to play unless you want any of the sharing features or cross-platform play with browser and mobile. Typical for this kind of game, you can expect constant ""share this with your friends!"" prompts and an unskippable mission to send gifts to friends, and so on.The combat system isn't as interesting as the true King's Bounty games: gone are the three hero classes and the skill trees. No mana management, you have to purchase scrolls for each spellcasting. You don't lose troops, you just pay gold to resurrect them. Units can always move their full movement and attack or fire. Units are missing some interesting abilities they have in the ""real"" games. Side-note: animations are also inferior-looking and don't have the wacky character of the originals.The overworld map shows its flash game origins and is a far cry from the gorgeous 3D maps of the original games. The quests are given in the usual dry facebook game style, and I haven't detected the trademark humor of KB:TL either.Only redeeming factor would be maybe the presence of a PvP option, or the simple progression system which allows you to upgrade the stats of your units, as well as a simple crafting system. Overall unless you're really interested in the social aspects or you're desperate to play this on your phone, I don't see a good reason why you'd play this instead of buying King's Bounty: The Legend. If you don't have it yet wait for the next bundle where you'll be able to get it for under 4$. (Google the ""Wars of Ages"" bundle for instance, should be up until mid-january 2013.)			"

												At its core this game is a Facebookgame with micropayments.It pesters you to share your Missionrewards with friends on your Facebookpage after every damn mission.You get equippment by gathering small pieces after every kill, and the Tutorial is one of those ""klick exactly what i tell you to for 10 minutes"" things.The Artstyle is all over the place and the Animations for the Charakters look very unnatural, after you kill a unit the camera zooms closer in an atempt to show a deathanimation, but by the time the zoom in starts its already over so all it does is zoom in and out on a charakter that does not move.Iam not seeng alot of positive things in this game that would set it above other hextacticgamesbut at the end of the Day the game is free, so you should give it a try and see if you like it.

												First things first: I love the King's Bounty series. I own all the games on that other, DRM-free site, and two games over here. I have hundreds of hours put into them, collectively. When I read a positive, recent review of this game, I thought I'd give it a try. I lasted only 12 minutes. During that time, I was nagged to log in and share things over Facebook NINE TIMES. In TWELVE MINUTES. Kill something? Share it on FB! Find a component? Share it on FB! Your wizard cast a spell? Why not share it on FB? Your warrior had an itch on his groin during combat and used the elven healer's pointy left ear to scratch it? Hey, I have an idea - you could share it on FB! At one point, I was actually informed of a feature that could ONLY be unlocked if I logged into FB.  That was enough for me.  Seriously. Nine times. In twelve minutes. It's like the first time I discovered my father's box of Playboy magazines, only not nearly as pleasant.  Not recommended.			"

												I love the King's Bounty games, I really do.But King's Bounty: Legions just doesn't feel right. All of the elements that made the previous games interesting were removed or tweaked to provide the most bland and generic experience possible to the player.In this game, there is no specialisation, you can spend your gold on marginal upgrades for units and spells, but cost scaling and level requirements for these upgrades is made in such a way that you can't just decide to dump all your gold into spells and rely on them. Especially since you can't learn spells, you have no mana, you have to buy scrolls, every time you use a spell you need to use a scroll.When it comes to army building, there isn't much to it unless you are willing to pay, you have access to some basic units from shops, and a few advanced units as quest rewards, but only enough to show you what these units can do and encourage you to purchase more at the real money shop. You just don't get the satisfaction of doing your best with limited resources like you did in the previous games, especially since morale mechanics and most of the units special effects were removed.Finally,  you don't have to select your battles like in the previous games, here you simply progress from one area to another with the ability to grind when you feel you aren't strong enough to take on the next challenge.The only thing that's left from the previous games is the turn-based gameplay, which just isn't enough to hold the game together without the strategic elements that the previous games had.

												Really nice-looking, sometimes clever, yet very grindy and rage-producing Pay-to-Win PvE/PvP Multiplayer King's Bounty game. It was made by the same Katauri studio, which resurrected King's Bounty title in the first place. If you familiar with some of those King's Bounty games, you'll feel yourself like at home at the start.But, but, but... the farther you go, the more you need dozens and hundreds of gaming friends on the Facebook, along you, to continue playing. Why? Firstly, friends are to send you some little, yet useful gifts, which you are need to strengthen up your army. And even with that help, you'll be grinding helplessly for missing ingredients. Secondly, some quests supposing that you're going to beat some tough enemies, which can be done only with help of friends.Why I'm talking about Facebook friends so much? For it's not the game FROM Facebook. It still runs ON Facebook, and Steam there acting just as middleman. If you don't have Facebook account or if your account is made not for gaming (like you don't want to invite hundreds of unknown people just to play along them) - you can start the game, but certainly you will not succeed in King's Bounty Legions.So don't start. It is just another grindfest, where you can't play like you want it, but need to wait until some hero's ""energy"" replenishes, which takes hours of real time. You can't get very far in it without supplement of at least 10-20 constantly playing facebook ""friends"". And you'll need hundreds of hours to achieve same things as normal game will give you in 10 hours...Mark 5/10. Time-wasting facebook grindfest game. There are so many more ""free-to-play"" games on the market, that are much better in terms of gameplay, even if they might not look so gorgeous as ""Legions"". And there are original single-player King's Bounty games, which are good. Just not mess with ""Legions"", it's a bad idea, that will turn you down after some time.			"

												A very simplistic turn-based combat game, too simplistic, nothing special going for it, there's many older games that pull off the old grid based combat so much better. The main problem with King's Bounty: Legions is there's a lack of elements which makes grid combat interesting such as distance on ranged attacks, obstructions, and positioning! The game will also persistently bug you about sharing things to Facebook, I feel it sort of belongs there amidst all the other games that require you to fall into zombie state to play.“Amazing job.” Kotaku I hope that's sarcasm Kotaku, or an unfinished paragraph.

												Boring pay-to-win grind fest. The ""strategy"" is virtually non-existent in the battles.How to win PvP?1) Be a higher level (and therefore have more units) than your opponent. YOU WIN!2) Have dragons (dragons are OP). YOU WIN!3) Don't be a lower level and dont not have dragons.4) How do you get dragons?  Pay-to-win!How to win PvE?1) You cant! After a certain point, fighting PvE costs more gold to replenish your troops than you win from the battles.  After that, you are left to grind against easy opponent for the daily reward of free common units until they catch up with your level (but you can never earn enough uncommon or special units this way) and tiny amounts of gold to upgrade whatever untis you have enough of to field.  Or you pay-to-win.  "

												Don't play this.  Abusive F2P model that utterly ruins the Legacy of the King's bounty series, with a broken system of getting party members & getting the members you want is extremely expensive, & easy to abuse with Real money currency.Sadly the very introduction of the Real money system is what breaks the entire system, as it massively inflates the cost of the buyable party members, to the point, of it being unreasonable to even attempt to keep a full party worth of each type of minion you have.  It also makes the 'free' premium characters you get worthelss after a few levels gained because you can't keep pu their numbers, and they become weaker then a full slot of farmers.That is also to state, there is No Steam support, steam friends mean nothing for htis game, the only multi-player where friends count or matter, is Facebook or you having to  spend the limited free premium currency on the temporary 'AI friends' slot filling item, if you want to keep playing on your Steam profile.2/10  Functional, but nothing more then a massive insult towards the fans of the Kings bounty series.   Do not support this game.			"

												Facebook adaptation of the Kings Bounty series. While they did an OK job and I guess existence of a facebook version of game can be justified as not everyone have PCs. But there is no reason to play a gimped up version riddled with mechanics that encourage microtransaction and other social gaming nonsense when you can play the real deal. You can get King's Bounty: Platinum Edition for 7.50$ on a sale and 1 dlc of this game costs more than that. Credit when it's due, this game does give you the option of PvP which you can't get from the others versions. If that's an important feature for you, you might tolerate the baggage it comes with but it's not worth for me.			"

												Sigh!  Was looking forward to this as I enjoyed the previous releases but it seems the developers thought converting it into a Facebook Micro Transaction game would be a good idea,  well it wasn't, it's annoying and not why we buy games on Steam.Yet another game series that's come to a halt in my book.

												I can't recommend this game, but you might like it.The game-play itself is actually pretty fun, and the combat is decent enough.  However, this game constantly tries to get you to use Facebook to get / share extra rewards with friends.  And it makes it feel like a facebook game.  That little fact, above all else, absolutely ruined this game for me.However, the game is free, and like I said, it can be pretty fun.  If you're broke and looking for a turn-based strategy, this could be a great little time waster for you!  I don't think you lose anything by not connecting with facebook, but you will be annoyed by the constant requests to do so (at the end of every quest / battle).Honestly, the devs made a decent game.  I'd love to give it more of a chance, but the whole facebook thing just throws me off.  If you don't think that something like that would bother you, you should totally check this game out.5/10.  Wonderful game absolutely ruined by Facebook Nagging.			"

												A good attempt at a free low budget multiplayer spin off of the king's bounty genre, but single player experience is very disappointing.As a fan of the King's bounty series, this seemed like a great idea - and the inital hours of free-to-play games usually are (in order to draw you in) - but the game quickly looses pace, and annoying, trying to lure you into spending money in order to speed up the ever increasingly grinding rate of play.There are a number of excellent new ideas (especially : paying a lot for new units, and then being able to resurrect them after battles for a fraction of the cost, and a global army! - very good idea) - but that game constantly strangled by wait-to-play and pay-to-play / free-to-play restrictions.Would much rather spend money up front to pay for a game. The idea of people using money to gain advantage over other players instead of using skill is abhorrent and I refuse to entertain it.Therefore I cannot recommend this game, unless you are keen on some multiplayer between friends - or you are a die hard fan of the genre and want to experience the new concepts.

												This is obviously a game made for facebook.Every time you start a mission you are supposed to share with friends on facebook, which closes the game. Then after the very short, timer will skip your turn, very simple battle you are supposed to share on facebook, which closes the game.The game has been dumbed down so much from the original Kings Bounty games that a trained monkey can play it.Obvioulsy pay to win, you get only very basic units for free, I mean who doesn't want to fight paladins with free peasants right?!?!?!?!Just skip it, unless you want something to do in between sharing kitten videos with your friends on facebook every 30 seconds.

												This game looks artsy and colourful up front, and i had high hopes. after playing age of wonders, i thought i'd come into this game to have fun. The first thing that put my hopes down, was a facebook login. I got very frightend at the idea. most facebook games are bad, and this game follows that trait.Bad musics and sounds. i wish i had the sounds off, it was awful, it wasn't enjoyable at all, and worst didnt fit anything i was doing.Art design. i still don't know who the ♥♥♥♥ was what and why they did what they did, after only 2 battles. i could barely tell if there were assigned colours or not. this got even more confusing when the 'turn based' element was implemented poorly.Gameplay. how do you mess up turn based, first it's someones turn, then its the next. in this game it thinks every character is a different player, and it's quite confusing at times to understand what the hell is going on. this isnt like final fantasy X, where it had a neat little side bar to say,  this person is next because they're fast. there is no warning, or understanding. (unless i had to read that, which i didnt)Tutorial. god knows if i even finnished that tutorial, but it was awful. a bunch of text with no highlights stopping me from playing how i wanted to. it forced me to use elements that at the time i thought were a terrible idea. it even stated for me to kill the big guy first, and not giving me much option, or reasoning. i should be lead to do what i want, not be forced to.The end of two levels. After the two levels i played it led me to some sort of buy screen. i don't know what i was doing when i was in that screen, whether i was buying more units, or buying backup units. but the idea was i had to use in game currency to do so, and with that, i left. I do not wish to spend days playing a game, to get some currency to get higher level items. theres no fun. no race differenciantions, nothing. Again, comparitavely to games we've seen 10 years in the past, this game is still rubbish in comparison. an epic battlefield, consisting of 5 blokes with rope for pants and 5 meters appart fighting over something probably as trivial as a stick.

												This game is all about hexagonal battles. Turn based. There s also a crafting mechanic, but the common drops won't provide you the best stuff, of course. And they re so hugely expensive on the microtransaction market.For fun if you think on your smartphone to kill some time, not the same on PC.It is totally Facebookish.Since its progression and army gathering is slow, it s well dominated by cashers, like most of free-to-play games.If you dont spend money on it, neither a 24h of daily playing will catch you up on PvP.It has beautiful graphics tough.Would give it a 6/10 if wasnt the so recurring money presence, turning it to be a non-recommended game overall and only recommended to the fans of its gamestyle.

I know some people like being knights but it is limited. I wanted to be undead, good luck with that unless you play the entire map to get them in the end.Second even bigger hurdle. You can only take one of each type of unit!! You can't have 3 magical units or 3 defender units etc. You have to have exactly 1 of each of the 5 combat types.Sorry but this is too limited for me.

												Having played the original for Sega Genesis, I had to try this game. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The music wasn't bad, though not as catchy as the original, IMO. The gameplay is where the largest difference was. There is hardly a connection to the original, other than unit type and battle similarities.The methods by which troops are recruited are totally different. The basic units could be hired at the home castle, but exotic units would have to be hired from their lairs in the unexplored wilderness. Part of the challenge and fun was finding some of the more rare units during your travels. In fact, there is no exploring at all in the new game. You must defeat a predetermined number of groups of enemies before being able to advance to the next town. The new game is repetitive and slow in its progression. The battles lack the save level of dynamics and difficulty of the original. Although there are some character upgrades (equipment, etc.), you are limited to one character. The original offered 3 different characters with different strengths (income and rank, leadership, and magic). Overall, there was more freedom in the original, and everything, from the music to the exploration and battles, was more interesting. The new game lacks challenge and is very tedious. The game name ""King's Bounty"" shouldn't be associated with this game.			"

												... I know, it's a Facebook game... I know it's made by Nival - those Russians that milk all their on-line games... I know it had bad reviews by most players... but I wanted to see it for myself...Well, I've seen it. Story sucks badly. Basically do not read and just go where the icon puts you, battle, win and claim the reward. Nothing overly hard there. And with one of the packs it's even easier because you really PAY to WIN your battles with big, bad beasties.But the thing that annoys me the most is every 2 battles that ♥♥♥♥ing pop-up to share gold with your friends on Facebook. Guys, we're on Steam. No Facebook at all there (aside from the connection Steam opts for screenshot sharing). I'm really not gonna give this game (or any other app for that matter) access to my Facebook account!And then I hit level 8 and get 2 quests I MUST connect to Facebook to find other players to complete the quest. NO ♥♥♥♥ING WAY! I'm done with this game. As I said before - I AM NOT GONNA LINK TO FACEBOOK YOU RUSSIAN MORONS!Good thing the DLC pack came from a bundle. It was fun while it lasted (2 hours) and am not gonna touch this one again.			"

												I'm kind of saddened by this game. After the wonderful Armored Princess, Crossworlds, and North King's Bounty games, Legions comes in with not much changed graphically. What they have changed, though, is that it is now Free to Play. While I am fine with this in general, this is one of those F2P changes that feels wrong given what the game is about. In the past games, you could in theory stack your army with very powerful units (although a low number since your character level and thus ""Leadership"" is low) if you won early battles and knew where to recruit. Replacing this deep and interesting mechanic are paid ""Starter Packs"", which are not nearly as diverse or interesting as a custom crafted army, or you can buy Booster Packs or units with real money. Even this state of affairs could have been remedied if I had some early access to a wide variety of units, some of which would be the higher tier units. This is simply not the case almost 10 hours into the game. I am stuck either rolling the 2-3 strongish units (even though my Leadership could support 6-7), or having to constantly spend gold on a very sparse selection of troops to replace heavy losses from crappy troops. I mean, I shouldn't have to buy Archers as my only replenishable ranged choice. At least open it up so I can recruit any low level archer.I really hope the devs go back, do a proper update of the engine, and release a game for $20 and remove the game killing mechanics that support the F2P model. It just doesn't work for King's Bounty.You're better off buying the earlier games.			"

												I'd like to start off by saying that I loved the original King's bounty, played most expansions and enjoyed all of them. This is the multiplayer version, supported by the P2W model. It has the same graphic style, largely the same units, yet it feels wrong. While I had no problems with the Kings Bounty series before army management was intuitive, here I find too many parameters to manage. Half a dozen resistances, special abilities, unit levels, special unlocks, auras, equipment creation, dozens of different scraps of materials that mobs drop. Simply too much for me, and not enough novelty to keep me engaged.Also his game has been stripped of all depth that made it's predecessors fun.Not to mention the free-to-play nature of the game is relentlessly, aggressively in your face begging for money.Of course if you are looking for a grinding game, this one may keep you occupied for a very long time.Overall 6/10.

												Having played Heroes of Might & Magic and original King's Bounty, this game looked like fun. Even though I knew it was free and I know that any developer doesn't work for free, I expected better than I got.No matter what you are being told otherwise, this game is pay to play. It is one step worse than pay to win. Even though it looks like you could progress  through the game in the early stages, sooner than later you'll run into the problem of having to grind the same levels all over, just to get some low-tier creatures. Forget about the higher level or even the legendary. You need them to win, but you'll be lucky if you get them from a lucky chest or as an in-game reward.Eventually you'll get stuck, having a mediocre army, mediocre artifacts and nothing left to do other then to grind the same levels over and over again.The PvP sucks as well. You might get lucky if there are players roughly on your level, but you could just as easily be paired with either a very high-level opponent or someone who put cash into the game and easily kicks your♥♥♥♥♥♥Story is almost non-existing. Spells are limited in usability, fight-map is too small. The game is also pretty slow, in having to always load (maybe synching with the servers?).In the end, I just deleted this game (level 22) and just re-installed HoMM5.			"

												As a great fan of the King's Bounty series, this is a game which I will no longer touch. Even though the campaign battles can be interesting, there are several reasons why I gave up playing the game:1) Slow in-game gold revenue where you basically can't fill up your ranks to the maximum once you level up. Once you do have enough gold, you log in to see that you have been robbed of it (see point 3)2) Majority of unit types are acquired through the story, but no camps/missions to increase their numbers.3) This game is purely pay to win and the PvP is awfull:-  Invest money and get those elite troops which you can use to roll over new players which are 10+ levels below you. Do rob them of their well-needed gold! - No level balancing between PvP players...Too bad, but I'll be back playing the original offline games!			"

ProsPvP in the game is decent and alot of strategy involved.Its free.If your rich this game is for you.ConsIf you play for free you are going to lose alot and i mean alot! The game constantly nags at you to get on facebook, share with friends.Feels like playing a cash cow. "

												This game is really looks like single-player Kings Bounty, however there is no any good story in it. It simply tactical simulator, and if you like combats in style of Heroes series - it could help to you to kill time of evening or two. But never try to bought crystals (in-game currency) in it - I try it myself, money were charged from Steam account, but no crystalls were added to my in-game vault. I wrote a ticket for game support - and they even didn't answer for it after a week of waiting. So it seems that them will never answer on it.			"

												Facebook game with microtransactions. It's also very Pay to Win. Eventually single player slows down and the creatures you face are simply too tough considering the units you are given through progression (ie. not paid). Also, unless you pay, get used to using the basic units. In fact, even if you pay, get used to using the basic units.After getting a free $30 pack, i crushed face mercilessly. Eventually I outleveled the benefits of the pack though, so I'm right back to where I was. This is because the packs only give you so many creatures. Once you get higher level, you won't have enough creatures to fill out an army without paying more money, so unfortunately it's best to just stick to basic human units. Had I bought the $30 pack with money, it would have been a waste. Only buy the pack if you are going to use it from level 1 and even then it's overpriced.Rather grindy after level 24 or so. Prepare to simply repeat the same 2-3 missions twenty times to level up.			"

The fact that you need your friends to play so you can complete a mission really bugs me because none of my friends have this game. They won't even try it because they think that it looks weird, but trust me, the gameplay is better than you expect. I would rate this game 9/10. If there was a way to get around the missions where you need your friends then it would be a 10/10. Other than that the game is amazing, addicting (in a good way), and fun.			"

It is an annoying social game, so you going to be cancelling Facebook sharing popups a lot.  Easy game and Good for wasting time on.Try it, maybe you might like it.For more info:

												I've been playing this game for months, and generally enjoyed it.  But as of today, the game will no longer play.  It says the ""server send an empty reply to the request"" or something like that.  Talked to another person who has been playing and they get the same thing today.  It worked for both of us yesteday.So, it appears the game is dead and the authors of the game didn't even bother to post any information regarding their apparent decision to kill it.  On Kongregate, the last activity from Nival was on Jan 14th.  It appears it is dead now.Ergo, I can no longer recommend this game.Addittional comments (though nobody will likely ever read this).  The early part of the game is excellent, especially if you liked the previous King's Bounty standalone games.  However, once you reach about level 30, there really is no point in continuing to play.  The game is designed to require you to put in serious money if you want to make it to the top 500 player lists.  I calculate that you'd likely have to spend anywhere from $350 to $2,000 to make it as a relatively serious player.  Because of that, it's simply not worth playing further.  Now I did make it to level 38, the effective maximum in the game, but it is impossible to build the top equipment without paying money.  Why?  Because the top (probably thousand+ players) have already done so, and it is impossible to beat them in battle player-verses-player which is the ONLY way you can get certain items that are REQUIRED to improve your equipment.  It simply is not fun to lose battle after battle, day after day, pursuing the competition which is totally unbeatable.			"

												King's bounty could never live up to the legend of Heroes of Might and Magic III, but then nothing can. Unfortunately this game doesn't even live up to the prequels of King's Bounty.It's one of those browser type of games where you pour down tons of money in order to beat your oponents, aka pay-to-win. As far as the browser ptw genre is concerned this is better than average in graphics, sound and theme, but lacks a more in-depth economy, common in the genre.In short, King's Bounty Legends aims at many different audiences instead of focusing on pleasing what the core fanbase might have been interested in paying for.

												good little game bit like chess but steam friends join you with ranged and next-to fighters all have differnet abilities and its fun to try and finish without losing any pieces.friends online within 24hrs also allow you a spell off their name ingame which rotate ..so certain high lvl friends have ressurect spells which are handy ^^.good easy game can play when you want and even run away if you have to stop playing.logging in every 24hrs for a full week grants you diamonds which accumulate and then you can spend them in the market.8/10 for a simple game but clever.1 bad thing worth mentioning is the way steam/game friendslist is together as it makes it hard to see who lays the game and who doesnt and with 300friends its a nightmare.   0range			"

												I played this back when it first came out, and while I liked it, it never really clicked with me, either because I hate Facebook or because it had a bunch of energy systems and such that existed mostly to grief you for playing it. I tried it again now that it came out on Steam, though, and it's gotten a lot better.Basically it's the new King's Bounty games as a social game / MMO-lite, with fairly predictable upsides and downsides. While I think I still prefer the offline ones, it's honestly one of the best social games I've ever played, being both fun as a game in general and clearly using the social mechanics usefully rather than just being ""Diablo, but you can play it in your browser"" - a thing some of the other 'good' social games I've played suffered from.It's free to play, and while it whines at you to log into it via Facebook, you don't have to in order to try it out. So, yeah. Trying it out comes in highly recommended by Imban!			"

												I hate the concept of the watered-down social-networking-game as much as anyone, but it is kind of hard to complain super-hard in my opinion about ""yet another King's Bounty remake,"" even if this is clearly the worst of the new lot due to the aforementioned factors.If nothing else, the inability to save and load as in the offline versions of the game instantly makes the gameplay interesting to me, as it means I have to put far more thought into my actions.  Even though of course it would be nice if I also had a baby dragon or valkyries to supplement combat in addition to my armies (plus, are there only scrolls?  No permanent spells?  Dumb).  Plus, some of the changes made to the basic formula of the game actually create excitement in ways the regular series does not really do--the first time I found my army in the middle of the field and enemies on both sides, I think I said ""OH ♥♥♥♥ (not ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥!  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)"" out loud because it was so amazingly unexpected.But yes, I definitely recommend anyone who loves the King's Bounty reboot series check this out--I mean, free is free after all.  You can see where they try to gouge you with pay-to-improve transactions, but the game is also fun without them.			"

												This game could be good or bad depending if you like similar type of games. I am a free player never purchased anything. This game is defenitely not a Pay-2-Win game. I have been playing this game for over 3 months now and played many in game hours across different platforms using Facebook.I strongly recommend you to think strategically and have a lot of patience!In order to win in PvP, you either invest real money OR a lot of time. Everything in the game is craftable and upgradeable for free given enough time. If you have patience to grind through, you should be fine. My PvP record is quite good 31 wins and 5 losses. For those who find PvP difficult, they usually level up too fast and did not upgrade everything. Be patient, this is a social game. You will need a lot of friends to help you unlock the wanted missions. Those missions will give you free units. Daily quests will also give you free units. I believe you should have everything upgraded eventually if you are patiently enough. That should take 3 years maybe. This is a true long grind. Play this when you want to kill time.			"

												Try this one out!I started as a Heroes of Might and Magic III fan. Came upon King's Bounty desktop version a while ago. And even though some People might disagree, I think it is quite similar to HOMM III and quite fun to play too. And now the free online version gives you tons of free game time.Even though it requires a facebook account for some features, it is not necessary at all. I play the game without login in to facebook (I play it via steam only) at any time and still have fun :DYou can play king's Bounty: Legions without spending any real money, too. Just be patient to get a good army together ;)But hey, playing the game is fun. Just don't take it too serious. And add friends!			"

												As with most free-to-play multiplayer games, progress is very slow unless you invest something to it. I didn't and I am able to play missions as they appear with no interaction with other players at all, few combats every day. However playing with human opponents is suicide - even with same rank their armies are superior. But it is ok for me, other people are what ruins my experience in every multiplayer game. So when I can avoid it I take it as advantage.Almost everything is taken from King's Bounty series (music, graphic,....), especially soundtrack is great but soon becomes repetitive.Recommended for casual playing, I can't rate real multiplayer game experience			"

												A qualified thumbs up: if you this absolutely free...prepare for hard grind. I was getting bored of the pay2win & facebook prompts and lack of gold to grow my army to the allowed size each time I levelled up. Then a couple of things happened: first, while searching for promo codes I found the ""King's Bounty: Legions True Tactician Ultimate Pack"" as part of a 10-game ""Brutal Bundle"" of Steam games for less than a fiver and the item powerups totally changed the game. Second, feeling more powerful and bolder I tried 'Raiding' (gold rolls in) and PvP (well you know how it feels different to beat a real person...and more gold). Now the game feels properly fun. Pay2win? Maybe. I reckon they should just sell it at App prices so everyone who plays it can have fun!			"

												I am new to the series, with that said I do enjoy this game. I've spent quite a few hours playing it and have bought some gems (I believe if you enjoy a free to play game its only right to buy some stuff). Pros-The game is fun and has a decent level of depth to the strategy and diverse content.-You can let the ai play for you, which is great when you want to watch a movie and play the game at the same time.-A multitude of deiffering monsters and soldiers to pick from.-UI is easy to navigate and understand, except for the chat system.-Units are very indepth with different abilities and counter classes.Cons-Adding friends is a pain and a chore, I made the mistake of signing up through my facebook, after trying for a few hours to find out how to add steam friends I couldn't figure it out.(To fix this I would just do what normal games do and add friends through the game, then add a facebook friend option as a secondary method).-the chat sytem is a pain, it constantly put me back into the sytem chatbox, only shows two boxes at a time which forces me to scroll to the clan chat. You can't talk in chat or clan chat while in a fight.- Again I understand the p2w model and am not against it for the most part. But to keep your legendary and even ""blue"" units topped off at full strength you don't have many other options which will cause you to stall out at around level 20+.(A solution I can see would be to allow players to save up items and use them along with a long cooldown to upgrade unit I.E a knight with several pieces of armor can be trained into a paladin, A swordsmen can be trained into a knight. this would give a deeper crafting system and not make players feel overly pressured into buying units with gems).- the gems don't feel scaled stuff is a little expensive like a paladin costing 28 gems, thats fine if I was only buying one every couple levels but not when I need a new paladin every level.This is just a brief review I'm sure I am missing a few points but over all I would recommend this game. If you have any questions please ask.12/20/2013*I did leave out the reason I recommended the game. It is a pretty simple reason its free, even though it is a very face bookish game (seeing as how it started tha way) the quality and level of work is pretty damn high. I doubt we will see any significant change to the game; almost never do. The bottom line is it's worth picking up for free and messing around with it as far as a tactics game goes.			"

												Brings a lot of what you have enjoyed of the King's Bounty fighting style, much more simplistic and limited roam as well as more intuitive battle ranking system. Seems to have a decent amount of content though is driven very much in a Facebook Game style type of play. You are encouraged to spam your friends and in all honesty, it would probably be better just to play this game on Facebook directly. I have enjoyed the game in the lower levels, but I am prepared for long episodes of grinding that will almost certainly be required.			"

												Pretty much a fun game, something you can do while your board or in the car. Just gets extremely hard to play free once you get to level 10 after that you kinda need to buy some good soldiers or go out there grinding on side quest.			"

												This game is fairly true to the original King's Bounty games, with a few adjustments made here and there to fit the system they're using. What it doesn't tell you is about the RMT / Social media tie-ins to the game. So far though, the only thing that has been obtrusive is the constant asking to post things to Facebook, but the gameplay has been good enough for me to put up with it. I think any fan of the King's Bounty line would enjoy this game if they can ignore the ""share with friends?!"" boxes popping up.			"

												Originally featured on Kongregate.com, King's Bounty Legions borrows the popular working formula from the original King's Bounty series. To accomodate casual player and to become a MMO, NivalPublishing watered down the brutality of the original series. Instead of loosing troops and lose the ability to hire them again, the hire pool refreshes every daily. Immortal and Legendary units are rehirable at a price as they are unavaliable to replanish on the map. Unlike other MMOs on the market which requires a lot of attention to maintain a well equipted account, Legions tries to accomodate gamers who are able to commit less than an hour a day by introducing dailies which can be completed in minutes and a patrol mode.In patrol mode, the player leaves the avatar at a location and the AI does battles over time. The player can sustain losses in this mode. However, in a reasonable location, a positive income together with additional rewards makes Legions a game for busy people.Legions demostrates great promise with a good compromise between free and paid gamers. However, increasingly powerful and pricey units found on the Royal Shop (the Cash Shop on King's Bounty: Legions) greatly tilts the favor towards paid gamers in the PVP arena. (*I am trying to remember whether PVP yields any unique rewards. If it does, the game would greatly favor paying customers with a fat wallet).Fortunately, the the game redeems itself by introducing a Raid feature which pits players against various other player's teams and everything boils down to defeating the AI which controls them.What further irks me is the inability to transfer progression between different platforms. In my case, my progress from Kongregate to Steam.Still, this game is a good introduction for players who are undecided on purchasing the original King's Bounty series, a new to turn based role playing game or an online world to test their skills against other like minded gamers.

												See those 1000+ minutes played? Those were all I could handle of this white knuckle, adrenaline inducing ride that is King's Bounty: Legions! From the title screen to the ""Out of date version"" error, every second of every minute of this adrenaline fuelled orgy is just A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. I can't for the life of me understand why you are reading this and not trying to play the game!Sure it crashes as soon as you tell it to 'update' and therefore the game is unplayable BUT YOU NEED TO SEE THE UNSEEABLE, TOUCH THE UNTOUCHABLE1!1 See how this game makes you think, beyond the borders, of the screen!Buy a 4-pack, share the fun.King's bounty: Crash Edition GOTY Version is the most fun you'll EVER have on the fantastic journey, back to your desktop.TEN OUTTA TEN!So seriously, what am I doing? Why do I have 1000+ hours?King's Bounty: Legions comes from a long line of King Bounty games, which in turn come from an even longer line of King Bounty games, yeah crazy right?King's bounty started life on the Amiga and was ported to several other home computers before morphing into the Heroes of Might and Magic series which still runs today. King's bounty was shelved, Heroes of Might & Magic lived on and Nival bought the rights to King's Bounty making their own series of games, similar to the original but with a modern take in terms of graphics and gameplay style.Legions is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of those newer games, being more PvP centered which is great. What's not so great is those 1000+ hrs? Yeah, the grind. Oh don't worry Rich American/Russian/Chinese player, you can buy the best PVP gear in the game, but it will cost you. How much? About $1000 during an ingame sale and double that outside of it. Rather unsurprisingly I opted to grind out my gear instead and 1000+ hrs later, I still don't have all of it, infact I have non of the pieces, it's that bad!If you like HoMM or KB and always wanted some multiplayer style PvP then HoMM has that, but KB never did, so this game is the only chance you will get for that. Bring a fat wallet, or prepare to give up your social life though because as you can guess, this is pay to win and if you don't have top tier gear, then someone richer or with more time invested than you is going to kill you very quickly.Also link up to your facebook account or else the game is nigh unplayable, many features are cut from the steam release.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												New Review: I was wrong. I'm sorry. I made a mistake, and reviewed a game before getting too far. The game has a serious, serious issue. You know how, I mentioned the patrol system? It doesn't scale right. Once that happens, there's only one way to get enough gold. And that is by subscribing. And, the story...well, it sucks. Here. I did a full review: http://gameolosophy.com/games/kings-bounty-legions/Kill. This. Game. With. Fire. Old Review: *Breathes in* It has issues with microtransactions, yeah. It's a facebook game ported to Steam. That said...there ARE ways to handle the microtransactions, and I especially like the patrol system. If you can keep your Gold up with patrols, you can make it with the non-microtransaction units. And, it does have the sense of humor that makes King's Bounty fun.That said...Wanted is, in fact, annoying. You can't make it without either friends, or real cash. Fortunately, it's optional. Unfortunately, I wanna do it. If you're already playing, Friend me.			"

												TL;DR: Better than expected. Not a waste of time.Basically, this is a Facebook game. At least I think it's an import from FB, since you can share to your wall and it has that terrible hand-holding tutorial for the first 10 mins of gameplay. Try to power through the big dumb CLICK HERE YOU IDIOT buttons and when the game opens up a bit more it's very fun. It has Might and Magic/King's Bounty style combat, but none of the overworld parts (Which I never really cared for a ton anyway). Units are stacked and your attacks chew through each individual guy's HP until you kill the whole stack. The focus on Combat and army building over the larger scale city building and adventuring is welcome for me, others may not like that. It reminds me of playing a somewhat obscure Playstation 2 game, Gladius, since it's fight after fight with a bit of crafting and a quest between each one. I'd say give it a try, but be careful of microtransactions. Not sure how good the PvP is yet, or if there's pay-to-win, but I wouldn't be surprised. It's a fun, cut down King's Bounty experience though.			"

												King's Bounty: Legions deserves a bounty of 48 (48/100)King's Bounty: Legions is a Facebook game on Steam. Is it fun, that is debateable. I would not persoanlly play a lot of this game but I do recommend all to at least try this game. It may suprisingly be fun to you though it is not fun me to. It has a unique type of gameplay that can be attractive to a certain audiance and worth at least a try. Story: 3/10+It has one-What is it about? No clue, too boring to read over the paragraphs of text-No voice acting+Quests, which means a lot of stories if you truly want to get into the lure of the gameEnvironment: 7/10+Looks goo,d not gonna lie, didn't get far in game so cannot tell how much variety there is but from what I've played, looks good+I like the style of the environment ^,^Controls: 6/10+/- Requires only a mouse+Easy controls+Simplistic user interfaceGameplay: 5/10+Fun and can be challenging-Gets repatative -Microtransactions to unlock the better units+Each homestead or settlement comes with different challenges and objectives, makes it fun+Unique and differentMultiplayer: 3/10+It has PvP and Clans-Have not found PvP or clans-No chat system :/ seriously?

												Played it for two hours, enough to figure out the basics of how the game works. Graphics aren't anything special, but they do the trick. Sound effects and music are the same as graphics. If you like turn based strategy games, this ones actually pretty fun. You don't need a facebook account, I havent run into any timed gameplay limits (stamina bars or whatever), and you don't really need to spend any money. I'd say its well worth a try.			"

												First off it needs to be said that this is a facebook game.  It takes that social nattery about sharing every single thing like taking a♥♥♥♥♥♥with your friends.  So if you don't like that kind of trash don't even bother playing the game.  It is also heavily Pay to Win typical facebook malarky.  So if you are not a fan of this then you should also stay clear.  It also has other frustrating elements of gameplay and while the tutorial explains some things it is very bla and a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥  Also having to pay gold (which is in way too short supply in the game) to revive fallen units can be annoying.  Also 30 minute cooldowns to re-do a mission is a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥so if some lame little character says ""collect 2 of these quest items and turn it back into me!"" my advice is to not turn it in so that you can actually have some fight to do over and over instead of having to wait for all the other cooldowns.Another con is it also has some of the worst starting content in a game.  You should never punish players and make it as boring as this game does in the beginning by having to basically criple your army to unlock enough areas to actually be able to progress your character.  So dumb.  As I played I kept thinking things like ""man this game sucks"" and ""I hate this soooooo much"" but I stuck it out since someone told me it will be a good game to pass the time.So why am I writing that I recommend the game?  I ended up getting a creature called the ""emrald dragon"" from some lucky box thing which generally gives you extremely pitiful amounts of gold (takes 2000 gold to get 1 unit that doesn't suck and you generally get 50-150 from opening the chests.)Once I gained this creature that had the ability to heal and resurect creatures around me and could do it 3 times a battle the game actually changed into something more like Kings Bounty.  I found myself playing the game around the concept of running a perfect game w/o losing any creatures each whatever I did.  And it took on an interesting form of gameplay that was actually fun.  I was suddenly playing towards the strategy of the game instead of some, no fun, facebook social nattering, invasive, pay to win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t fest.I found myself shocked that I was actually having fun.  A lot of fun.  In the end though with all the other BS the game has going for it I don't write a strong recommendation for this game but a very mild ""it will help pass the time and it's free and you might have fun if you stick it out.""This game isn't for everyone, and in the beginning it wasn't for me and it won't be for most if you don't want to deal with that facebook social sharing nonsense (since let's face it we play games on steam so we don't have to deal with that trash.)  If you want a really fun game and are willing to drop some money I would say get the real Kings Bounty over this, but as for free to play games it's not so bad if you can actually get into it.However in the end the way the PvP is completely broken and the way it trys to force players who want to do anything to have to shell out obscene amounts of money I can't recommend it in good faith to any other player.

												Over 4000 hours spent on that game. Most of that was only being online to monitor my alliance chat, but you can guess I played a lot. Do I recommend the game? In it's current state, hell no!  Why? Here are some reasons:Nival never showed even a tenth of an ounce of respect for their customers. People tried so hard to communicate with them, working on new ideas and sugestions about how to implement them in a way that the game would thrive instead of dying like it has been over the last 12-18 months. I played this game so much and wanted it to get better. Instead, they implemented a stamina mechanic that totally makes the game unplayable for newcomers. This totally killed the community as old players were quitting faster than new ""regular"" players coming in. About 24 months ago, when I started playing, it was a decent F2P. The P2W was there but you could still (slowly) progress without paying. Then, maybe 18 months or so ago, they implemented the stamina, which was not too much of a hassle for me as I had so many creatures I could use. But then, people started quitting. Others tried to open dialogue with Nival to improve the game. Nival gently told us to f**k off by deleting our forum posts. The message was clear : we don't give a s**t about what's going on and what you think. We are in charge and we will shamelessly ask you for money so you can replenish your troops stamina, troops which for some are only obtainable by spending in game currency or PVPing (but PVP matchmaking is broken anyway!). So basically, pay for troops, then pay to play with them if you are unlucky enough to have more than only a few minute for your play session.But most of all, pay for gems that we will take forever to send you. I once bought gems that they took over 2 weeks to deliver to my account. After the 10th of 12th day, I asked them for a refund, and their answer was that I was too late, according to their policy, to be eligible for a refund. I am being told that I am late when I waited over 10 days for something that should have been delivered instantly? Honestly, I don't know if it's the game itself that sucks, or the team behind it that can't seem to get their s**it together, but there's definately something fishy going on.			"

												Gameplay 5/10Starting out nice, you have some troops and battle your way through the cities and villages. Good looking development for units (goes very expensive in microtransactions). You can can buy equipment at the royal shop (Extremely expensive for my taste, I saw a sword at 2300 in-game currency = about 150euro) correct me if i am wrong (still rubbing my eyes)Music 3/10Didn't really catch my attetion. sound effects of some dying units remind me of +18 movies lolPVP gameplay 2/10I did 5 duels at level 9, got matched up with opponents of level 15.... They had much bigger armies and i had to watch myself get defeted (couldn't find a quit/surrender button) and I have paid for some in-game currency to buy stronger units for this!Graphics 6/10Just like in the screens on the store pageSummary: I got to lvl 13 and i'm dropping it, storyline battle got harder and i assume this is the part where you pay big money. Nice game, if you like it check out the other kings bounty games!			"

												This game is garbage.  Its a HIGHLY pay-2-win bs game.  Even if you buy any of the legion packs or DLC to get a jump start it doesnt matter.  The secret is the units all need to be upgraded 15xunit x 10 unit slots per garrison/main army.  This can be upwards of probably 3-4 months of mind numbing grinding and friend whoring to facebook.  Your other option is to pay like 100$ for in game ""gems"" to upgrade your stuff instantly and to actually buy new units.  Thats the other hidden trick, as you level your army is allowed to have more units in it which everything but the ♥♥♥♥♥iest units have to be bought thru gems or daily quests and theres no way to max that out and the best units ""aka Dragons"" are like 40 gems a pop.  So yea this game is a big bend you over and♥♥♥♥♥♥your wallet game.  Not really worth while.			"

												Watered down, uninteresting version of King's Bounty: The Legend and its nice sequels. This started as Facebook game (which is where I tried it initially, long enough to see all the features) with microtransactions and a wait-or-pay-to-play system. Facebook login is not required to play unless you want any of the sharing features or cross-platform play with browser and mobile. Typical for this kind of game, you can expect constant ""share this with your friends!"" prompts and an unskippable mission to send gifts to friends, and so on.It pesters you to share your Missionrewards with friends on your Facebookpage after every damn mission.You get equippment by gathering small pieces after every kill, and the Tutorial is one of those ""klick exactly what i tell you to for 10 minutes"" things.

												Everything the critics say about this game is true - microtransactions and facebook nag - but it is still hugely addictive and good fun if it's your kind of game. You can play (and win pvp sometimes) without paying if you're prepared to be very patient. But I found it more fun to pay something (as a PC gamer I expect that, right?) for an easier early game ride.A few tips, having played partway with (separate) Steam and facebook login games:1. Decide if you want to link with facebook from the start. If you start off logging in through Steam, you'll lose any friends (but not progress) you make when you switch to fb. (Irritating I guess, but not the end of the world.) NB. YOU CAN'T DO 'WANTED' BATTLES IF YOU LOG IN THROUGH STEAM. You've been warned!2. Steam friends can be 'invited' for bonus gold (I think x2) for a single battle. Not shabby...just find the 'add me' discussion in the KB: Legions group and add everyone (they don't seem to need to accept).3. With fb you can do 'wanted' battles for units, but the friend invite mechanic is different and so far despite adding loads of fb 'friends' I have a v. short list of invitable 'friends' to boost battle gold (I'm earlier in my fb game than the Steam one so hopefully it's just something I still need to figure out).3. Steam vs. facebook login? So far I give it to Steam for gold, but fb for units. On Steam I bought DLC for units, then used friend invites to get faster gold and level my units. On fb I'll do 'wanted' battles to fill up units and accept slower levelling (maybe).4. Go find the codes for free stuff! Not transformational but every little helps. If you do link to facebook (and only then) you can login from an iphone/ipad AND (or) an android phone and unlock BOTH the 'browser' (=steam) and 'mobile' codes, and the android exclusive emerald dragon code. I used the bluestacks android emulator (cool in its own right) to unlock the 'mobile' codes as I don't have an android phone.That's enough for now. Good luck, have fun.			"

												10 minutes after i started playing i couldnt click on anything except settings. so after another 2 minutes of going full screen - windowed and back i gave up. i did play the game some years ago with no internet connection and it was focused on single player and it was great. i would love to play the game but since the only command available is ""setttings"" is kinda hard to enjoy anything			"

I have never seen such a game which, is this type, is so easy to learn and graphic juicy at the same time. It raises no learning difficult and you can have a lot of fun at this.I totally recommend this one, and it has Facebook build-on to play and sync with your friends! What else would you want?			"

												Great game. It was however a browser game which I had played years ago. The game has microtransactions but it doesn't kill the game as long as you do not play PvP. Gold is sometimes hard to come by but completing quests or selling old equiptment helps you. If you are a fan of Heroes of Might and Magic series, this is a watered down version of it. As some reviews say, this game should be mostly played on Iphone/Ipad and not on a PC. Piece of advice: buy DLCs only on sale.King's Bounty games that you pay $15 for are a better investment than the DLCs for this game.Good luck gaming!			"

												Over 4000 hours spent on that game. Most of that was only being online to monitor my alliance chat, but you can guess I played a lot. Do I recommend the game? In it's current state, hell no!  Why? Here are some reasons:Nival never showed even a tenth of an ounce of respect for their customers. People tried so hard to communicate with them, working on new ideas and sugestions about how to implement them in a way that the game would thrive instead of dying like it has been over the last 12-18 months. I played this game so much and wanted it to get better. Instead, they implemented a stamina mechanic that totally makes the game unplayable for newcomers. This totally killed the community as old players were quitting faster than new ""regular"" players coming in. About 24 months ago, when I started playing, it was a decent F2P. The P2W was there but you could still (slowly) progress without paying. Then, maybe 18 months or so ago, they implemented the stamina, which was not too much of a hassle for me as I had so many creatures I could use. But then, people started quitting. Others tried to open dialogue with Nival to improve the game. Nival gently told us to f**k off by deleting our forum posts. The message was clear : we don't give a s**t about what's going on and what you think. We are in charge and we will shamelessly ask you for money so you can replenish your troops stamina, troops which for some are only obtainable by spending in game currency or PVPing (but PVP matchmaking is broken anyway!). So basically, pay for troops, then pay to play with them if you are unlucky enough to have more than only a few minute for your play session.But most of all, pay for gems that we will take forever to send you. I once bought gems that they took over 2 weeks to deliver to my account. After the 10th of 12th day, I asked them for a refund, and their answer was that I was too late, according to their policy, to be eligible for a refund. I am being told that I am late when I waited over 10 days for something that should have been delivered instantly? Honestly, I don't know if it's the game itself that sucks, or the team behind it that can't seem to get their s**it together, but there's definately something fishy going on.			"

Then.YOUR UNITS HAVE NO MORAL, PLEASE WAIT 3 HOURS FOR THEM TO BATTLE.Are you absolutely kidding me dad?  I can't play video games until I get my homework done?

												After playing for a few weeks (finished the single player campaign which was quite short anyway), getting quite close to lvl30, and achieving a certain status in PvP ranking I could say two things about this game:1) maybe it's not exactly p2w but you definitely have to throw in 10-20 bucks just to start playing comfortably (I did, to buy some legendary creatures);2) the game itself is nice (I am a big fan of the single-player KB series) but it's plagued with various bugs and especially - it is not made for steam. Seriously. It's a facebook game, you cannot even access some of the most important features w/o facebook account AND it's not possible to connect steam and facebook - without erasing steam part of the account, no less. Until guys from Nival change their attitude I strongly recommend AGAINST paying them a dime - because chances are, the very next day you may not be able to log in again to use the in-game things you just bought. Check forums for more info...UPDATE: I've been playing this thing casually for a few months and now I could say for sure - yes, it is definitely p2w :) What's worse, though, is that the developer's greed killed all the fun. There is not much to do in the game after you beat the campaign but to PvP. Now, without upgrading your units to at least 8-10 level you're a cannon fodder. The problem is: the random generator is bugged and to reach the levels stated you will either be subjected to the long and extremely boring grind or... upgrade for real money. You want to experiment with different builds? I am sorry, but there are no way for steam players to get new creatures in-game. Recent update further decreased the chances to steal a unit in PvP (which was the only viable way for us so far) so chances to collect a stack of units without paying real money is now effectively 0. Now I woudln't mind throwing in a few bucks time after time but with one full stack costing about $30... And you need 5 of them... And don't forget, you'll have to upgrade them to make playable... Add it all up and think about it: why would someone pay a full price of a decent AAA game for a *chance* to have some fun in a typical facebook game with all of its shortcomings?..			"

												The game is unbalanced. The developers are gready and lazy. This is clearly a Pay To Win game. Nothing new in it. There is no tactics or strategy in this game :(			"

												wow what more can I say than this should be the game of the year, the graphics are beyond crysis and whatever crapy game engine that  excuse for a game is made with. Legions provides years worth of game play and I'm one to believe that this should be kept an eye on for the 2014 game of the year and maybe even a movie deal. None the less, exceptional game WOW!

												Dont bother. Its a fun game, but once you hit level 16-17, theres literally no quests you can complete, as the quest range jumps from 16 to 20, and the difficulty jumps enormously as well. Ive spent probably 20 hours stuck in this range grinding raids(pvp), and the dailies, and i still cant move forward. Its a paywall, plain and simple. I understand they have to make money, but Id rather pay 10 bucks for a game like this, and not run into situations like this. It would probably cost me 30+ dollars to move forward, no thanks.			"

												it has some nice aspects but i dont like it, it has an unclear hud, the tutorial doesnt explain so much (click here, than here, and after that here, not: this shows that, what'll do so). graphacis are very poor. and i dont really like the turn based system.			"

												Very good turn based game. Love the different classes, helps make each persons team very unique. I also love the team format, helps make each team a little bit more even. It makes it more fair for a new person to play a veteran if they both only get 1 legendary and 2 special. Recommend this game for anyone who loves to strategize.			"

												after level 8 ...it's ""Open Season"" on your @  $  $  ... my best advice is to use your gold wisely and have a HUGE army in your garrison .... Also I'm not a fan of Face book games (were every little thing needs to be posted to FB ... i.e. New levels, New location, hey how about annoying your friends with the fact that you Just made some WOOL CLOTH!!!) .... if you don't drop real money into this ...and you ignor or just dont post all them FB ""pop ups"" ... this game is fairly good ... I'm already level 13 so all you  level 20+ that like to ""pick on the lil guy"" for barely any gold or exp as a reward.... I'm coming for ya .... LOLin the end would I recommend this game ...Sure, why not I think you can play it on ""all your devices"" ...just don't tick off your Facebook friends			"

												Decent game very much like the Kings bounty series but the Shitbook connection and popup to share your♥♥♥♥♥♥was getting boring.After a certain level you will have to invest real mney as your minions will become very weak and your garrison gets destroyed quickly. If you could past over the anoying Shitbook stuff, the game pretty decent until they introsuced the stamina system for force people to spend huge amount of RL money to avoid very long waiting periods.This, for me, destroyed the fun I had with the game even with that FB sharing.
