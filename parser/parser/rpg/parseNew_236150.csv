Early Access Review
								First Impressions:For an early access game this game is already really playable as the sandbox mode works just fine. See this game as EVE offline. You fly your own ship (which you can upgrade or just buy a bigger one) around a HUGE universe that has highway like wormholes and natural wormholes. You can also move around anywhere under your own power so just traveling on highways or through wormholes isn't a must. There are hints of fleets in thwere but haven't been able to start one, although you can already by extra ships and leave them in your garage.Your Ship:Upgrades for your ships are plenty and the weapon systems include, lasers, plasma cannons, railguns, missiles, and much more which you can freely add to any supporting hardpoint on your ship (light for guns, heavy for ammo consuming launchers). All upgrades and repairs happen on the station and I've noticed you really need to shop around the stations to get the best stuff.Your Crew:Yes, this game has crews as even your starting ship is more then the usual fighters you get in other games. There are 3 shipstations which you can hire crew for. The crew gives you boosts on weapons or ship systems like engines, shields and cloaks depending on their skills. Again every station/planet offers different crews with different skills.Gameplay:Random missions are generated all the time wich includes simple ""go there and shoot.."" missions, scan anomalies and bringing around cargo and passengers. You can visit many many stations (and planets) to upgrade, repair, hire crew, trade and lots more. The universe is very much alive as you encounter friendly and non friendly ships all over the place. Some sectors and stations really don't like you and can form a real challange when fighting in those sectors (enemy reinforcemants and stations blasting you). Fighting is mouse controlled, aim and shoot your light weapons by clicking the right mouse button and fire your heavy ammo consuming weapons with X. Also you can give the command ""Fire at will"" which will basically unleash all weapons on all in range enemies (this can be very much fun to watch while you just fly around avoiding damage with guns blazing).Trade is already present in the game but is still in it's first stages so you get very little info on prices except for a news scroller that is viewable on every planet and station.Development:Patches are rolling out in a steady pace and the devs are very active on the forums (Post a question, suggestion or comment and you'll likely get a reply within the hour). This just gives you extra confidence to buy this game in early access and help in it's development.Current Verdict July 18 2014:Highly recommended early access game that is only getting better with each update.*My above opinion still hasen't changed, latest update is again full of content. Recommend to pick up on current sale :)Current Verdict September 16 2014:Latest patches have added full controller support for fans of those things. Also the game is nearly complete as release is almost here, they've been busy with optimizing the game and adding final features, complete campaign/story mode is not finished yet but devs have indicated it's coming soon! (And in the past they've proven time and time again that they uphold their word!).So still a big fat recommend from me at this final stage of early access.			"

												This was the game I wanted when I wanted to be a space captain/pirate.  There are ships.  The ships come in different sizes and configurations.  You start in a tin can with a couple of turrets and work your way up to space battleships.  Some of them can be challenging to get your hands on, if a faction you've♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off is the only one that makes it.  There are different weapon systems, each with strengths and weaknesses.  There can be a story/plot if you want it to be the driving reason behind your space-captaining/piracy.  The game punishes you for thinking you are a main character with plot armor and can charge at whatever your quest is without strategy.  It rewards you for doing a bit of grinding on the side for money and xp, be that with asteroid mining, quasi-legal trading, playing space police, or space piracy.Being a space game, there are a lot of different controls and interface options.  There are less than other space games I've tried.  Navigation is relatively simple, and wormholes, ion storms and radiation clouds make that more interesting than the vastness of space probably is.  You need captain 'levels' to fly bigger ships, but xp can be earned from basically doing anything.  Aiming is done via turrets.  Pick a view mode you like, aim the turrets yourself or let the computer do it for you, find a ship you like, and fly around space.  That's what you're here for right?It took me 40 to 50 hours to finish each story line, taking my time and taking advantage of the vast numbers of pirates just waiting to be boarded and salvaged.  Ultimately this was the first 3d space game I've tried that gave me some complexity while still making 'fly a ship through space' enjoyably easy.  I enjoy leveling, working my way up from the bottom and becoming an unstoppable juggernaut.  I enjoy flying a ship through space and shooting things with lasers, or guns, or plasma cannons.  I enjoy some odd challenges and impossible odds.  I enjoy exploring.  I felt accomplished when I finished the plot in my decked out dreadnought.  I enjoyed this game.  And the free DLC.Spaaaaaaaaace.  What's your favorite thing about space? (mine's space)			"

												TL;DR: At the verrry bottom, ya heathens!This game, wow. It is eating away at my soul here. Like I need to sacrifice another small vessel for creds so I can sleep again.I bought this game cause I had a gut feeling it was what I needed in a game right now. Yeah sure there are others like it, but I just wanted singleplayer and something really solid and fun. An man was I in for a treat! I had no idea I could enjoy a game so much again, like back in the day with all the old systems around and gramps was trying to figure out why the TV is calling him. So far the story has been very engaging with some smug and unsavory characters, not to mention a bunch of stuff to do on the way. Clearing asteroid fields for some spare loot to fill that cargo hold, capturing enemy ships to either sell or dock for your own collection. Beaming aboard your crew to steal stuff for you on a old mining field or enemy ship in battle to turn the tide an steal it for yourself, you will have to tractor beam it the whole way at impulse speeds to the nearest planet or station of course, who wants to do anything the easy way any way? Psssh.You have your classic worm holes you can use to travel or them good ole relays for cash, but who wants to waste money?Also you will run into random slipstreams in which you can use to traverse.. well the verse, by steering your ship properly through it. Be warned about worm holes though you can loose people, but don't worry you can get more red shirts at the nearest docking bay :D.Even combat is savvy. Tell your people to fire at will, take the helm do it yourself or root all power to engines as the words of Firefly's Jane ""Let's Moon'm"" cascades from your lips like lavander and oats. Be a commander, be THE commander. Hire merc ships to roll in your space posse, have a fleet of some bad to the bone misunderstood ship captains looking for redemption and love among the stars. You can of course also customize your ships colors and a few decals, but the real bread n' butter is the all the parts you can fit the ships with. An there is a lot of parts ranging from pulsar cannons to rail guns.You are not constrained in anyway wanna be that scruffy looking nerf herder? You can! Got that Serenity Smuggling Fever? This game has the cure my friend! Wanna travel across space corralling convicts like Cowboy Bebop? See you space cowboy, I'll be chilling with Jet. Wanna make enemies of a gang Outlaw Star Style? Look no further time to pop that space cherry Gene Starwind! Need to feel like you're back in Star Fleet Academy with Kirk? Picard? Riker? Janeway? Tuvok? Classes start as soon as you hit the buy button cadet! An tell Neelix I sent ya ;D.What is also great is that the devs have been very responsive and helpful working with the community to solve issues, active devs have really made this product shine and continues to better. I do hope you get the game and enjoy as much as I am.In my conclusion yes I recommend this amazing game, I have spent the last few years just really yearning for something, but sure what exactly. When I saw this I knew my sacrifice to the Game Satan had finally been heard. The graphics are solid and just breathtaking, the gameplay is as smooth as Bruce Willis's bald spot in The 5th Element. An steam workshop also? All I can say is beam me up Scotty, we can do it Captain this time we have the power.TL;DR: Game good. Combat fun. RPG Loot Funsies. Space much of. Do lots o' stuff. Very shiny graphs. Much impressed. You should buy it too.			"

Early Access Review
								So, you've played Freelancer, Wing Commander or Privateer. Its been years since these games were released and perhaps, for you, just like me, they left behind a massive void. I've leapt at EVERY space sim/rpg that been released in the hopes, that one day, they'll replace what I lost with Freelancer. Sadly they never did. So I saw this on the front page of Steam and thought, heres another disapointment. Well Starpoint Gemini 2...blew me away. This game is THE best space sim I've ever played and its in beta!! Beta will always be beta, that said, this game is solid. When you read the description and see theres only a dozen planets, don't be fooled. The galaxy is ♥♥♥♥ing huge. Absolutely enormous. Open world to boot. No loading screens. Just you, your ship and the stars. There are some absolutely amazing locations, zipping through asteroids, cruising the nebulas...its awesome. Theres a diverse choice of ships for you to cruise the stars with. Gunships, Corvettes, Frigates, Destroyers, Cruisers, Battleships, Dreadnaughts, Carriers, Freighters and freightliners. Each ship category has multiple choices and each of those choices allows you to build your ship in the fashion you want. Do you want a ship decked with heavy batteries, rain missiles and torpedos down on people. Do you want a majority of light batterries, decking your ship with railguns, beams or plasma cannons? Perhaps a ship that can deploy a large number of soldiers to board the enemy ship and take it over. Yea, you read that right. You can board an enemy ship, take it over and either destroy, loot it or sell it.Perhaps the trade life is for you, with a vast hold and fast engines to shoot you away from the pesky gunships. Trade hasn't been completely implemented atm. In Freelancer if you remember, you could see what planets were buying what for what price etc etc. That hasn't been implemented yet so you have to find them yourself. Perhaps your a miner at heart and want to reap the profits from those floating rocks. Go right ahead, blast away. If you want a huge yield you can buy missiles especially dedicated to obtaining larger yields. You can tailor your ship to fulfil what ever role you require. If you need more energy to fire you weapons, buy system attachments and upgrades to improve their energy reserves and recharge rates. Missing that little gunship too much, you can increase their accuracy or their damage against their shields. You can hack the enermy ship and disable their systems if thats the approach you like. You choose a career role. Each role has various abiliies for use that augment your fleet, turrets, shields, movement and various other cool things. Yea, thats right. You can build your own fleet to travel around the galaxy with you. Sounds perfect for a bounty hunter right? Your going to need it to tackle the toughest bounties in the galaxy. You track the bounties yourself and take them down. Be warned though, they aren't alone and they're prepared to fight. Seriously guys, I can't praise this game enough for what its doing. Yea, theres only free roam available atm but you can do WHAT EVER you want. Want to be a pirate, theres a huge array of choices for you and they're everywhere. You want to own your own carrier and deploy fighter wings, YOU ♥♥♥♥ING CAN!!! THIS GAME IS IN BETA and despite that, you can do soo damn much. I've crashed twice and that was in the first 2 hrs, since then, I haven't had a single problem. The galaxy is yours for that taking atm. I highly reccomend this game to all Freelancer, Privateer and Wing Commander fanatics. Even to those who are new to the scene. This game is so diverse and intricate in all its details...but god damn its so easy and simple to understand and master.This game is in on-going development, if its this good already, I can't wait till its finished!!

												====================================== Starpoint Gemini 2	(Updated review!)======================================**Don't Forget to Nominate this Game for the Steam Awards!**LGM Games’ successful debut title, Starpoint Gemini, an RPG tactical sim set in a unique SciFi setting was released in 2010. It was a great learning experience for them and it paved the way for their next game - Starpoint Gemini 2, the sequel. It entered Steam Early Access program in September 2013, and a year later after what most would consider one of the best Early Access communities on Steam, Starpoint Gemini 2 hit the shelves on Steam in Sep 26, 2014.On a personal note, I was honored to have been with such an amazing community. Both players and the Developers worked together so well that I myself strongly believe it was the best early access game on Steam! I made many friends and I truly enjoyed the journey...====================================== Pros	+Huge dynamic game world that can be explored as a whole!+Can play the story campaign or go free roam sandbox style.+Workshop with plenty of cool mods.+A ton of ships to fly and tweak!+Combat in big ships with fleets...+Did I say Mining? Yep, you can mine asteroids...+Very well done Faction system+You can Trade with a good amount of commodities+Developer support that sets a new standard+Best Community on Steam+Awesome Replay value!+Free content updatesConsNone really. Yea, the game is THAT good :-)Neutral+/- Average voice-overs (This is a good thing to me)======================================IntroductionStarpoint Gemini 2 is an action space-sim combined with diverse RPG elements. Control various space ships, ranging from small and agile gunships to lumbering, but deadly carriers. Explore, trade, mine asteroids, and research in a star system no longer hindered by loading points. The entire Gemini star system is now one giant area thanks to the implemented streaming technology. Gain experience and upgrade your skills to change the tide of even the fiercest space battles. Complex, but easy-to-use RPG system with skills and perks to customize as you see fit. This also gives great replay value, you can literally spend many many hours just trying different styles...======================================Game-playI have played EVE online, Elite Dangerous, and lots of other games in the space genre. Out of every space game in my Steam library, this is the one that keeps me coming back for more. Deep, immersive, beautiful. It is the perfect open space sandbox game. To elaborate, yes there is a story campaign mode that will guide you through the lore of the game. It does this via story-missions, in-fact at the start of a new game you can choose to play campaign or free roam(sandbox). A great feature is that even in the campaign you can do the story missions at your own pace. There is a great many of freelance and side missions.I played the first Starpoint Gemini so I was going into this quite excited, but you don’t have to play the original in order to enjoy this sequel anyway(They made the first one playable with the free DLC Starpoint Gemini 2: Origins). It is a space game all about exploring, mining asteroids, trading, capturing, and flying multiple ships and getting lost in a massive dynamic universe. It is the kind of space game I love to get lost in for long periods of time just roaming through space and immersing myself into the game world. This game certainly provides many ways to do it, such as gearing up a ship to go on a mining run. There is so much to do in this game it can get overwhelming at times. (But in a good way)When you first launch the game, you will be introduced with tutorial tip screens. These can, of course, be ignored, but I would strongly advise that you read everyone of them. The interface can be quite complex and there is many ways you can customize the ships so no need to go in blind by turning off the Tips!. You want to survive for more than ten minutes in space for your first captain. There is another matter I would like to clear up as well, this game is not EVE Online or Elite: Dangerous. It is a unique tactical space sim with exploration and missions. Many people including the Dev's would say that it is more comparable to Freelancer in all the good ways...Mastering the ship controls is not that easy at first, because there are a number of ways to view the action. There is the turret view which allows you to swing around the ship so you can track everything around your vessel, the mounted view which puts you just above the ship, and a third person view which puts you just behind the ship. All of them have their own advantages depending on the situation you may be in and half the battle is understanding when to use which view. It takes practice to master this when the combat gets hectic and you need to start switching rapidly between them. As ships have location based shields, being aware of what is attacking (and from where) can be the difference between life and death.This game really shines at immersing you into the life of a deep space merchant, miner, pirate, or whatever you prefer! There are so many options and the awesome guys at LGM have done a great job at making every path fun and viable. There is a ton of customization to help you really fill the role you choose as well. I personally spent several hours just looking at my options the first time I leveled up. Any hardcore RPG fan will have a ton of fun just building and tweaking their character and ship into their very own ultimate space hero... Or a feared pirate. So just let your imagination run wild.I mentioned customization earlier and this game has a ton of it. You can hire staff for your ship which affects its performance: For example, you might hire a crew member who increases your propulsion speeds. You have complete control over your equipment load-out and their enhancements. You can even customize the look of your ship to some degree. All of this is generally handled when you anchor yourself to a space station or planet. While docked, in addition you can buy and sell trade goods, read news clips, access a garage which houses your ships, and more. It sounds like a lot to deal with, but between all the tutorials, which are accessible at any time for reference, and the well-designed interface, you’ll have your hands around it in a reasonable amount of time.============================================================================ConclusionStarpoint Gemini 2 is a game for space lovers made by space lovers. This is by far one of the best open space games I played and it will delight you with its gorgeous visuals. There is a true sense of adventure as you discover new areas of the star chart, with opportunity and danger lurking around every corner so you are constantly encouraged to build yourself up in terms of power, wealth, and relationships with the various factions.LGM and its great team have created an instant classic that will be around for many years....======================================			"

 SHORT SUMMARY:  Starpoint Gemini 2 is a bit shallow and a bit pricey for what it offers, but it is still enjoyable. Overall the story was okay enough to keep me going, and the combat was fun enough to make my stay in Gemini enjoyable. If you are itching for a space sim that is pretty easy to get into and doesn't require a large time commitment to win (around 24 in-game hours for me), this will scratch that itch pretty well. Otherwise, you may want to think carefully on buying this game unless it's on sale.However, the developers appear to be actively working on improvements to the game as time goes on. Some concerns raised in this article may be addressed as time goes on. Keep an eye on the updates page if you're interested in this product!---------- LONGER REVIEW:  The good: Visuals are nice, music is nice, starship aesthetics are good too, and the combat is solid. The universe feels big, and provides a pretty immersive experience of traveling through space. Said universe is also populated by various starships as well, usually around space stations and various other miscellaneous space structures. There are many different factions that like to use certain types of ships and lay claim to different areas of space, and you can easily see heated space battles taking place at faction borders. The HUD takes a little getting used to, but is pretty nice once you learn it. The game itself is a bit grindy as it uses RPG levelling mechanics to determine what ship you can pilot, but I personally didn't mind it that much since the combat was pretty fun. The not-so-good: The story is okay. The Voice Acting for the story dialogue ranges from terrible to okay. Side-story missions boil down to ""repair structure there for $$$ and XP"" or ""kill enemies here for $$$ and XP"" or ""ferry person over there for $$$ and XP"" with little fanfare. After you finish the main story, all you can do are the missions described earlier.  During the main story, certain factions and places will be purportedly destroyed or crippled, but what this actually means is that you will just pretend that the story happened while in practice the universe remains largely intact and unchanged. Certain mechanics are a bit shallow (i.e. hiring crew = looking up which dude/gal has which bonuses, click hire button). Also, while you *can* be a merchant or asteroid miner in this game, it seems to be much eaiser just to capture enemy ships and tow them back to a planet/station where you can sell them.Character progression is RPG-like, yet character skills/perks can pretty much be ignored. Your character's power is MUCH more dependent on what type of ship you are piloting and how well it is outfitted. The RPG mechanics are more akin to a gating system, where your level determines the type of ship you can pilot. For me, the entire game was a bit grindy. This was how it went down: capture/sell ships until I can afford the next weight class of ship, do missions (sometimes main storyline) so I can meet the level requirement of said ship. Repeat until I have achieved highest class of ship. ------ Long segment about what I would have liked to have seen in the game:  Multiple plotlines in the game.  The ""Escape Velocity"" series of games (plot-heavy 2D shooter space-sim) implemented this rather well; there were multiple plotlines for each main faction AND there were also a lot of side plotlines too.Examples of side-plots: testing prototype weapons for a starship arms company, or ferrying vacationing CEOs to a jungle planet for big game hunting, or helping a rockstar go on tour throughout the galaxy only to discover that he's a robot! Or picking up a random stranger and ferrying him to a planet only to discover that he's a leader of a small sect of colonists who are trying to resist pirate incursions, and he implores you to help them with their plight since the Powers That Be in the universe are far too busy (or corrupt) to deal with the pirates. I didn't just do these missions for cash, but to see the story unfolded; to see how these characters reacted to these sometimes tragic events in their lives, and how they would deal with it.I think it's good to have a big Main Storyline as the main attraction, but there's plenty of room in Gemini for smaller guys with fascinating struggles and dramas in their own lives that an aspiring starship captain can be a part of. Being able to hail and talk to other ships and planets. You don't need to have dialogue trees for every one. But it'd be nice to be able to beg for mercy from a pirate and buy him off with credits, or just say hi to random ships and planets. In this vein, they'd also have a message for when you greet them, with each faction having a different way of talking to you. Perhaps even with a random pool of different types of responses from each faction that vary in tone depending on your standing with them? This is a bit small, but I think it would help with game immersion. The ships, planets, and space stations could use more flavor text.  Though it might seem like a huge hassle to write up descriptions for every space station/planet/starship, you can build an EXTREMELY immersive narrative with these and make the game feel alive. Again, the ""Escape Velocity"" game series (mostly Escape Velocity Override and Escape Velocity Nova) used flavor texts/descriptions to great effect.Why is this station in the middle of nowhere and surrounded by hostile space? Are they revolutionaries or sympathizers with another faction, or are they just badasses? Why is this Frigate cheaper than this other one? Oh, the company that manufactures this one wanted to push out a model to get an edge over their hated rival company who was taking their sweet time with their own model. Hey, this Corvette saved an entire company from the brink of bankruptcy! This Carrier design looks like a UFO because of a revolutionary new frame that allows for rapid fighter launching while providing overlapping fields of fire from all of its turret batteries? Cool. This Dreadnought looks like a eldritch abomination because their designers desperately welded a lot of spare parts together and accidentally created a ship that could challenge all previous starship design conventions? Neat! Planets and some space stations presently have short descriptions with a little flavor text. But it doesn't help that these blurbs are only accessible via starmap. When a player is on the starmap, their first instinct is not to click ""info"" and read; they want to get somewhere quick. I think it would have been better if you saw the write-up in an unobtrusive static text box on the bottom of the screen. This provides incentive for an exploration-oriented player to land/dock on every planet/station that they find so they can see the little blurb there. These descriptions can really flesh out the factions and gives you an idea of why they exist and how they conduct themselves (i.e. how they treat citizens, local planetary economic problems, policy problems, military actions, natural disasters, etc.). Overall, more flavor text would be nice so that the universe that the player travels in would feel more alive. Also, it would be nice to have an in-game chart of which ranks correspond to player level.			"

												I have been playing SG2 since EA (with many breaks in between...) and it is one of my favorite games in a long time. I've had a hard time getting into Elite, and SC is a long way out, but SG2 has filled the void admirably. I always loved space games and the WC/Privateer/Freespace trinity is pretty much my past.PROS:++ Best community on Steam. I own a lot of games and visit nearly all the forums - but this one is the best. Devs are active, the community is friendly and helpful, and some of it is satisfyingly weird (meep...) meep. MEEP.++ It's not overly complex. Which doesn't mean it's simple or dumbed down - it just means that you can jump right in and have a great time exploring space.++ Combat sequences can be exhilarating! I've been in many skirmishes that could have gone either way, frantically deploying sinks and coming around to line turrets up to open fire. Enemies coming in at all angles and PTE disrupted...++ With just a couple of mods (skyboxes and nebulas) the game can be breathtaking visually. I play with the lights off and the surround on and it is very easy to get lost in the moment.++ It's just fun. You can do a lot of different things with it and have a great time doing them. The voice acting is infamously fun bad, and the story is a kind of canned - but who cares, it's fun running through it all.++ Ultrawide!!! 3440x1440 - no problem and gorgeous!CONS:++ The economy is kind of not really there at all. I wanted to be a trader but the derelict mechanic made it more profitable and efficient to be a bad♥♥♥♥♥with scavenger bots. Which is kind of too bad, but it is what it is. ++ Playing the campaign like it is freeplay means you will be so OP that every enemy the campaign throws at you will be trivial to weak. Wish there was more scaling here, but it's not so bad to destroy waves of ships with out much thought because you outclass them by a mile.++ The UI is kind of crap and it's all raster so you can't mod it out to be better.++ Once you've played for a while, you start to realize that there isn't enough ship variance to keep it interesting. Some ships are clearly better than others, and you just sort of play the game out with that ship until the next tier - and its obvious captain, become available to you. I give this game an honest 10/10, even with the cons because it is a space game that you really can fall into. It really only asks for your time and patience - and doesn't require twitch muscles to play at a high level. The fire at will mechanic is great for it's tactical benefit, and for me I like to think about positioning in the large scale battles, rather than target/fire and positioning. To some it might seem like an ""easy button"" but for me it really makes the game. (i'm old... ;) )			"

												Overall the game is pretty awesome, but it could use some polish.PROS:Nice variety of skills and perks available.Great variety of factions and areas of control.Good selection of ships.Can capture enemy ships.Like the blueprints idea.Like the compare weapons and ships.CONS:Traveling over 10 units takes a couple minutes.There are four equipment slots to use and only about four that I found were actually useful, ie. shield recharge, strengthen attack, scavenger bots, hull repairs.  Even then, I rarely ever use them.Crew members do not have special abilities, but rather only bonuses.  A single slot for a special crew member.  Assuming only one special member exists in the game and is almost impossible to gain because the blueprint takes 20.Blueprints are super difficult to find, but very rewarding IF you ever complete them before becoming near god strength already.  I completed one for a nice fighter hangar jet, but the rest remain far out of reach while I am practically invincible with all the best enhancements and warship.The only truly useful weapons in the game are rail guns and maybe missiles.  I say maybe missiles because they are only really useful if the shields are already down and rail guns can usually take care of it anyway.  Lasers are useless.  Plasma is too slow to be useful except for mining.Level 70 bounties are easy kills for a level 50 that has a good battleship with maximum upgrades.  I think I may have beaten one with the next class down at a lower level too because you can stay behind them and they cannot fire back.Travelling outside the known universe area leads to infinite enemies and loss of whereabouts on the map.  Travelling too close to the sun does the same thing except enemies will start to randomly die from heat damage.Cannot see what is on a captured ship until it is transferred to the garage and crew is transferred as well.  Crew losses will occur if the captured ship has less.There are three kinds of heavy weapons, but I failed to see any real difference in shockwave damage.Exploding ships nearby do no damage.Has lag and slowdowns most of the time.SUGGESTIONS:Make traveling without gates a little faster when in full engine mode.Make some artifacts that last indefinitely / bonuses or useables that fit in equipment slots.Change the decimal enhancement descriptions, eg. 0.5, with percentage values, eg. 50%.Please fix weapon range.  Bonuses are not being counted.Add a barrier on the edge of the map to prevent getting lost in the void.Give a warning for pending heat damage when getting close to stars.Show radiation areas on the map.Show map sections that are partially visible on the edges of the map.Allow transfer of weapons and cargo from ships in the garage without transferring crew.Make plasma weapons hurt shields more, but damage hull less.Make lasers damage both shields and hull with shield punchthrough for damaging systems.Make railguns work best on hull, and less on shields.Do a similar rock paper scissors with heavy weapons.Fix the pathfinding.Improve AI for wanted bounties.

												My initial reaction to the game was ""Wow, this looks like a massive sandbox space sim! Just look at how big the area map is and how many factions there are. I'll be playing the game for tens of hours!""Well, after a while I started to realize the game had lots of problems with being a LOT more shallow than what it promises at first. Setting aside the optimization issues and how easily the game can be prone to crashing, It boasts and impressive ~50 factions with a reputation system that ended up being nothing more than a glorified Good / Evil alignment system. If you do missions given out by the good factions you get +rep and they will be friendly to you an the evil ones will be hostile. Vice versa you do missions given to you by the bad guys and your rep shifts to their side making them friendly to you. Unfortunately that is as deep as the faction system goes. Factions don't change opinions as they are completely static. The static factions leads me to the next problem. The whole world is static. There is absolutely NO sim element in this game to speak of. The game has NO economy, NO dynamic factions, NO dynamic world events. When we speak of sandbox you think of open worlds with things to do in them, but all it is here is the same map as the campaign, just without the campaign missions. Since the game lacks an economy and dynamic factions it makes trading all but a dull and soulless experience. Also, since the world isn't dynamic, there is no real territory control for the factions either. I mean they have their own territories, but they are completely set in stone. You cannot capture territories for the differenct factions. This leaves you with the same Assassination, Taxi, Cargo ferry and Repair missions to grind over and over and over again.How is the combat then if the other aspects are non-existant and hollow? Well, the combat is rather decent, but what kills it for me is how the game is level scaled. Each time you level up so do your enemies. After certain points their ships get upgraded. If you do like me and other people may have done and only grinded missions for money and XP you'll quickly find yourself in a situation where you don't have enough money to upgrade your ship but you are starting to be too weak to do missions and half the time you simply have to turn around and go away since the RNG pitted you against enemies that simply outclass you. This can be avoided if you salvage derelict ships for parts or capture them and sell them, but then it means that the level scaling system is balanced if you play in a certain way which is horrible, horrible balance in a game that claims to be a sandbox. Simply put if you aren't maximizing your money gains per level then you'll find yourself running into some issues.It just isn't a good game in the end of the day, and it certainly is no sim either, which is what I was lead to believe. There are no simulations happening behind the scenes, everything is static. The game is hardly an open world sandbox either. It seems to be a loose term that gets thrown around a lot these days. It's a sandbox world if all you had was the big open box without any of the sand in it to be shaped and sculpted by your hands. The game COULD be good, because the flying around, the skill system, the ships, the combat etc. feel good and are fun, but the content within the world is non-existant, unless you want to count repeating Kill X (Assassination and Rescue missions but both work the same. In rescue missions it means that you have to save an NPC ship, but so far they have served as reliable allies that help me take down the enemy ship faster rather than someone who needs help), Fetch Y (there is fetching and delivering cargo and serving as a taxi for VIP, but it works the same mechanically for either mission type so it's only different by name) and Repair Z (there's also Scanning anomalies as missions, but mechanically it works the exact same way as repairing so there is no real difference here either) missions as robustful content.

												This is from a post I did on the forum and decided to add it here following a suggestion to do so.SPG 2 The Good, the Bad, Oh God the InsanityIf you’re on the fence as to whether you should get this or not it will all come down to what you are looking for in a ‘space’ game.This is not Eve Online so get that out of your head. Seriously, if you want EO you’ll need to go log into EO. There is no online multiplayer, no gate camping players, no griefers and no gankers.That being said, this game offers something EO and many others, online or not, have simply forgotten or just don’t care about. Interactive Devs.Yep, you read that correctly. The Devs are extremely active in the forums. I’d hazard a guess and say 99% of all issues, questions, comments etc. are answered near instantly.They take concerns very seriously and look for ways to address them as quickly as possible, faster even it seems. While this isn’t to say other Devs aren’t around, personal experience has shown they just don’t answer, are too busy, don’t care and on more than one occasion… are downright obnoxious and rude.So +1 for Dev support seemingly 24hrs a day every day…Community… holy crap, where to begin…There are a lot of helpful people. One or two I have noticed try to step in when the Devs FINALLY get some sleep. This doesn’t mean there aren’t more filling in those roles, only that I can’t read, re-read, and re-re-read each and every post over and over to see who is filling those roles. Though, I will admit, sometimes the forum reading is an exercise in hilarity. Serious questions for the most part get serious answers. Once in a while they spiral out of control with loose jokes, odd references and such, though more or less after the issue has been handled.Remember the active Devs from earlier? Yeah… they contribute too.Don’t be surprised to find one or more of them plowing into your thread to partake of whatever silliness is afoot. Oh yes, my friend, they are characters indeed.On the whole, the community is developing into a large group of knowledgeable friendly people looking to help out any way they can. Yes, some can be offended easily, but I have yet to see an all-out flame war like everywhere else. In fact, most people just apologize if they upset someone and move on, including myself.So +1 for a truly friendly and helpful community.Graphics…Nothing that will stress your system too terribly. High end or low end, it seems everyone can find a setting that fits the bill and allows them to play. I have seen one or two instances where certain systems (read Laptops) refuse to allow the game to run, but I have yet to see more than those.Even then, the Devs are still trying to figure out how to get it working on those couple of problem machines. Interesting, since most would just tell you that your system doesn’t have what it takes and to go get something bigger.All in all, the graphics are very nice indeed. Nothing mottled, disjointed or misaligned. No missing pixels here and there or stand in objects for missing items.So +1 there for that…NPC’s…What do you expect? They are NPC’s. They shoot at you, they kill you and they keep doing it. Unless you kill them first, in which case, they die rather well and don’t whine about it. I seem to remember an account of griefing done by NPC’s, though I believe that was a one-off. Funny though.They get tougher as you progress through the game. Different levels, different types and different areas. They fight each other if they are opposing factions and will turn on you if you are low enough rep with one, or both. In which case, run.So I give a +1 for good NPC mechanics.Missions…Lots of them. They are everywhere in both aspects of the game. Free play or Story line there are tons. Decent rewards for the time invested as far as I can tell, probably a bit too decent considering some missions you just have to click a button and repair something.I’ll give a +1 here too.Storyline…For as much as I have done, it progresses well. Seems to have substance and a bit of plot for as far as I have gotten.But…It is buggy. Missions sometimes fail out. Sometimes you overshoot a zone and they get canceled, dropping you out of the storyline and into free play mode. Other times, you just crash out of the game.They are working on the bugs as fast as they are made aware of them and that helps out a lot. More often than not, you can just reload from a save point and try to continue.No points for this one, still needs work.Mods…There are more than a few. Something for everyone I suppose. Uber ship, got it. More money, got it. Star Trek themed ships, go those too.From Star Trek to vastly improve (overpowered) beginning station inventories, there is something to fit most everyone.The game has a mod community growing faster than the game itself. Even at least one mod I saw that will completely change the game to Mass Effect themed ships and even a new storyline that appears to be in the works.The Devs seem to support unlimited, no holds barred modding. So definitely +1 here.Oh, lest I forget...Community input...Look in the game. Look at achievements and improvements. You will see all the signs of active community involvement that has been taken seriously. (mostly) Yeah, +100 and some Oreos for all you community peoples that report bugs, request content changes and overall general improvements.All in all, for me, this has been one hell of a ride… and it’s just beginning. The game is only getting better and more is on the way.If you’re on the fence, get off it. Buy the game and join the fun in the community.And the insanity? Glad you asked...There are the elite few who can claim this. They watch you at home while you play. They see you in your boxers. They wear your boxers, like I am right now. The Devs are part of this group, I know one, whom I shall leave nameless, who has watched me in my boxers. Yes, some of us are insane... And that is the fun of it all.Sincerely,VirikasP.S. +1000 to the Devs for allowing us to be insane, taking us seriously when needed and for being on top of everything, everywhere, all at once, every day... always. Now... which one of you took my boxers, Meep.			"

												Well...the game looks nice but is actually quite boring. Here is why:1. Unengaging storyThe story consists of a lot of text (white on color, not very legible) and really really atrocious voice acting (which sometimes just cuts out). There are so many factions with text descriptions I did not bother to read all of them. Honestly I did not understand half of it because I have not played the predecessor. The game did not present its universe in an engaging way.2. Simple missionsThe free missions are all randomly generated but they consist  of either go to A and kill / capture or go to A and scan / repair (same menu button) or go to A and transport to B.The campaign missions are the same. Go to A and usually kill everything there...done. Sometimes you need to ferry stuff. But the whole involvement is detached. You arrive...the game cuts to sequence and some voice acting..suddenly to reappear with enemies around...you kill them...cut to the next short scene...done. There is no drama, no real action, no emotional involvment. I did not respond emotionally to the characters, who are just pictures with horrible accents.Trading and mining is a horrible grind if you like it. It is certainly helpful in the beginning but not worth your time later on. Just take the ""kill pirates"" mission and blast everything to hell.Once I got capturing ships down...I had so much money I could have bought ships that were not yet unlocked for my character level.3. Simple combatUsually you fly somewhere, click F for ""Fire at will"" and maneuver a bit around. There is not much strategy involved. Starfleet Command or Space Empires Starfury had more interesting combat. Manal aiming is cumbersome because you can't really see the ships at longer ranges and there is no help with aiming. Due to the turret placement your shots might not go where your reticle is...so automatic fire it is most of the time.Also medium difficulty is way to easy. I had a destroyer that could easily defeat a dreadnought without breaking a sweat (loosing shields).4. technical stuffAlthough the combat is in 3D the star sector is actually in 2D. The map is in 2D. You can fly ""up"" and ""down"" but it feels like all planets and stations are on the same plane. It is not a globe but rather a ""thick"" square.Flying around especially in the beginning is tedious because jumpdrives or jumpgates are way too expensive and when you have the money to buy jumps you can get a perk that allows you free use of the jump gate system.After about 10 hours the game just felt like a grind to get better ships and more weapons and do all the story missions (usually just killing enemies). It simply got boring.			"

												This game has come a long way since its beginning and it's still going strong. For me personally it went to overwhelmingly frustrating to awesomely enjoyable. The devs are super responsive and really care about the community. Keep in mind this is a tactical combat sim with trading aspects. There is a living economy, but personally I never paid any attention to it.Destroy enemy ships, capture enemy ships, loot enemy ships, grapple enemy ships, hack enemy ships. Do whatever it takes to defeat the enemy. Expansive map with plenty of variety to keep you exploring. Ships, officers, mercenaries, trading opportunities, weapons, weapon enhancements, system enhancements, equipment, etc. This game is an awesome space game in terms of what its selling point is: a tactical combat RPG space sim.

Early Access Review
								The next best thing if you want something similar to Eve and Freelancer. More arcade-ish Sci-Fi space shippy RPG. Start with a small gunship, make your way up to dreadnoughts and carriers by trading, doing freelancer missions like repairing a damaged space station, transporting a VIP from A to B, getting commodities to a planet or scanning anomalies, or just hunt criminals in hopes to get a huge bounty. The game is beautifully done, has a large selection of ships and weapons, the combat is fun although some say the camera is a bit slow, and there's a lot to do in it. Buy it! Throw money at the devs!!!! DOIT!			"

												I must preface this by saying, I don't write many reviews at all, but when I do though, it means I really enjoy the game.This game reminds me a lot of the X3 games, but the interface is a bit easier to get a grasp on.Pros:- Mod support- Great music, think Mass Effect & EVE Online style.- You can be anyone you want, and do whatever you want, there's a campaign mode, and freeform mode.- Nice interface.- Beautiful graphics.- Runs smooth, haven't experienced any crashes.  - Combat is fun.- Controller support.- There's a large selection of ships & weapons, and you can upgrade your ship.- All of the above points help with immersion, you really feel like you are in space driving your own ship.- The developers work hard and are engaged with the community.  They do have their own forums where they answer questions, etc.Cons:- Space can be a bit lonely at times, but, it is space after all.TL;DR - If you're looking for a game that is part X3, part Eve Offline that can also serve as a stopgap until Star Citizen & Elite Dangerous, you could do a lot worse than this game, especially when you consider the game is currently only $28.8/10			"

								This is a very entertaining space game with a healthy side order of role playing and is pretty well polished even at this early access stage. The developers have a genuine rapport with the community and this is helping to shape a very enjoyable game. Until the final product release and all features and story campaign are implemented there is still a lot to enjoy in the sandbox mode. If you like beautiful ships, trading, chasing anomalies, blowing up asteroids and firing lasers at baddies there’s a lot to like. The music is awesome too.			"

												I like this game, I do, but 35$ I feel is too steep for what it offers. At first I thought this game was like Mount and Blade in space, with so many factions, different types of outposts, and skills oriented to being a leader. That however is not the case, the game is more or less a dungeon crawler RPG without the dungeons.The story is fairly bland, and frankly the voice acting of the main character is so outright awful I had to turn off dialogue volume, and I just quickly got bored with the story missions.Theres no real ""looting"" and going out of your way to be a merchant king through cargo hauling is a waste of time, the early portion of the game is farming money to get better ships, once you have better ships you just capture enemy ships for quick cash and farm levels. Looting ships for weapons is a waste of time, as all stations are static and theres no random element to their inventories, simply fly to the station selling the best weapon of your chosen class, and buy it, everything quickly becomes a monotony of going from X to Y and repeating.The biggest issue I have with the game is saving, the save system is abysmal. You can only save while anchored at a planet or base, if you arrive at a friendly base and find it swarming with enemies (in some sectors this happens constantly) you can find yourself trapped in a prolonged battle, or killed, when all you wanted to do was save the game and go have dinner.You cant side with factions, or take over stations, or influence anything, so dont expect any depth with the politics of the world, you are either ""good"" or ""bad"" and that determines who is friendly, nuetral, or hostile. Good being the vast majority of the galaxy. So the dozens of factions in the game, may as well be two factions.""Commanding a fleet"" isnt as exciting as I hoped either, its not so much a fleet, as you having two hirelings, hence part of my comparison to the game as a dungeon crawler.There is plenty of good though, the actual gameplay is fun, you are more captain than pilot, you configure power usage, set speed, battles arent about quick manuevering so much as overwhelming firepower and good positioning. In a star wars example, you are piloting a Star Destroyer, rather than a Tie Fighter. (fighter squadrons are in fact a system on later ships) Just be sure to go over the controls, I spent far too long without realizing you could activate automated fire.Bounties are probably my favorite aspect, unlike most games, bounty targets arent static, you start the game with a full list of bounties, and they move around the galaxy on their own, when you choose to hunt them you have to go by ""last spotted"" information and attempt to cut them off. These are also the most challenging fights available, and shouldnt be taken lightly.After a while though I begin questioning my goal, Its not difficult to get better equipment, at least not after a certain point, and the only thing you have to upgrade is your ship. A uninteresting campaign that I cant be bothered to finish? The bounty targets to award money I dont really need? Side missions that are much the same as the main missions?This game could be improved by aspects of strategy (something I think Warlords addresses, though the game is very very early access so I dare not bother with it yet.) and aspects of procedural generation. Non static stores, to put more of a emphasis on looting (Perhaps ships produced by that faction are much, much more expensive, but always available and the randomly generated ships are cheaper, like buying a new car vs. used car.) and procedurally generated weapons Diablo style. A star system you can purchase as a home base, to build your own colonies, defenses, shipyards to give you more to do than just upgrade your ship.The game has so, so, so much potential, and the team that worked on it seem dedicated and helpful to their community, the framework is here for a game unlike any other, and I am excited by where the team goes with warlords once its finished. If you can nab this for $20 or less, do it. But in the end, whats that phrase? A mile wide, a inch deep.			"

												** A gorgeous space game marred by painful lore elements.**      [[Recommendation comes with strong suggestion to play in sandbox mode only]]This game was an odd experience.  The longer I played it, the less I liked it.When it started, it took me back to the wonder of games like Privateer.  Sandbox, big galaxy, lots of options.  And it's really gorgeous, from the ships to the planets to the nebulous backgrounds.  Some of space stations look oddly low-res compared to everything else, but that's minor.However, things went downhill when I started to follow the main story campaign.  The voice acting is truly atrocious, and the writing isn't much better, from the minor (bad grammar) to the median (dialogue) to the major (an incoherent plot with characters whose motives don't seem to correspond to events).  And when you get to a more difficult mission that you have to try several times, the lack of any button to skip the dialogue becomes truly unforgivable.Speaking of retrying, there are several design decisions that make sense on their own, but quickly become annoying when you have to replay a mission because it's difficult or bugged (like the infamous mothership mission).  First, you can save only at stations or planets.  OK, there's a sort of 'realism' sense to that.  Second, there's a lot of empty space between points of interest.  That actually worked for me at first, because it added to the sense of scale and exploration.  But when you have to retry a mission and reload to find you are about a 5 minute cruise from the action -- and then remember that you'll have to sit through 3 more minutes of unskippable community theatre auditions when you get there -- it gets really difficult to stick with it for the next attempt.There were also a number of minor annoyances, like the fact that missions seem to get reset when you load a game (so if you pick up someone or something to deliver, you must do it before you end your current session or forever have that passenger or item in your non-cargo inventory), some inscrutable elements, several mechanics that seemed incomplete, and a handful of crash bugs.I think there are the ingredients of a good game here, with a good core and beautiful graphics, but the lore side of things really lets those elements down.  Perhaps the best strategy would be to ignore the story and play only in sandbox mode.			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is a space trading and combat game, think Elite or EVE. You fly around a vast galaxy, smaller than in EVE or Elite though, doing missions, trading, mining, bounty hunting, etc. Captain your ship and level your captain in a RPG-like fashion. I turned to SG2 for that EVE Online fix. I would call it a simplistic EVE, but it's still very good to scratch that EVE itch. You can forget about the RPG system, it's so simplistic, but the rest is a full fledged space game. The game's looks take a little getting used to, coming from sharp and shiny EVE or Elite gfx, but after a while it grows on you and flying around the galaxy is as fun as usual.Getting through the story and all dlcs can take about 50 hrs, then there's some additional hrs if you want to replay SG story in SG2 engine, and then there is freeroam. Freeroam will not be so fun after completing everything as your ship will obliterate everything that the game throws at you, but still, 50-70hrs of game time looks quite amazing considering you can get this on sale.I liked:* quite a large map* lots of different ships* large amount of weapons and enhancements* flying in space shooting / trading / uncovering stuff!I disliked:* capturing ships is the only way to go if you want to make big bucksGet this:* if you're looking for EVE Offline and don't mind simpler experience* if you want to fly in space and pew pew stuffDon't get this:* if you're looking for complex space sim			"

												I really wish I could recommend this game, but it's a buggy, unfinished mess.  I can't believe the state the developers left this in before abandoning it and moving onto their next project; Starpoint Warlords, which I would highly advise people to stay away from as well.  Aside from the persistent crashing, there are parts of the game the developer just didn't even bother to finish.  For instance, none of the equipment that was introduced with the expansions works.  None of it.  The developers are completely aware of it too, they just never bothered to finish it.  Simple things like being able to skip dialog doesn't work because of ""technical reasons"".  I kid you not, that's their excuse, but it supposedly works on xbox.  Many of the quests are bugged, including the final mission, and require hacking save files or reloading the mission numerous times until it works.  Voice dialog worked for maybe a third of the game, the rest of it you just have to read the dialog and then wait in silence until what should have been voiced over to finish since, again, you can't do something as simple as skip dialog.  Character/story progression is very poorly thought out.  It wasn't until I got about 10 hours in, when I was getting wrecked by even the lowliest of enemies, that I had to go to the forums to find out you shouldn't do any missions because you'll over level yourself but not have enough money to buy a new ship and essentially have to start all over or hack your save file to give yourself credits.  Nope, you're supposed to just go capture ships for money and not do any missions.  I'm not kidding, you aren't supposed to level up or do missions or you'll break your game.  I'm not even going to list out all of the other bugs the devs are aware of that they just never bothered to fix.  Stuff that was brought up back in 2014 during the beta that they said they would fix and just never bothered with.  I could probably go on for another three paragarphs listing all the issues with this game, but suffice it to say, it's a mess.  I'm hard pressed to recall any other game I've played that was left in such a sad state, it's like a beta release.  It's a huge shame too, because there is a really good game hiding underneath all the garbage, but having finished the game, the incredible amount of laziness and carelessness by the devs and the amount of frustration it causes just ruins it.  I have no tolerance for devs that abandon a game like they have here and then move on to their next cash in.  I will never purchase another game from Iceberg Interactive.			"

												Loved this game. Felt like Privateer 2 without the cutscenes and sadly missing Clive Owen with Christopher Walkins :-( Freelancer should've been more like this. SG2 is a lot more open world than Freelancer which has its advantages and disadvantages. Personally, I found it purely an advantage. Unlike Privateer 2 and Freelancer you can truly just be a merchant if you want and switch effortlessly to being a badass kill everything murder ship at any space station/planet. Sometimes it's just the little things that make you happy... The graphics are great, the music not annoying, the abundance/ease of quickly accepting missions is a serious plus, and most importantly the flexibility of the game to allow someone the ability to play  the game how they want w/out the need of trainers, cheat codes, or cheat engine. Just like in the real world there are easy ways to make a quick buck with minimal returns or riskier methods that garnish heavy monetary rewards. I love that this game isn't afraid to make the playing field drastically uneven when it comes to rewards. Harder, almost always (there are times you get lucky/learn to exploit advantageous situations), means greater rewards! Learning the in game market is very beneficial. But it gets better, should you disagree w/me all you have to do is download any of the many mods and change how the game mechanics work. This game is a literal win-win. Small minor bonus pluses that I think are worth mentioning are; 1.) Achievements actually give you in game bonuses 2.) Blueprints that give better stuff that can't be bought 3.) Bounty hunting ( this is a mixed bag. this system could better implemented but I'll be damned if i didn't end up hunting everyone down!) 4.) Buying of certificates/licenses (w/game money and not real money) that give-in game bonuses for no other reason but to make the game fun (personally, I think it could have been better implemented but I sure as♥♥♥♥♥♥was excited to find a new one!). 5.) A good array of ships to pick from (potentially unlimited if you count mods... Just saying...) 6.) Personally, I found the system upgrade gimmick confusing at 1st but once understood, it opens the door to a lot of options that becomes unlimited if you include modding (just saying...).No game is perfect and this one isn't either. This is the disadvantage section of SG2. SG2 has some pretty poor optimization problems. 4-5 years ago my PC was a champ so it's aged a bit meow. Still, w/the level of graphics/visuals/objects it should run better. Especially since the video/graphics adjustment is bugged/non-functional. It's only a moderate complaint because the game allows mods and several are designed to reduce the toll taken on your PC. The rest of the comaplaints are mild at best because all are easily adjusted w/mods or are drastically overshadowed by the game's massive, bulging, make you scream in your pillow as you take it awesomeness so here goes- 1.) The voicovers are almost all a joke. They're done w/the stalest emotion possible. 2.) The story is kinda flat. Open ended games are prone to this a lot so it obviousley shouldn't be a huge unseen problem here. The game brings up interesting things here and there so kudos for the Devs for trying but it is still kinda... ummm... blah most of the time (kudos for the DEVs for doing such a good job to make the game so fun I really didn't care!) In short, my complaints are minimal at best and I had countless hours of fun playing it. I found it quick and easy to learn and SG2 left a lot of options for me to explore for future play throughs. I can't ask a game to do more than that but w/mods this game could be literally different everytime I played. I got it on sale and felt like I stole something. I would have happily paid full price and been more than content. This game is awesome, WOOF!			"

Early Access Review
								As a long-time fan of the great grandfathers of space trading, exploration and combat games, (Elite, Wing Commander, Privateer). I am always on the lookout for a game of this genre that has the feel and enjoyment these classics gave.Starpoint Gemini 2 goes a long way to bringing back those days in a modern, eye pleasing, fun package that is not overly complex like some of the modern games ( later X Series, EVE Online) which although are great games and in many ways superior, probably due to much larger budgets, leave me feeling like I have just sat the final papers to a master’s degree.Starpoint Gemini 2 which is still in beta at time of writing this review, shows great promise and I eagerly look forward to the future updates and release of this enjoyably challenging game.I hope to add additional updates to this review as new releases come out and I explore the game further.

												Well-made hybrid of SG1 and Freelancer. with light RPG elements on top.Pros+Vast selection of ships from fighters to dreadnaughts and carriers+Engaging combat+diverse systemsCons-Lack of persistent objects. You won't see ships traveling from one system to another, because they are always generated when you enter a system.-There is like 30 factions, but reputation system is two-dimensional. So when you help one faction you improve/worsen relation with the rest of them.-Below average performance.7/10 (8 of 10 if the they fix bugs and improve optimization), worth buying if you are into space genre. If you are not, you can wait for Christmas sale, a lot of things should be fixed by then.			"

								The playstyle is an assorted combination of the Freelancer + tactical elements of Star Wolves + diversity of EV Nova + some good original ideas on top.Do you remember that feeling of excitement when you discover something, something that makes you feel more alive? I feel a deep immersion when playing this game which is so rare nowadays (even in alpha state atm (nov 2013), with only a basic features present). The devs put a part of their souls into creation of this, I feel it in all those small details here and there. I'm looking forward for a release, and quite positive that anyone who loves ""space sims"" won't be disappointed with this game, especially with such a good modding support.			"

												TL;DR version - GET IT! Fun as heck! Some minor issues and bugs but devs are hard at work on fixing them!Ok as far as space games go, this is ""easy to get into"" and ""fun"" to me. Easy once you actually READ the tutorial tips and understand how it all works. And it's fun cuz I found myself needing to ""just go over to that next unexplored sector"" to see what's there.However, you can't compare this game to another game like X, or Star Citizen, or Elite Dangerous. It's like asking if Diablo 3 is like Skyrim - they simply can't be compared fairly. The only thing in common between this game and the game you want to compare to is just that the action takes place in ""space"". How it makes the gameplay fun is different from the one you want to compare to.If you want to ask ""Does it have <this feature> like <the other game you want to compare to>?"", don't. Go back and read my previous comment.What I can tell you is that this game feels like an RPG more than a Space Combat game. There is a story. You upgrade your weapons and armour. You kill your enemies and loot their corpses (derelict wrecks). You use what is better than yours and you sell what is not. See? Just like an RPG.You can do some trading, but I don't concentrate on it like I would have in X or Elite Dangerous. In the end, the question is - does it make you feel that you want to play this more? Does it make you want to see what happens next?The answer is YES for me.			"

												I wish I hadn't bought this game. I loved Freelancer and thought it would be something similar but boy was I wrong.This game lacks any atmosphere and feeling of a space-traveling universe. Docking at stations and visiting stations is one of the most disappointing events I ever encountered in a space game. There is no radio chatter, no clearance for docking; you never hear anybody over radio nor do you see more than one or two ships (even near well populated planets!). This game feels so incredibly dead and empty, that travelling and exploring just simply isn't any fun at all. It all feels so static. Add to that that planets and stations you visit are not animated but all just have a static, bland screensaver in the background of dull buying menues. There are no bars or other places that give you the feeling of really setting a foot on a place. Rather it all feels so incredibly generic and it doesn't get better if you add the boring ""go there and kill pirate x""-missions that we all have seen way too often now.This game is nowhere near Freelancer and if you look for something like that, you will most likely be as disappointed as I am. This is a sad and empty game and I would be careful to get carried away by the positive albeit misleading reviews here.			"

												I recommend this game because of the followingThe minor bugs are actively being fixedThe devs are responding on the forumsExplorationSpace feels large, but it's only one solar systemPlenty of travel shortcutsThe map has to be uncovered by visiting each sectorThere is, sort of, an autopilot for easy travel to a waypointCombatCombat is funAuto-fire if you don't feel like aimingThe controls work well, controller supportGraphicsThe visuals look good (DirectX 11)All of the screenshots are from the in-game engine, not works of art.The planet-side artwork is niceThe space stations and ships are varied and have styleThe game is well polishedSimple user interfaceEquipment and LootThe ship fitting is pretty simpleThere are multiple types of ships, weapons, and multiple styles to choose fromThere is a collect all button to make looting quickThere is a quick way to sell everything in your cargo holdOtherYou can do more than just shoot other shipsYou can choose free-roam instead of doing a campaignYou can crash into a planetAchievements with in-game bonusesIt's able to be moddedEasy to learnMusic and sound is goodIt's not complicated, but I am also a fan of complicated gamesWhat's bad about it? Not much, just things I personally prefer.  Others might consider some of these to be ProsNo multi-player optionsNo empire to buildFreelance missions do not have much variety.The officer system is a little strange.  You can only hire them in their original location, they go home when you fire them, then you have to fly back there to hire them again.You can't equip ships unless you are piloting them.  This can cause you to lose crew or be forced to sell cargo.You might like Starpoint Gemini 2 if you like these games. Freelancer, X3-series, Eve Online, and space based games in general "

												A good game that could have been a great game.After several hour of play the missions quickly get repetitive. Trading and mining get boring even quicker. The real challenge of the game is capturing enemy ships (and it is the only way to make enough money to advance in the game).The faction system didn't much much sense to me, and didn't seem very important as it was just goodies vs badies in the end.Near the end game there was nothing to spend your cash on. The weapons at the end of the game really aren't much better than what you get 20% into the game.The game crashes from time to time, but not enough to ruin the game thanks to the auto-save feature. It is a 32bit only game and seems to run out of virtual RAM. The developers should have also included a 64bit executable in the install package.So, good fun for maybe 20 hours.Some suggestions as to what would have made this a great game.- Some ship customisation (and why can't I see the weapon arcs)- More variety in the  enemy ships (maybe some boss ships)- Some random system wide events. Not just random pirates- The hacking (and anti-hacking) features making some sense. I didn't get hacked ever, but had zero protection.- More high end weapons and gear- The galaxy having low and high level sections rather than being seemingly mostly uniform. At the moment sectors are either friendly or impossibly hard.  I never found any netural sectors.			"

												Most have taken to calling this EVE offline, but I find it to be more EVE Lite or Diet EVE. Think the core concepts of EVE in an open sandbox map rather than many separate systems, but with the waiting 5 months for a skill replaced by grinding for a few hours and all the player interaction removed.At the end of the day you're left with all the things that made EVE great, with none of the stuff that makes it only suitable for people with vast swaths of time available. You can jump in, do a quick mission, save and jump out. You don't have to worry about being dicknailed by a ship fifty levels higher than you at any given time, and you get an experience that's much more simple than EVE.I'll reccomend it. I've come across some bugs, and the voice acting is really, really bad at times, and just pretty bad at others. Personally I think the 20 bucks out of pocket I paid (had 6 bucks steam credit) was in the right area for the game, maybe a little high. I'd say buy at 5-15 for sure and 20+ only if you like the sounds of EVE Jr.			"

												(8/10) Pros: -Freelancer 2.0 -Capitol ships. -Ability to capture vessels and own them or sell them. -Ability to lead a small fleet -Simple control scheme, complex battle needs. -Runs perfectly smooth for my mid grade computer-Story line is not overly complex and compels you to keep upgrading your ship/fleet/character in order to surviveCons:  -Some dlc quests may get bugged if you load all DLC at start of a save.  Forums have workarounds to help solve issues though-Capturing ship to sell profit far out scales all other methods of profit (trade, mining, missions, etc) and after a playthrough of a character/ship tuned for this method, all other methods feel like roleplay, comparatively.Starpoint Gemini 2 is a game extremely like Microsoft's Freelancer however instead of a choice of around 10* fighter sized ships (in vanilla freelancer), you will be getting a plethora of capitol sized ships from transports, frigates, cruisers, destroyers, and so on up to carrier and dreadnaught.  Titan class if you get that dlc too.Gameplay wise the game features easy controls to help you manage power towards shields, weapon batteries, and thrust, and you will be required to fluctuate this power as the game progesses and the needs of battle and speed get more intense.I found the ui and gameplay to be very good.  This game has been the best open space trader sim that I've played on steam yet.Late game battles can be intense and even if you power through tens of ships at a time, you will need to be vigilant in your positioning, use of power, and abilites.

												Updated review as of October 1st.First impressions: Broken. With a lot of potential.Secondary impressions: It's an acquired taste. It does grow on you. But it's lopsided. Strong gameplay props up a (very) weak campaign.Initial review:This game may be out of early access, but do not be fooled. This is NOT a finished product. Not even close. It is sorely lacking in decent voice acting, and the campaign hangs together by the thinnest of threads, and liberal deus ex machina. Frequently you will look at the screen in confusion and ask ""Who is that? What is happening? Why am I supposed to do this?"" The game approaches storytelling in a very basic, almost childish way. Even in my short time in the game, I have already encountered several borderline-gamebreaking bugs. Such as non-functional campaign triggers. And equally game-breaking, though no bug, is the games tendency to assume the player knows more that he does. This game needs a softer introduction, not to mechanics, but to world-building. As it is, it's a mess.I am giving the developer the benefit of doubt, and I will continue playing. I do believe there is a lot of enjoyable content to come. But ""it gets better later"" is not a defence that a genuinely good game would need.Let me put it like this: I am playing the game simply because it is the only game of its kind currently available. If it weren't for the fact that I have played Freelancer into the ground repeatedly, I would be playing that. It is a superior experience in every way.Currently, I still regret spending money on this game. Therefore I am choosing not to recommend this game.Update #1: After a few more hours, I can only confirm my first impressions: I have absolutely no idea what is going on in the game, and my enjoyment of it suffers as a result. Time and time again, I am told I need to go to some place I don't know of, to meet a person I've never heard of, to get a thing which I know nothing about, for reasons that are never made clear. To call it frustrating is an understatement. The game is seemingly an unending series of unanswered questions. Primary among them: ""Why am I doing this?""This is not intentional mystery, this is just really, really bad writing.Which is a damn, crying shame. Because the game itself, mechanics and graphics, are solid. Ish. A little shallow and clumsy, perhaps, but the closest I have come to Freelancer since Freelancer.I wish this game was better. But it isn't. I wish I could love this game. But I can't.I have given this game more than its fair share of chances. I have given it more than the benefit of doubt. I have acted on faith, on the belief and the hope, that this game ""gets better"". So far, this has proven to be wishful thinking.I'll research the Gemini universe, and see if that gives me enough points of reference to piece together just what the hell is going on in the game. Then I'll give the game one last chance to pull itself out of this confusing funk and make some damn sense.Update #2:That helped a lot. A now have a fair grasp of what the game was assuming I knew by heart all along. It made the campaign bearable, though still not good by any measure. But at least I'm no longer tearing my hair out (as much) over the lack of proper world-building, exposition and adherence to storytelling 101.I still can't recommend the game, despite that I am now beginning to enjoy it. Chances are that you won't be as patient as I have been, and I fail to muster any decent arguments as to why you would wish to be.			"

However as I kept playing it kind of grew on me. Now I'm hooked. Can't wait for what the devs have in store for Warlords. Cheap good fun and many hours of game play.			"

 Review - Starpoint Gemini 2 === Rating: 7.0 / 10 - To boldly grind as much as nobody grinded before === The Good - Good variety of pilotable vessels for various play styles: mining freighters, battleships, fighter carriers, it's all there- RPG elements and alignments system enable the player to take the path they wish in both terms of abilities, perks and behaivior- Fairly good, but not excellent mind you, number of different sectors to explore- Main quest, a load of secondary missions, contracts, bounties, random encounters, global events... really, there is a lot of stuff to actually do in the Gemini Sector...- Decent assortment of weaponry and modifications- Space anomalies, ion storms, radioactive nebulas, and all sorts of space disasters to endanger your ship- It takes really long to get to high levels, get all the good ships, weaponry, kill bounty targets and such things- Quite complex but rewarding enemy ship capture system, you can really do an awful lot of money if you get good at it...- Overall, more than good longevity, to complete everything the Gemini Sector has to offer, DLCs included, it will take you, say around... 100 hours (i played the beta version before release in the past and did so)=== The Bad - Trading / Mining / Gas collecting / Scrap salvaging are good for making money at low levels, game start and quite a bit after, but from say level 15/20 and above, they become very underwhelming: contracts, bounties and most of all ship boarding surpass the gains by FAR, so players that want to play a Trading type character will be severely penalized in mid/late game and will have to do epic amounts of grinding to get anything- You cannot destroy space structures if they are not part of a specified mission that involves their destruction. Solar arrays, gas collectors, bandit space stations, trading posts, all of them are completely indestructible: their structure will drop to 0 eventually but will still be perfectly fine. This MIGHT be a game design choice to avoid players break main quests and such, BUT doing so with all space structures is really unacceptable- You can board space structures, and plausibly get all the sweet loot inside them right? Wrong my friends. Board a mining station, a resarch center or such, and the troops will say it is captured and the loot is being ejected outside: this will not happen. Never, ever. This feature might be incomplete or never finished by developers.- You can only save your game while docked to a space station or a planet. Not a really big deal, just a poor game design choice- Ship's autopilot can bug and randomly fly you inside space stations, space debris, asteroids, and turn your ship in a fireball.- The ship's targeting computer is not able to target automatically asteroids or salvage piles, if you want to be a miner, be prepared to aim at every single little piece of asteroid manually and then collect its loot. This makes mining even more painful than it already is because of the problem i explained before- The ship's targeting computer (yes, AGAIN) is able to, thankfully, target enemies in automatic fire mode, and is pretty accurate at it, more so than you doing it manually in fact, but the big issue is: the computer will randomly fire at all enemies in its range, and will NOT stay and focus fire on the enemy you locked on. You should understand how this will do in a battle. Yes, really bad.=== The Ugly - When boarding a ship, ANY ally ship, be it random, hired mercenaries or quest companions, will STILL target the enemy ship you are trying to board, and there is NO WAY to tell them to do otherwise. This results in extreme frustration because maybe you are actually succeeding in the believe me really difficult task of capturing a ship (especially at high levels), but then some random ally blows it up making you lose time, your troopers inside it, and maybe also a mission involving the ship capture will fail. The developers said this WOULD be fixed many times on forums and steam hub, well it never was.- Ship capture is the ONLY feasible way of making good amounts of money from mid game and above: contracts will start giving you a pittance, trading will long be worthless and selling those nice ships for money will be your only chance of making money to get better stuff and ships to actually progress in the story or freeroam, because enemies scale with your level and get better everything, and so you must do the same. Yes you guessed it, the thing i said before about boarding, it happens a LOT, so you can choose between getting ulcer from boarding, or grinding 70 contracts in say 6 hours to get 1 tier III weapon for that slot you are missing, and then again and again and again.- There is a bug that can happen randomly, i presume it is uncommon: after completing a Main Story or DLC Main quest (Happened to me just after finishing Aethera DLC), and this is a really severe bug. What it does is simple: it RESETS the entire quest line of the main story to a random mission, so basically instead of progressing to the next quest, it says the actual active quest is one you ALREADY completed, and i found no fix for this, system cache check, restarting, even savegame editing, nothing. This has lead me to be unable to play Titans DLC because the quest is broken, and who knows what sorts of troubles will other players get from this bug.=== Conclusions Honestly, SG2 is a nice space game, nowhere near the depth of some other games like the X series, but positively much more accessible than those, but still being complex enough to not become casualized, and that is all good.Still, many problems as you read cripple the game and prevent it from becoming truly excellent.

												Pros: + Beautiful game; very nice to look at!+ Lots of small interesting mechanics and ideas, such as boarding other ships, hacking their systems, etc.+ Mining and trading are well implemented, although it's very hard to get rich through either+ Plenty of unique ship designs and overall great attention to art+ Very decent music and sound effectsCons:- Boring story- Abysmal voice acting- No multiplayer- Excessively combat-focused (good luck getting rich as a merchant)- easter egg hunt (in a space sim? sigh, okay)- only one star system, seems limited for a space sim- the prices for using the jump gates are insane, get your podcast playlist ready and have fun trucking through space- lack of animations for entering or leaving stations/planets (yeah this one is a bit nitpicky)- placing stations and artifact containers right next to riftways is borderline sadistic- what REALLY pushed me away from this game:WELCOME TO USER INTERFACE HELL!oh my god, this game's interface makes me want to stick puppies in a blender! --> fifty thousand menus that don't give you all the information you need--> 'why can't I select this station? oh the waypoint marker is in the way, let me place it somewhere else for the 1000th time so I can move on with the docking procedure' (same thing applied to any static object in space you hope to interact with)--> 'does a green price mean it's a good sell, or does it mean the price is very low?'--> 'why can't I use the turret camera while in PTE mode?! oh, I can, but I need to press Mouse1 simultaneously. wtf?'--> 'time to compare some prices, now let me just find the item in this huge list which isn't alphabetically organized'--> I spent several hours having to remind myself that the BLUE bar under the red HP bar doesn't represent shield, but speed. Why do I need a speed bar? God only knows. And one that looks like a shield bar, on top of all.--> I could go on, but the point is: if this game's UI had been better conceived, SG2 wouldn't have♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off so often. I'm not saying it's a bad game, just that... it's not great fun. I guess that's enough.			"

												This is a good game for space adventurers. However, there should be an emphasis on the word ""adventure"" more than action on this one. There is story here, but I find the game play is slightly lacking. The idea of controlling a modify-able ship is awesome, especially with the ability to turn auto-firing and auto-pilot on and off - but I just find this game lacks a bit in depth. There is a lot to do, a lot of side missions, main missions are intriguing enough, but SG2 just fails to deliver amazing game play. Maybe it's because I'm playing with a controller, but I find from the stuff you can do in game to scanning or teleporting is not quite there. You cannot walk around space ports or your own ship which is really disappointing because what captain doesn't want to see what's going on - on his/her ship. I find myself always chasing new nav points and flying in circles and turning on auto-firing.I like the game, but enough to pass time or keep me busy. I do not think it's worth the stated price and recommended to buy on sale.RATING : 7/10 Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ "

												(Still in Alpha stage)Pick a style that you like to play, space sim wise, and go do it..lol Be a pirate/bounty hunter/merchant/miner..ect No story line ATM, but as it stands right now, it is still worth the money. You can easily get 20 buck worth of enjoyment out of it, plus some. When the game is done, you will be glad you did get in on early access. Fun ships and plenty to choose from, even now. Good fight and flight modes of flying. Great space eye-candy. No loading screens to get from one side of the map, to the other. Unless you are using the jump gates, then there is a small load. You want that ship the npc is flying? Just board it TAKE IT!!..lol Over all, I cant give much of any complaint. As a reference, its like a graphics smak down, with a upper cut in gameplay, to Freelancer!!..lol (only SP, no co-op multi..-1/2 star..lol)I give it 4&1/2 stars out of five: with it, as it stands, in AlphaEDIT:Now that this little gem is fully released, I can go ahead and say I wasn't wrong in my EA review. There may be a bug here and there, but the Dev team is really on top of it. It's about all been flushed out. So if you have been on the fence, and want a feeling like playing Freelancer for the first time. You should give this a go. And, with a active Mod community, Im sure there will be years of fun in the future of Starpoint Gemini 2!!			"

												Finally out of Early Access, Starpoint Gemini 2 is a great entry point into the genre. While you're waiting for things like Elite and Star Citizen to come down in price (or release), this is an excellent stop gap game. While the science behind it isn't world-accurate like other games, the pure amount of things to do and systems in play is excellent. Workshop support is excellent and the modding API is well detailed on the developer website.			"

												This game gets compared to Freelancer a lot (particularly by forums users), but it's like a poor man's version of Freelancer without any of its artistry or high points like the lore backgrounding the game, and the great universe design. There are similar mechanics: do some basic trading, have a ship...TBH it is a bit of a disappointment after the hype you hear about it from fans. To be really blunt in its current state I think this is a $10 max game. It feels a bit like it would be a good iOS space game, but as yet isn't a good PC space game. It needs an additional layer of depth and polish to become anything more than average. I'm playing it a bit but it's mostly as a time filler and because its a pretty massive grind to get anywhere (which I assume covers for a lack of content).The forums seem to be an unadulterated love fest for this game and that was one of the main things that swayed me, but it's fairly average so far. I think it has something to do with the developers being active on the forums, big-upping anyone that says anything positive. Will update this review if my opinion changes, but I have a pretty good picture of the core dynamics: capture till you get a bigger ship, capture till you get a bigger ship until you get the biggest ship. Do really boring missions until you get your rank up. Otherwise you might do the really boring version of trading or mining (compared to other games).THE BAD Tutorial and the campaign to date are pretty bad and unengaging (I kinda know what I'm doing but just don't care). Visuals are mediocre, although the ship art is okay. Universe feels empty in a bad way. Voice acting in the plot is amateur. You can only save in certain places which is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥(there are some lackluster excuses about this) Combat seems fairly one dimensional RPG elements are lighter than I expected (4 skills that you level, and some perks) Crew are just stats bonuses Trading economy and mining seem extremely basicOverall I think a game like Starsector has far more RPG depth.THE GOOD...You can customise ship colours, decals, and names so we can all call our ship Stormbringer, however, I haven't tried naming one Mistake Not My Current State Of Joshing Gentle Peevishness For The Awesome And Terrible Majesty Of The Towering Seas Of Ire That Are Themselves The Milquetoast Shallows Fringing My Vast Oceans Of Wrath - it might be possible.The cosmetic stuff like naming the ships and changing colours seems to be my high point so far. It might end up being a good timewaster...here's hoping.			"

												Sorry for the negative review, but I found this game frustratingly boring...- The game is a real grind…. -Freighting cargo around doesn't pay well at all, and I installed a mod to try and solve that issue, but seemed to not help.-The story did not capture my interest. With sad voice acting, and the death of the characters farther on the “second” mission, I felt nothing for it, and was simply poorly laid out. -Not a fan of the combat, it's clunky, panning the turret cam is slowed in combat. (that could be due to my system but the graphics run fine in combat, I suspect it's something else) -A lot of the free roaming play is go here, go there... with not much inbetween. maybe some random combat…-No feedback on some systems, if you can't charge your engines in combat, no way to tell how long they will take to comeoneline, or I didn't find any readout to tell me… -not a fan of magical powerups/skills but that just my preference-The sell all button is poorly placed with no confirmation, will also fail you if you're smuggling. you can't buy it back to complete the mission… sigh...-Not a fan of the docking anchoring system. it makes the long or short trips that much more unsatisfying :( -missions seem to be straightforward but lack information… eg. where am I smuggling this to? You want help, what kind of help? Missions simply lack information that would give you the choice to make a educated decision. -Combat music sounds very VERY similar to Freelancer... just putting that out there...I have tried to get into the game twice, tried to give it a chance. I have put 13 hours into the game... I don't feel there is any need to put more.I strongly recommend anyone considering purchasing this title to thurellery research it on youtube or forums, as actual game footage it not supplied on steam, and is quite misleading...

												So here's the kind of stuff that happens in SG2:I'm flying in my cloaked Freya-class stealth carrier towards a small fleet of enemy vessels. I drop to cruising speed (drawing power from engines to weapons + shields) in the middle of the ship cluster and release 1 wing each of fighters + bombers, which wreak havoc in their ranks. I lock a grappling beam on the flagship, drop out of cloak and set weapons free. Turning the ship, I shoot missile salvos from my port, bow and starboard ports, crushing the flaship's shields and bringing hull integrity to critical levels. I then use transporters to launch a boarding party, which subdues the vessel's defenders in less than a minute. All the while my guns, bombers and fighters make short work of the supporting vessels and I leave with a prize ship worth millions of credits.That's the game in a nutshell. It's really, really, really cool and accomplishes what few games like it can... but has giant glaring holes in it. I recommend the game if you get it on sale or if you don't mind taking the good with the bad. I'm not one of those weird people who likes s***ty games and *I* played it for 55 hours and counting.Here are my gripes:* Capturing ships? Yeah, pretty much the only sensible thing to do towards the end game for cash.* The system is kind of arcane. Most of it becomes intuitive after you get a chance to tweak it (for instance, I've set my mouse page Back/Forward buttons to lock on the nearest target and mark it for fighters/fleet vessels). However... it wasn't until like 40-50 hours into the game that I realized that ""Power-To-Engines"" didn't actually put full power to engines and you boosted speed significantly if you used the power allocation tab to set Engines to 100% while in PTE mode.* AI is miserably weak. Boarding actions? They don't do 'em. Hacking your ship? Yeah they don't do that either. Grappling? Hahaha no. They seem to just go towards the nearest enemy and shoot. The most complicated thing they do is use items that drop mines or kill your fighters or knock out your engines. It leads to ridiculous situations like my Freya ship with 110 troopers destroying 6 Equinox-class carriers with 130 troopers each... when just two of them could almost guarantee taking my ship by boarding. Same goes when I'm wrecking a freighter with a small corvette-class fighter/bomber... and it could easily knock me out of commission by grappling me and pounding me to dust.* The dialogue killed my parents. Seriously... this stuff comes across as written by a middle-schooler, translated to Russian-and-back, and voiced in the dumbest, least engaging way possible. Worst of all.. it's unskippable! There's a command for ""skip dialogue"" but it DOESN'T WORK.			"

												Update : Now LIVE V1.400 (Internal Test build)I myself have been playing since Alpha (September 2013 release) and I have seen SPG2 come along in strides. Below is a basic list of what is in-game and can be done whilst playing. SPG2 brings back many memories of quite a few spaces games I have played since the mid 80's onwards.Star Point Gemini 2!DLC - Secrets of Aethera - Adds in new ships, new storyline arc, tweaks and updates to game systems.Riftways - Oh my, something to experience yourself! - Rollercoaster rides in Space.Fighter wings for ships with hanger bays are a blast to play with.70 ships to buy/capture/destroyEquipment/Weapons that can be modified with enhancementsCustomizable ship - Can re-color certain parts of your ship, add decals etc.Consumables - Shield boosters, damage boosters, repair nanobots, etcPower ups - Boost your Railgun damage, or Beam weapons etc for a few seconds to turn the tide in battle (Use them wisely though as they have a cool down for re-use)Ship cloaking (Ships that have cloak devices) - A lot of fun with this one :)Hero Characters to hunt down and kill for excellent credit reward. (You can kill a few of us Forum members now as Hero Characters! - Thanks to LGM's competition)Global events - More fun things to do outside of freelance missions etc.Junk yards - Cruise the junk yard like a junk yard dog looking for some possible cargo and or poor unsuspecting ships that might contain some nice cargo to liberate from them.Trade your wares in stations and planets that you either bought elsewhere or collected from combat or mining. (Price balancing to still be finalized)Board and capture ships - Hire troopers and grapple a ship, send in the troops and take over that ship for some extra credits or to take as your own new ship.Worm Holes appear around the galaxy and can whip you to somewhere else in no time (Be warned you might turn up somewhere ""You dont want to be"")AI Security forces scan you ship for contraband and give you an option to dump it or duke it out (Pirates life for me, damn the pollice hehe)T-drives work as personal T-Gates to quickly jump to other areas very quickly (Same as using T-Gate, but on the spot usage, instead of finding a T-Gate)Ability to hanger (Personal hanger accessed via stations and planets) upto 5 ships, which you can swap out when needed. Have a freighter parked in your hanger when you want to do those big commodity runs for the big bucks, or some large scale asteroid mining. Drag out your carrier to go out and take on fleets of enemies with your weapons and your fighter wings.Travel the Galaxy map by normal engine power (I have done this and it takes quite some time - grab a coffee and some food), Power to engines (faster travel speed) or by Fast travel ways (Real fast movement across the galaxy)Freelance missions, Combat, repair, scan, VIP Courier, Cargo courier the list goes on.Steam Workshop - Mods are coming along and many more to come as modders get busy!Did I mention how bloody good the galaxy looks, Nebula's are amazing, Asteroid fields are real special (I like to play a pirate, so I like to hide in the dust clouds of some asteroid fields and wait for passing freighters/mining ships for some easy kills and loots. Junk yards look great, and just a reminder again don't run into them they not hurt hehe :)Oh and Mod Tools, Want to add a new ship into game, can do!!Want to add new sectors into game, Can do!!Want to add anything virtually into game, can do!!! Probably the best thing of all about SPG2 is the Dev Team, These people are one of the best I have had the pleasure of enjoying an alpha/beta release with. They are always responding to members posts, questions, technical help, and ideas. The Dev Team have even taken ideas from members and have put into game those ideas, what more can you ask for in a Dev Team who cares just as much for the player base as their game, that is simply priceless and a quality lacking in many AAA title Dev Teams.All I can say is, ""If you enjoy space gaming, Buy SPG2 today. You wont be disappointed""And drop by the official forums and say hello as well :)http://www.starpointgemini.com/forumhttp://www.twitch.tv/webferret - My Stream of SPG2 most nights 8PM AEST (GMT +9:30)			"

												I love space sims. I don't even know how much time I sank into freelancer or the x3 games. Yet this one I am dropping after a bit more than 10 hours of playing.Let's start with what I like about this game: The graphics are good, the different ships with their various layouts are cool, you can customize your ship through enhancements and hiring officers, the energy transfer management (engine, weapons, shields) is interesting, and on the surface the game feels like it is trying to marry the best parts of freelancer with those from the x series (which means many things immediately make sense if you have played those games before).However. Somehow the game feels like a chore; something I am willing myself to play in the hope that if I continue a bit further it will finally become exciting and turn into the great game it has the potential to be.The story is inherently boring. Fly from A to B, listen to some terrible voice-overs, destroy a target (ambushes being optional), get an (uninteresting and unusable) item and no real information other than ""fly to XYZ to get more info"". But you need to grind a few side missions first to level up enough for that. Rinse and repeat. I have lost all interest in the main story and there is just nothing that compels me to continue playing it.The other sidequests and missions are okay, but also very repetitive. The difficulty rating of these is useless, as some missions (e.g. science, maintenance, taxi, ferry) are childishly easy, whereas others (e.g. assasination, station defence) become really hard quickly unless you sink all your money into your fighting capabilities. Importantly the missions don't pay enough in my eyes to make them worthwile. I found boarding other small ships much more lucrative. And flying through space feeling like you are a towing service is just not fun for long. These side missions quickly turn into mindless grinding.There are many other things that bug me (not even to mention the numerous bugs I encountered already) that make this game a ""no"" for me:The fighting is super boring; most of the time I just sit there with my turrents firing automatically and I don't do anything other than watch. Ships feel very small and their speed and maneuverability do not seem to decrease with size as far as I can tell (there is no ""speed"" property you could check when buying a ship). There is no good fast travel: gates are too expensive, wormholes regularly throw you out at the wrong location (and what is it with that terrible, terrible animation you are shown after you have flown into a wormhole?) and those ""green highways"" seem a bit pointless; most importantly while all of these move you long distances quickly they don't allow to quickly travel to something that is say halfway of that distance. Factions have no character and no individual story making them pointless really. The energy transfer management can only be used effectively by dragging it around with your mouse; there are no customizable settings to be activated through a button, e.g. a ""hit and run"" (50% engine, 50% weapons). Skills have no real impact: I have put all my skillpoints into one particular tree (beam weapons) and I still can't tell the difference before and after I activated the skill, with the promised increase in range definitely not working. The game cannot be played effectively with a joystick: some button commands cannot be changed (e.g. closing window, using skill, cycle through tabs in the store) while others simply are not recognized or don't work; also you can't use a mouse to quickly navigate say the store and star map.There are many more things that have added to me not liking this game, but those are probably too specific to me to be really useful for other players.Tl;DR: Repetive missions, bad main story, boring fights, lots of mindless grinding, terrible voice acting, the whole universe feels characterless and the joysticks can't be used effectively. While it is trying to combine the best things of previously succesful spacesims (freelance, x3) it does not get it right.			"

												So I thought I’d wait before writing this review until I got at least 10h+ gameplay and finished the “story”. So at the time I’m writing this I got 43h+, and just finished the game. My favorite space game of all time is probably Freelancer, and other games I’ve tried haven’t even come close to it. But when I heard about Starpoint Gemini 2 I got my hopes up a little. Started following the game, checked in-game videos and such, and I got very interested. So I decied to buy it a week before the release cause it was on sale. It’s a good game. If you, like me enjoyed freelancer then you will no doubt enjoy this aswell. It’s not as good,  but it’s definitely not a bad game. The RPG elements are an interesting addition to the game. You start of by choosing your “class” which are:  Commander, Gunner and Engineer all with different set of skills. Depending on your play style if you prefer being in a small group of ships or just pure loner/dogfighter etc, I think most players will find these classes interesting.Alright, now to the positive and negative aspects of the game: I really liked the “feel” of the ships, smaller ships are easier to maneuver while the bigger ones are heavier, and I like that “feeling” it really does feel like you are flying a ship. So the developers got that down quite well, spot on. I do wish they would have added like a secret ship(s) that could only be found and bought at a specific place that was hidden.   And continuing on the topic of ships, there are A LOT of them to buy. Allthough you will be very discouraged with the prices in the beginning, but don’t worry cash will eventually start flowing in. Just do side missions or if you prefer mining or trading etc. The map is huge, and you have a lot of exploring to do if you’re into that. Just wish there were more things to explore, more secrets and mysterious anomalies etc. There isn’t really any suprises or “wtf” moments in this game, which is sad. No mystery. The graphics are awesome, no complaints here it’s a living world and the designs are nice. The sounds and music are awesome. But…I really wish they would use at least more than just ONE battle tune, cause it gets reaaally tiring to be hearing the same♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over again. Specially since battle is a big part of the game. Would it have hurt to put in at least 2 more songs in? Other than that the rest of the songs are awesome, it really suits the mood and game.There are also enemy heroes in this game, which all have bounties on them. And they give you a lot of cash, I totally missed this feature when I started playing so it took forever for me to get cash in the beginning. So that’s a nice feature, but would have been even more interesting if they had like one final hero that was nearly impossible to beat, unless you were leveled up to the max with the best ship etc. Now to some of the negative aspects of the game: Map travel, when you press M or whatever button to bring up the map, the game pauses…so while you check your map and try to plan ahead for your future travels, the game is on pause and you don’t progress at all. So while I was travelling to this planet, and checking the map at the same time I noticed I was right where I left of. So that’s annoying.The autopilot fails a lot of the times. It only does this after you have docked with a starbase and you click on your next destination to go there autopilot, most of the times it just freaks out and takes you in circles.The voice acting in this game is a big joke. And not in a good way either, cause sometimes bad voice acting can at least make you laugh, but this was just…ugh.The storyline is nonexistent. Which is really sad cause of the big universe the developers built up they could have written such a better story for this game. So if you buy this thinking it will have a nice or at least mediocre story, rethink why you want this game. Im not saying not to buy it, beacuse the good things outweighs the bad in this game. So to end this I’d say it probably is the best new single player space game out right now.I’d give this game a 7/10+Many ships to buy+Huge map, a lot to explore+Pretty graphics+Music+Enemy Heroes+RPG elements-Maptravel-Music-Bad voice acting♥♥♥♥♥♥story-Autopilot fails			"

												I have mixed feelings for this game. I wish I could make the review neutral. It's a space sandbox where you roam Gemini system, complete easy single objective quests, get money and buy better ships and guns. The game is quite slow-paced, and you'll probably want an open book at your table, so you can read it while your ship travels to whatever waypoint you've set. The combat system is pretty simple, devs probably wanted this game to be chilling instead of intense. Positive moments:- Beautiful space vistas and ships.- You can destroy enemies, you can mine asteroids, you can buy things in one place to sell in another. It's a sandbox.- A free DLC with alternative campaign from the first game.Negative moments:- The story is mediochre, we've seen all this a thousand times before.- Voice acting in campaign is pretty bad.- My PC fits the requirements, and yet the performance is really bad. I experienced crashes in long sessions too.- Once you get yourself a carrier class vessel, you'll find out that there's like nothing else to do. You can bother yourself with achievements, but it isn't that fun.- Unrealistic game world. Nebulas within a solar system, asteroids gathered in clouds rather than in rings, tiny planets and stars, you only fly forward when your engines are on: your ship stops once you turned them off, like a car would. I understand that it all was done to make the game less boring and more saturated with content, but it fells just toyish.Starpoint Gemini 2 is still fun to play, even with the flaws I listed, but I can't recommend it for the full price. If you're into space, get it when on sale.			"

												When I was a young adult (28) I bought an Amstrad CPC 8-bit computer and a cassette with the game ""Elite"" on it. I played that religiously at least a year and after that again every now and then. The graphics were underwhelming (green wire graphic), the plot practically non-existent. There were only 8 ""missions"" I knew of and the grind to get to Elite level was enormous.I looked for such a game a long time after that. Freelancer was a good try. The direct Elite successors were overdone and technically underwhelming. After a while I gave up.Then I stumbled over SPG2. And here it is again. Nearly. The freedom to do what I want, the grind to get to the top and a vast universe. For such a game it is important that the combat is interesting, and it is. If you are level 20+ you will encounter more than one enemy at a time, and then you will have your hands full.Here a pro and con list:+ Graphics are good. Not brillant, but good.+ You are free! You may do what you want. You can safely ignore the main quest if you want.+ You can capture ships. That is not only very profitable but also fun and later on you have to be quite skillful to pull that off (with battleships and the like).+ The map is huge.+ Fighting feels great.+ Your character has levels, perks and skills. And they are surprisingly useful (I play an engineer). And fun.+ You have to learn the UI but after the initial learning process it is very functional.+ You can change all keys. And you should change at least some.+ There is a nice levelling curve. It could be even slower, to be honest...+ There are secrets in the game. A secret station I just discovered (named after an astronomer, won't spoil it too much), sectors with radioactivity, anomalies and so on.+ If you don't know what to do you can do an automatically generated mission. They are endless.+ You can save only on a station. I like that because it means you risk a bit if you venture outside. But only a bit. Just the right amount :)+ The developers are very active and really trying to please their customers.- Trading is not risk free (there are enemies out there) and not profitable. That is not well designed because either you avoid risk and gain or take risks and get profit, but the trading option means that you take the worst from both worlds.- While there is a reputation system it is not individual to each of the factions. You are evil or good (or something in between). If you are ""good"" you are liked by all lawful factions. If you are evil you are liked by all evil factions. That could be more individualized.- The main quest has quite a boring plot and is not written very well. The voiceovers are horrible. These accents!- The map is not endless. That is not a big disadvantage because it is huge as it is. But it would be nice to have an option to generate a new ""universe"" procedurally.- If you land at a station the graphics are disappointing. It is nothing more than a greyed-out picture of you in front of the station. You don't feel you are on the station, you feel you are in a system menu.- The full screen mode does not work every time. On Windows 8.1, NVidia 760, full screen mode is only achieved after I start the game the second time. That is a bit unprofessional...Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 9/10Developers: 10/10Main Quest: 3/10Combat: 9/10Feeling of Progress: 9/10Overall: 9/10Good: if you like Elite or Freelancer.Not that good: if you like X, X2, X3.I bought it in a sale but it is worth its normal price and then some.

												Highly recommended! This game is similar to so many other games, yet so different in every aspect. These guys really offered something special.And if you have a question, devs are answering them on Steam forums 24/7. Something that is rarely seen. My boyfriend got me this game cause I liked Evochron Mercenary. I'm as happy as I can be with it. Highly addictive and fun!Thumbs up!Update: After so many hours, I still feel compelled to return to the game from time to time. I left my heart in Gemini, it would seem. :)			"

												I'm 60+ hours into the game as I write this review. I have to say that I haven't played space sims for a while but do have fond memories of Freespace 2, Wing Commander, Privateer, Freelancer and Darkstar 1. The good news is that SG2 has some interesting elements. Could it be better? Sure, but let's get to the nitty-gritty. There are 3 things I'll comment on: RPG elements, SIM elements, and GAMEPLAY elements.RPG:·	Not great -- voice acting is poor, and I don't really care much about the storylines (I have Origins, Aethera and Titans DLCs), which I feel could be better or more compelling.·	Not enough random events by NPCs, etc. The universe is constantly changing economically, politically but it doesn't feel ALIVE. The characters seem dead.·	There is a points/perk system where you can improve your character but that's about it.·	You get some credits and blueprints for completing campaign missions (no medals or other perks). The blueprint reward system is interesting but really tough to complete a whole set, so what's the point, really? ·	The NPCs you deal with are flat and uninteresting. Oh and the voice acting sucks. Or did I mention that already?SIM:·	This is supposed to be a space sim, but many controls are lacking. e.g. You can't coordinate attacks with wingmen or give them specific orders.·	Other sims even let you contact NPCs/wingmen over comms; not here.·	Combat is simplified -- which may or may not be a good thing. i.e. You have an auto-fire button for your light weapons, and a key for your heavy weapon. You have to be facing your opponent appropriately before other non-frontal weapons will fire. Sometimes the AI fires at other targets even when you're locked on the nearest one.·	There doesn't seem to be full support for my Thrustmaster -- I can't map the buttons, nor does it allow me to use a Joystick / keyboard combo. There is a turret cam view that can be useful, but without my joystick, it's pretty pointless.GAMEPLAY:·	Pretty graphics·	Fun sandbox (free play) mode. I actually spent more time here than on the campaigns.·	These are cool: Space stations, T-gates, T-drive travel, worm hole travel, boarding ships,          officers and mercs you can hire·	Lots to explore·	Faction/reputation tracking system·	Very useful star map with overlays and filters·	Game seems skewed towards battle; i.e. hard to get rich through the economic modelOverall:The game world is pretty. While the devs try to create a decent economic model, I'm not quite sure it succeeds. You can't really make much cash that way. The quickest way is to board and capture ships with your troopers, then sell the vessel, or through bounty-hunting. This skews the game towards a combat model -- not complaining, mind you, but if you want to have a robust economic model, well, then make it workable. Players should be able to make MORE money through mining, gas clouds, and trading. There's a fair bit of grinding involved if you want to play a merchant. This is a shame because there is an excellent transport infrastructure -- i.e. you can travel vast distances using T-gates, rifts, worm holes, etc.I like the fact that there's sandbox mode and campaign mode. Having hangars and your own fighters/bombers is a nice touch; and being able to beam your troopers to enemy vessels to try capturing them is fun. All in all, SG2 is an entertaining and pretty game, but it falls short of being great -- more RPG elements would help, and of course, proper joystick support... and yeah, the voice acting sucks! I would recommend getting it only if it's on sale. 6.5/10.0			"

												At a glance Starpoint Gemeni 2 is a sandbox space sim, nothing special and it has been done better before.I could live with it if the game features an interesting story, which the game does. The game also has a tendency to crash during or shortly after finishing a story mission which makes it a race to reach a save point before the game crashes and you need to redo the mission. So the redemption from story doesn't apply. If anything it just makes me more frustrated.Looking further into the game, you realize it is a single player MMORPG, ship upgrades are gated behind arbitrary level requirements. Ships handle basically the same except for the top speed, so your carrier is just as agile as the starting gunship.Weapon upgrades follow a similar MMORPG route, some weapons are poor and you go through the game trying to find better weapons. Weapons that are described in awkward and sometimes even incorrect ways, such as ""rate of fire"" being the delay between each shot. Once you get over the initial hump of how weapons operate you realize you need a calculator to figure out which weapon to use.Sure I can play this, but all the time doing so there is a thought in my head asking why I am playing this game when I have better games available.Edit: 2015-11-25I just wanted to add that this game isn't necessarily bad, if they fixed the weapon descriptions and the crashes I'd actually consider recommend it.I consider the X-series, especially X-3, to be more enjoyable. I do not want to advertise for other games in a review, which is why this was at first omnitted, but since so many replies have been about it I'll add it.			"

												This game will give you hours of fun, not a fast pace action packed in your face game but the strategic plan your every move with every action having consequences game. In saying that the combat is very rewarding with many battles containing the fast pace action (if you manuver your ship properly to avoid incoming damage and allow your weapons to target correctly while adjusting speed, shields and/or gunnery). Interface gets the job done but can take a few minutes to understand which isn't a negative with a great tutorial that can be accessed at any time if you forget something. There are not many camera angles which I look forward to an update on this to make a more fluid experience especially in combat (there is free move camera angle which can hinder while flying and looking around). I truly would enjoy a cockpit view from the captains chair to feel really immersed while mining or ship to ship combat. I also want to see more interactivity with planets and stations ( one suggestion would be allowing the player to approach an enemy planet to try a diplomatic or subversion mission to change the flow of power/status of that planet).  In a nutshell try this game it makes for a great space flying simulator.			"

												I see a lot of negative reviews for this game, and while it may be a bit repetative, I can't find any 3-D space RPGs that are as easy to control and not just pure spaceflight ""simulator"". The story and voice-overs are what you would expect from a space rpg, however that shouldn't really be the reason you play this game. In my opinion, I have had loads of fun warping all over the galaxy doing manuevers around large carries and owning pirates and rebels with my plasma cannons and missiles. The amount of customizibility with your ship is off the chart for this game, however once you find your playing style and the best gear for that style you are kind of set. You can also download other peoples mods and get fan made ships or docking hangers and other cool weapons not found in-game which is pretty sweet that the devs opened it up for modding.All in all, this is a quality game that I went back and purchased the DLC's for because I thought the price justified the entertainment. If you like space games like the original escape velocity, or games like the app galaxy on fire you will like this game a lot. 8/10			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 recently left Early Access, and it is now one of the few games of that honour to actually turn out well. If I was to compare it to anything, I'd say it's like Freelancer or an offline EVE, though not quite as complex as the latter. Complete sandbox freedom. Go wherever you want and be whatever you want, whether that be a trader, pirate, mercenary, miner, fighter, explorer etc. Though it is a space sim, it also plays a lot like an open world RPG. You pick from three different classes - COMMANDER: has a focus on buffing friendly units, GUNNER: all about maximising firepower and ENGINEER:  boosting your own power systems and hacking/debuffing the enemy - and go around doing freelance missions, mining, fighting or exploring, and it all gives you XP (and sometimes money) to level up your character. Levelling gives you the ability to spend points on improving your class skills, which can be used in battle, and attaining perks, which provide buffs to a number of things like increasing troop strength for boarding ships or improving trade prices.Besides the sandbox 'Freeroam' mode where you are able to freely explore, there is also a recently added Campaign mode. This provides you with story missions, but you lose the ability to pick your class, character portrait or choose from one of the three starter ships (it forces you into a Taurus ship, arguably the best of the three anyway). The story isn't great, and it's a little buggy, but you can still freely explore and do whatever you want while doing it. The story missions are not particularly interesting (go from point A to B, kill target, deliver package, meet NPC etc), but they give you something else to do. If you're feeling aimless and not sure what to do next, the campaign missions can be a good way to provide yourself with a sort of goal or objective. Each mission will advance in level and difficulty, and you will often find yourself needing to gain XP and a more powerful ship in order to advance. I found that It added to the feeling of progression, albeit in a not very interesting way. It's completely optional, but I personally had no interest in it.There are nearly a hundred ships to acquire by either buying them or grappling and boarding an enemy ship, killing the crew and towing it back to a nearby station to either sell ( for a very high price ;] ) or place in your garage for use, and they are all customisable. You can equip them with a variety of different weapons like railguns, plasma cannons, beam weapons and heavy weapons. You can enhance your systems by purchasing upgrades for things like your propulsion engines or shield generators. You can even give them a new paint job and add decals, though the colours don't stand out too well and the decals are just a short list of basic emblems. You do have the ability to add your own custom ones, but I didn't mess around with that feature. They're nice cosmetic touches, but nothing to rave about. The boarding is also fully automated and you don't actually get to see anything happening. It's nothing more than watching troop numbers rise and fall and choosing whether or not to send reinforcements. Quite unexciting to say the least, but stealing ships this way will be your main source of income, and managing to capture an expensive ship still gave me a lovely feeling of satisfaction despite the lack of a more involved system.Your ship is freely controlled, you can fly it yourself wherever you wish with the WASD keys and your mouse. You also must manage your power output. Do you divert all power to engines to give yourself a speed boost, to shields to make them hold out longer, to weapons so they fire for longer or do you try to balance between them all? It's very situational and you will find yourself having to tweak it back and forth very often when travelling and in combat. It's a system I quite enjoy as it keeps you occupied and helps with keeping the combat and travel feeling busy.Speaking of combat, it's very fun, though not too complex. You can aim and fire your weapons yourself or have it done for you with autofire (though it can be inaccurate at times) and positioning is key. You and your enemy have four directional shields, one for each side, and each decreases under fire accordingly, meaning you should focus fire on one side if you wish to do optimal damage. If any of you have played Star Trek Online, the shielding is pretty similar to what that game has. You also have a choice of four skills, which differ depending on your choice of class. Each provides some sort of combat buff and can be levelled to add more effects. On top of that, there are then a multitude of items you can purchase and use whenever you wish, such as temporary speed boosters, repair drones or T-Drives (these allow you to instantaneously jump great distances) and a variety of other things. If used right, they can really save you when in a tight spot.One issue with the combat however, is balance. I often found myself easily destroying ships marked as 'impossible' targets to beat due to having bought a reasonably expensive weapon or by managing to acquire a powerful ship. This can really mess with the early game and make it far too easy. It does begin to even out the further you level due to enemy scaling, but as long as you continue upgrading, it never gets difficult enough. This is tricky to do however and really only becomes a problem once you're comfortable and good at the game, which takes time.Overall, and despite some flaws, I believe this to be a good game with a lot of love and care put into it by the devs. It is just oozing with content and interesting, well polished mechanics. If the developer's words are anything to go by, a huge list of future content is still planned for Starpoint Gemini 2 and all of it will, supposedly, be completely free of charge. Hopefully a game to keep your eye on.I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of space sims, sandbox titles and even people who are awaiting Elite: Dangerous or Star Citizen. It's not overly complex and it does lean a little more on the arcadey side of things, but despite that, it's still a deep enough experience to sink some enjoyable hours into.Score: 7/10			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is a great space rpg.usually a statement like that needs clarification, so here we go. this game is basically if you took the most complicated parts out of games like x, opened up the game world like evochron mercenary and throw in a control system not unlike eve online. what im getting at is that its not as complicated to play as the aforementioned games but leaves the best parts of each and marries them into a system thats fresh and familiar.one of the things that irritated me about the x series and evochron for that matter is that missions had to be acquired at a station. my question has always been, why? no long range communications in either universe? in SPG2 that is a thing of the past, when you enter an area, you will be notified when missions are available and you can accept missions directly from the starmap which brings me to the next point. the starmap is one contigious area, like in evochron, there are no load screeens and while the actual area is smaller than evochron, its a lot more detailed visually. so yes its probably not 100% true to life because there are very few areas that just look like a black void in space, but the visuals are well done and give you more to look at than just black with white dots everywhere.controls are reminicent of eve online though i havent played it in years, it reminds me of that. not necessarily a terrible thing, but if you are looking to find yourself in the cockpit of the ship, these ships dont feature cockpits. if anything even the smallest class available would have a bridge. so in comparison to the ships in X or EM, youre piloting a capital ship right off the bat. in fact to give some comparison, the M5 through M3 classes of ships in X are basically bought as commodities to place in the hangar of carriers. you wont be flying anything that small and if you were, youd have reason to be very very afraid. it would seem that the gemini system doesnt build much of anything in small scale :)As of this writing there are a few technical issues that arent game breaking but considering the devlopment team is very active and even communicates with the players regularly i feel that this game will evolve into something even better. if you like rpgs and space games, this will be right up your alley. LGM has done a great job keeping the game fun and challenging without making it a nightmare to learn how to play.			"

												I wish there was a ""meh"" button along with thumbs up and thumbs down. Bought it after getting burned out on Elite Dangerous in hopes that it would scratch my space sim itch. One one hand, the scale just isn't there. You tool around a single smallish star system littered with stations, planets, teleportation gates and even a couple black holes and nebulae for some reason. The space is also dirty, dusty and littlered - no, really - there are chunks of rock and clouds of dust constantly whizzing by (fortunately there are mods that get rid of that). There's no hyperspacing to other systems or exploring the galaxy. I guess it's a little bit like the Expanse TV series.On the oher hand, during ship combat the scale is pretty faithful - you blast your cannons in the general direction of someone flying around you in the darkness, and all you see of the opposing ship is the big red target marker. Eventually, one of you blows up. The only way to take a closer look is to approach to boarding distance, which I have to admit is a nice touch. Between that and a rather obtuse camera, the space combat experience is underwhelming.The game isn't bad, it's just kind of lackluster. You can tell that it was made by a tiny studio on a limited budget. I know LGM tried hard, but neither the visuals nor the sound can hold a candle to the current-gen games. After seeing the visuals delivered by Elite and even the unfinished mess that is Star Citizen, you soon notice the janky-looking engine exhaust, low-budget pewpew effects and simplistic ships.It also has some issues outside of the weird camera, the most glaring being a graphics crash (blank screen) in full-screen mode. Since you can only save in stations, this can wipe out a lot of progress.Let me put it this way: this is a chill spaceflight game (not a sim) in the similar vein as Rogue Galaxy, and it was worth the purchase price of $6.50 with all DLCs during the sale. I wouldn't pay more than that.			"

												Starpoint Gemini feels like a PC game I played when I was younger. It's relatively rough around the edges and there is nothing groundbreaking about the graphics--but it represents a kind of space exploration game in a very cohesive package. The soundtrack is filled with ambient electronica and is a real highlight for me; scanning pulsars and exploring unknown reaches of space feels extremely gratifying and peaceful at the same time.The game itself lets you explore space however you choose: you can become a merchant flying cargo through sectors, a bounty hunter going after pirates, an explorer of the universe and scanning anomalies and space oddities etc, etc. It's a game with great potential that doesn't hold you hand from start to finish. If you have any interest in Sci-fi/space exploration games (Freelancer/Star Trek: Bridge Commander/Eve Online) this game does a great job filling that role.			"

												Starpoing Gemini 2 is a humbling game.  It isn't on the scale of some star exploration games, being in only one star system.  But where it lacks in size to its competition, it makes up for it with sheer density and diversity in play.  You can be a star trader, pirate, a security operative, or... yes, even a mere space station mechanic -- only accepting missions to repair other space stations to earn your money.  The combat is intelligent and engaging, but not too challenging.  The only drawback is I cannot bring my friends in.  But with a list of objectives like I have in this, who has time for them?  time to go kill some pirates and steal whatever they've stolen, and sell it!  BETTER SHIPS ♥♥♥♥♥ES "

												I would not recommend this game to anyone but the most hardcore fans of the genre, and that provided the price comes down. While I do acknowledge some might enjoy the tedium and vaccum, neither I, nor any of my friends did. Core mechanics are grind, fetch&kill 'quests' and exploration. You also pick up things and sell them off at the nearest friendly station, or buy things at one point and sell them to a trader across the map for profit. The game world is huge and fun to explore at first, but given the lack of variety (it is space, after all) it will get boring afer a while. Combat is nothing like a proper space sim - you either get projectile weapons and miss, or directed energy (beam) weapons and hit 100% of the time via automatic turrets. These make the whole combat thing ridiculous - all the fun is outsourced to your onboard computer. The game seems to be balanced with this in mind - you can either turn on the auto tracking and let the computer do the fighting or die. Fun parts:-exploration. the playing environment is huge! Volumetric shadows, nebulas, asteroid and debris fields and planets are stunning. It does get old after a while given the game's shortcomings -visuals as per above. Nothing you haven't seen in X3 already though-ship designs & varietyThe not-so-fun parts:-tedious, fetch&kill tasks that pass for quests here; gets old in about 10 minutes -the game is vacuous. think mmo without quests or other players. -as of now the game is bugged and some options are greyed out. No, despite what the industry standard for indie games seems to have become lately, it is not okay to release an unfinished game with greyed out options and scenarios that 'will be added later on'. That's what early access is for!-repetitive, unaccomplished space combat-the 'RPG' portion of the game comes down to several global stat boosts and 4 active skills, which I've not seen to have any serious impact on the game			"

												I am a SUCKER for space exploration games (I even played Darkstar One, and it was mediocre at best). An yet I did not like this one. This has mainly three reasons:* The story (what little I have played before giving up on the game) is not riveting and seems to follow already trodden paths (trodden by games far superior). The whole ""The system is riven with conflict and there is some hidden threat only YOU can uncover"" is nice and dandy, but again, done better by previous games. The voice acting is .. unethusiastic. I know, I have been spoiled by world-class actin as in Mass Effect, but still...There is a lot of grinding - trading, mining, doing freelance missions, to get a ship that you need to NOT be blasted to smithereens by the next main mission,. There ALWAYS is. It is a core principle of the game, and usually, one that I like. In this game, it feels like a chore. This has again to do with the story, which just does nothing to make me want to reach the next mission.* The steering. This is a MAYOR point. I did not think one could botch follow-the-mouse-steering. Sadly, one can. The point you fly to is somewhere in the upper third of the monitor. Which KINDA makes sense given the perspective and the axis of the ship and all. BUT the neutral zone of the mouse-steering is in the center of the screen. Which means that when you point at an object an try to fly towards it, you will pass OVER it (for given values of ""OVER"" in 3D space).This is annoying, to say the least. It is also unintuitive. I remember when Freelancer made me use the mouse (for me, it was the first time then) to steer the ship. I took to it in seconds, because it was so intuitive. Well, this one is NOT.* The mission system is bugged, if not broken. ""Yes, you can take this mission with level 6"" Great. They WHY is there a friggin' CRUISER waiting for my gunship at the mission point, blasting the living hell out of me? This happens regularly, and it is annoying. ""Nooo, THIS science mission is WAY to dangerous, it requires you to be level 11."" Ah-ha. So floating in space, with NO enemies to pop up (I have yet to meet one on science missions) and waiting for the scanner is something only my higher-level self can handle.. All those points make me kinda regret the purchase. Oh, and one final note: it may be okay with copyright law to use the theme from the mining minigame of Mass Effect 2 and use in the score, for me, it was just an INSULT to the ME franchise, because this game is not even doing the same sport, not not mention playing in the same league.

												A worthy addition to your steam space strategy titles. It starts off a little grindy but once you get over the initial credit problems the fun really begins. Over 70 ships to buy and fly from gunships all the way up to carriers and dreadnoughts. You can trade and fight across a large area with many many different factions.Customize your ship how you like with different officers, weapons and equipment and choose from a large amount of skills and perks to further compliment your ship.There are two modes to play, campaign for a single player story and sandbox. The effort has obviously been put into the sandbox over the campaign.One really annoying problem and probably the only major one for me is the abyssmal camera control. Something that should be bread and butter for a game of this type. you have to use something called turret mode to get anywhere near the type of camera your used to in just about every other game of this type. Unfortunately even turret mode is a floodlight type chase cam.Despite the camera problem I heartily recommend this game for anyone who is missing a fix of space goodness.Here is a taste of cruiser gameplay:

												Very good Freelancer-like spaceships game. Very nice graphics, playability and effects. A lot of ships which are actually different one from one to another. There's not just the boring small-big-bigger-huge mechanics mixed with the Light-Heavy-Trader axis. With different stats (cargo load, soldiers, weapon spots etc) the choice between one model and the other seems to have some meaning. Trading is a bit basic, although the map is very large and there are a lot different goods with different degrees of ""rareness"". Main campaign not so exciting but with some twists and cutplay more than decent. Big plus: the company is still supporting the game with fixes, adds and patches. Without asking you for more money. Much wows, so honest, many pleasant.			"

												It took nearly 20 hours to finally come to a conclusion on this game.Despite all efforts made to make the combat complex - energy management, 4 different active abilities (with a kinda silly feeling levelups with them),  and up to 4 consumable items (of a selection of around a dozen) useful for combat - it just isn't all that fun. I believe the biggest culprit is turrets. While it is possible to partially blindside a less maneuverable ship than yours in 1v1, ultimately maneuvering and dodging in combat is best done by spinning around in circles. When you're spinning around in circles, you can't effectively target and attack targets manually, and so you rely on fire-at-will auto targetting to do that job for you. This is boring.The economy is workable, but not that interesting - different stations have a set low-mid-high value for all of the commodities. Buy and sell appropriately.The storyline is workable. The Gemini universe is interesting, and is worth reading about if you're into that sort of thing. The storyline does an almost adequate job of immersing you in that universe. The voice acting/writing is awwwwwwful.The good: All around, this is a workable game that will scratch your spacefaring itch, though will likely not leave you satisfied. The graphics are beautiful, each region of space is very well stylized in the coloring, asteroids, and various anomalies. Plenty of the starbases and ships have pretty unique detailed models. Music and sound are good, although the short soundtrack for the music is a mild disappointment there.			"

												Overall, I think this is a pretty fun game...just not worth the $40 they want for the game + DLC.  Given that it's been released for several years now, and apparently, is still full of bugs/missing mechanics that the dev's were promising would be fixed years ago, I don't think I'll be buying anything else by this company.  The Titan DLC was rather dissapointing, it was more of a God mode than additional content...once you're in a Titan, just hit fire at will, and a few seconds later, even fleets of carriers are goners...and there's only 2 enemy titans as opponents, once you've captured/destroyed them, you're pretty much invincible. Also, voiceovers frequently failed, the game would occasionally crash for no apparent reason, and planets/bases only stocking 1-3 of consumables is frankly annoying and ridiculous, particularly when it comes to those used for salvaging/mining.One thing I found particularly annoying, is that on the context menu, there is a button labled Follow.  None of the in-game tutorials mention this button, and as far I can tell, it remains greyed out no matter what you have selected...and does not work to let you follow any of your escort targets, or enemies, or anything else.  Nor does it work to tell hired mercs to ""follow"" you...apparently, it is one more vestige of over-ambitious devs that gave up on the game to move on to something else.I will mention that I have not tried any of the mods for the game, but as it stands by itself, it is definitely a product that did not live up to its potential....and the reputation system? Really? 1 kind of good vs. evil rep with all those factions? and if you go outlaw...its hilarious...once you can land on an outlaw planet, failing to smuggle on that planet moves your rep more towards outlaw(just like failing to smuggle on ""good"" planets), making outlaw factions(including that planet) more friendly...lol.I mean, how hard would it REALLY have been to include a reputation number for each faction?Don't get me wrong, I did find that game enjoyable overall...but there was so many constant things that made me feel like I was playing a beta instead of a game that had been released more than 3 years ago...

												I love space sim, Freelancer, Freespace, etc. and I hoped for this game to be another like them. But unfortunately no. Graphis is good, ships nice, weapons too. But..Why have only turrets? And camera binded to them?Why such dumb camera controls? Even with joystick it's not like space sim.Why so slow travelling without time acceleration?I've tried it for a few hours, but no, I am dissapointed, I was looking forward to this game. Maybe I will try to play it another year if those issues would be solved.			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is a complete turn-around from the quality of the first game. It's prettier, it's satisfyingly complex and most of all, it's a lot of fun. It's blend of RPG elements, freeroaming gameplay and atmosphere is great, and pretty well refined. While the voice acting isn't anything to write home about, the simple joy of adjusting the loadout for your ships, hiring officers, mercs and troopers, and leveling up can be downright intoxicating. A couple small issues nag at me, however. At the time of this review, the ability to adjust shadow quality or post-processing in the video options menu is still locked. There are some balancing issues that make themselves painfully apparent within the first hour or so of gameplay, namely the rate at which you accrue money. Tackling big number bounties might seem like a great idea, but they're prohibitively difficult (as of level 7, all the available bounties were way way out of my level range) and grinding freelance missions can sometimes feel monotonous. Additionally, the lack of communications chatter between ships can make space feel somewhat sterile. When rescuing a ship from pirates, it would be great to hear a panicked captain's voice pleading for assistance, or thanking me for the help. These are minor gripes about what amounts to an overall great experience.Granted, I haven't played through a ton of the story campaign content, and my time with the game might be small compared to others, but having seen such a triumphant turn-around from the first entry, I felt compelled to gush a little bit, and congratulate the developers. Well done, guys! I tend to not be one to jump on the early access titles very often, but it was honestly really cool watching the development of this game, seeing community input being utilized, and watching something grow from nothing. I can say truthfully that I don't regret purchasing this game during early access in the least.4 out of 5 stars.			"

												With only 3 hours play this is only first thoughts.A worthy title. If you have played any of the X series of games this is it's younger and not so complicated brother. In some ways it is more like Freelancer but either way it has nods to all these games whilst keeping it light on the learning curve. You can jump right in and start blasting asteroids for early bucks and the early missions (freeplay) are doable with the starting ship.I have several mods that give me Star Trek ships and a Star Wars universe to roam in which are both from the Steam Workshop.In short (in earlry play) this is an instantly playable space trading/shooter that looks and feels great but don't expect the depth that the X series has (which for some people will be perfect ;) )7/10 Go give an asteroid a new bumhole.

												This game was a big surprise for me. I was never much into heavy stuff like Star Citizen with their real physics and hardcore gaming. SPG2 is fun, entertaining, tense, interesting, relaxing, I cannot describe it in a few words. I found this by accident and decided to give it a try. It blew me away. Please, give it a shot. I doubt you'll regret it. Can't wait to see what will they come up with next! 11 out of 10!Update Jun 2016. Seeing and playing Warlords, you can tell how deeply these devs care about their players. Warlords is so much bigger and with so many stuff people wanted in SPG2, that I can recommend it over SPG2. But if you're relatively new to the genre, this gem is currently on massive 80% off and it's worth every cent.			"

I heard there are people with 1000+ hours and I know I'm not going there, but I'm pretty sure it will keep me occupied for many more hours. Then again, with all DLCs it means even more time sunk into this amazing game. Keep up the good work developers!!!			"

Early Access Review
								Overall, it's a very, very good game. I've split this review into a few categories, so maybe that'll help you find what matters most.- GameplayLet's be honest here. This game is about space combat, not about mining or scavenging or being a space taxi man. That's where the ""meat and potatoes"" of this game is. So this is the most important thing for this game to get right. If it fails at this, it fails as a game.And to its credit... gameplay is superb. Combat is fun, if a bit monotonous once you get a really powerful ship. It only keeps you on the edge of your seat when you're in real danger of losing your ship, such as when facing a really strong enemy while you're flying a much weaker ship, or a large fleet of enemies on your own.Capturing an enemy ship is very satisfying. Unfortunately, towing ships takes a very long time and can be quite boring, especially if you're being attacked by enemies the whole way there. This game is still in early access, so balancing will still happen, so we'll have to see where it goes. But for now, its an amazing game and I can't wait for more!There are a few immersion-breaking issues, though, such as the large delay, stutters and pauses when starting up the game, when entering a new area, when receiving new missions, or when auto-saving. However, since this is early access and not full release, we'll have to see what will become of these bugs.Score: 9/10- StorylineNone. At least none that I could find. While the game is tremendous fun on its own, with farming resources, capturing enemy ships and destroying enemy outposts, there doesn't seem to be any real purpose to it. At least not until the game is finished.The story is still being developed, as this is still an unfinished product. But if this turns out to be a game where the war between factions can have the tide of the war turned either way depending on the player's success or failure in certain missions, it could be very cool, especially if areas become owned by different factions thereafter.Score: Unknown (Not yet finished)- ControlsThe controls are nice and solid, with ships feeling very responsive (small ones) or sluggish (large ones) depending on size. The way a ship accelerates and breaks is also much more believable and immersive than you might believe from early footage. Trying to get a carrier to stop within 100m of a target feels like a feat of piloting at times.3D space combat has been perfect by this game. I've played many space combat games like Homeworld, Star Trek Online and several others. But this game nails it and then some. At first I didn't understand why all the buttons and controls were needed for. But after enough time playing, I get it. And the position of the keys and what they do really helps give you a great feeling of control in the game.Score: 10/10- Graphics and SoundLet's face it, as time marches forwards nobody wants to see ugly-looking games (unless they like Indie or retro games). And this game has some of the finest looking graphics one could hope for. They look beautiful, and even at 1440p on my GTX 650 Ti Boost 2GB it still performs smoothly (except when there are a lot of ships).Considering that this is on the low side of a mid-tier graphics card, I'm impressed. With more graphics settings I should be able to increase framerate, and coding optimizations should also help make the game run smoother in the long term.Sound wasn't much of a focus on this game, but the chatter and computer voice are really nice, and remind me a lot of the voice of the Enterprise-D in Star Trek: The Next Generation. It was a heart-warming surprise, and I can't wait until we get a total conversion mod for Starpoint Gemini 2.The lack of a large variety of background music did feel a bit annoying and lackluster, but time will fix that. I'd love to have this game include beautiful symphonic and orchestral music, like Star Wars, Star Trek, and other great SciFi series. Music could really help take this game to the next level.Score: 7/10- ChallengeThe game felt off-balance at several points during my dozens of hours playing so far. Capturing a large ship early on and using it felt almost like cheating on Normal difficulty. I'd like to see more balancing, such as not being able to use more than X amount of turrets on a ship depending on how many ranks below its minimum requirement you are. (So, if you're level 25 and trying to use a level 35 ship, you wouldn't be able to use 2 turrets in each direction.)The long-term replay-ability right now is hindered because the game hasn't really given players much of an end-game challenge or reward system. Once you have earned 50M credits, and have several Dreadnoughts in your garage, the game just doesn't feel challenging anymore.I'd like to see something to give the players the ability to hire commanders and bridge officers to command the ships in their garage, to they can join the player in large scale battles. This way it helps the player build his very own Armada to wipe out large (and challenging) enemy structures.Right now all the fun is at the first 30 levels of the game. Once you reach that, it gets monotonous. But given the early development of this game, I think we can expect great things from it, especially with modding support.Score: 6/10- FunWhat can I say? I had a blast (no pun intended)! It was exciting and challenging for a long while, and it's consumed me for the past few days. I've lost sleep planning what my next ship upgrade should be, or where to lurk around under cloak waiting to capture the ship I wanted (but couldn't afford). Few games drag you in and hold your attention like that. All I can say is that I'm beyond impressed!Score: 9/10- ConclusionI guess here's what I've got to say. For a game on Early Access on Steam, this is as much promise as I could dream of. (Unless you count Star Citizen, but that isn't fair.) It's fun, exciting, supports modding... it just isn't finished.If you're looking to buy a whole package that's neatly wrapped up, ready to go, this game isn't for you. When you play an Early Access game, you're getting a sneak preview, you're beta-testing a game that will (of course) be filled with bugs (and your job is to report them), and your feedback this early on will also help shape where the game goes. You get to be involved in the creation of the game, and if it succeeds you get the satisfaction of knowing you helped a little.This is a sneak preview. It's a taste of what's to come. And so far, I like what I see. They've got the game where it counts. Now it's just a matter of the final touches like faction warfare, dynamic economy, trade blockade, storyline, and so on. But given how far this game has progressed, that shouldn't take too much longer. I haven't seen many bugs, and for 25$ right now this game is a steal!I give this game a wholehearted approval, and my recommendation to buy it. I can't wait to see what kind of amazing mods we'll see. Here's hoping the team that did the Star Trek Armada III mod for Sins of a Solar Empire can start working ASAP on Starpoint Gemini 2.			"

Early Access Review
								I had this game gifted to me by a friend(Thank you, Thune!), and it's easily one of the best space games I've played in awhile.  If you enjoyed the freedom that the X series gave you, but absolutely hated the UI(or lack there-of), this is a game to rectify that.Flying your ship is quite easy and fun, combat is rather fluid and in-line with the class of ship you're currently flying.  Combat is definitely part of the game, but certainly not the only aspect.  You can shoot asteroids for resources, scan anomalies, salvage wrecked vessels(of your own making via combat, or derelicts you find), send troops onto enemy ships in attempts to capture and then tow them to a station(strip them of fittings, sell them, or keep them for yourself), there's also trading between stations and planets.Everything you do awards some experience points(running missions, scanning anomalies, killing things, etc), which is then used to upgrade your character's abilities(weapon skills for railguns, lasers, plasma and heavy weapons; want your railgun shots to have a chance to fire twice with one volley?  A chance to penetrate shields and hit hull?  Longer bursts for your lasers?  Put points into the appropriate skills.)The devs are very active on the forums and always listen to the community, even adding community ideas into the game regularly.  They also really want the modding community to have as much control as possible to expand the game; as evidenced by the Steamworkshop support.I expect great things to be afoot for this game in the future, and even in early access it's fun to tinker around and see what you can get into.  The engine is solid and the dev team is very much hard at work, the community following the game is strong.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open-world space games with no loading screens.

								I've been looking for a game like this for a long time. There are a lot of space games out there (and quite literally more coming by the day) but most focus on either small scale fighter combat (Freelancer / Freespace style), or large scale rts fleet combat (Sins of a Solar Empire / Home World). There isnt much of a selection when it comes to piloting your own larger class of ship from the helm. For those of you who enjoy the likes of Eve and Startrek Online i believe there will be much here you will enjoy. First impressions show a lot of potential and a fun RPG / progression system in place. The graphics are nice and the combat is enjoyable. I look forward to seeing more of what this game has to offer.			"

								Starpoint Gemini 2 is not your ""typical"" Space Fighter game. When playing this game you need to treat your ships more as a ""crewed"" ship then a standard fighter ship. First mistake I made was trying to use my ship as a fighter, this reduced the amount of fire power and abilities of my ship greatly. Every ship in the game is a manned ship meaning turrets are controled by you or you can assign crew to operate them for you, leaving you the ability to keep them in line with the target. Its an extremely in depth game, and extremely fun. I'd highly recommend it to any one who is tired of the same old ""fighter craft in space"" game.			"

												Having just played through Rebel Galaxy, maybe I was expecting too much, but couldn't get into this.  It lacks cohesive vision, just feels like a bunch of different game systems tacked on, and thrown together, with nothing in particular being well done.  It's not terrible, just dull.  Combat is dull, trading is dull, the progression system is dull, weapon and ship variants, factions, characters, various ways of adding percentage bonuses to basic abilities, ship enhancement items, crew members you can hire, but nothing does anything interesting.  The story is barely more than a distraction.  The gameworld is just a bunch of planets and stations clumped together in a cubic space, with a binary star painted in the background, like the scenery behind a fishtank.  It's a space sim which seems to be created by people who have no interest in basic astronomy whatsoever.  Disappointing.			"

												As someone who loves space games, including strategy, simulation, sandbox, RPG, and almost any genre in space, I love this game.  Im an avid fan of X3: Terran Conflict and the X series in general.  Starpoint Gemini 2 has so many things right and is fun, simple, and rather elegant.  I highly recommend it.  However, as with all games, it does have drawbacks and a few not so great things. First off, Voice Acting-You will likely notice it straight away when you start the campaign.  The voice acting is certainly better than that in the original, however it is still poor.  Most characters have strange accents or inflections, strange pronunciations which are inconsitent between characters (specifically the word ""stasis"") and no emotional connection.  The main character, Adrian Faulkner, is basically monotone with no depth nor feeling thruout. As a man who just lost his father and is out for revenge, he is VERY boring.   So do not expect the story to be compelling on that count. Story/missions-The story in SPG2 is better that is was in the original, and seems more streamlined, however it still remains quite boring after a short while.  I understand the game is mostly freeroam/sandbox, so take this as you will.  However, the missions are a bit more diverse than the original with some capture stuff added in as well as some scanning and transporting.  But it still remains the standard ""Go Here, Kill/capture/scan/transport, Return, Listen to more dialogue""    So dont expect alot of diversity in missions.  Its pretty much the same with side missions and freelance. Gameplay-The gameplay is terrific. Its nice, simple, and easy to use.  Its easy to jump into the game and not have to learn 1000 controls or things to do.   However I personally miss some of the depth of controls and other minor things for the sake of immersion. (Thinking of X3) Ship models / aesthetic -The overall design, and texture of all ships and stations were fantastic and very intricate.  I might have to say they are some ofmy favorite ship designs in a long time.   Planets are ok, but lack proper scale.  Vigo at the start is almost the same size as planet trinity or at least pretty close.  Go look at planets in X3 and see proper scale.  However I understand such an accurate massive scale wouldnt work in an sandbox single system. Its something that many space games (mostly strategy games) do. In the end I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a nice, simple space sim with a bit of RPG elements thrown in.  You will get a good 40 or so hours out of it, then will lack anything to do. There are freelance missions that will repeat forever.			"

												--UPDATE--  Starpoint Gemini Warlords has entered the beta stage of Early Acces.  If you haven't already bought SG2, I would recommend skipping right over to SGW instead.  It directly addresses the issues found in  SG2  and offers fleet building and management while retaining the things that were great about SG2.  SG2 is still a worthwhile purchase if you have money to spare, but comparing the two, SGW is definitely a step up - including the ability to hotswap between KB/M controls and an XB1 Controller.It's a pretty good game.  I feel that SG2 is deep enough to be interesting, but not so deep that it becomes a chore to play.  It is very RPG-like in that regard.  This isn't what I would consider a ""super-complex"" simulator, but the gameplay elements are more reflective of mainstream game design.  This is not X3: Albion Prelude (a great choice if you're looking for an extremely long-term 4x/space simulator game, btw.  I highly recommend X3AP, too.).  You don't need to spend hours on end just learning the game to enjoy it, but it is still a deep enough system that you can do what you want with it.  ""Easy to learn, difficult to master"", is I guess, as close to the truth as possible.There are a large number of ships to be purchased and each has a number of components that can be swapped out.  The individual components can be upgraded with a variety of stat bonuses.  Crew members can be hired who will also provide different stat bonuses.  You can choose a character class at the beginning of the game that will give different abilities, and that character will gain levels as you play.  NPC wingmen can also be hired.I like it because it is all the things I enjoy from EVE Online, but as a single-player game, with all the single-player elements I would expect.  There is an optional story-line campaign that can be played or ignored at your leisure.  I'd recommend starting the game in Campaign Mode, not Free Roam.  The only difference between the two modes is the lack of story-line missions in Free Roam as far as I can see.  Free Roam in SG2 is like playing Skyrim without the story missions.The game is very flexible in terms of how it can be controlled.  I've seen people say that the controls are bad, but I got used to them quickly.  Once I got used to switching between control styles with the press of a couple of buttons it became a very fuid experience.  You can take manual control of ship-to-ship combat or allow the game to do the bulk of the work depending on your mood with the press of a few buttons.  You can switch between multiple camera perspectives, mouse vs keyboard turning, and/or lock the camera to your turrets or follow your ship with the press of a few buttons.  This dynamically changes the gameplay ranging from playing the game like a 1st person space flight shooter to a 3rd person EVE Online style point-and-click system complete with the wheel-menu auto-pilot system.  There is even the EVE Online style auto-targetting system that allows you to tell your ship's turrets to automatically fire at hostile targets in range with the press of a button.  Manually aiming and shooting will increase your rate of fire and damage potential, but your ability to hit the target is based solely on your aiming skills.  Auto-targetting slows down your rate of fire, but hitting targets is based on your ships numerical statistics.The game also randomly generates side-missions, which are the standard faire (""go here, pick up this, scan that, kill something, deliver this"" etc, etc.).  I can't really complain about that, though.  They're optional and I don't know what I would have done differently.  They're short and sweet and appropriately rewarding.  It's something to do and it keeps the money flowing in!Choosing missions is a simple process.  You open up the Starmap and click on the icon to bring up the mission description and click accept (or the ""OK"" button to close the window if you don't want to do it).  These missions tell you the recommended level, what needs to be done, and the reward for accomplishing it.  The game also allows you to click anywhere on the map and select a ""Go to"" option from the pop-up menu.  This will set your ship on auto-pilot and take you to the location.  Just keep an eye on the screen for long distances.  Unlike EVE Online, objects in space are actually solid and running into an asteroid or space-station isn't going to do your ship any favors.Graphically, it looks really great on max-settings.  It is slightly stylized, so it should age well as time goes on.  And holy crap, the customization for the ships is great.  Other games would charge micro-transaction fees for what you're allowed to do with your ship customization in this game.  You can change the name, the color of the name, the logo, the color of the logo, the paint color, the ""glossiness"" of the paint (to the point of making your ship look like a mirror, if you want).  Flying around in the USS SrFrogg23 with a neon-red logo and Skull & Crossbones Pirate logo with reflective black paint that you can see the surrounding stars on is pretty cool!The game's performance on my computer has been great.  I haven't noticed any frame-rate drops, even when there's a lot going on on the screen.  There is a slight hiccup when travelling from one ""sector"" of the map to another (the hexagonal sections of the Starmap), but I think that's probably textures being loaded.  Not a big deal considering the game doesn't use any load screens or ""instances"" to separate locations.  The whole map is ""open-world"" so everything is connected.If I have any complaints about this game it is the voice-acting and music placement.  The voice-acting is passable, but not great.  I really wish the devs had put the ship's voice through a few filters to give her a more synthetic sound.  I guess she's supposed to be a helmsman or something, but she constantly provides updates using the same sound-bytes and it just doesn't sound natural for a human being to provide the exact same dialog in the exact same tone for the same situations over and over and over again.  That's something I can look passed, but I think it would have been easier to accept as a player coming from an on-board A.I. system.The music is also really nice when I'm out flying about, but docking (Anchoring) at stations has music that seems extremely out of place.  It's epic, and it's ok for a title-screen, but it gets really loud and obnoxious when I'm browsing through a station's selection of ships and component upgrades...  The station music wore out its welcome extremely fast.The game also has controller support.  It's passable, too, but not customizable in any way that I would like.  I recommend playing with a keyboard and mouse to get the most out of the game, at least until you know all the icons and abilities by heart, but that may just be a matter of preference.  Mousing over abilities and ship commands with the mouse will show a tool-tip that tells you what the button does.  Using gamepad controls, on the other hand, doesn't provide a tool-tip.TL;DR:  It's a good Space-based RPG that takes older, more complex space simulator games and gives them a more modern/mainstream feel.  It is easy to get into and provides a lot of gameplay flexibility.  I have only minor gripes.			"

												Does a crap job of explaining mechanics. The voice work and story is rubbish.But the gameplay itself is fairly good. Complex but not unnecessarily convolued like the X series. Chances are if you want a space game, you'll get at least a few good hours out of this. It also has modding support which should lead to some great stuff from the community, as always.			"

												The game keeps telling me to use things on the menu that simply don't exist at my level. Lack of ammo for the main weapon, 1990's looking HUD. When you land on a Planet, it's a photo. No attemp to feel like your on a far away civilization. Took 1/2 hour to figure out how to land on the planet w/o blowing up and having to do the ENTIRE mission over. SPOILER ALERT: Space travel is very slow. But for $8 what the heck. Someday I'll have time to get as high as the designers and figure out this frustration fubar.It's just seems to be more frustrating than what it's worth. Wormholes where none are being displayed, supposed upgrades are just terrible downgrades. Losing interest real fast. You're told to ""Follow"" a ship, yet the ""Follow button in the HuD is grey'd out; no way to match speed of ship you're following... It'll take hundreds, if not a thousand missions to afford a ship, worthy of making this game fun. Excuse me while I gladly step out of this air-lock.			"

												A game that surpass expectations and delivers countless hours of fun and excitement to any space Sim fan.I came across Starpoint Gemini 2 when the lack of time made me stop playing X3 Terran conflict/AP. I'm a huge fan of X series but the amount of options you have are so vast that consequently increases the complexity of the game and therefore the time you have to invest to progress. Unfortunately with work and all, I just stopped playing those majestic games.SPG2 is not that complex and therefore its perfect if you want most features that a space Sim should offer but in a simple and easy way. You still have it all... Trading, Mining, Piracy, Boarding and countless more things to do, just way more accessible.Recommend 100% "

								I see some potential, but it is a bit of a letdown if you're expecting something like Freelancer. The visuals are nice and there are lots of options for cargo and things like that, but the whole place just feels desolate. There is no signs of life anywhere. I mean, you see ships, but they seem like drones. There is zero com chatter or anything resembling conversation. The only one who talks to you is your ship. You never see any people when docked on space stations or planets. That really brought Freelancer to life, where you could talk to people in the station bars and get tips. This place seems dead by comparison.			"

												Unfortunatly although the game has good reviews i found it mediocre to bad at some points. it has lousy ai (both pathfinding in space the ai keeps on bumping into stations or planets trying to go to the location you have picked) and with the ""fleet"" (2 ships as far as i saw max). You cant actually give them commands so a lot of times they will conflict with what you are trying to do (like board a ship and they will fire destroying it).The story is also mediocre and the VO is down right bad. There are too few side missions at least in the story mode (basically go destroy or capture target, repair or scan anomaly and move cargo/vip from station to station). The game is pretty at times ( i liked the varied ship art) and the music is quite good also at times. Would not recommend it unless really cheap 5 or less or you are bored with nothing else to play.			"

												When I first got this game, I played for about 10 minutes and was disinterested.  I really don't know why, perhaps I was a bit impatient that day.  About a week later I came back and really got pulled in.  I'm 29 hours in now and loving it.  The graphics are good, I'm enjoying the story, and I'm also free-roaming all over.  There are some quirky mechanics such as ship-boarding that make it a bit easier than it should be, but other than that I truely enjoy this game.  I've already purchased Warlords and I am looking forward to how that game progresses as well.  Alot of enjoyment here, just spend the time to learn the mechanics and have fun!  The developer and the community are great so this has been a good experience for me, well worth the purchase price.			"

												A solid effort for those who enjoyed Freelancer.  Early impressions 7/10.  The fact I've been pretty non stop should bump it up more, but there are a few nagging things I'd like to see improved over time.1) When I'm shooting at a target many of the rounds appear to pass through and not impact on the targets shield or ship body.  I'm still doing damage, but that sense of kinetic/energy contact would help the immersion.2) AI tactics are in the early game underwhelming.  I'd like to see enemies do more drastic evasive manouevers to look like they're concerned about you as a threat a bit,			"

												Short Version: If you like space tactical combat, exploration, a bit of trading and if you're not just looking for another stupid space dogfighting simulator, this might just be the game for you. At a decent price and with DLC at a very low price, this game is totally worth a shot. It's not without it's flaws though. The devs, apparently, take player input seriously and are constantly looking for ways to further improve the game, which is rare nowadays.The long version:The Good:- You actually feel like you're in command of your ship. You're flying tripulated ships with several guns and missiles to fire on your enemies and sometimes even fighters and bombers to assist you! This is not another stupid ""dogfighting style camera view"". It's more tactical and I love the devs for making that choice.- Combat is very interesting and you can decide how you want your engine/shields/weapons focus in the middle of the fight.- Graphics are very good and the design is ""colorful"".- You actually feel like you're evolving as you advance in the game and have access to new ships. There are many options to suit your playstyle.- You can fly Capital ships (dreadnoughts and carriers) and they're not useless sitting ducks like they're in EVE online. In Starpoint Gemini 2, you can actually destroy smaller ships in the blink of an eye flying one of those, as it's supposed to be when you're flying a freaking Battlestar with fighters and tons of guns at your disposal.- Devs are constantly looking from feedback from the playerbase and they're very active on forums, taking players advices and questions and participating on the debates in a polite and helpful manner.- You can send your troops to board enemy ships and try to steal them in a very interesting and original mechanic. Nothing like trying different strategies and escaping with a nick of health from a battle after taking your former enemy's ship with you in tow back to a station.- Capital ships!- DLC at a very low price that offered some new content.- Did I mention Capital ships?!The Bad:- Several things are not clear on the tooltips and there are no manuals inside the game. There is no ""ship encyclopedia"" as you'd expect on a title like this.- The difference between weapon types, bombers, fighters and interceptors is not clear.- There are not too many weapon types in the game. It seems like it lacks some variety.- There is no clear DPS indication. There's an ""average"" indicator on weapons, but you have to calculate the firing rate manually to figure that out, apparently, so it's hard, at a glance, to know which weapon to use as an upgrade.- The management of your shields could improve and be something more like Star Trek Online, where you have to define what side gets the bonuses.- The way ""Fire at will"" works should be improved on. You could mark targets (as you do with fighters) and your tripulation would shoot them, instead of firing on everything and everyone around randomly as it is right now.The Ugly:- A few bugs still annoy me, such as not being able to launch the game if I have Teamviewer service running on the background or not being able to run the game in window mode simulating full screen. If I alt tab while in fullscreen, the game will switch to a window mode, and I have to close and reopen the game to load the fullscreen again. Another bug happens when you take a mission and you're unable to complete that, such as the missions that tell you to patrol and when you get to the place you're supposed to go, nothing happens.- Voice acting is TERRIBLE.- Missions get repetitive quickly, so you'll be unwilling to play after the grind for the big ships is over.- Strongest ship unlocks at level 40, so nothing to look forward to after that level.- Story is poor.

												I can not believe how much fun I am having with SPG2.   I have played the X games and enjoyed them, however, I always found them obtuse and very difficult to learn.  SPG2 is simple by comparison but this in no way a bad thing.  They have found all the elements I found fun and pulled them out and made an awesome game.   Combat is fun, I feel like I am in control of a mighty star ship, not some egg with guns.   However, if your not careful you can be over run and taken down.  The ballance is great, I have died but never have I said ""but why"" or ""that wasn't fair"" .   There is Traiding in the game but its simple, again not a bad thing.  If I wanted Stock market sim 2015 I'd have gone and bought that.   This is a nice system to make money with that I don't have to spend weeks reserching prices and locations.    Mining and salvage as well, but again, I don't have to spend a week trying to find a station that sells mining or salvage mod for my ship.   Weapons are again Simple.  havinge 300 different items that all do basicly the same thing isn't a plus in my books.  3 weapon types with several items for each class and clear choices which is better.  Ships are again simple with up to 10 systems to worry about.   I find no fun in the need to have 100 different system for a ship.... simple is better.I Now have 35 hours in this game,  one of my top single player game in my libray now.  I find it difficult to find any con's for this game that the DEV's seem to be very involed in.   My only thought is More Ships, but again keep it simple.Awesme game all around.			"

												Didn't expect much and got a masterpiece. I thought this was some 2D tower defense game and I was wrong. This is a brilliant 3D space game with tactical combat, fantastic soundtrack and the devs have a beautiful sense of humor. You are transporting Annoying Guy to the next station, pirates attack you while you have your cargo hold full of adult magazines and things like that. Modding community is very active and there are so many mods here that everyone can find something for themselves. Star Wars, Star Trek, you name it. Highly recommended!			"

												Considering the game is mostly centered around flying around and combat, the controls are absolute garbage. Some agree with this, some don't.

												Since all the other recent reviews were so negative I avoided this until it was 80%-off.If you can get it at that price then I certainly recommend it but that doesn't make liars of the other reviewers - at full price it is too buggy, limited and awkward (when you start) to recommend.Bugs (under Win 10) - rare crashes to desktop after 10+ hours continuous play, not-at-all-rare and repeatable loss of accepted (but not completed) missions on loading a game.Limited - like most space games it's deliver this there, do this there, kill that there.  Get money and experience for a bigger ship so you can do the same missions against bigger enemies.Awkward - the context-menu takes a bit of getting used to and there can be a LOT going on at some points so you need to practice to keep up with everything.  This is especially true when boarding ships in the middle of an ongoing battle, but then capturing three or four ships in a single engagement is unusual and earns mega-credits.  Seriously, play it right and you can buy a ship, use it to capture enemies in a battle and immediately afford the next bigger ship.  Practice does pay off though and after a few hours it all feels pretty straightforward.Bigger, longer battles really bring out the awesome in this game.  It might not be Eve level but it has Elite beaten!  I have seen groups of 4 factions fighting each other (with me generally mixing it in the middle ^^) with reinforcements spawing/arriving for battles of 20-30 or so ships at a time, lasting 20 minutes and leaving more 'derelict's than I cared to name.  That's nice, because you can drift around after the battles and loot all those dead ships for all sorts of goodies.  Naturally,  you have to be in a pretty substantial ship yourself if you're going to survive such an event.Broadly, it starts grindy and confusing, quickly gets interesting and gets better the longer you play.  Until 'been there, done that' sets in (in free roam).			"

Yep, the game is that short and uninspiring that i actually forgot ever ending it and started to play it again. And during these few minutes of finishing this game for the second time i kept asking myself: When does this get interesting? Why is the voice acting so horrible? Why is every mission the same?So i backed a game that didn't live up to its promise of being worth my memories, it can happen. They dare to sell DLC that only adds a few ships for a game thats been finished 2 times in less than 35 hours? *sigh*			"

And that they made the game highly moddable and with Workshop support. Yes I deeply respect that and I wholeheartedly recommend this game. Even if you leave it after the campaign, you will still have more than 20 hours in it which alone makes it worth its price.Their newest game, Warlords is still in alpha but I can see how bigger and better it might become until release.

												This game takes a bit to get used to. Also theres not too many guides to tell you the smaller information. Like if selling or buying the colors change. (Green good -red bad) between selling and buying.  So if your buying an item that is green its a better deal and if your selling an item  that is green its a profit.  Also they don't address the fact that after you take over a ship through boarding you need to grapple with the ship to take it back to a base to sell.  I left 1 ship out in space on accident that way.  Also there is a huge curve when it comes to getting new ships.  The first zone only carries 3 ships so your forced to go to different spaces and bases to find the one thats right for you. 9/10 gameplay (Its fun to play in space thats open ended)6/10 support (even manual doesn't answer all the questions)7/10 controls (especially in fights its hard to steer unless you stay still by cuttng all engines.)6/10 Missions ( The missions are almost all the same)8/10  Graphics (The graphics are good quality)9/10 Customization (Would be 10 but they really don't explain why certain weapons don't go on ship)Overall I give this game a solid 8/10.

												Since it has drawn so much attention, i have played it recently to see what was new offline ( internet issues). For some reason it didnt show how much i played recently and my total is incorrect because i got the spacebuttplug ( tsar) and restarted a few times, played some of the story. so since you all are reading it, let me elaborate further, What i noticed that has changed, Gravity field of wormholes, wormholes are now working, some balancing stuff, same ship enemies dont go down as fast and use their abilities. Gameplay: The central game mechanic is the combat and trade system which are very tight, trade is simple but at times exploitable thanks to licenses and some close stations that are close by, no big deal though you can only get a few millions at most each run. Camera views, weapon systems etc were good but for the love of all that is space worthy why not include a database for weapons and enhancements like you did with trading? This might seem minor to you but it is infuritating to go to wiki ( which also turns the game to windowed so i have to restart) while same thing exists for trade. Gameplay is very solid which is why it got my hopes up. Those are pros mostly, cons would be mostly with presentation. Story: I must say i mainly played freeroam but when i did try story mode. Something about main character put me off. It might have been choosen one wibe i got from the start (son of an admiral and all that) not to mention his accent was strange. The voice acting was done by professionals this time i see but the ghost from starcraft 2 telling me where to go felt funny, love his accent and voice. Those are fine, what kind of broke it with me was that missions were presented through text that was in a box and UI designers would know, the things in small boxes should be small because for some reason we are not inclined to read all that. Nice flavor text on bouties though. 2 major problems with freeroam story, repetitive missions ( transport X to Y, or go here kill all that moves, very little flavor to it but if the surrounding fluff is good, that is all you need, world of warcraft did it. lots of games had repetitive missions that did not feel repetitive, Why? Answer in presentation )reputation that do not even feel like you are progressing, easier to read reputation bar and actually meaningful reputation would be nice.  I will explain the biggest problem that is connected to this in presentation. By meaningful some contact from faction representatives contacting you for special missions and thanking you for your help, you can go nuts from there. As it stands now. the only faction i know is trinity coz they have a weird space station. Presentation: Here is the place where i loved it and hated at the same time. Graphics are some of the best i have seen, sounds are great ( computer voice being modable is good too), ship designs are hit and miss but even the ones that are bad have something good about them such as tsar the spacebuttplug, it is pretty funny how it looks but is still intimidating. Tutorial is a bit annoying but the game is complex so its fine, takes practice but not as bad as many other games ( elite dangerous comes to mind, which i quit because 4D parallel parking in a flying box is not my fun)  The problem is, the real problem is despite all those great gameplay, the space is made lifeless, it would have been so easy just to add some flavor fluff like in rebel galaxy, visit a bar, with people, get some place specific music and visuals. Officers are nothing but stat sticks. In fact let me explain the crux of the problem by drawing comparison from world of warcraft and harry protter: In harry potter, wands are used for spell casting but are such a big deal and visible in the story that you know what they are and they make the universe feel complete. In WoW: They are stat sticks, something you forget you had and just use for stats exactly like officers here, wasted potential.That is why it is so painful to engage in all that space combat again and again, the space feel lifeless, like you are the only living thing in the galaxy. I understand your main thing was the gameplay and combat, i get it but you need to support it with other things. This could have been mount and blade in space easily. Why did mount and blade succeeded? Because outside of its outstanding combat ( just like this game), it had decent world building, there were lords who acted based on whats going on in the world, lords and ladies who talked, npc's who you would see face to face, so what if they had literally 2 lines of dialogue, it was still an improvement over a text box, It is even more painful when you see these gorgeous graphics but all this dead space. The only reason i considered rebel galaxy superior because it had this world building, world still felt shallow but it felt like a world, not a combat simulator. Remember why No Man's Sky failed? Trillions of planets that all felt same and lifeless? Here it is the same thing but here is is painful because it can be fixed so easily. As a side note: combat is meh compared to other RPG games, in space simulator genre, its pretty good ( but can you make the boarding a bit more interactive? Its a space sim not pokemon) I hope this wall of text explains your worries, again i played before and after writing this review  ( after since the reactions) I think it could be great but you need to work on the world building, it is simply inexcusable with such talent you guys got.

Early Access Review
								Finally a game that has the potential to be even better than Freelancer - and that says something.Took me about 2-3 hours to get familiar with everything and to be able to play the game properly, even after playing years with space sims and space, so allow yourself a bit of time when first playing. Still in beta at the time of writing, so if something not works as it supposed to, for example crashes, or missions cannot be completed, strange enemy behaviour, do not get annoyed, the devs are constant fixing bugs and writing the game, developing. It is in a playable state already; you get a fairly powerful ship at the start, you can fly around, explore, get missions like repairing space bases, destroying pirates and playing taxi between distant bases. There is a good(ish) tutorial on the start to which you can go back any time, so you are not left alone to find out what is where. My biggest problem was having the ship not powerful enough, not fast enough and not having strong enough shileds until I found out about the quick and very handy power distribution feat - this is in the tutorial, but the information was so overwhelming that my attention slipped by the end and learned as I went along with the missions. I think (hope) there will be a smoother tutorial in the final version, perhaps like the one we get in Eve.  Everything I have seen in the game so far makes me think it was a good buy and worth every penny. I'm looking forward to see the final version and what other goodies will the devs come up. Recommendation: BUY IT !!!!			"

												The boredom, oh the boredom. I am not one who requires a game to be fast paced, I do not require anything to be overly shiney. Heck, I play Football Manager non-stop and to most that game is tear jerkingly boring. But alas! I have found a game that really does not grab me at all.I get it, many say after more hours you will get into it, and then many say after many hours it becomes repetitive. I am not going to wait around to find out. A game should grab you at least a little within the first few hours.Maybe I just don't like space games not based around Star Wars?			"

												I like this game, I really do but this desperatly needs an Ai to assign hired crew to captured ships to mine, patrol  follow you etc. Thats the only thing really affecting a nice game. A few bugs also hang in the game that prevents more than one boarding party, hanging battles etc. Needs a bit more work to make it shine.			"

												So here we go. First of all, I found this because of it's Star Wars mod. As a huge SW fan, the option to fly Star Destroyer and wreak havoc across the galaxy was too tempting to resist. That said, I have to say that this game shines everywhere. It's just that good.PROS:+ Ship design+ Mods (Workshop)+ Music+ Combat+ Funny moments+ Developer support+ Community+ Free content updatesCONS:- Size (it's not really a game problem, but m Internet availability in Ethiopia)- Average voice-oversI would buy this over and over again. Do not hesitate. And if you catch it on a discount, it's definately worth your time.			"

Early Access Review
								I must say that i'm very impressed! I had low expectations about this game, but after seeing some video playthroughs and reading some reviews, I gave it a chance. And, I'm glad I did! This game really reminds me of the classic and much-loved space sim, FREELANCER.The only bad thing I notice until now is the lag that happens time to time when I switch from normal game view to the map chart or game options screen. My rig is not very powerfull (I3, 4 GB of RAM, HD 7770), but I can play all my game library without lag, with good performance. But since the game is still an ALPHA version, I'M sure the developers will fine-tune it to be more compatible with older systems.If you like spce sims, trading in space and flying beautifully detailed ships, this game is for you.

												I kind of hoped this game would be an open world sandbox RPG like Mount and Blade but in space, however I was disappointed. It's suprisingly very shallow, overpriced, falls short in many aspects, missions are dull and repetitive, the game feels too grindy and the world is fairly lifeless despite being beautiful. With more depth the game could have been monumental.It is certainly not a terrible game and it has some merits, but it did disappoint me. If I could give it a neutral or maybe rating I would as I don't think it deserves a thumbs down, hence my recommendation.			"

												I rarely write reviews so for me to post this you know it has to be bad. I got this at 80% off for like 8 bucks and I still think I was ripped off. Lets start:First you may see 15 hours played but that's really less than half that. Between all the random crashes and not being able to save... Oh yeah You can only save at a space dock or planet. Problem is they are so spread out and you travel so slowly(no hyperdrive mode just full impulse) you have to spend 20 minutes getting back to a save spot just so you can save your mission before it maybe crashes again. Forget trying to accomplish multipule objectives or missions in a row before a crash thats not possible. Before you ask its not my rig. They have bugs and issues all around, just do research. For such a new game to have this many issues is jarring. Speaking of bugs my second complaint: Lack of proper controller support. This nearly killed the experience for me. Sure you can theroretically use a controller but dont expect the game UI or even the menus to give a flying #$%. It says you can use a mouse and keybord with the controller but you cant, its locked at one or the other. Then all the games UI and in game menues and tutorials dont reconize the controller so good luck trying to figure out what to do. Also forget trying to use the controller to even land as there inane system wont reconize the contextual presses.  Even in 2014 this is inexcuseable, but they had multipule patches and its still terribleThat brings me to my final points, one leads into the other. This game was released in 2014 and in my opinion it was rushed for early access and beta's and all that nonsense. They made constant updates but largely all the bugs remain. Its like great you added a few things here and there but would you please fix the bugs? Nope. They made their money on this game so now they've stopped updating it compleletly to focus on Starpoint Gemini Warlords. Excuse me you release a buggy game, dont fix it, and then move on to a new one? What are you an EA wannabe? Which leads me to my last point, because of their constant pointless updates, not a single mod works. That was the last straw. I can deal with forced to use a mouse and keyboard, I was going to give the crashes a pass for the moment to see if it got better, but the *Total*  lack of mod support for only a 2,3 yo game is straight up insane and nonsense. If you know your game is moddable, you include a freakin mod manager, why would you release updates that ruin mods? And of course nobody wants to keep trying to make the mods work everytime they update. Sure theyve finally stopped but that still leaves every mod incompatable. I know what your going to say ""Dont buy games for mods"" Well honestly I do, some games I wouldnt play without them and this is one of them. Let me give you an example: The first space station you visit ""Vigo Station"" has most of the ships in the game, but you cant access the shipyard. Instead you can maybe find some research station way out in the void that maybe has a ship for a million credits thats slightly better than your starting ship. The only way to access the station is to increase your repuation but you only get 20 rep per mission. You'll out level your ship before you get enough rep to access the space port with the actual useable ships. Which you dont want to do tat because to more you level the stronger enemies become. So a simple mod that unlocks that station, and gives me access to powerful and yet affordable ships would save so much time you'd think.  Well I bought a ship and then the game crashes when I go to a planet. Then I load up the game and the screen  is blue and wiped out when I exit to space.   The developer even told me that mods no longer work for the game so there you go.  I almost feel bad, as I talked to some of the devs, and they tried to assess my problems and seemed nice. However I cant ignore these glaring issues. I only hope this review will save the moeny and time of those interested in this. I hope to get a refund for this but its my duty to warn others. I wish I never bought this game and instead bought Rebel Galaxy.			"

												I first fell in love with spaceship rpg games with Wing Commander Privateer. There was nothing like it at the time and I played hours and hours. Many years later, I found Freelancer and went through the same thing again, but after that nothing I played ever felt so close and so great as Starpoint Gemini 2. It has everything I loved about those games but also so much more, so many details and options and features added so well you can tell how much the developers care and love the game. I finished the storyline and all DLC and of course, I'm playing it again. And for sure won't be the last time.			"

												With all the recent updates, this game is finally playable. I think their biggest issue was releasing this so half finished originally. If you enjoyed old school games like privateer, you'll find some neat similarities, mixed with freelancer style controls. Its got a lot of good structural things going for it, but still feels light on content, which is understandable given that its a small dev team working on it. Never the less those guys managed to put together a fun space sim that doesnt take itself too seriously. If you are looking for a hardcore space sim, this isnt it, but if you are looking to fly around blowing things up and occasionally have an interesting battle, then you are in the right place. I continue coming back to this game to see new updates, and if the dev guys continue to produce content, I think this will flesh out quite nicely, so that the universe doesnt feel so barren with the same 3 mission types everywhere.

												Ever since I played Starpoint Gemini, I have been a big fan. The original game was very easy ot use and not too overly complicated to use. The game was in 3D, but only flew in 2D, so it wasn't hard to get form point ""A"" to point ""B"" with little effort.Starpoint Gemini 2 takes the original game several steps fruther. The concept is sitll the same. You are a space pilot looking to make a name for yourself in the age of space trader. You can either play in campiagn or in freemode.Some of the things that have improved since the first game are as follows...1.) Flight is now in 3D instead of 2D2.) You no longer have to use jump gates to get to your destination3.) A lot more ships to choose from4.) Ships have a lot more upgrades to choose from5.) Some ships offer a ""Flight Deck"" where you can send small fighters out while you battle6.) Not only can you have a flight deck, but you can also choose which kind of fighters you want7.) This time, you can also land on planets as well as star bases8.) Combat is lot more ""tactical"" than before9.) You can now make friends and enemies, this determines if you are able to land on stations or planets10.) There are now factions, each with their own likes and dislikes about you and other factions11.) More items to buy and trade12.) Major improvementts on comba, flight, and trading system13.) There is now a fully viewable starchart you can use to determine where you are versus where you goOverall a much more enjoyable game with added features that allow a lot mroe to do as well as a lot more offer. The added bonus of flight decks is also very helpful for when you need that added help durig combat. If you are into the Space Trader system that has true 3D concept of space flight, this is a good game to get. If you loved Starpoint Gemini, you will love this second part. The added benefit of landing on planets is a major bonus from the original game.			"

												I don't often write reviews, but when I do, it's for a product I love. Starpoint Gemini is probably one of the most fun space games I've played. It feels reminiscent of the X series in a much-welcomed third person perspective(Though you have the option of using a mounted cam perspective instead if you prefer), with the noticeable lack of any empire-building elements to speak of; likewise controlling a fleet is very limited by comparison, and as far as I'm aware you have to be pretty far into the game to even start a fleet.The game, much like X, has a campaign option(Which I haven't played and therefore cannot comment on) and a sandbox mode. In the sandbox mode, you pick a starting ship and get thrown out into the universe with the usual obnoxious tutorial screens, and then it's pretty much straight into the action. Your prime objective for most of if not the entirety of the game will be to make more money, which you have several options for obtaining, such as mining, hunting criminals, trading goods, or pirating goods. It's all quite fun, but the payouts are generally small in comparison to the price of ships and equipment upgrades, meaning you're definitely going to have to spend several hours chauffeuring sales reps and diplomats through hostile territory and mining asteroids by the hundreds to ever afford that ship upgrade, but this is balanced out by the fact that the starting ships are pretty powerful generally speaking, and should last you as long as you'll use them... Though that doesn't mean that the money grind is any less monotonous.I'm not saying it isn't fun. It's just not as rewarding as it could've been. You grind money for the sake of getting a bigger ship, for the sake of grinding more money more easily, for the sake of getting a bigger ship. Perhaps the campaign provides more variety, but the sandbox is in desperate need of some more money-sinks.Graphically, the game is a joy to look at, though the fact that I rarely dabble into anything this modern could be skewing my opinion here a little. The art style is reminiscent of a cartoon or an anime, and colours are very vibrant, making literally everything stand out dramatically. The only thing worth complaining about in terms of graphics is the little debris particles that fly past your ship during movement, as they're practically the size of my tiny gunship's cockpit, but thankfully there's already a mod to remove them.All in all... It's definitely not a bad game. There are better games out there for the price, but I'd still recommend picking this up if you have money to blow, especially if you're a fan of space games. And if it's on sale right now, slap yourself for even giving it a second thought and then buy it. Just a forewarning however, it will definitely annihilate your social life.			"

												If you liked Freelancer, you will love this. Though, so far, the story hasn't been as engaging as Freelancers but there is a freeroam mode that basically cuts that aspect out of it and just throws into this really well designed and nice looking universe, for you to do in as you please.The combat is awesome, the UI is nicely layed out and easy to understand and the game isnt overly complex for the sake of being complex (I'm looking at you X series). The soundtrack is pretty cool too.Its quite fun and addictive for now, but I can see it becoming quite repetitive. I'm sure later on in the game things become a bit more interesting with bigger ships and fleet battles, but the early game requires a lot of grind it seems.I recommend buying this on sale, as it is at the time of writing this review. I can't say, yet anyway, if its worth the full asking price. Though I am having a lot of fun with it at the moment.  "

												I'm a fan of space games. The problem with them has been for years that there's no depth to trading or interesting story to delve into. Quests in this one are all either mail carrier types or combat based. The fighting is fairly uninteresting as well.On the plus side, the graphics are very good and I loved the scenery. The game does have a very large area to explore if that is yoru thing, but as I mentioned above, it gets very monotonous quickly due to lack of depth.The other big flaw is that the only real way in this game to make money is by capturing ships. You can trade or just do missions, but it would take an awful grind to get enough money to change ships which seems like a balance flaw to me.Even on sale, I'm going to actually suggest you skip this one. No, there doesn't seem to be much better out there, but I would say you are better off never playing than to waste time on such a shallow game.			"

												Purchased on recommendation from a friend and loved it.Didn't have any of the technical issues that others have posted, and the comment about missions outleveling yourself is silly because each mission has a recommended level.  Not at that level? Do some sidequests or freelancing to level up - just like any open world game!The storyline is interesting but not essential, although I would recommend playing through at least a few hours of the story before jumping into a purely-freelance game because the early quests train you quite well.

												This game was exactly what I had hoped; a mix of EVE online (minus the spreadsheets) and more action orientated space games like Freespace.I played through the storyline which served it's purpose of driving things forward but beyond that is rather forgettable. It also featured some of the worst voice acting / writing I have heard in a long time. Thankfully the sandbox of different mission types, trading and exploring more than makes up for it. One of the more enjoyable scenarios is ship capture where you have to whittle the targets shields and hull down to the limit and then board the ship with your troopers with the aim to capture it. This has big pay off's and lets you bank huge sums of money to buy new ships and gear.The ships are the main stay of SG2, they are nicely varied and do not fall into the EVE trap where every ship has to have its trade off's, in SG2, a Dreadnought can kick serious♥♥♥♥♥against all sized ships as you would expect and is a blast to play with.This game is a solid 8/10 and had me hooked all the way up until I had the best Dreadnought and Carrier available and could just mop up. Definitely looking forward to SG3 with hopefully some more budget thrown at it to get some writers / voice actors in to bring the lore to life.			"

												I am really enjoying Starpoint Gemini 2!  Having never played the original, I was a little nervous about buying the sequel, but that isn't a problem at all!  Free roam mode gives you a blank canvas and you can do pretty much whatever you want.  The option is also available during the campaign, but I always feel compelled to stick with the story rather than go off and do my own thing for a little while.  Due to this, I have not spent much time at all on the campaign.  Doing random missions, trading, capturing enemy ships, and exploring have all distracted me from that.  However, the five minutes or so I have spent on the campaign were not all that impressive (shoddy voice acting, uninteresting writing). So, do I recommend this game?  Absolutely, just not for the story.  Get this game if you want to get lost in a space sim for hours, not for some kind of an epic drama.			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ offspring of the X series and freelancer. From X, it got a lot of different gameplay options, a rich, large world, customization... And from freelancer it got the fast paced gameplay, the great combats, a little arcadey feeling that doesn't interfere with the simulation aspect...A truly great game.			"

												Trader, Warrior, Pirate, Explorer, Bounty Hunter, Miner, Smuggler - a few of the things you can be in the Gemini Sector.  This game puts you in the boots of a newbie starship captain in one of the most volitile areas of human colonization, and it's your choice as to what you will do with your newfound freedom.  Will you avenge your father and find out why he was killed in the storyline?  Will you go off and discard your past in the free-roam sandbox mode?  The choice is yours.You start out with a very basic gunship, but the game doesn't limit you to one ship like some others (Darkstar One, X-Rebirth), but instead gives you the option to upgrade and upgun in one of several ship classes.  Do you like the thought of zipping around in a fast, maneuverable stealth corvette?  You've got several to choose from.  Maybe you'd prefer to roll into a hostile area in one of the mighty dreadnaughts or carriers and outgun everything in the zone (except perhaps another dreadnaught or carrier)?  You can do that, too.  Or you'd like to be a trader, working your way from your starter ship to a freighter, and then a freightliner, ferrying cargo, buying cheap and selling high.  Again, your choice, but remember to pack guns to keep the pirates off your back, as they have the same choice in ships as you do!  You'll do all of this in a *very* good-looking setting that has NPC ships doing their own thing according to their own agendas.  My personal favorite example of this was the time I was attacked by a group of pirates.  I was in a destroyer, which is fairly middle-of-the-pack in speed-to-guns/armor, and flying with a group of trader ships.  The pirates jumped us, I engaged...and the traders *bolted!*  Left me there and ran, as they weren't going to stick around and slug it out with pirates that outgunned them (being businessmen in freighters rather than naval officers in warships, it seemed their AI told them to GTFO).  Just as I was swearing to hunt them down (if I survived this and didn't have to reload halfway across the map), security forces from the nearby station arrived with battleships and cruisers and what was a brutal last stand became a lopsided pirate turkey shoot.  Brilliant!Starpoint Gemini does a lot of things right, and the devs have shown a lot of interest and support in the community.  There were a few bugs on first release, but continual support has polished this into a real gem most space-sim fans will enjoy greatly.  9/10			"

												A very good game. Don't expect it to last longer than 2 weeks though. You can do a lot of things like: 1. Upgrading your ship. 2. Commanding a carrier type ship with 4 turret slots and 4 missile slots. 3. You can board another ship. 4. Station defense / Station assault type of missions. 5. Launch fighters/interceptors/bombers from your ships.The thing is that it's a very short game with a ton of good gameplay that'll keep you hooked. Unfortunately, you find yourself doing repetitive things (like boarding, mining, etc.). You'll eventually find yourself with more money than you can count and you've basically done everything there is to do in the game. Compared to other gaming simulators, this one is a junior. Great to get back into space sims, but not your ""goto"" space sim. For your ""goto"" space sim, I would actually recommend the following games: 1. Elite Dangerous (Once it's released. It might already be I don't know). 2. Star Citizen (This game promises a lot and has a lot of potential. Wait for it to be released)3. X: Rebirth 3.0 (I know some of you space sims fans HATE this game, but in reality, this game had a very shaky start with bugs that would render the game useless, but in version 3.0, almost all of these bugs have been fleshed out, there's a ton of new features, and it's a GRAND game). I've been playing X: Rebirth 3.0 for a month now and I have yet to do everything it offers. It's beautiful!			"

												It was fun, and a lot to take in. Easy to learn, hard to master. It would be nice if the game was made with classes less restrictive. More ships to choose from, or something. Seems very cookie cutter for stores. Do love the anomalys. Weapon prices are way to high. Can't experiment without hours of grinding. Right off the bat though, the cost system needs to be re-balenced. otherwise fun. As a gameDev myself, ask yourself, ""Am I making the player grind just to extend gameplay hours? Is there a better way to get the same affect?""			"

Early Access Review
								*WOW*Space sims have almost disappeared as a genre over the last 15 years or so, but this is the most promising one I've play since X-3.  Having been disappointed by the original Starpoint Gemini, this mere Alpha of Starpoint Gemini 2 really blew me away.  The dev comment ""hugely improved sequel"" is very much an understatement.  I barely got my feet wet, but this game is literally a decade ahead of its amateurish predecessor.Forget all the wrongs of the original Starpoint Gemini (or just forget that game entirely), SG2 fixes all the terrible compromises it made:1. No longer locked a 2-D plane, you have full six degrees of freedom.  As the developer blurb says ""everything now is in 3D!""  *shock, horror* 2. No wierd incremental steering. (I guess you have to play the original to understand this one.)  As I said earlier, full six degrees of freedom.  Pitch, yaw, and roll to your heart's delight.  There's even a toggle to steer with you mouse for more precision dogfighting.3. No amateur voice actors reading non-native English scripts.  Not a lot of voice acting in the alpha, but what it did have was professionally polished.4. No hideous 2002-era low poly character renders.  Hand-drawn 2D portraits FTW!In general, the production values are up to what you'd expect from a modern game.  Those screeenshots don't lie, it really does look that good in-game.  The soundtrack and sound design is also very well done.  The UI is beautiful, handles well, and very user friendly.It's still alpha, so there some key content missing (mainly the campaign, and the the trade system is very under-developed), but so far this looks like the first promising successor to the Elite/Privateer/Freelancer legacy in years.

Posted: January 3, 2015
												Ok this is my edited review. I'll try and be semi-objective as I have interacted with the dev's, their moderator and the community for some time. But please read on and judge for yourself.Spg2 is a tactical space combat sim. I joined in EA and didn't play it for long due to hardware limitations on my account but liked the idea of a big massive universe where the player doesn't end up being the ""King of the Hill"" but just a small piece of a bigger universe. And Spg2 filled that need for me. This is not the most epic game I've ever played and I didn't expect it to be. But from a small ~10-ish Croation developer team I've been surprised. Not only have these guys made their own engine which shows beatiful graphical capability but they also constantly updated the game for almost a year after release with steady patching and a nice and cheap DLC while being constantly (I can't express how crazy these dev's are when it comes to listen to player feedback and troubleshooting with the community, it's unheard of) active on forums and responding to any bug report they received and fixing it with each new update. This is more than half the reason I'd buy any game they'd ever release.Well about the game; There are more in-depth Space Games out there, more epic stories to be told. But this game doesn't pretend to be any of that. It knows it's limitations as a huge space universe where the player is just a small piece of the puzzle. And it does that extremely well. Imagine being in a single-player MMO ( yeah kind of contradictory) but that's how this game treats you. You're nothing more special than the next dude around. You won't change the Universe all by yourself but you're just a small part in a bigger scheme. I love that sense of relating to your own existence in the world. How many games dares that anymore? In an age where we all feel we're the turning point and center of the Universe this game is a fresh breath teaching us the Universe doesn't resolve around us but we're just here to try to survive and do the best we can. There's no classic story arch to this game. You don't end up feeling like you're the king of the world. You're just a captain in the void trying to fend for him or herself. That's it. And from a philosophical perspective I love that notion. Too many games rub your need for being the ""one and only"". Not this game. This is reality expressed through a game. You're not gonna matter more than others but still need to claim your place in the world. That's beautiful and invigorating and  ... well poetic in some sense. There's a story (campaign) in the game that lends itself to the lore created in Spg1. But former knowledge of that is not required. I am still on the last mission of that storyline but that's not the reason I play Spg2. I don't relate that much to the story as such but enjoy the stories I can make with my own captains more.The game lets you choose between story and freeroam missions at a whim. You can always wander off to do randomly generated missions even when playing the campaign (campaign has a fixed character while freeroam lets you generate your own male/female character) and explore as you see fit. My preference and love for space was to be more of a ""freelancer"" doing randomly generated missions for different factions making friends and enemies along the way depending on my choice of the missions I'd carry out for different factions (help one faction=lose reputation with another faction and vice versa). The game can be a grind for some, other cherish that type of neverending possibilities and in Spg2 the ever-changing possibilities for changing your reputation and the constant randomly generated missions can keep you playing this for hours on end.Some days I just log in, cloak my ship and enjoy the scenery. Other days I just log in to take my temper out on whatever faction I'm currently in bad standing with and make them suffer. For a better description of the game check some videos on Youtube or other reviews. I'm still sold on this thing and the constant updates, a very nice and cheap DLC plus the upcoming FREE DLC makes me wanna recommend this game to everybody. Best and coolest development team I've ever meet and a hell of a positive and friendly community.This game is Steam History for the books. The reason I still get into EA from time to time is because of these guys right here. This is a game made by gamers to gamers. And a hella lot of respect for their interaction, back-and-forth, constant updates and pleasent attitude. If you're in doubt visit the forum. These guys are the future of gaming and a pinnacle of how developers can make gamers trust and cherish them again (yeah plenty of jaded gamers out there seeing bigger companies♥♥♥♥♥♥all over their customers or make highly dubious decisions).Edit: It should be noted that this game twists a few familiar concepts of games and how to progress the best possible way. There's not much ""hand-holding"" here but the forum is pretty active to anyone needing a tip or two on how to get the most of it and learn those ""different"" mechanics/understanding from what other games usually bring. So remember to pitch in with questions if there are any or you don't understand something. The early game in particular can be a bit rough for new players but once they get a hang of it it's really not that hard to understand. over 9000 / 10			"

								The game is about to enter Beta.  As it stands, the game is not only playable, it's stable and fun!Everyone compares the game to Freelancer, which makes a lot of sense.  The input for flying is similiar with mouse and keyboard.  But I like the fact that you captain a capital ship instead of flying a starfighter.  Even smaller ships (like the Destroyer you start out with in the Alpha) have a sense of weight and inertia in their movements.It's a fun game, with a slower, more deliberate pacing than a starfighter game.  There's time to decide your own fate while being pounded on by your opponents.  You end up feeling like the captain of a tall ship at sea.  Which means they must have done something right.There's no campaign yet, but sandbox offers a complete game in and of itself.  It's a career mode, so there is persistent progression, kind of like a campaign might have.  There are tons of ships to buy, and plenty of missions to run.  Or you can run around getting into trouble, and you'll progress just as fast.So far, I haven't needed anything that isn't implemented yet.  In fact, the only things I've actually missed up till now are the jumpdrive (T-drive) and cloak.  Other than that, nothing feels like it's missing.It's well polished at this stage, which makes sense since it's one week from Beta.  The graphics and UI look slick.  Anything that's actually implemented at this stage is almost always bug-free.  The game is very stable, too.  I don't think it's crashed once on me.This is March of 2014, and as it stands the game provides a satisfying experience to play repeatedly.  It is on sale till the 17th, but will have a price hike immediately afterwards as it goes into Beta.  Also, buying it before Beta will give you 1 free copy of the original game.  A fun tide-me-over till this game is complete.			"

								In short I enjoy the game even though it's  in pre-release, it's simply fun to play. It's the game I go to when I'm in between some the more well known or mainstream games. The dev's work hard on the game and it's come a long way since it's beginings. Which makes it a joy  to see all of the new fixes and changes to the game every time I come back to it. There are plenty of well stated reviews  both positive and negative so I won't say much, however as for me was the game and is the game worth the price? If it's worth my time to play it then it's worth money. This game is continuely getting better and improving all he time.			"

								This game caught my eye a few months ago, but at the time it did not really seem like a good buy since everyone was anticipating that Xrebirth would be a super awesome game. Then Xrebirth came out. Luckily i did not jump on the hype wagon (learned my lesson) and when the first videos came out i was stunned by how terrible the whole game was.Yesterday I saw this game on Humble bundle for a few bucks, so I took a look at some videos on YouTube and found that it looked pretty decent. Then I read a few reviews, and found that this could totally be the one game that can fill the X's place.I was not disappointed!!! THIS is how X3 should be done. Everything is done right, even though many features are still missing, like the ability to create fleet, owning stations/player faction, more ways of modifying weapons (custom mods maybe). There is not really much content in the game right now, but the promise of it shines on the horizon like a new day's sun (especially story mode) and i can only hope, that the devs continue to be as awesome as they have been so far in communicating with players and using their feedback to make the game better.

												Possibly one of the best games I have ever played and it isn't even finished! People litterally write to the devs wanting to pay more just to get more content. The devs unlike most care more about their legacy then making money. This is the perfect freelancer 2 which sadly never happened. You can explore, trade, raid ships, and despite forcing your progression, you can't fly ships you level isn't high enough for. The game battles are balanced, and even when you are flying mega ships, you can quickly find your self getting swarmed by many many smaller vessles. There has to be a balance between devs and profits. Unlike Payday 2, this game NEEDS to sell updates to keep it going.			"

												This game is totally worth every penny.  Not only do I have a passion for space/sci-fi genres (as well as a few others) but the fact that they give you both a campaign and free roam mode only games it better since free roam basically lets you do what you wish.  You command a ship and can do whatever you want. Become a pirate and capture other ships and their cargo, become a trader and buy/sell goods between planets and space stations, become a bountry hunter, and much more... It also helps that the Gemini System (map) is pretty damned big with constant activity.  My favorite moments involve coming upon large battles between factions, or simple skirmishes between myself and a couple other ships turn into a huge battle when other nearby factions decide to intervene to either help or harm me. Best part about the space battles is that it feels so real... ships aren't all on the same plane as if on an ocean/sea, they're everywhere at all angles. Another huge point in favor of the game is how amazing the graphics are without reducing performance (that I have noticed and have a pretty good gaming computer) though there is a lag whenever you move to another sector, but that barely effects me.The games doesn't restrict you to certain areas... you can go anywhere and everywhere they do limit you in other ways... depending on you reputation, different sectors will be hostile to you and some sectors have high level enemies in them. One major problem (in my opinion) is the repetative nature of the side missions and very few secondary missions (those give to you by factions depending on your reputation and level.)  Another problem is how long it takes to level up and to get to the higher level so as to be able to fly around in a dreadnought or carrier.Overall, I'd have to give this game 9/10.EDIT: Spelling Errors			"

												This game has a lot of good stuff in it, but also some weak spots.Brief description of the game:You are commanding a capital class ship in either a sandbox experience or a campaign with main missions. You will be flying around undertaking side missions and smaller assignments, upgrading your ship size and firepower.First I will start with good things:+ Proper 3D movement, your ship rotates in all directions+ Huge map full of objects in space, except planets and spacestations space is full of ships of various factions and other space objects like solar power plants, gas collectors, prisons, etc. All of those obejcts come with few designs so the feeling is that most of them are unique. In addition there are clouds of radiotion of electric storms.+ In dept ship command. In addition to guns your ship also has tractor beam (you can pull enemy ships), teleport and marines (you can board enemy ships and pull them to nearest station to sell them), launch bays for fighters, slots for various consumable items (bombs, AI turrest, boosters, repair bots etc)+ Power management. You can direct power between 3 main areas of your ship - engines, weapons and shieldsm by default power if directed 1/3 to each, but you can channel it to one of them in order to receive +100% bonuss to speed, reload, recharge etc, at a cost of -% to others. (PRO TIP: always channel power to engines when you fast travel for +100% boost, since you cannot shoot in this state anyway)+ Large selection of ships and weapons as well as system upgrades to treak your ship as you like it, weapon types are really different (plasma are slow firing, slow flying, hight damage, hight power consumption; laser are 100% acurate, quick firing, low damage; projectile are quick firing, medium damage, fast flying) as for missles you can get some with huge area of effect or long distance small area of effect etc.+ Campaign is not so bad, but lack of options, alternative solutions etc makes it a less fun.Now to negatives:- Bad voice acting- Poor mission reward system - if you wanna by new ships and top weapons you better learn to board enemy ships, do it for few hours at start then start campaign fully equipped. (for example: low level assassination task will give you 4-10k credits, while if you board enemy craft, kill the crew and pull it to space station you will get 80-120k plus you will complete the mission), just doing missions for money is mindless grind and gets boring really fast.- Not involving space combat, this will require some longer explanation.Your ship has turrests, shields and missile weapons in 4 sectors (front, aft, port and starport). You can manually aim turrets, but odds of you hitting a tiny little black dot on black space around you are virtually none, the only thing you can hid manually are destroyed ship husks and space station with are not moving. So in order for your turrest to do anything you set them to auto-fire then they will randomly pick a target and shoot few bursts at it, then change target and go on. In the end during combat you can only select target and manually fire guided missles at it and rotate your ship so that more turrets and fresh shields are facing the enemy. After 10h of playing this is damn boring !!!- Not interesting PTE (power to engines, which is a form of quick flying), as to why it doesnt set power distribution to engines for 100% and has to be done manually for a nice speed boost is a wild guess. And you dont get this fancy visuals of super fast travel like we know from movies, it is just that, your ship flies faster.Conclusion:I recommend this game as it is quite fun to play for space exploration for 10-20h of fun, therefor I advice get it on discount because it is not worth 40€.Then I advice you to learn how to board enemy ships quickly so you can make some good credits and try out weapons and ships.

								This is going to be short and sweet.I like this game. Its a single player 'EVE' without the ridiculous complexity. Obviously its not without issues, personally i have to keep all of the settings low to get a decent frame rate but that might just be my machine and im sure it wont be a problem once optimisation is introduced.My only major gripe is the lack of fuller content. So far the freelance missions are pretty much the same few objectives in varying difficulty but they are quick enough that its not too much of a trouble to level. I think once the proper campaign is introduced it will make the game a lot more enjoyable.			"

								If you enjoy open world exploring and the freedom to do anything you want then this is the game for you. I got this game and to have seen it evolve from something basic into a more complex game with amazing graphics and some spectacular battles the potential is endless. There are a number of good things about this game such as the ability to choose what you want to do from being a pirates to trader, or if you like just fly around and find random things to do. you can even captur enemy ships even bigger ones if you chose to do the upgrades for your troops, you can then either sell these ships off for at times big money or keep them for yourself and use them. The graphics in this game are amazing for a space simulator with astroids thatt look like astroids to ships that look really good. the major con for me at this point is that there isn't any real story yet so no actual campaign to do but the story that they have set up really does have the potential to be great.

								This is striking me very much as what X:Rebirth was supposed/hyped to be. The game is rendered in a beautiful 3d environment and, while fiddly to get used to (it's a little more clunky than the X series of games), once you're used to it, you won't encounter much in the way of problem. Right now, there's not a whole lot to do other than explore the universe but then, what did you expect? It's a pre-release game!I decided to support LGM because, quite honestly, I didn't with SPG 1 and, in hindsight, I wish I had because it's a company that hasn't forgotten the golden rule in the gaming industry;                                                      ""Listen to what your fans want, then make it for them.""So many authors make the game THEY want and then wonder why the game bombs. In my own experience, Mass Effect 3 was that game but I'm sure most of the readers have at least one recent title they can apply that to. LGM listens, they adapt and incorporate into the game and they're not shy about it, either.So, if you're after a non-mmo space simulator (Elite springs to mind), this is definately for you. Hell, for less than £20, you're not going to do much better at the moment. Get it while it's hot because it promises to be an amazing experience. Graphically and audiably it's breath taking by anyones standards..Now, where did I put those secret pictures of Dr. Ridley.......			"

Early Access Review
								even for its beta state, game is very promising. i expect it to become a new modern X3 for space sim/shooter/rts fans.game gets updated very frequently, i only think that s because due to positive outcome product of sale amount. i mean steam playerbase support should be good enough to make the devs work hard like this.i want to point some unique points about this game.-enhancement system for ship parts, not only you can change your offensive,defensive,special outputs but you can also further tweak the bonuses with part enhancement, offers you very high amount of combinations.- high amount of factions, each faction's missions gets randomly generated depending on your current faction standings.thats nice. that means your actions have consquences.-you can actively own a fleet, and make them support you in battles or transport/hauling/smuggling.-crew salaries really a good money sink, something to think about.-game supports modding. enuf said. ^^now a bit of negatives :- currently since game is beta, the main storyline is not out yet and freelance game mode(sandbox) offers  a bit repeatitive missions.- traveling might take some time, there s no time acceleration/deacceleration- using map, pauses your game. you cant watch your ship moves while on starchart. that makes creating waypoints make game stop and cost you time.- current number of pilot classes only 3 and each has 4 different active abilities, these 4 abilities each has 5 sub categories changing characteristics of active skills, this s a bit few, could have been more.-after accepting each mission, you have to find objective area/station etc manually via starchart. you gotta click each marker and see which one lets you create waypoint/jump etc.- accepted and offered quests have same color markers on starchart. again no visual clue for finding your active missions' waypoint.- there s a quest log but not really helpful , doesnt fully work atm. therefore if you serious about completing your missions, you gotta take and complete 1 by 1. unlike other rpgs you cannot hoard multiple missions and do it with a spree.not at the moment. Doesnt apply to people with super memory- you cannot purchase spacestations or other type of stationary npc controlled objects. not yet.TLDR, summary : the game runs smooth and not many bugs for its state, gameplay wise there re many things to add. lack of variety atm might be boring but combat is fun and makes up for it. im pretty sure as it develops, many new features gonna be added and this game has potential to beat X3 in future in open beta. only if devs keep the game updated just like now.

												This game looks beautiful, even on the lowest graphics settings. The music is wonderful and sound effects are great. Voice acting is... well, pretty terrible in all honesty, but I'm really impressed that a pretty small indie developer managed to get as much voice acting in this game in the first place! That tends to be an enormous expense in any game, and it's still better than the voice acting in Just Cause 2 or Strike Suit Zero.However, even with two years of steady work, the game still suffers of performance issues and frequent crashes. I can accept a lot of problems but I really hate having to restart the game so many times in one evening. Last I heard, the devs are still actively working on the game - I hope they'll find these last crash and lag sources and fix them someday soon, because until then I won't be able to play this thing more than maybe half a hour a day. If the crashes are finally fixed, I'll be more than happy to recommend this game.			"

												I wish there was a neutral button, or I could give a 10 star review. I would give this game a ""5"". In my continued quest to find a game of equal or greater quality to old WIndows game ""Freelancer"", I was hoping I had found it with this one. I was NOT sorely dissapointed, but it's kinda a rather bland game...It's like getting a coffee but no cream and sugar, or a turkey dinner with no mashed potatoes. The core concept is there....just they didn't cook it long enough.Mechanics are good, the idea is great, beautiful graphics and awesome full 3D flying, and I love the slip-stream ""Surfing"" idea, but I just can't get my attention to be held. For my limited playing, I felt the story dragged, I could not afford to be a trader and spent most of my time jacking pirate ships, looting them, dragging them back to a nearby base to sell. (FYI: Your crews DO NOT take over the ship and fly along with you as an escourt - At least from what I experienced during my limited gameplay. It took me about 3 lost ships before I realized you had to tractor the ship back to a station :P )I am hoping either these guys do a MASSIVE update on this game, or maybe they will get it right in the next game they are making. I'm certainly willing to give their next one a chance. However until then, my ""Freelancer"" parody search continues.			"

								It is indeed a great game in the making, but the only think I would love to see that great games such as skyrim didn't do is have a multiplayer option. Goto friends or bring friends and have adventures with each other, a game as good as this is better with a friend! I get there is other games like this one like EVE, but I hate playing with people I don't know very well and backstabbers. A multiplayer option like borderlands 2 that lets your game be ether wide open or closed only for many or few of your closest friends to share the experience with. Thats all I will complain about this game, other than that it something to play. Takes a bit to learn but it's worth it!!			"

I'm sure crashes happen but I have not had a crash to desktop in a long time.  I mostly like exploring and seeing what the game offers and it's fun, landing on planets or fighting hostiles. The artwork for Starpoint Gemini 2 is very good. They have an intro video for the game story that will be added later. Really glad to have bought this game, it's worth the money. Space games have always been on my top 5 when buying. Started out on Wing Commander 3 and never looked back. If you like/love space sims please consider Starpoint Gemini 2.			"

								The developers for SG2 really set the bar into the stratosphere for early access. There are more renowned titles that aren't this polished at release. While they've been busy building this game, we, the players have been exploring the vast systems of SG2 in it's already space worthy assortment of vessels.The graphics are silky and the models imaginative. The game play is smooth and intuituve. And being fully supported by the Steam Workshop allows the players uninhibited creativity. Many have paid twice as much for a ""finished"" product that promised the galaxy but couldn't deliver the moon. SG2 delivers the solar system, the galaxy and the cosmos for half the price.The responsive developer team never let's too much time pass before they're reassuring the community that they're forging ahead to a quality release. Lord Have Mercy! When they add the remaining content and features, this game, if not overlooked should be considered top in it's class for 2014.			"

												I`ve put quite a few hours into this one and whilst there is alot to like, it is ultimatley a very detached and empty experience. I found it hard to care about the games universe and different factions. The battles were just too arcade like and not much fun. Ships close into engagement range quickly and from then its usually a case of putting on auto turret fire and carrying out some random evasive manourvres. There didn`t seem much in the way of strategy or tension.  And reaching higher level ships just seems to up the stats- there just isn`t that satisfying feeling of pwer from owning a battleship or Dreadnought. This could have been so much more.			"

												Very good space game, I'm so pleased this genre is making a comeback!I've not played a huge amount yet, but enough to get the feel for it and I'm really enjoying it so far.In this game you are flyng a large ship with a crew, not a one-man fighter, so it feels more like Freelancer, ST Bridge Commander, or Independence War, but it has it's own feel. The ship handling reflects this and the control scheme works really well. I tried it with a flight stick, but it's not really that kind of game, the mouse controls just feel right for the pace as you seem to spend more time targeting, selecting systems and activating powers and perks, rather than 'hands-on' flying. There is a strong RPG element in terms of building up your character and ship with equipment, skills and perks to develop. There is a lot going on and I'm sure I barely scratced the surface.Technically it's excellent, great graphics and effects, and not a massive system hog either. The soundtrack is very nicely ambient and helps to immerse rather then distracting. There is great community around this game, and the developers are obviously very keen to make improvements so I can see that there is a lot of potential for future enhancements, but the game that is on sale now is a totally complete and functional productMy only criticisms would be that the universe seems a bit impersonal, and the setting poorly explained, being a sequel to a game few have played, and the script a bit weak and generic. The English voice acting is very flat, and it might have been better to stick to text to be honest, but it's farily sparsely used and doesn't spoil the game.Overall, great game, well worth the price which is very reasonable for the amount of content and the mod support and supplied tools mean that it will have plenty of new content  to come.

												If you like open world games, and you like open world games in space, then Starpoint Gemini is absolutely worth picking up.There's some reviews out there that are comparing this to Freelancer, and I'll say so far I definitely get that same vibe. Is it ""as good"" as Freelancer? I'd say it is a little early to tell, but I feel like this is going to be a huge time sink like Freelancer in a good way.Other reviews say this is Eve ""Offline"" and I definitely see where that is coming from, and in a good way. Trading so far does take some thought, there's random pirates that you can mostly evade if you want, and there's local defense forces around that will jump in to help (even if you don't want them too). Right from the start you can start doing whatever it is you feel like doing without feeling too ""new"" for lack of a better term.I started with the Campaign, and I'd say I'm not overwhelmingly enjoying the story, but it's still early so I can't fairly judge it.As far as free roaming, which I've spent more time on, I can tell I'll be spending most of my time doing just that. I managed to capture a ship I was planning to buy when a pirate attacked me, and so the mechanic for that is interesting. I've done some repair missions, bounty hunting, salvage work, and some trading. You can mine both gas and asteroids, but I haven't gotten around to that yet. No idea if there is any exploration to be had other than wandering around.It would appear there will also be a huge variety of ships in the game, as different areas have offered different ships for sale. So far, I've seen perhaps 4 or 5 factions of ships and the faction list is pretty long. Also, these are only the small ships which your skill will correspond to purchase ability. How hard it will be to obtain the bigger ships I cannot say, but given how many credits I have versus what the prices are on them, it does not appear to be a grindfest.The map feels pretty large, and it takes some time to get around each sector. At first, the map did not look all that large fully zoomed out, until I started panning around. Then I realized there was a LOT more and I've barely scratched the surface. 3 hours in, and doing a fair amount of travelling, and I have only made a small dent in the map BEFORE you pan anywhere!Combat takes a little getting used to, but I was also learning the controls, and I'm pretty competent now which was why I tried boarding a ship. The boarding mechanic is more or less getting close enough to grapple the target ship, then send boarding parties aboard to kill their defenders. Larger ships have more troops, so don't expect to successfully board a battleship with a gunship. You can also go into a ""turret mode"" to keep your guns trained on an enemy ship. While you might have some turrets blocked depending on ship design, you might also be able to deliver a nasty broadside!Speaking of those troops, you can replenish those troops at stations, and you can hire officers for your own ship to automate some things and make it more efficient. You can also hire mercenaries to fly alongside you, each with their own ships. So, as long as you can pay the salaries of the officers and mercs you hire, you can have a good leg up on some encounters. This also means traders and miners can have escorts, while the combat pilots can have some wingmen, and the fleet leaders can lead the way if they so choose.Trading is pretty straightforward, with each station having commodities in various states of supply and demand, which change from time to time. You can check what's in your cargohold against the last known prices of stations you've visited to gauge if it's worth making the trip. I should also note smuggling is an option, as different sectors have outlawed one thing or another, and you can ""sneak"" illegal goods if you have the right conditions.Overall, I am really happy to have picked this up, and I definitely look forward to exploring everything this game has to offer.

You can also upgrade your ship with various weapons and boosters you can even hire ships to follow and defend you.The devs are still updating and ironing out any issues which is nice to hear, but i haven't had a problem with it yet.I'm gunna smash this game once i'm done with divinity.8/10 "

I tried it with a flight stick, but it's not really that kind of game, the mouse controls just feel right for the pace as you seem to spend more time targeting, selecting systems and activating powers and perks, rather than 'hands-on' flying. There is a strong RPG element in terms of building up your character and ship with equipment, skills and perks to develop. There is a lot going on and I'm sure I barely scratced the surface.Technically it's excellent, great graphics and effects, and not a massive system hog either. The soundtrack is very nicely ambient and helps to immerse rather then distracting. There is great community around this game, and the developers are obviously very keen to make improvements so I can see that there is a lot of potential for future enhancements, but the game that is on sale now is a totally complete and functional productMy only criticisms would be that the universe seems a bit impersonal, and the setting poorly explained, being a sequel to a game few have played, and the script a bit weak and generic. The English voice acting is very flat, and it might have been better to stick to text to be honest, but it's farily sparsely used and doesn't spoil the game.Overall, great game, well worth the price which is very reasonable for the amount of content and the mod support and supplied tools mean that it will have plenty of new content  to come.

												If you like open world games, and you like open world games in space, then Starpoint Gemini is absolutely worth picking up.There's some reviews out there that are comparing this to Freelancer, and I'll say so far I definitely get that same vibe. Is it ""as good"" as Freelancer? I'd say it is a little early to tell, but I feel like this is going to be a huge time sink like Freelancer in a good way.Other reviews say this is Eve ""Offline"" and I definitely see where that is coming from, and in a good way. Trading so far does take some thought, there's random pirates that you can mostly evade if you want, and there's local defense forces around that will jump in to help (even if you don't want them too). Right from the start you can start doing whatever it is you feel like doing without feeling too ""new"" for lack of a better term.I started with the Campaign, and I'd say I'm not overwhelmingly enjoying the story, but it's still early so I can't fairly judge it.As far as free roaming, which I've spent more time on, I can tell I'll be spending most of my time doing just that. I managed to capture a ship I was planning to buy when a pirate attacked me, and so the mechanic for that is interesting. I've done some repair missions, bounty hunting, salvage work, and some trading. You can mine both gas and asteroids, but I haven't gotten around to that yet. No idea if there is any exploration to be had other than wandering around.It would appear there will also be a huge variety of ships in the game, as different areas have offered different ships for sale. So far, I've seen perhaps 4 or 5 factions of ships and the faction list is pretty long. Also, these are only the small ships which your skill will correspond to purchase ability. How hard it will be to obtain the bigger ships I cannot say, but given how many credits I have versus what the prices are on them, it does not appear to be a grindfest.The map feels pretty large, and it takes some time to get around each sector. At first, the map did not look all that large fully zoomed out, until I started panning around. Then I realized there was a LOT more and I've barely scratched the surface. 3 hours in, and doing a fair amount of travelling, and I have only made a small dent in the map BEFORE you pan anywhere!Combat takes a little getting used to, but I was also learning the controls, and I'm pretty competent now which was why I tried boarding a ship. The boarding mechanic is more or less getting close enough to grapple the target ship, then send boarding parties aboard to kill their defenders. Larger ships have more troops, so don't expect to successfully board a battleship with a gunship. You can also go into a ""turret mode"" to keep your guns trained on an enemy ship. While you might have some turrets blocked depending on ship design, you might also be able to deliver a nasty broadside!Speaking of those troops, you can replenish those troops at stations, and you can hire officers for your own ship to automate some things and make it more efficient. You can also hire mercenaries to fly alongside you, each with their own ships. So, as long as you can pay the salaries of the officers and mercs you hire, you can have a good leg up on some encounters. This also means traders and miners can have escorts, while the combat pilots can have some wingmen, and the fleet leaders can lead the way if they so choose.Trading is pretty straightforward, with each station having commodities in various states of supply and demand, which change from time to time. You can check what's in your cargohold against the last known prices of stations you've visited to gauge if it's worth making the trip. I should also note smuggling is an option, as different sectors have outlawed one thing or another, and you can ""sneak"" illegal goods if you have the right conditions.Overall, I am really happy to have picked this up, and I definitely look forward to exploring everything this game has to offer.

												I love this game. I thought I had a game breaking bug. So I complained about it on the discussion page. A developer messaged me back. He asked me to send him my save file and log. It turned out  to be a mod I had from a couple years ago. I deleted the mod and the game was working fine again!This game is beautiful. It can get a little repeative. But I really enjoy it. It's a really good one for the genre. I recommend it. grab it on sale, and you will really get your money's worth!!			"

												Amusing and pretty game.  I had fun.  Once I got the hang of capturing ships, the difficulty level dropped.  To be fair, I haven't tried tackling any of the veteran bounties, yet.  I understand that those are considerably more difficult since they will actually put up a fight and deploy counter-measures.The reputation system in this game is very simple: you gain +20 reputation for completing tasks for law-abiding factions and -20 reputation for completing missions for pirate factions.  I would expect reputation gain to drop more significantly and gain more slowly as it does in many other space sim games (e.g. Eve, X3, ...).  As it is, if you're low on cash, simply cap a ship and you'll be back in black.Pro:- Pretty- Lots of ships- Large mapCon:- Not a whole lot of variety or depth.- Different ships don't seem different enough (i.e. play style remains largely the same)- Voice acting is terrible; would have been better without.- Overly simplistic reputation system (see above).

												I was looking for a space game and found a great one.  You can free roam or follow the story.  Like most RPGs, there are optional side quests and missions.  I like the fact that there are easy missions and missions so hard, that you can easily die without a strategy, even if your in the mighty TITAN class ships (love mine btw)!  This is a space RPG, if you are looking for a casual space game, you can just fly around, but you will miss out on so much fun.I had an extremely slow start figuring out how to play the game and how to use the controls.  Oddly enough, I only use 3 keys outside of the directional keys.  I had to google how to board ships, how to use my side weapons, ship stats, etc.  That is stuff that I've had to do with other RPGs too.  Does the game have some issues...yes.  There is so much to do in this game, and the only quirk I noticed is the patrol missions don't work.  So, I just skip them, there are plenty others to do.  Almost every issue people have in this game, you can find in others that were herald great games!!! I purchased this game for $8 including both DLC (winter 80% sale).  As much fun as I had and still have, I would have paid more.  I will be purchasing the next Starpoint Gemini Game.			"

								If you're looking for your EVE Online fix, this is the game for you.  Best of all, it's Single-Player (for now, at least.  Not sure if MP is going to be a thing or not).  No pirate players to come rain on your parade.  No constant worry of whether or not you'll be blown to smithereens when you come out of a gate.  Scan anomalies!  Mine asteroids!  Hunt down the bad guys!  You can do it all.  Had there been a demo for this game for me to try out beforehand, I would have easily paid double its asking price for it.  It's most definitely worth it and more.			"

The music is ambiental and realy sets you in the mood for the game.Combat is a bit slow but it's to be expected... and that's coming form a long Ace Combat fan, still trying to find the perfect interceptor/fighter for my play style but I'll find one sooner or later... nevr give out hope.

Product received for free
Short Version: Grand Space Sim that puts you in command of a space ship to fly, shoot, trade, save the universe, blow up stuff, do the laundry, collect files hidden in floating junk, level up, hire recruits, upgrade your ship, and do pretty much anything else your starfaring heart desires.  The game looks nice, plays well (albeit at a slowish pace), has enjoyably 'space-y' ambient music, and offers a ton of different content that may not always 'wow', but will definitely satisfy.Starpoint Gemini 2 reminds me of a giant, sword-wielding turtle.  No, really! Just let me explain...Waaaay-back-when, in those wonderful 8-32 bit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle video games, you could play as one of four characters, each with different strengths and weaknesses: Raphael, who had tiny, short-range, but superfast attacks; Donatello who was really slow but could whack-a-ninja from half a screen away with his staff; Michelangelo who specialized in... I don't know, making pizza with nunchucks? Or something?  And then there was Leonardo, who didn't attack quite as fast as Raphael, and didn't have quite the reach of Donatello, and didn't (pizza?) quite as well as Michelangelo - but hey, he was a very close second-best at *everything* and pretty dang awesome as a result.Sooo... if space games were mutant turtles, then Starpoint Gemini would definitely be Leonardo.  Sure, some dedicated RPGs have better character development in stats and story (and DEFINITELY voice-acting), and some starfighters have more intuitive controls without the need for a gazillion tuturial screens and HUD informational windows, and some trading/exploration games have a more lifelike economy that can fully support your character as a pacifist (read: cowardly) trader... but Starpoint 2 offers ALL those types of gameplay and more, and all done extremely well - just not quite on par with the best. This enormous range of solid, enjoyable space-sim content is the essence of Starpoint Gemini 2.All-in-all, SG2 is a huge Space-Based-RPG/Combat/Trading/Strategy/ShipBuilding/Sandbox-Simulator mashup that may be slightly flawed and a bit slow-moving compared to games that 'specialize', however the astonishingly vast scope of gameplay content is all well-done, nicely polished, and most importantly... fun!   With a large campaign and moddable freeplay mode spanning half a dozen genres, Starship Gemini 2 is second-to-none in being second-to-all - but hey, so was Leonardo, and he became the leader of the Ninja Turtles for a reason!(*SIDENOTE:  Despite evidence to the contrary in this review, Raphael was actually the best turtle.  Of course, comparing Starpoint Gemini 2 to a giant mutant *sai*-wielding turtle would have been utterly nonsensical, so I went with Leonardo.) Received a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.

												6 out of 10 Starpoint Gemini 2 is a space exploration and combat game.  In short, I expected somewhat more.   In the end I just could not finish it as it just dragged on and on. The good: 1. Great platform.  Space, ships, weapons etc. 2. Capturing enemy vessels. The bad: 3. I always seemed to die at the most inopportune times.  Then need to reload and re-traverse the same bits over and over. 4. Storyline is not very exciting.  No animation or something else to give it some life. The ugly: 5. Very repetitive.  The game needed more unique locations and content.			"

												Hi GuysUpdated 15th december.After spending sometime into this game heres my review.Pros1) Great graphics and good music.2) Freedom to roam and also a campaign to play. 3) Tons of ships, items to equip your ship.you can hire troopers to board and take over ships! Hire officers and also mercenaries.4)You have missions available at different places where you can accept or reject to earn money and experiences.5) Mods availble for this game.6) You have traits and specials skills as you level.Cons1) Tutorials wordings are too small!!!2) I find it not very user friendly even though the tutorials are there for you. It seems that I struggle for quite some time to get used to it and also the mission chart map seems nto well constructed. To me its not user friendly.3)Something is missing in this game I am not too sure.I will still recommend this game because of the things you can do in the game. Its the freedom to roam. This game is a hit and miss , If you are not sure I will suggest you get it on Sale or bundle. Its much more worth it.			"

												Graphics are good, action is nice, the gameplay smooth and mostly bug free.  In many ways this game does things exactly right.  So why the thumbs down?Because it does one thing wrong and that one thing is enough to drag the rest down with it: It tries to use MMO logic in a single player game.  Which is to say that the grind is the whole of the content.  Do this mission to get credits to get a bigger ship with bigger guns so that you can do a mission with a bigger enemy to get more credits to get an even bigger ship etc etc ad hoc infinitum.  Once you hit max level and get the best ship there really isn't anything left to do except mindlessly blow things up at random.  It gets old really, really quick.Yes there is a story option but the missions in that story are hardly any different than the randomly generated ones from freeroam.  They just add voiceovers to some rather poorly written dialog.Still, the price is cheap and they game is entirely without it's virtues.  It just doesn't have anything to really hold a person's attention for very long.			"

Great Space Opera game with amazing graphics-> Smuggling, fighting, mining, trading, bounty hunting, capturing ship, escorting convoy or attacking space base. -> Nice ship design.-> When you gain lots of credit, you can build a full fleet.-> You can create your own challenge = Being a pirate for exemple and try to be friend with the evil faction is an interesting challenge and a different gameplayThis is not a a space flying simulation as the game is optimized for mouse and keyboard, giving the game a nice tactical touch. It take a bit of time to get used of all the control but once you get them, you can get into amazing space battle : Surviving the  assault of an ennemy fleet on an allied Space station is just so rewarding.Cons :. Voice acting is not great but after sometime you get use to it.. A bit repetitif after a while/lots of grinding needed to buy better ship. . The auto aim make the game to easy in the end while you get a op battle ship.Anyway got lots of hours of fun with it.PS : Something extra to make the planet more lively would be great imo			"

												so ive never been one for grind games. ive never fully enjoyed the objective of having to do lots of tiny bits to achieve the end goal, but i have to say i thoroughly enjoyed this game. I got the gold pack and have completed both the main story line, soa and of course titans. I find myself actually enjoying the aspect of flying around and stealing ships, taking on fleets and planning my moves. I feel the whole grinding aspect actually pays off when you go from ship to ship and i have to say, personale faves are the baeldor ships. or if you manage to find it the echelon, which is a beast of a ship. overall i love the designs of the ships,  yes the voice acting may be a bit iffy at times but i think it adds to the overall feel of the game, and even though there is a huge grind for ships, the rewards are well worth it. from a novice gamer who never really played these kinds of games i can well and truly say it is money well spent, and i am more than looking forward to warlords.

								Very fun space sim, very much in the ""Freelancer"" vein.  You get a ship, fly from port to port, buy and sell commodities, mine asteroids or take on freelance missions for fun and profit.  Your ship is upgradeable with an assortment of weapons and buffs available at any port with a drydock; there seems to be a pretty decent variety in the different planetary sytems.  Hiring officers (up to 3, at least on my frigate class) will give you additional buffs; each officer has different strengths, and no two are exacly alike in my gameplay so far. You can add to your fleet by capturing enemy ships after boarding them with your troopers, or do it the old fashioned way, and save up your credits.   Kind of reminds me of ""Eve:Online"", without all the annoying other people! ;)			"

												I dont do reviews, but this game is the exception.  Totally caught me by surprise with engaging gameplay and storyline.  If you love space then this is it.  Eve, Star Citizen, and Homeworld fans watch out.  Starpoint Gemini has the potential to beat them all with updates and cool mods.  Finally a great space game!!!!			"

												If, in your gaming memory you remember the classics like ""Freespace"" and ""Privateer"", and loved them, this is the game for you.  The interface is slick, operative and easy to use an understand.  There is a campaign, but my limited time with it just made me hungry for the freeroam mode, as I wanted to be a smuggler or pirate.  What's more the team at LGM is going to keep improving this title in the coming months, and it is likely to become not only a stopgap for ELITE: Dangerous and StarCitizen, but a competitor; and a great one.  I can't recommend this game enough.  You are really in for a treat if you take the time to take the tutorials and just be ready to forge your destiny.			"

												*Gnome Seal of Approval*Don't let the boring tutorial text scare you off if you're new to the genre. It's not as complex of a game as they would have you think. In fact, it's quite easy to learn once you know the basics. I'm new to the genre myself and read comments saying this game is too simple and dumbed down. So if that's true then this game is a good place to start, because I had fun playing the free roam sandbox mode.Lots of stuff to explore. Good controls. Nice visuals. Cool soundtrack.The negative:Earning money is slow until you're strong enough to take on heroes. You'll have a hard time earing enough to buy a new and better ship (which is important). However, once you start killing those heroes for rewards, you will quickly earn more than you need (which in turn feels a little imbalanced).Sandbox mode was a little repetitive. Short framrate drops when the game loads a new area in front of you (which in turn have lead to a crash here and there).If I was to play again, I'd start the story mode instead of the free roam.Cool game!

								Great Space Sim... Developers are always adding new stuff and I can't wait to see where it is going.  EZ flight control, beautiful graphics, and true to self.  I really like the mechanics of the game, much more friendly then X Rebirth yet not to simple to loose interest in.Love to see...- story missions- Missions from NPCs from space (things like, ""engines failed, tow me to station..."" or ""Pirates took my cargo, go get it back for me..."")- crafting- Custom ship building- Named loot drops from destroyed shipsOver all I would say it is a good 20 hours play now but when it is done it will be EPIC "

 Remember that dissapointment called X-Rebirth?   Starpoint Gemini blows X-R from outer space AND it's in Beta!   So you can imagine when this space sim is finished it will leave X-R in the dead of space!  Give Starpoint Gemini 2 a shot now. Or wait till it's done. One way or the other, this game is one of the best out there.   Thanks LGM! Great work and slam the bass in that audio!   "

												To me it's like an arcade X3. Lot earier to get action and jump right into the game, but the trade means nothing in this game and your ""fleet"" is your one ship (and you only can have 1) and a merc you hire. Still fun for a time killer, but I prefer actually doing something that means something to the game like X3 does every second your in.So while there are freighters capable to carrying a good chunk of cargo and yea you do trade, it means nothing. The prices are random so you're selling high and buying low but it doesn't mean anything to the universe around you like X3's chained trade.			"

												Since my life is so busy I cant play games much, I come from the angle of a almost n00b to the space sim, free open world games. I always wanted to see space but since our kind is more content sitting on this planet beating each other with sticks I suspect I wont achieve this dream.... So I bought most of the X series and I loved the idea but got so frustrated with the controlls and other nuancses that I probably spent about 4 hours in the last one I bought which was X3. I spent some time on X2 but due to lack of time I just never got into it.If only there was decent space sim that is not so complex I need to study a 1000 page manual to get into it and this certainly proved to be the one I was looking for. Easy to get in but I suspect fiendishly hard to master.Considering this is a brand new games studio I must give them a big 4 little thumbs up(I only have 4 thumbs). The interface is simple and clean. Objectives are forward and to the point. Graphics are great and I spend my time on the mindless train trip between Gordon and Blacktown with my laptop keeping me nice and warm as I just muddle around in the universe.It is a bit grindy at the start as you try and figure how to get to bigger things but overall a very enjoyable experience if you want something really deep but not obscure.Great effort and I am looking forward to what LGM studios brings out next.

												27-Jul-2016 : Finished main story + extrasEquipment : MSI GT80-2QE NotebookREVIEW :First thing first, this is not arcade space sim combat like Elite Dangerous, this is RPG game with space sim combat. You start with a small ship and you can play it like arcade space sim combat since the RPG elements seems irrelevant at the beginning. But as your rank get higher and you get access to bigger ships, you find yourself constantly outnumbered and outgunned. Tactical combat and RPG elements (properly developed character and ship) becomes essential to win a combat.The game is open world. To be powerful enough to progress through the main quest, you can do faction side quests, freelance quests, mining. trading, bounty hunting, pirating and capturing ships. The graphics and soundtrack is great, the story is mediocre with really bad voice acting. This game is not a high budget A-List game, so there's no fancy 3D cutscenes with motion tracking and real voice actors.  The game also really mod-friendly. You can edit stats and even your savegames using a simple text editor. This mod-friendly approach is more handy that it seems. For example, my favorite Carrier-class ship doesn't come with a cloaking device. Easy, edit the ship stats file using Notepad and add the cloaking device myself. There's also Mod Tools to build your own contents. If you're a Trekkie, make sure you try the Star Trek Ship Mods in the Steam Workshop.The developer also generous enough to give a free DLC titled ""Origins"". This free DLC offers 30 storyline missions of the original Starpoint Gemini, re-envisioned and ported to SPG2 engine. So if you never play the 1st one, you can play it now without extra cost. Basically you get 2 games for the price of one.CONCLUSION :Recommended on full price, a must-have on sale price.			"

												A decent capital ship combat game, but somewhat shallow.Pros:+ A wide variety of ships and equipment+ Combat is a little simplistic but fun nonetheless. Reminds of Rebel Galaxy but offers more control.+ Capturing enemy ships feels satisfying+ Looks good enough. I somehow love the battle hud(blue ring thingie around your ship, appears on some of the screenshots) and miss it in other similar games.Cons:- Probably the worst voice acting in game history. Some voices are really irritiating, especially protagonist's.- Even though all ships are capital ships, you don't feel their scale. For example if you play X3/X:Rebirth, you do feel that your massive capital ship is a massive capital ship. Here all ships are basically the same size and you don't have anything to compare them to.- RPG elements are pretty lame- Story progression is sometimes very confusing. Like you won't have enough crew on your starter ship to capture any other ship (and start earning significant amount of money) or you'll simetimes find that you need 10 more levels to actually pilot a ship you've just earned. Or later in the game I kept getting way more levels than I actually needed.- Limited ship customization options. You can arbitrarily choose any weapons for your ship which's good, but its subsystems are predefined for any given hull and you can just upgrade them slightly via enhancements.- Even though I did rush the game in the end, I have completed it(without DLC stuff) in 32 hours on the hardest difficulty which's a little underwhelming for this kind of games.Grab this game if:You want a little arcadish broadside-style capital ship combat driven by a campaign scenario. Avoid this game if:If you're looking for a very in-depth experience similar to X3/EVE or physically plausible ship controlling similar to Elite. This game has a strong indie feeling to it, don't expect anything of AAA-like scale.My overall rating is 7/10, I did enjoy this game and I'm really looking forward to its successor Starpoing Gemini : Warlords.

												I received a press key during the early stages and have had the pleasure of watching the game take shape into what it is today.  The tutorials could still use a bit more work, though the game is a lot of fun once you get a handle on what you're doing.  It's a bit like Freelancer and other like-games in that you can explore different sections of the galaxy, do missions, mine for resource, buy/trade commodities, and so on.  The middle mouse radial menu, coupled with the starchart, makes interacting  with objects a cakewalk.  I still find combat to be a little tough because I have trouble figuring out and observing the available weapon arcs, though you can set the ship on ""fire at will"" and fly around while the computer does all the shooting.  All in all, worth the asking price.

												The combat is painful.  And tedious.  And just plain painful.Even on a high end machine, it seems like everything lags behind about a quarter second, which means you miss everything and anything.I'm an MMO guy, and even I can't handle the grind necessary to make anything worthwhile in this game.I genuinely regret Steam not having its refund policy in place in time to get my money back here.

												KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK HERE GUYS BECAUSE JUST LIKE THAT I HAVE LOST MOST OF MY ATTENTION WITH SWTOR THIS IS A VERY RICH DEEP GAME HERE The flow is nice & you are not that timed on missions or at least not at the point where I am in the game. I have much experience with games of this nature. However, this right here is just nice. The music, the planets, the gear and ships. You definitely got my attention. I'll be honest that I bought the game & never opened it that much because another game here that will go unmentioned really destroyed it for me with games of this format. I recommend this to all who have been disappointed with sandbox/open-world games lately. You will not be disappointed because looks like they actually listened to the players. Hint: if you like the X3 Trilogy with a little of EVE ONLINE then go with this ONE HERE FOLKS. It's no pay to win or confusing irrevelant aspects such as if you run into a friendly target you get penalized in rank. RIGHT ON! FINALLY! Someone actually thinking!			"

												Althought the campaign game was uninteresting, I put 22 hours into the free roam, cruising around to different planets and engaging in space combat. The singleplayer campaign leaves a lot to desired, as the RPG elements are limited, and it is essentially a ""fly here-destroy"" ""fly there"" destory game. I did not get the impression of a complex game, but merely a simplistic space simulator, with very little depth. Worth it for a bargain, and only if you are interested in space sim games that are not too complex or fascinating. Factions only differ in name and equipment, and the presentation is shallow overall.Overall, this does not feel complex and finished enough to reccommend for a full price, but I would recommend buying for  a bargain.

												Only 4 hours into this game and it is wonderfully stable thus far. If you feel a bit burnt by another recently released space game, give Starpoint Gemini 2 a try - I really think you'll like it. If you are a Star Wars fighter jock you'll have to get used to flying a heavier ship. The UI is both intuitive and beautiful. This feels like a sort of dystopian 29th century Star Trek.Edit: Now 15 hours in and this game just keeps getting better all the time. I took down a ""hero"" a.k.a. a large ship with a threat level of ""Impossible."" The fight took 20 minutes and alternating between targeting the enemy's heavy batteries and subsystems. This ship jumped me and was not part of a mission.  My little ship a small Pegasus class gunship wore this bad boy down and the reward was 4 million credits! I decided to step up to a Corsair class rather than an even more powerful Frigate. This is really a game to be savored and frankly, I am so happy with Starpoint Gemini 2 that I really couldn't care less for Elite: Dangerous especially with today's (18 Novemeber) announcement that Elite: Dangerous will require constant online even in single player.You can play this game as you see fit and don't be fooled into thinking that the explorable area is small because there isn't a whole galaxy to explore. I've only seem a tiny part of this game. Somewhere in the Community Hub of this game someone had posted a complete map of the game and suffice to say it is M A S S I V E.Limit Theory is now the only other space game that I think will force me to divide my time if it turns out to be as good as it looks. CNo Man's Sky is still a long way off and Star Citizen is so bloated that I believe it can't possibly live up to the hype nor the budget which I think equals  the budget for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.Simply put, Starpoint Gemini recaptures the magic of the great space games of the past like Indepence War I and II, the Freespace series, and the legendary Tie Fighter and X-Wing and all from a small studio. If you love space games,  get this. Ignore it at your peril.Great job devs! Keep up the great work.			"

												This game is great if you want a single player RPG and to run around in space.  The free roam is cool but gets old, and the story gives you purpose but it is limited.  This GAME WOULD BE EPIC if it had multiplayer support.  If you could build a fleet with real humans and maybe go raid someone that might be able to apply a little bit of strategy.  The biggest drawback is that it is linear, you want to beat someone get some better guns... or a bigger ship, thats it.  Buy a long range weapon and you can literally just tease the AI until they are dead waiting out of there auto combat range, attacking them and backing off when they chase so they start all over.			"

												4/5I´ve been looking for a game that resembles one of my old favorites, Freelancer so when I found this I got very excited.Sat down, launched the campaign and boy did I smile once I had it all set up and flew through space on my way to my first mission. Gonna try to list some of the pros and cons belowPros+ Nice graphics+ Awesome soundtrack (seriously, I leave the game running when I go to bed)+ Lots of ships+ Select between campaign and Freeroam and choosing the first won´t stop you from doing the roaming freely.+ Many different factions+ Huge map+ Really nice controls once you get the hang of them+ Active devs, seen them post in the steam forums many times+ Many different ways to make money in-game+ Rare drop blueprints+ Achievements+ Many difficulties (only tried normal)Cons- The voice acting in the campaign lacks feeling- Sometimes it´s impossible to target things by clicking on them (think it might be a bug cause if you click on something else and then try again, it works). No real problem though since it´s uncommon and you can always use quickbinds for targeting stuff.- I´ve had a few crashes since I bought it but since the game is being actively patched (and I haven´t crashed for a few days) it might have already been fixed or I feel confident they'll fix it.- Might get a little repetitive after a whileHaving played it quite a lot the past weeks I'd say it's one of my best purchases in a long time and it deffinitly deserves a strong 4!1 - Crap, don't buy2 - Fun for an evening3 - It's an alright game but not my taste4 - Great game5 - One of the best I've ever played			"

												Bought this game not that long ago and i have had a blast. Simple yet hard and fun combat, the focus of the game is on large capital ships instead of fighters something i like very much, it makes you feel like a proper captain. Awesome ships designs and graphics. The game gives you tons of freedom to to what you want to do, you want to be a pirate go ahead, trader sure, miner or a bounty hunter have at it. The game has one of the best and most active dev team i have seen, they activly talk with their gamerbase and activly put in new features and ideas in the game. This game is going to evolve alot and they are planing many more awesome features.

												This game is a TRUE open world space RPG. I really love this game, despite is few shortcomings.Freedom: Full freedom to do whatever you want, wherever you want, whenever you want is why this game is great. You can become a full time miner and collect minerals, you can ferry goods from station to station and trade for money, you can capture enemy ships and DRAG them back to your base to sell. Combat: Perhaps the best part of this game is the combat system. It is really like a 3d dogfight in space ships. Do not expect a true space physics, but the combat system is one of the most fun I have played. You actually fly the ship yourself and shoot the weps yourself. Direct full energy to shields to survive, weps to destroy, or engines to run like hell!RPG: You gain levels as you go. You can kill ships for small XP or do missions for more XP. You can level up each of your 4 special skills, get bonuses to your ""profession"", and buy new ships at higher levels, each with their own special traits.Glitches: I have had about 10 full crashes in 24 hours of playtime. I have many out of memory errors when I still have lots in task manager, although the game still runs, for a while... In game glitches are more frequent but less noteworthy.			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 makes for a pretty enjoyable space sim experience, but it is very lacking in depth.  It tries so hard to give you the complexity one desires in a space sim with features like capturing ships using marines, scanning anomalies, and coming across derelicts just waiting to be scavenged, but in the end, these activities are very superficial.  They eventually become very routine and the rewards are often limited to money or experience.  Levelling up your character doesn't grant much satisfaction, except for when a perk point is given.Not much is required before you'll be rocking around Gemini in the biggest ship the game has to offer, decked out with the biggest guns, with all the best upgrades.  Luckily, this doesn't make you the ultimate end-all-be-all combat god of the universe.  Combat appears to be balanced in such a way that you will always be vulnerable and dealing with this turns out to require very different strategies depending on the size of your ship.Combat is one of the things this game does very well, and a challenge always awaits you as the game throws squadrons of enemies at you routinely, even the periodic Legendary or Hero ship, which offers an even greater challenge and huge money rewards for the latter.Otherwise, this game seems like a pretty casual space sim.  You will get plenty of enjoyment out of it, but you won't get invested in it like you'd like, which makes the sub-40 dollar price tag perfect for the experience it offers.			"

												Some intial problems with the game almost made me eat my own scowling face with rage. For serious, it took four tries just to make it launch and once it did launch it took two restarts to make it launch without messing its big boy pants. Finally, I got into the game, started playing, and immidiately strangled myself with my own mouse cable. This will happen, don't panic. Just unwrap yourself or, if you have to, find an adult to help. At first the controls feel as stable as a drunken donkey with the skurvy, at least with a mouse. I flopped around for quite a while, but eventually not only was I flying circles around the bad guys, I was...no, I was just flying circle cause that's how I dodge enemy fire while keeping my guns trained on them. The point is the flopping became on purpose, cause stragedy; now the controls seem alright to me. The map is roughly six times bigger than something really, really big (a house, a small country, yo momma, etc.). It's big, like hugemongous. Think of something really big, and then know that this is much bigger. The game has two modes: Campaign and Freeroam, although a Campaign save can abandon the story to go chase space squirrels once you realize that space rodents are much more interesting. I played the Campaign for about an hour, then made a new character in Freeroam who is a morbidly obese, one-eyed robot smuggler with a ship so fast that no one has thus far been able to catch it and I regret absolutely nothing. Freeroam is why you buy this game. Freeroam will consume you. I have accepted that this game is my new family, and you must too. Don't fight it. Let Space Daddy carry you away in his big, strong hands. Shhhhhh..... 8/10			"

												A qualified ""Buy.""This game is basically Freelancer. The variety is a bit lacking, but the gameplay is pretty solid.A few caveats: (2 Days after Release) - In it's current form, balance is an issue, some activities are far more profitable than others. - Enemies scale in difficulty based on your level, it's possible to earn too much experience and not enough money to prevent yourself from being anihillated by everything. - Some technical issues remain (Framerate is locked at 30FPS, Some graphics options are disabled. Crashes are rare but occur.)TLDR: If you loved freelancer, and want more of the same, you'll probably enjoy this. Don't expect anything revolutionary, however.			"

								First off I'd like to say that I can't recommend this game or not, its still in its development without a storyline yet. It has a lot of potential but also a lot of stuff to work on. Much of what the others have said is absolutely right. The money/combat balance system is so wonky at the moment. There have been times I fought 2 'impossible' ships and knocked them out almost immediately, and then 3 'trivial' ships have taken me down a little while later. Using manual aiming is a massive handicap because you can only fire from a few turrets at a time and trying to lead a ship is next to impossible at many ranges. I have yet to come across another gun, light or heavy, that is stronger than the ones I started with.The skills and perks are lackluster at best, you start with all the skills and simply increase the efficiency slightly. Every five levels you get a perk, and again, that just adjusts your efficiency with one thing or another, 8% more money when trading, or 8% more damage with railguns, etc. Very uninspired stuff. And then the money, over the course of a week I got about a million, which isn't enough for any ship. Then when I get to a particular station I kill a bounty without even realizing the ship was one. After selling at the station, I get another bounty, and another. In the course of an hour I get 17 million and can pretty much afford whatever I want, except I can't fly much at the level I'm at.All in all it is a game on the cusp of having something really good going for it. There's a lot of potential here and I'll continue to play and explore because I do find it entertaining.			"

												A fun and accessible space sim, but suffers from lack of depth.The economy system could use an improvement, prices don't seem to vary much and it does not seem to work on a supply and demand system.The faction relation system seems shallow, with a faction being good or evil and depending on your stance factions belonging to one side will either like you or be an enemy. I almost wish it was like ""Mount and Blade"", with you joining a faction and assisting that faction capture enemy territory.Though besides it lack of depth in places, I still enjoyed the game for the time I spent in it.

								30 mins in and its pretty good so far, reminds me of a old Star Trek game I used to play where you can control the ship tactically and space combat is not all arcade dog fighting-like. Though the world is still layed out like most star trading games, IE- standard trading of goods from A-B, scanning stuff, fighting pirates and griding. Prices for upgrades and ships seem rather steep for the rewards given for quests, hopefully they get that figured out because that seems to be a exessive amount of grinding. Combat, navigation, and controls are really intuitive (played the first one since it was free and its controls are aweful) skiped the pop-ups and just jumped in. One suggestion that would be nice is thet able to attack the ports in space, as of now you can target but nothing connects and you can fly right through them. You would probably lose but its no fun without the option.			"

								You can pilot anything from a gunship to a carrier (you can NOT pilot fighters, they are launched from carrier class vessels), do freelance missions like assassinations (destroying marked ships), assistance (Fight off attackers and protect a ship). However the ships you have to destroy are not necessarily your enemy, in fact they could be allies!The game might be in alpha (going in to beta very soon), and there are bugs/missing features (Alpha is alpha after all). But in it's current state it is highly playable and very fun for anyone interested in piloting their own spacecraft, and the developers interaction with their playerbase is very commendable. I see them answering questions in almost every quistion topic here on steam, and they are active on their own forumes as well.I have heard the original Starpoint Gemini was not that good (I have not played it myself), and if that is so: do not fear, this game, even in alpha, is very enjoyable. Any spacesim enthusiast will get their moneys worth, and then some!			"

								Starpoint Gemini 2 is a game I've been following for a long time, hoping for a game that would dethrone Freelancer from its rightfull place. So far things look good and this might even be the case in the future, but as of now there's still plenty of work to be done. That doesn't mean SG2 wouldn't feel good to play. Does it?The game features a rather large open area The Gemini Star System. It's filled with stations, shipyards, bases, asteroid fields, junkyards, enemy ships, friendly ships, planets, anomalities, practically everything you would expect from a sandbox-type space game. It feels like there's a lot to do out there but at least for me that's not the case. This is because the game features very few different types of missions for the moment. There are freelance missions which you'll accept over the map view and then start them by docking with the correct facility, ship or planet. These missions usually involve hauling passangers or goods from the dock point to another. There are also scanning, repairing, patrolling and I think I even saw an assassination mission. These might keep you busy for a while but the samey repeating content of each mission type quickly lose their charm.The game's main emphasis is on space combat which for the most parts feels good. Ships fly in space and trade fire with missiles, beam weapons, plasma and railguns. Fighters fly out from the bigger ships and engage the enemies and boarding parties can devastate the enemy ships from within. You can fire manually or tell the game to target and fire on the target for you. I find this helpful since handling the ship in combat can be a real pain. You control your ship through two different control mechanics. The default one uses WASD to steer the ship while the mouse is used to target, shoot and activate buttons on the GUI. The second method is using the mouse to steer the ship. The ship turns along your mouse movement much the same way the default steering in Freelancer was handled. I prefer the former method in this game since using the mouse flight feels overly sensitive and I can't seem to make the ship fly straight or stay on target. In combat you also have to keep your ship from taking damage and face the stronger shield at your enemy while also focusing on distributing fire from your weapons evenly enough so you can have a sustained stream of fire at the target. I'm not sure if this is the intended way to fight but I've found it effective. You can also enter the turret view to move the camera and aim targets around your ship freely, this helps you to shoot targets your ships is not directly facing at. The combat is fairly entertaining, although like I mentioned above, steering the ship can be difficult and the default camera angle isn't helping much. When you need to fly on target it seems you have to place the target somewhere above your ship, close to the top edge of your screen. This is the actual direction the ship is moving towards to and it might take a while to get used to that. Also because of the odd camera angle I often had to keep the enemy ""above"" my ship to be able to fire the majority of my weapons at it. This just feels wrong, at least to me.The GUI is what really bothers me the most. It's overly colourfull, oddly clunky and the sound effects are horrendous. I have a tendency to go for a ""minimalist"" kind of look when it comes to user interfaces and such. In this game the UI makes me think of children toys, the large plastic kind with full of teeth marks and bright flashy colours. Actually, now that I think of it, the overall design and look of the game is overly shiny and gleamy. The ship designs could also be a tad more imaginative. Even the large battleships just look and feel like one-man fighter crafts even though they are supposed to be much larger than that.Overall the game has potential to be extremely entertaining. I like it so far even if the things I mentioned above might feel a little harsh. I've got great expectations for this game, although experience has taught me not to, but I can't help it. I'm longing for a good space combat/sim/whatever that has the feel and openness of Freelancer.			"

								After playing EVE Online (Non-Steam) I've been really looking for a space-sim similar to it but an offline version. X3 (Non-Steam) was the best one I've played so far, and Rebirth I've never touched because it looked pretty disappointing.Music: The tracks so far are good and fit the game well but there's only 4 tracks I've heard so far but hopefully more will come.Gameplay: Depending on the class you pick, you'll have a set of skills that you can utilize in combat or other purposes, there's a leveling system as well which you progress by doing missions, mining, exploring new sectors, repairing ships/stations, scanning anomalies and blowing other ships up, with this in mind the game felt like it was a Space Sim/RPG mix to me. Combat is good, I have freedom of movement and aim. It's also cool how you have troopers on your ship and you can get them to board other ships, unfortunately I never succeded.Graphics: Ship/Station models, anomalies look decent, the background looks excellent, planets look ok but overall the game looks great.Single Player: So far there's only a Sandbox mode where you can do whatever you want, there's no story mode at the moment but they have said that they are working on it and we'll probably end up seeing it sooner or later.Summary: Starpoint Gemini 2 has alot of potential and It's pretty good for an early access title, so far I've enjoyed my time with and will continue playing it. One thing I would love to see is the ability to actually fly into the planets and explore the landscapes, not just dock on the planets with a menu and what not. "

Down side is learning the controls.The tutorial is like a wiki, text and image based which I found hard to follow. I tried to play using my controller but found it impossible to shot because the controller buttons for the menu were the same buttons to fire and target, this meant I could not manually fire my guns. If I am missing something maybe a video tutorial on how to play with the controller would help so maybe a member of the community could help here.Once I switched back to the mouse I found flying around quite enjoyable. You do not have to fly far to run into some action which I liked. Over all I like this game very much, and did I mention the great sound effects and epic music.  "

												I really love the game, the open world and freedom to do what I want is so simple yet nobody seems to ever give the true freedom of choice that I want in a space game. I'm really happy with it. I only have one complaint and a two suggestions. For the complaint, and it may be something on my end, I'm experiencing a lot of crashes, still worth it to reload every hour or so though. As for a suggestion, I love the open world sandbox feel, however a more effective fast travel would be nice. My second suggestion would be to work in some speaking graphics of an alien or human pirates or whoever is talking when I recieve a message from somebody in the upper left cornet within the exploration game. I just feel like it would be more engaging with that.			"

												Great game and great customer support!SPG2 is not a Flight-Sim like the X-Games... its more likley a point and click and Flight-Sim Hybrid.Point and Click components are implemented in the following game Mechanics:- Targeting- Special Skills- Shooting (Auto Aim and Auto Fire [Optional you can aim and shoot by yourself but the controls are not really made for this])Flight sim:- Evasive Manuveurs - OutmanuveursAs you can see is the Focus on the Point and Click elements. Personaly  i would like to play this game as an pure Flight-Sim but the controls are right now just to clumsy (Mouse Aim is a little bit hard to master and flying with joystic will lead into big disadvantages because you will have massive problems to rotaet those turrets (Nearly all Weapons are turrets).But the Game is still in Progress and the Devs are very active in the steam forum and try to help there costumers nearly in every single thread that is posted. Suggestions are also taked really serious by the devs.The First company i know which has a suggestion forum that isnt just a placebo.Never has seen such a service before! "

												I've had Starpoint Gemini 2 since Early Access, but I didn't know how to play it. Only a couple of days before release from beta did I start watching YouTube videos on how to play it and since then I've been having quite a bit of fun with it. I'm hooked. Right now, I'm ten hours into the game playing Freeroam; I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of this huge game. I kinda like how I can go in-game if I have some time over and just do a couple of quick missions, while, if I want to play for longer, I can do long trips to the end of the galaxy that will take hours and involve lots of exploration and combat. It's beautiful, it's fun and it's satisfying. I like Freeroam mode, but there's also a storyline mode. The modding is going to be awesome. Watch out for some big total conversions for this one! Also, the community and developers are really friendly.			"

								This is a great game. Like all space sim/action/whatever, it takes a little to get comfortable with all the controls. There is so far only one real thing I'd change. There is a sense of ""I'm never ever gonna be able to afford that..."". The experience gained from freelancer missions is way too freaking small, and the upgrades to weapons are insanely expensive, not to mention I have no real idea how much of a boost they are giving me, because the data doesn't have % signs or adjustments shown.So really, it's a great game. Period. It seems like it would never end really, which is great. But I still have no sense of how long it will take to get to higher levels, because right now I'm level 3 (so like 6300/9000 points to next level) and each of these freelancer missions gets me like 50 freaking points! So I'm asuming never.I know I am just griping about that over and over, but that's it, that's the only drawback. Other than that, it has everything you want in a space RPG. Exploring, mining, upgrading, fighting (which is pretty hard, but really fun), assassinations, etc.			"

												I gotta say ever since the Star Trek Star Fleet Command series of games I was always looking for something close.I found Starport Gemini and it quickly grew on me. It has many of the elements the former Star Trek games had, Ship command, 360 degree views, power management, repair, officers, ability to go anywhere in the galaxy, trading. The great thing aboiut Starport Gemini 2 is it improves on all that with 360 degree freedom of the camera and space maneuvering. Its no longer 2d in that regard. Even in beta it feels polished compared to the earlier game. I can't wait for the campaign to come and I do hope someone makes a mod so us girls can play as female in it. I give the Game 4 stars out of 5 as is.Big thuumbs up.			"

								when you play SPG2 you have to remember at the moment its a Beta and has the main story missing so full review not possible . So far i have given it about 30 hrs of play time and have discovered about 50% of the map so very replayable and keeps pulling you in to discover more . Lots of side missions available  but no side line stories or quests as of yet i assume these will come with the main quest . Although there are a abudance of different factions and ship and enhancements available easily enough to keep you going for a long time . There are also a large ammount of mods avaiilable throught the steam workshop which yet another dimension to the game especially if you like blowing things up with very big guns . I would fully recommend this game it has provided me with hours of entertainment and many more to come  during my play i have encountered no gliches or freezes to date  and all seems well . Looking forward to the Main story .			"

												Edit: This was a review of the EARLY ACCESS! This does not reflect the new content added in the update, but once I play the retail version enough, I will be sure to update!For a while I have been looking for a good open-world space game, with nothing really looking like a decent game. For me, spore is the most experience with a space-style game, which I really loved, but I wanted to move on to better things. Then I saw Starpoint Gemini 2 in development. After watching some videos and seeing how fantastic the game looked, I decided to buy it, which was an excellent decision and one that I recommend anyone reading this review to follow.Little more needs to be said about the visuals. They are fantastic. Combat is also really well done, and content is surprising since it is still in development and only has one gamemode so far. The most disappointing thing about this game for me was that there is no option to actually explore planets. This is purely a space exploration game, which of course is why the price is not rediculously high and is very reasonably priced especially for a game so modern that it is still in development. That limitation is really the one thing which is keeping this from being my dream game, but it is definitely fantastic for what it was designed for. Just make sure to dock whenever possible so that you can save and not lose a ton of progress!Overall, I definitely recommend this game whether you are new to the space scene or a veteran. Especially at this price point, it is an excellent buy!			"

												A very good space game, enjoyable in freeroam and the story mode seem pretty interesting. The only thing bugging me about the game is the frequent pauses and stutters whilst flying through zones - the game will literally stop for a second, at first it didn't bother me but since starting the story mode the pausing seems to stand out more and has become a pet hate. Going to wait for a few updates and hopefully this will get cured, not sure I can finish the game whilst this is an issue.I'm going to recommend the game because it is a really fun game, if these pauses get cured it will be really enjoyable, and I do think it will be cured because the devs have been doing a great job.(And before anyone blames my spec for the pauses - I'm using a i7 4770K, 16GB ram, GTX 770 and the game is running from a 3TB WD black.)

												This game can be summed up as a modern day Freelancer, but with capital ships instead of fighters. It shares many similarities with the aforementioned game, as well as some enjoyable improvements, and will probably be the best single player Freelancer-style space sim available for a good while. With Star Citizen focused on multiplayer, look no further than Starpoint Gemini 2 to fill the gap between the two.Like Freelancer, you can play with keyboard and mouse, with a rather familiar flight control style to Freelancer players. But although SG2 offers support for other gaming controllers, it's far from polished right now - it's near-enough unplayable with the popular Saitek X52 HOTAS, given the rediculous deadzone on all axes. However, if anything, the keyboard and mouse feels more natural to use in this game anyway, given you're playing the role as a ship (and later, fleet) commander.Comparing this game to the failure that was X-Rebirth, SG2 comes out on top. Although more arcady, SG2 is significantly more enjoyable from the getgo.			"

												Very enjoyable, a bit rough around the edges.Even with a few issues (voiceover audio not playing, no docking animations, navigation issues when you hit go-to when you're next to a station you've docked at, etc.) this game is very, very fun.Unlike the space sims before it (Freelancer) and the modern ones coming out (Elite: Dangerous and Star Citizen) which focus on the mechanics of a more agile fighter, Starpoint Gemini 2 focuses much more on a capitol ship feel. You're not a lone pilot darting through space in a dogfight, you're sitting at the helm of a Carrier, deploying fighters, and watching your crew unload your ship's payload. Power management is stressed, as is the use of powers and items that bolster shields, shut down enemy systems, etc. One thing I love about this game which I have not yet seen in another space sim is the ability to send your troops over to capture another ship. This happens to be one of the best ways to make money, and is extremely fun.Unfortunately it doesn't give you any experience (which seems a little peculiar, considering it's an integral part of many people's strategies), but the payout is fantastic.All in all, worth buying, though I haven't played it since Elite: Dangerous came out lol			"

												I'm not sure how to review this one. There are some issues that I have with it that are just hallmarks of past space sims. So if you hate typical downsides of space sims, then this game doesn't really break that barrier. If you're not a fan of classic space sims, then this game doesn't deliver much outside of that. But first off, I got this game when it was 80% off 2 years after it released. I got it primarily to scratch that never-ending itch of playing a worthwile space sim while waiting for Star Citizen to be a more complete game. My review is about the base game with its base story missions and content.The main campaign is a revenge story of a son wanting justice for his dad's murder, but like past sci-fi games it quickly evolves into you saving the whole world or in this case a solar system. Cliched, I know, but I won't spoil it. The story likely took me about 8 hours to complete which I expected for a game like this. Like previous space sims before it, it allows you to do whatever you want and start any mission you want after the initial mission without an artificial lock like you need to be level X to do mission Y. Personally, I like that in open world games. There are supposedly 13 non-story mission types that are randomly generated on the map, but depending on your ship these missions can range anywhere from super easy or downright impossible. That was my first problem with this game. The randomly-created missions support the grindiness aspect of the game, and the rewards often feel lackluster even after progressing so far into the game. When you've done one ferry mission or security mission, you've done them all. There's no variation in each mission type. Just a difference in NPC ship difficulty. That's where problem 2 comes in.You can mine asteroids, crystals, and pockets of gas in certain sectors of the map that will reward you depending on the market value and how big your cargo hold can take. After getting the ship with the most cargo capacity and mining said sectors, the tediusness and grindiness settles in quick. If you like that aspect of space sims, where grinding = bigger and better ship then this is right up your alley. If not, then look elsewhere. Personally, after ~50 some hours of mining, salvaging, bounty hunting, raiding commercial ships and stations, escorting/protecting/rescuing NPCs and scanning space anomalies, I feel like this game scratched that itch. I can't say I enjoyed the whole grind experience, but I did feel satisfaction upon earning one of the best ships in the game. Once you get past the tedium and set up a ship goal, hours did fly for me by working up the reputation and credits to earn it. If you expect not to grind for a better ship, then expect to mod the game or not get the game at all.The leveling system is typical with missions giving you x amount of credits and experience points. You use these points to level up different abilities for one of three chosen classes (commander, gunner, engineer) that activate in-game to give your ship better stats momentarily like faster speed, more weapon damage, faster shield regeneration, etc. The reputation system is binary where doing missions for X faction will yield Y rep points and -Y rep for the opposing faction. You can side with ""bad"" factions, stay lawful/chaotic neutral, or side with ""good"" factions. I chose to be lawful good throughout the game, like a good boy scout that I try to be irl. Siding with either faction will either open or close certain planets and stations which will lock you out of a certain achievement if you're not neutral. It's a lot harder to stay neutral because the story doesn't let you choose outcomes and there aren't enough non-story missions that will help keep you neutral. So what's my problem with this? The leveling system on top of the grindy non-story missions really does show how tedius this game can get. It doesn't really get better once you reach your ship goal. I'm still left with the same missions and rewards that don't scale as much as I wanted it to.You'd think that once you're Commander Badass with a Dreadnought, fighter ships you can deploy and merc ships you can hire, that you'd be making bank by melting everything in sight with your plasma cannons. Nope. I still have to mine/salvage/scan/trade ad infinitum to make serious money. Having a bigger ship does help with not dying every 10 minutes or so from seemingly random incursions with other giant ships, often multiple giant ships to contend with. That's another problem I have with this game. NPC ships that scale from a trivial threat to impossible come out of nowhere at random times. Even when you're technically in safe sectors of space, NPCs that are against your faction (which to me is every bad guy in the game) will spawn or decloak out of nowhere and proceed to tear you a new one very early in the game, until you have one of the best ships then you can go toe to toe with one of them. If dying repeatedly due to random incursions regardless of where you are in the map isn't your thing, then that's a big problem. I get it, space is dangerous and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s can be anywhere in the vast emptiness of space. But if I'm 10 seconds away from the good guys Navy fleet, you'd think that pirates and marauders wouldn't go that close and tear you a new one. If/when I create a chaotic evil character save, I will update this review to reflect my experience being on the other side of the law.One aspect I failed to use in this game before this review are mods from the Steam workshop. They range from quality of life mods (better loot, more damage, faster speed) to custom assets in game (ships, stations, missions, etc.) to total conversions, so fellow Star Trek fans will be able to scratch that itch.I'd like to say that after ~60 hours of playing this game, I will recommend it to fans of classic space sims with the caveat that there is a space sim grind to it and that it doesn't hold your hand. If you're looking for a revolutionary game that breaks the typical downsides of space sims, then please look elsewhere. If you know that you want to scratch that classic space sim itch with the understanding of the problems that I've explained above, then I do recommend this game to you.			"

								Wow! I have played a lot of Freelancer over the years and always looked forward to a second comming if you will. With the recent surge in SciFi games I have tried my chances with a few and been let down (X-Rebirth I am looking at you). However this game keeps the syplicity of Freelancer with ideas from today. Honestly it really takes the best from Star Trek Online and Freelancer in that it allows you to be what you want but gain levels along the way with a pretty good skill tree. I really enjoy the freedom to do what you want combined with an RPG element. That way I actually feel like I am getting somewhere. Ordinarily I would wait to post a review however with these types of games I can usually tell if I will like them based on my love of Freelancer (hence the constant name drop). This game also has a full workshop so there is the possibility of endless content. There are already Star Trek mods and I am sure that more are to follow. All in all, if you need to scratch the Freelancer itch and you are tired of waiting for Robert's new game, please try this one. For the price it really cannot be beat.			"

												Great game. Lots of stuff to do, ships to capture, loot to find and so on. But I encountered several bugs too, mostly plot-related. Sometimes missions just won't progress after you do something. You'll have to reload and hope it doesn't happen again. Quite frustrating, especially if it involved a lenghty mission, or just lenghty waiting (talks between various characters).Otherwise a really fun game.			"

												Alreet peeps, so this is my experience shot and review. So first things first id like to recommend this title and hope you enjoy it as much as i did.  This however will just be a general impression not a rating or in depth review.Reasons : I'm coming from the original Starpoint Gemini and really enjoyed it for its single player freelancer style of gameplay. I picked it up in early access which i dont usualy go for but due to my experience with the original i toke a chance, this was not a mistake though as the title has come along way since i originaly purchased this.Graphical: not cutting edge but still a really good looking game. fx to physics all of which are well made and are still being refined even after full release.Sound assets : I have no ear for sound effects but they where up to standard, no odd sounds that ruined the experience.Performance : Runs great. I dont have a uber rig, i run a very avarge system and this game runs great even in larger battles.Content: A good solid campaign backed up with a freeroam mode that allows you to strip away the main story and play the universe in the way you want to. So many ships that you wont get to fly them all in one play through i reckon even with a few play throughs you will find some new ship to fly, some new mission and or enemy to beat up on. Also the ability to play as a peace keeper or as a bandit.faults : no borderless window mode and lack of a multiplayer.Overhall: Solid singleplayer title that if you like freelancer / startrek online / x3 then your gonna be at home with this title. Defo pick this up and i pretty sure you will enjoy whats here and whats coming in the future as the team behind this is great and im sure this game can only get better.Update- the original games campaign reto fitted into this game for free!, why cant all develpers do this. Perfect actualy prefect.Stay Frosty			"

								It's a good space RPG, that has a few bugs, still but only minor ones. the ship customizing is, good idea,  and the ships are a fair size, with combat skills, the turning rate, still needs some work.  combat pretty basic, missle weapons and beam, weapons, just need to upgrade, them.  For the overall of the game, u get more, from hunting down emenies, but still can make  some pretty good, coin, in the trading system, just have to find a trade. route, that will pay more, for ur buying items. at the stations.  Missions are good, since u need them to build ur rep, with the sector's  and regions of the game.  But don't do any missions that take u into a hostile, Base. really bad idea.  As for Rateing this game, would be 8/10.  Not a bad game to have.			"

												Da. Best. And that is an exact measurement.  Starpoint Gemini 2 successfully brings the open world 3D single player RPG to space.  Some may say that sprpg is past its prime but SG2 didn't get that memo because this game doesn't feel dated at all and includes all the modern accessories like side quests, an engaging story, lots of skills and ranks and points to customize your character, hireable mercenaries, customizable ships (oh yea), and some awesome new stuff to make you feel like you are not only piloting, but commanding a fleet.  I played this game a lot during early access and I said then that this game had the potential to be awesome if executed correctly and man was it ever!  On top of all that your ship is a whole character of its own with everything from frail gunships to massive carriers that can cloak themselves and launch entire fighter wings from their carrier bays! I would recommend this game to anyone who has suffering in the drought of good space games and anyone who enjoys rpgs.  Oh and [name redacted] this isn't Eve, you get to shoot the guns and do stuff.			"

												Starpoint Gemini is worth buying if you like sandbox space games where you can mine, be a pirate, or just do missions. However, 35 dollars just seems too high for what you get so you may want to wait for a sale of some kind first.Video showing what the gameplay is like(even though old video, gameplay is still 99% the same... campaign just didnt exist yet):

Early Access Review
								Being a SCI-Fi fan, it brings me much joy to review SPG2. This is an awesome space sim/ fighter game in which you command one of many space worthy vessels against pirates, factions and even natural elements like radiation which will wreak havok on your ship and crew. There are missions, faction missions, mining and salvage operations, and if your more about chaos and destruction then you can go around hijacking other ships to add to your own collection or sell, its all up to you. Currently the game is still in Beta and the game has its bugs and balancing issues but the Devs are always hard at work bringing constant updates and answering questions from the community, which is a major plus these days. The game at is current state is beautiful to look at with many various galaxies, planets and space stations, this game easily surpasses other sims that have already had time to mature. Future updates include strory lines, more complex missions, and ships, also the list as the devs have called it is always growing from ideas of players and the community as a whole. So if you love space, ships, fighting, customization, looting, selling and RPG elements then this is the game for you, trust me when I say you wont regret it.			"

												Good time killer but there are a lot of little bugs that blow it for me. Like mission triggers that don't always work so you can get stuck on missions and need customer support to tweak them. That and the combat is relatively bland, they put a lot of thought into boarding actions and such but its not easy to learn unless you stumble upon a youtube guide, theres no tutorial really for it. Beyond that the enemy AI always hangs out in your blind spot and the dogfighting is very ""meh"" - point and click stuff, doesn't feel like it's skill based you know? Just tell your turrets to go HAM and wait a few seconds for things to explode. Scan anomalies for EXP that you'd otherwise ignore so their ""side effects"" aren't very underplayed.			"

												Well for $35 I have enjoyed this game. There are aspects of this game that are in need of improvements. Specifically: the point of view difficulties with turret mode, fixing balancing issues with mission level and mission difficulty, sudden explosion of ship which occurs randomly for no apparent reason either in combat or not, and a revamping of the money making process as capturing ships is the only effective way to progress due to missions and mining not being profitable enough to support ship progression. I have only played the freeroam with a starting zero reputation mod. I have played Rebel Galaxy before purchasing this game and found this game to be different and not necessarily better than Rebel Galaxy. There is more that is different than the same between the two games.			"

												I haven't played this game for too long but it has proven to be very fun and challenging.  I am currently playing through the campaign but I am also conducting side missions.  The side missions include (from what I have seen so far): assassination of trouble makers, repairing installations, bounty hunting, and transporting VIPs. I mine asteriods and trade at stations frequently to balance my finances.  Capturing and selling enemy starships have proven to be the most lucrative transaction.  Combat is somewhat confusing at first but the games excellent tutorial guide and fully customizable control menu is very helpful.  Pros:-Good graphics.-Intense space combat.-Can easily change viewing settings - Rudder control""bridge"" view, Rudder control third person view, and turret third person view.-Ability to purchase and upgrade several starships.-Can hire mercs and form a fleet. -Large open world to explore.-Many unique ways to ""jump""around the map e.g. rifts and wormholes.-Story is ok.-Background music is pretty good and varied.Cons:-No NPCs to interact with at space stations.-No first person perspective.-No ship interior perspective. Mixed:-Fairly steep learning curve to become proficient with all of the games functions.Overall a great indie title!  Give your self lots of time to play this game...it is hard to quit this game for the night!			"

												I always was fan of space games, but most of them are meh at the best. The only that I TRULY liked A LOT were X3 (all 3 of X3's), EVE Online, FTL, and Space Pirates and Zombies. To be honest, I expected Stairpont Gemini 2 to be just meh, but it came on sale. Quickly calculated the cost in my currency, and decided to give it a shot anyway.It might not be one of those I love the most, but certainly it's not meh either. It's actually pretty good. I am enjoying it.It sure has it's flaws, but it sure is fun to play. I see it as kind of mix of Freelancer/X3 with EVE Online. For sure, I don't regret spending money on it - and it doesn't happen a lot.			"

Posted: April 7, 2016
												There is a very important tip in this review! If you're going to get this game, you better read on.I tried to return this game after five hours of trying to make enough money to even by the next better laser in order to break the asteroids faster.  And, I can tell you I'm very happy that I passed the hours played deadline for returning it! This really is a quite fun game if you know the right way to make money!  If you think you're going to make money trading or mining, you got another thing coming! Forget about anything except capturing enemy ships.When you go to a space station, on the upper left you can select hiring troops or mercenaries. Hire as many troops as you can, and then go find an enemy ship. Find an enemy ship that has as many or less personnel than the troops you hired.  The number of personnel is listed to the right of the 'lock on' information.Destroy most of the enemies hull, but leave about a quarter. Then from your 'center mouse button' menu select send troops. Over on the right side of your screen a small flag will appear showing your troops are boarding the ship and how many troops are left on both sides. At this point you can click on the green arrow to send extra troops, if you don't send extra troops you will probably lose the battle.  If and when you capture the ship, and you must learn how to capture ships, use the tractor lock on in the 'center mouse button' menu. Then head back to a space station and sell it. In the beginning ships get you about $100 K, maybe a little less. But that beats the $10 K per trip of breaking rocks. Then use that money to buy better lasers, missiles, and systems upgrades. You do not get experience points for capturing ships though.(unless it finishes a mission) Destroying ships gives you experience points. Once you have upgraded your ship as much as you can, then go start doing missions to gain experience points.Make sure you save at least one of every higher level ship to use as you rank up. If you are good enough at combat, you can capture ships larger and better than yours. Then once you rank up you can start using them instead.  I have succeeded capturing ships with one third less personnel on my ship than the enemy ship. I think the worst damage to the enemy ship the less troops you need.Definitely read the instructions in the upper right ? Icon.Pros:It definitely is a well-made galaxy. It's pretty, large, has lots of planets, anomalies, and wormholes. The wormholes can be a little crazy when you're in a battle and one grabs you and sweeps you away!It has lots of great ships to choose from.Plenty of different armaments to choose from.Some armaments work well in some situations and then do not work as well in others.Lots of side missions to choose from.The campaign story is really good.Cons: Even though it has a good campaign story, the voice acting is some of the worst I've ever heard in most of the characters.  It seems like they went around from high school to high school looking for the worst of the drama students they could find to perform the stories.The mission text portions have obviously been poorly translated. I think it was originally in German. A lot of the stories and side missions are just given to you in text form, and because of the poor translation it can be hard to understand what they are trying to say.Considering the size of the galaxy they provide, the main campaign was too short. I did tons of side missions, finished the story, and still had half the galaxy unexplored. Since I find no point in just roaming around the galaxy for no particular reason, the rest will remain unexplored.All in all:It was totally money well spent! I also got the two extra campaigns which I will now go and play.			"

												This is the space sim I've been looking for since I stopped playing Freelancer; big open world, customisable ships, factions, upgrades and a big open world. I get to fly around a large universe, exploring, trading, collecting bounties or mining and still feel like there's more out there to see/do. Maybe these things are available in EVE, but I wouldn't know as I don't get enough gaming time these days to justify a monthly subscription.This game is about captaining a ship; the piloting and gunning controls work best if you select a target/destnation and tell the ship to attack or move.Here's my first impressions after 20 hours:Pros Big open world (might have mentioned this already) Customisable ships Various factions to befriend / hunt down Freedom to choose between merc, trader, explorer, etc No game breaking bugs (so far)Cons Feels like a late beta - the DLC prompt EVERY SINGLE TIME I start the game, despite my saved games already using the DLC. There's also missing voice files for some conversations and custom key configurations aren't saved between sessions. Voice acting, when it's there (some of the voice files are missing) Tutorial - be prepared to click through screens of dull text every time you mouse over a control the first time you play and still have to look things up afterwards. Do yourself a favour and watch some YouTube guides instead.Still I reckon this'll be one of my most played games by the time I finish with it.			"

												This game has lots of flaws, but I like it so much since it's the game i've been looking for a long time.PROS:-Absolutely beautiful, the way the binary stars cast shadows on asteroids, to the way distant nebulae appear giant and intimidating-Most of the locations you see in space are reachable-Great soundtrack-You can be what you want, a pirate, trader, privateer, whatever-Lots of ships-Lots of modules and countless ways to setup your loadout-For a space game, the environment is extremely varied-Boarding and stealing a ship feels damn good-MODDING!!!!!1111111!!11MIXED:-Probably just me, but the trading and interface feel to simple; after playing EVE Online for so long, the UI feels like it needs more-The active ability RPG portion feels tacked on, I find myself almost always autofiring; at least never using my 1-4 keys-Sometimes the autopilot glitches out and it's hilarious; I like to think of it as a feature-Doesn't have SLI support, unless forced through a third party program like NVidia inspector or even just the control panel. However, once you do force it, it runs really nice (minus some annoying microstuttering).CONS:-The downscaling of the universe is really obvious and weird-Things pop in a lot, like anomalies and stations-Bad sound effect design, especially in weapon firing sounds-Inconsistant graphics, some things are really highly detailed while others look like they came out of a 2006 game-Missions get repetitive, and if you strip all the lore and factions away, all the gameplay is literally the same, minus enemies getting tougher over timeCool game, go buy, shoot ships in the face.

I've tried, but the default control mappings are bizzare, they don't align with any other sim of this type, combine that with the UI that is nearly unreadble, and trying to figure out what does what is a pain. You would have to remap every control in this game to make it playable, and then you would still need to figure out what the near unreadble UI is trying to tell you.			"

												Basically Freelancer.Similar to Sid Meier's Pirates but in space. Huge space.Ship customization similar to Mechwarrior's mech customization.Mine asteroids, hunt bounties, play with the market, buy better ships, better equipment, etc.Streamlined user interface.Combat is good. There's several weapon types for you to try out. Rockets, laser beams and plasma cannons to name a few, each with their own properties and upgrades. Get on your gunship and chase enemies by their tail or line up your battleship and bombard them mercilessly. Your choice.Exploration is good. The game gives the player a huge world to explore. Planets, space stations and shipyards that offer different products depending on their region. Planets and space stations act as hubs, you can't set foot on them and explore. Not as huge as Elite Dangerous but huge nonetheless. Music is good. Too bad there's not much to go around. If you have a space exploration playlist then add this game's music to that playlist and play that instead.Economy is there. Trade clean goods or contraband. You can take advantage of rising and falling prices of materials but the economy isn't deep enough to make it an engaging enterprise. You can mine asteroids or scavenge space junk while going about your trade route, I guess.CAN'T FORM A FLEET. You can capture enemy ships. You either sell them, keep them or scrap them. Keeping them puts them in your garage. You can switch between ships YOU CAN ONLY USE ONE SHIP AT ANY TIME. The closest to a fleet you'll get is by hiring mercenaries to fly with you for a price. Even then you can't command them. This is probably the worst negative point of the game in my opinion.Light RPG elements.A good space game overall but if you're into trading, playing with the economy or empire building then this game won't satisfy you. I bought this on sale at 80% off so it's more than worth the money.			"

												As many reviews state, this game starts out amazingly. Once you figure out the 3 things to do though, you are done. There is no taking over rival factions or expanding faction space. In fact, the factions may as well not exist other than to proivde you with dynamic enemies.The appearance and interface in this game is great. I just want more guts. The core is so flacid I simply stopped playing due to boredom. Stories and missions are mostly a joke. Go assassinate this guy. Go do this. Go do that. Fly for hours between. It just ends up being grind for the sake of grind.Get it on sale. Play for a bit. I got 8 hours out of it and will probably spin it up again in the future for another hour or two. "

												havinghad this game from the alhpa release it has been constantly improved with each patch that has been applied and if there are any problems then you can alqays email andlet them know, oneof the thing i love about this game.  having palyed other games like the x series this one doesnt seem to have as steep lerning curves as the x series does for example, only thing is i wish you culd explore planets and stations when landing, but maybe that will comeout in one of the future pathches, asl well as the key to cut the talk between characters doesnt seem to quiet workm but again will probably be addressed in a future patch. i love this game for me it has a trek feel to it, and i have spent many hoiurs happily wasting my life on it, and will continue to do so			"

												70% game is good, but this game Could be better than this, if developer make the (massive multiplayer) . some times we need rest, ok just start game and listen music and play ,you going to relax. space Graphics is beautiful , game play is good,weapon good.just imagines if, i meant if this game going to MMO what happening to other MMO game (space MMO), maybe Starpoint Gemini 3 going to (MMO) who knows. in (MMO) or (massive multiplayer) games you feel game is live, You're playing with real players and every time you play, you will not get tired of playing (not much). anyway this is single player and good.

												I remember getting this game when it was still in its alpha/beta form with only a few things to do besides blowing up ships, blowing up asteroids, taking their goods, and then selling them at a market for a few dollars (which seemed weird back then because ships cost a ♥♥♥♥ TON and still do, but there are ways to get more money now.) So playing now, seeing that it is full release form, welllllll....it's still empty. I mean, there is absolutely almost nothing going on except for an occasional enemy ship flying in to a friendly territory that gets obliterated in a second. Other than that, nope, nothing. People that hate you, hate you and people that like you, like you, not much else. I thought it'd be awesome to be the revered space pirate captain who steals from all and gets in the way of people to scavenge as much money as possible, even between factions. Which is another huge problem, factions do not feel like they have bad ties between each other, it's as if they are both completely isolated with their borders set in place without anything in between. And there aren't even any huge battles as well, the closest one I got was between myself and 30 other enemy ships. So you might ask, ""What is there to do?"" Well, exactly what I explained at the beginning, you do missions, kill enemies, blow up debris and turn it into a station for some money, like, a little amount of money. And the most money you get is from ship debris -floating ship debris and destroyed ships- which on maximum with the stock ship which can only hold 45 units is about $30,000 maximum give or take. So how much does an upgraded ship minus weapons cost? Depending on your preference from the different types, a direct upgrade would be from 2-5 mil even though it can go higher to prices of 30 million. So with mining and missions ranging in price from 10-20 thousand, you're looking at doing this 66 times to afford a new ship and that's at the maximum you'll get from mining and missions just for a 2 mil ship. Yes, there are hero ships that give you about 5 mil if you destroy them, but so far I've found no real way to track them other than hearing the news saying they are in so-and-so region, and even if you do find them, they are at impossible difficulty and usually have other ships around them so good luck. Did I have fun though? Yes, I had fun in some parts when I tried to dodge enemy ships while firing, but after your first few things to do it gets incredibly boring.			"

												I would definately recommend this game... but with some notes of caution.  I consider my self a supporter of 'Little Green Men', because I've always enjoyed their games ( at least the few I have).  However... I feel this one is falling a bit short, and I'm unsure if these are problems they are having issues resolving... or have just given up.  However... the problems that I've seen thus far, are more inconvenient than Game Stopping.There's a serious issue with early game over powering of the enemy.  While I've heard a claim by the developers that this was a Development decision, I personally believe this is a Bug that they haven't been able to resolve.  Basically, when taking a mission which is marked at a specific level, the mission turns out to be impossible to complete even though your level made be higher than the recommended level.  Option:  Run and find another mission and hope this doesn't happen too often... but it will.Another issue deals with Enhancements which can be added to ship's equipment and weapons, but the Enhancements do not actually enhance the item.  Note:  some... not all.Licenses, also, which should provide specific bonus do not work.  Note:  some... not all.Other than the above I have no other negative issues with this game.  It has all of the elements of a Good Space Sim, with many choices on how one wishes to play... Fighter... Merchant... Miner... Salvager... or even pirate.  I usually don't play pirate until I get bored with a game, but don't want to stop and need a new challenge.  however, the problem with being a pirate in many space sims is the limited choices you get; often being more of a headache than anything else.  But with this game I've seen the pirates (or more correctly, the Hostile Factions) have as much territory to operate in as the 'So-Called' Good Guys.  I'm actually looking forward to trying my hand as a pirate.The merchant side of the game is IMHO as well done as it seems to be possible based on the many games I've played, and wanted to be a Merchant.  In short... I don't feel like it's Great... but it does seem Very Good; just haven't got a decent size Cargo Ship for really trying it out.  However... for the little trading I've seen and done... it looks like it has ""Very Good"" Potential.  Mining for both Ores and Gases was done in a very fun and unique way... which I've been enjoying for the most part.  It doesn't really seem to make as much money as Combat... but then again, this is a Combat Game; I just like mining; with a touch of combat to give me a reason to wake up in the morning.  But you'll still need to focus on combat fairly early just to get a decent ship for mining.Combat was a bit disappointing at first because of the mechanics used to control the ship.  I found it was best to turn on Auto-Fire on all turrets... which seemed a bit Impersonal to me.  However... as I got better with all that you can do to Protect and Enhance you ship in battle... Aiming my Laser became the least of my problems, and I was rather happy I didn't have to worry about that anymore.  But that is a matter of Personal Preference.Also... the Skill and Perk system is fun; I like the fact that you can ""Sort Of"" custom build yourself for the type of Player and Character you choose.  I'm not a fan of being forced to play a specific character as is done in the Campaign (I feel disconnected to my Character while following the story line), but that, again... is just Personal Preference.  And the fact that I can build him the way I choose is far more important to me.One of the best aspects of this game ""To Me"" is that Money, thus far, is maintaining it's value.  Too often in Single Player Games you find that Money loses it's value far too soon.  Once you get to your 3rd or 4th ship -or- 20th or 30th level, you find  you start ignoring ways of making money... and just focus on leveling... because there just isn't anything left to buy that you can't afford.  I'm current level 43, and still find myself occasionally trying to scrap together a few Bit Coins to buy that Blaster with the Extra Kick.  I find that once a game's currency loses any real value (or more directly; Need) the game heads down hill from there.  At the time of this writing I have roughly $17mil, and trying to get to $29mil for the next for the next ship I want; but not the last ship I'll fly.All in all; while I got this game on sale, I would not have been disappointed if I had paid full price (assuming full price was under $40).  I definately would recommend this game; with hopes of certain issues being resolved.. but with confidence it's still a Fun and Addictive Game.Enjoy!!!			"

												I gave this 15 hours as at first it seems like lots of upgrades and stuff that make it seem technical which I like.But this game has no substance and no depth.I'm so bored I am watching a movie at the same time and still bored with it.I could go into detail but whats the point when no one will ever read this.Think of this as a boring point and click mobile phone game that requires grinding the same hand full of missions over and over to level up and get new ships.  But then you realise its all the same.And you will come to a point where you need to fly to a space station to save every single time you pass anyting as instant death is just around the corner.  Do this boring save crap or replay the last 30min before you died.Yawn.....			"

												Well what can i say i absolutely love this game. Every time i play this game it take's me back to when i used to play colony wars on PS1. This game is definitely made for people who dont have the time sit and grind the hell out of a game to get anywhere. For example im only 30 hrs in this game and im already running around the galaxy in a dreadnought feeling like a absolute power house. You rank up very quickly and theres easy money to make out their. Other then that the ships look awesome and the galaxy it self looks stunning.the only thing i found wrong with this game is that it doesnt feel like a simulation it has more of a arcade feel to it but if your some one like me who doesnt have alot of time on your hands because of works and is raising kids then who give's a s@#$			"

												This game is fun, but to be honest I have run bored of it.I capped and pulled the best ship and went berserk on enemy factions.I love how you can grapple into an enemy craft, send your troops and if good enough you can pull the empty craft to a hanger, either to store it and use it, sell it or scrap it! Cons:- too much farmingBuy it and try it, its one of the good space games out there. "

												The latest update has elevated this to the most satisfying trading simulation I have ever had the pleasure of playing. Not only can you see what various commodities are trading for at the stations you have visited, you also see the distance you currently are from each of those stations. This adds another level of decision making – is the extra distance you might have to travel for a ‘best’ price worth the time it will take to get there, or is a slightly lower price actually the better deal? A small thing, perhaps, but it does make you approach your cargo manifest a bit more critically when deciding on what and when to trade.The second thing this encourages is exploration. You only see the prices for the stations and planets you have discovered. I find myself compelled to push into unknown territory on that never ending quest for the ultimate trade route. And the commodity information screen itself is wonderfully easy to use. The filters are a tremendous help, eliminating the need to scroll through every item available. Are you a miner? Click on ores. Love to hunt down pirates? Quickly discover who is offering the best price for those contraband items.As you may have guessed, I’m a merchant at heart, not a fighter. But I’ve found the battles to be well-balanced and a simple click will tell you if that tantalizing enemy ship you have your eye on has the capability to turn you into so much space dust. Not that the knowledge will necessarily stop you, but at least you’ll know what you’re up against. And for those times when you do take on just a bit more than you can chew and yet somehow manage to pull it off by the skin of your shields, well – you know the feeling.The graphics are gorgeous, the gameplay is addicting, and personalizing your ship is as much fun as creating a new character in most RPGs. At this point the only thing I’m hoping for is that we may eventually see a larger collection of avatar portraits. The new group was a nice addition, but as a female gamer I find the two current offerings lack some of the personality that the male portraits possess. And that something so minor is the only flaw I can find says a lot about how truly innovative and honestly fun this game is. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a trade empire to build. "

Tons of ships to buy, loads of equipment to compare and upgrade, factions to ally or make enemies with, complex trading system, large variety of side missions, and an engaging story. The combat is engaging, I love capturing ships and selling them, the mining the dozens of different types of asteroids is eye candy, and there are tons of secerets to find and explore.

												Been waiting for this sequel for a while with much anticipation and LGM haven't disappointed!  I've only put in about an hour so far but I am loving it already.  There just aren't enough good space trade/fight/explore games any more so this is a welcome relief from the market that's been saturated with FPS games.  LGM are a credit to the PC gaming world and really do support their followers and they deserve our support back.Highly recommended and I cannot wait to get more game time in but I unfortunately have a job :-<			"

												There are ultra realistic space sims,  there are slow paced datasheet space sims,  and on and on and on you can go down the laundry list of space games.   What Starpoint Gemini 2 seeks to accomplish is finding a healthy balance of it's predecessors without leaning too far in any particular direction.   Make no mistake,  SG2 will take you hours to accomplish anything substantial,  but it won't take you hours to start doing something fun.  Want to be a trader?  You can do that.   Want to mine for rare materials?  You can do that.  Want to be a pirate?  You'll eventually be able to do that.  Want to be the force of good bringing bad guys to justice while getting paid for your bounty kills?  You can do that to.    My 7 hours have been mostly spent divided between the three classes that you can choose from in the freeform game.  There is the Leader,  Gunner and Engineer.   Each class provides a fairly substantial difference on terms of feel however the common objective between most of these skills is all the same...   kill your enemy.   I was a bit disappointed to see that many of these skills are not overly helpful for more mundane tasks like mining,  trading,  or exploration.  Seeing as how the game puts heavy emphasis on providing you options - this particular part said to me ""We're only truly designing this game with combat in mind"".   While the other things to do are definitely not afterthoughts,  they're not quite as fleshed out and as robust as I would have liked.There is a story mode but unfortunately the voice acting is horrible.  Normally I can manage some bad voice acting but found this to be a bit too much.  This turned out to be alright in the end as the sandbox aspects of this game are fun and easy to get into.  The tutorial or lack there of was at least filled with a pop-up tips menu which got me rolling quickly enough.  I had to spend some time rummaging through the keybind menu but after that I was off and racing.  This game still feels very young with a lot of possiblities.  My 7 hours is definitely not enough time to even have a completely firm grasp of what the late game or even middle game will be like but I have a hunch it's going to just be more of the same but with higher stakes involved.  Instead of combat with 3-6 ships,  it'll be more along the lines of 10-20 ships if the trailers and other various videos are telling a truthful tale.   Scaling of this nature is not altogether a bad thing if you're having fun with everything you're doing at the start of the game.  Essentially,  it's not going to mix up the formula a whole lot as you get deeper into the game.  Sure you'll be able to use more skills due to having higher energy and more points to place down extra turrets and systems...  but most of those tools could be used at the start of the game as well,  just within limitations.   If I could pick one thing I wish this game had, it would be co-op support.  Sharing a universe with 2-16 friends could serve for some amazing lan or house hold family fun.  Luckily the mod community seems to be getting behind this game so at the very least the variety of things to do will be getting mixed up a lot.  If you're still on the fence of this game I'd say just keep checking back.  Look at what the devs and the mod community are up to.  There is already a decent amount to do here and it's just done well.   If I had to give it a 1-10 rating I'd say we have ourselves an 8.2 with the clear opportunity to become a 9-9.5 if they continue to add features.   If you're someone who enjoys smelling the flowers and doing assorted tasks with some grinding mechancis involved due to large credit costs to purchase anything substantial,  then this game is the game for you!Give me a thumbs up if you found this review useful.

												The game is fun, it's sort of a mix between X3(ship control, selling items) and Darkstar One(upgrading weapons, equipment and such). This game has some potential but right now it is still a bit lacking. Fun factor: You will have fun fighting and dodging enemy fire. Having troops board enemy ships and take them over. Looting dead ships. Seeing how different ships are and act. The joy of dragging a captured ship to a dock.Unfun factor: You are very much alone, yes you can hire mercs, up to two, but the only person you can talk to is the ship computer who in fact will only say anything to you do an action (move command, fire at will) or when an enemy teleports right to you. The world is pretty empty, NPC's are just sitting there really, and they tend not to do anything else unless an enemy happens to be around.The makers have stated they plan to add expansions which will lighten things up, but those things are in the future.  They also stated they have plans to change things up, shields will matter later on for boarding and such. Time will tell.I have put in 13 hours and so far feel a little worried. I ran most of my time in a Frigate capturing ships to sell. I even in fact captured a battleship by running back and forth between two stations to fill my troops and relaunch new boarding attacks.  It took very little time to level, and as well I fear I may never enjoy all the ships this game has to offer in the long run.So is it worth it?Positives: Somewhat fun, feels semi-polished, the devs are hard at work fixing bugs very fast, what seems like a bright future for a game.Negatives: World is full of things, but they might as well be boxes floating in space. No life really. It seems like the same type of AI as Minecraft. Seems a bit short so far even with Freeroam (world is open, no story).  I feel the game's price is sort of almost right at 25 bucks.

												There's already a million comparisons of this game to Eve, but I'll add another - It's a lot like Eve but with a personal story arc that concerns your character.Unlike Eve, the space combat is twitchy and fast-paced, and surprisingly deep.  You've got to keep on the vulnerable side of the enemy you're fighting, all the while keeping your vunlerable sides pointed away from his freinds.  There are a million ways you can outfit your ship and plenty of variety in ship types - how you outfit it matters, and the weapons you choose need to suit its strengths and suit how you will be piloting it to be effective.Not everything is perfect (I felt like the different factions were somewhat faceless, and felt like it was a little too easy to pass through hostile territory) but the small, indie studio that developed it is already planning on plenty of post-release changes.The game has clearly had a lot of loving care put into it, and is a definite recommend.  It's amazing already, and I'm fully confident it'll get even better.			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 totally scratches the Freelancer itch without all that pesky not-drinking-anything in outpost saloons.Bad News: I couldn't fight my way out of a paper bag in this game, though I could tag along with patrols and get credit for being there, even if I couldn't score a kill, myself.Good News The non-combat options in this game more than make up for my shoddy combat skillz. Between science, maintenence, ferry, taxi and smuggle missions, I've been able to eek out a living. With a cloaking device I can even operate in territories way above my skill level.I've not played any of the campaigns (but have 51 hours of play time, go figure) so I don't know how they pan out. Been resistent to trying them considering my slacking gunnery, even with way-overleveled guns.			"

												After 28 hours, I've finished SG2 on normal difficulty. I've mixed feelings about this game. Since I got it at a reduced price and it managed to enthral me long enough to finish it, I hesitantly recommend this game.  I'll give you a list of things that, in my opinion, are well done (from + to +++) or bad (from - to ---).Stability: +++ I've encountered not a single crash. Good work.Bugs: +There are some minor bugs but no show stopper. Most of the bugs are only slightly annoying or are gone once you restart.Graphics: ++Not cutting edge, but there are some nice visual effects that improve immersion. Audio: +Ok, but nothing eartshaking.Character development: -I didn't feel that there's anything that I really want to ""reach"" with my character, except maybe getting better ships. The skills are dull and consist mainly of ""tier 1 gives you +8% dmg"", ""tier 2 gives you 16% dmg"" and so on. HUD: --Bad HUD. You want to know what kind of ship you've just locked as a target? Well, better turn your giant Dreadnaught around and find out that it was just some tiny gunship that gets destroyed by your automatically firing canonns before you can take a look at it. You can't really scroll out while flying your ship, so that your view is basically reduced to what's in front of you.Aiming / Target selection in combat: ---They really dropped the ball here. You either enable automatic fire, which means that all your guns fire at will at a target of their chosing (no focus fire), or you take over manual control over your ship's weapons and try to hit your designated target. Unfortunately, this is so badly implemented that you will stick to auto fire 99% of the time.Missions: -You level up and get money from missions by activating the star map and click on a mission marker that has become available there. Missions are the entire content of the game. If you play the campaign, these mission markers may either be part of the main mission or they are a side mission. If you play in free mode (no campaign just pure exploration), there are no main mission markers. The side missions are repetitive as hell. Go there, kill that, finished. Go there, repair that, finished. Go there, take the item and bring it elsewhere, finished. Role playing / Character immersion: --Nope. No. There's none of that here, move along.Fights: +Fights are often balanced, sometimes not, but generally they are somewhat fun. Have a ""meh"" from me here. Traveling: --Pirates. Pirates, everywhere. Have you ever played an MMO where some frenzied rabbit may bite your horse and rip you out of travel mode so that you have to squish that little bug with one hit and then wait until you can enter travel mode again? Well, SG2 gives you some nostalgia here. Campaign: -The campaign is nothing special. You character is rather lethargic and just stumbles from one event into another. You can't make any choices either. The ending is rather unspectacular. I was like ""and now? that's all or what?"". There are no epic story fails, though. Replay value: --SG2's replay value is the same as the reeat value of a pizza.Customization options of your character and ship: +You can't customize your charakter except for his skills, but there are some nice options to personalize your ship, which is nice.Modifications: ++The fan base is strong in this one. There are some decent mods out there that give you new ship skins or that modify game values.If you can get SG2 for less than $15 and like the genre, go for it.			"

												Wow! Just Wow! I bought this game back when you could basically do a little mining and fly around attacking small craft. After coming back after so long, I am truly impressed in what they did with this game. I loved playing Eve, but not paying monthly subscribtions for months of mining, grinding, and training, only to get a Tengu and have it blown up in minutes by a swarm. Those days are over! I had always hoped for a single player game like this with a sandbox option. Hopefully, they might add co-op or being able to take over a space station and starting your empire, pirate kingdom, etc. They may have that, b8ut since I started playing the game I have been too busy playing to take the time to read the change docs. I even bought the DLC. I'm just so glad for the early access games. While I did buy a few early access lemons, games like SG 2 and 7 Days to Die have made the investments well worth the risks. Finally the type of space game that I've always wanted as opposed to the RTS type!  I feel the game is well balanced. I love the boarding option and the progression from miner to caputring ships to sell and hunting down ""bosses"" (bounty hunter). I get to the story line when I want to, as well as running side missions and other replayable missions (escort, assasination, etc) that pop up. The map is large and there are many factions. I can't wait to see what else they are going to do next!  A definite buy for space gamers!			"

												Not the best space sim out there, but a very good one. What it does best is it gives you a huge space to play with and float/fight/work/kill time/rush through/etc. at your own pace and style. For me that freedom and lack of restrictions on how to proceed gives it an edge.			"

												One of the best space simulation games I've seen to date. EVE Online was too complicated, BS Galactica too dated, ect.., but this game struck a special chord. It's devs are very active, taking player considerations seriously. The mods are pretty dang fun, it's cheaper than most other games of its type, you can fill a variety of roles in game, ect.. The only real con I can see with the game so far is it's single player exclusive. If multiplayer's eventually implemented, I can easily see this being the next big thing for online MMORPG space simulators.			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 + Secrets of Aethera DLC:Excellent sandbox space game, campaign missions are quite easy at first and then they aren't, you need a bigger ship. Which means credits.  Trading, pop-up missions, side missions, capturing ships and mining are your friends now.Once you get you fingers trained on flying it's a lot more fun...fly in hard and fast and then slow down to stay on the tail pipe of your target, watch out for the explosive radius of your own missiles.Trading/Mining could use some TLC. The small cargo space and low margins on items makes for a lot of trips for those playstyles to make a lot of credits. A dedicated mining ship would be a good idea, with maybe a compressor item or mining laser enhancement or something so that you can fit more than 1 ore in 1 cargo slot.The trading screens in the map could really use a mode to show best to/from, rather than a per-item best buy/sell, also remote buy/sell ala Eve would be great.But trading and mining isn't what this game is about. The real fun comes with capturing ships and running the various types of missions. Capturing takes a while to figure out, I suggest youtube and practise.  Basically, grapple, burn the hull down 2/3rds of the way, transport your troops and keep transporting them as long as you have troops. After you get the hang of it, you take every mission around your level just to try and capture another ship.The pop-up missions are rather generic, about 10 or so different types that I've found and they differ only in the difficulty of the enemies. Some are out-right free credits and XP (science, repair).The Side Missions are quite variable from the few I've done, more credits and XP and more difficult than the pop-ups.The Campaign Missions are similar to the Side Missions in reward and difficulty but advance the story-line.Exploring the map is a lot of fun, it's huge...also more areas to find capturable ships and missions. One downside, when you play windowed, if you focus off the game, it will pause. This is non-condusive to setting a long waypoint, maxing your engine power and doing something else on the other monitor. Very fast save/loads. The fights can be quite intense, the AI seems to be aggressive, but not stupid, it'll gang-tackle you quite happily. The auto-firing works great, but I'm not a fan of the way it keeps shifting targets to closest enemy as opposed to the target you've selected. I guess I have to learn manual firing.I suggest staying with the Tauris starter boat, pick a weapon type, level that type up  and stay with it for the first 20 levels or so. The gunboat is a paper-tiger, so you learn a lot about dodging, firing, and your equipment needs. Lot's of save and reloads figuring it out. ++Shield Boosters, Repair Nanobots, Hull Plates.66hrs, 8.5/10 and am still playing. It's not solo-Eve, but darn close.			"

												My first bit of advice is this, ignore the people who reviewed this with 2 hours or less in game, or even 5 hours or less in some cases.I've played EVE, the Wing Commander games, Star Citizen, and many other games in this genre.  Out of every game in my Steam library, this is the one that has most surprised me.  It surprised me because I hadn't heard much of it, and I got it at a very reasonable price.  It also has the polish of a game by a much larger developer, and depth galore.  Campaign is nothing super special, but there are so many side missions or freelance things, I don't see it as a big deal.  That said, I am pretty early in the campaign so I don't know how it ends up, could get better.I rate this as a must buy if it even looks remotely enjoyable to you.  Give it a bit of time for you to figure out the intracies, and for it to impress you.  Things might seem simple on the surface, but the game is actually just the right level of complexity.  I can't reccomend this game enough.			"

												This game is actually pretty damn sweet. If you enjoyed games like Freelancer or the X series, you will enjoy this without a doubt. It looks amazing, plays smoothly, has a big universe to explore and conquer, has staggering ship customization and upgrades, great trading, easy interface and decent tutorial so you feel comfortable playing it within 10 minutes. It's also surprisingly bug free, for a game that's still in beta, it doesn't crash, nothing. It misses a campaign (I think it will be added in a couple of weeks just in time for release), but even just the free roam mode is great fun. I also loved the idea of having different classes that you can choose with different abilities, some make your ship stronger while others buff your (future) fleet, along with a ton of perks that you can customize as you level up. Gives it a lot of replayability as you try different styles and approaches. Even the music's great. I honestly can't find anything to complain about, and that's pretty rare for m			"

								IN THIS GAME You can do missions where you smuggle nudie magazine through pirate filled wastlands full of direlect ships and then defend against said pirates who sent a scout who scanned your ship when you weren't looking and reported back to the pirates further ahead that you had said nudie magazines and siad pirates further ahead launch an ambush from behind a massive freighter wreck from a previous ambush and they take down your shields and breach your hull and send a landing party and thankfully your ship is full of Marines who you hired to protect the nudie magazines at the station where you got the nudie magazines and the pirate landing party is slaughtered and you use a special button to dedicate all available power to your engines and then you leave the pirates in the dust, swerving to avoid asteroids and massive dead ships as you make your way to a remote station where you are greated by friendlys and you dock at the station and sell your nudie magazines and repair your hull and use some extra money to hire an escort ship, so next time, the pirates won't be a problem. 10/10			"

For the price, I would say if you enjoyed any time with Starfleet, and being as fun as it is in early stage, it's well worth the $$ spent for the time I've already mined.I've not yet played the first iteration, but don't let it's low Metascore impact your opinion of the sequel.

So far I have...Missions / Trade / Exploration ( the universe is pretty huge and there are no jumpgates, you want to go somewhere be prepared to have a tea and fly it )Boarded and pirate who attacked me while mining. Stole their ship, towed it back to station, 60k profit w/ a hold full of ore as well. Enough to purchase some weapon and power grid upgrades & repair my own hull.Still mining, happily shooting rocks in a deep and immersive asteroid belt miles from any station ( the graphics are fantastic ) again unaffiliated scumbag smuggler drops my shield and attempts to hack my power grid. Fire a grappler, boost shields, send feedback up his signal to shut down his shields instead, steal everything on board, destroy his engines and leave him to die in the darkness.Ships are hugely expensive. Hatched a plan... equip a gunship w/ a cloak and heavy shielding. Observe trade routes and traffic to a wormhole. Wait for lost lamb transport indy with no escorts ( they are tough as nails and heavily armored ) ... decloak, target, fire a grappler, boost shields and tear their ship apart until they surrender, kill everyone on board, towed it to station under a salvage license since it was an independent, now it's mine. All repaired and with a new coat of paint & trade license ( my main job, trading is awesome and dynamic, you need smarts and a good memory of hundreds of stations / planets )Right now I'm flying across the universe in a heavily armored trade / transport ship carrying passengers, 2 vips and sipping a tea on autopilot. 100 thousand K to go, it's going to be a long flight. If anyone needs me I'll be in my cabin.All is quiet... for now.And this is alpha. Srsly.			"

								While i am at the early starting stages of the game i can say that it is thoroughly addictive and easily simplistic to pick up with the added availability of many tips.   I can see a comparison with ""SPORE"" with the aim to evolve by in this case feeding on rocks,asteroids and other ships. There are various mods to download from the STEAM workshop, including many ships from the star trek catalogue .... In short, while this game may not have the more realistic depth of the X series it has a charm and addictiveness that is rarely seen in games nowadays. "

								UPDATE: After lots and lots of play time, I've lost very little enthusiam and this has become my favorite game.If you find yourself missing Freelancer but wishing it was more robust in just about every measure (barring an in-cockpit view), this game is for you. There is a vast universe, seamlessy connected* so that you can fly between them without having to load at a ""waygate"" like almost every other space game out there. Sure there are gates and wormholes and all the other staples, but they're not necessary. The starter ship is gorgeous, and you can customize the look of your ship in small ways. Combat uses a lot of showy glowy beams that seem to trade off well against each other balance wise, short-ranged instabeams, blaster/plasma-beam-ish projectiles, glowy-trails-having missiles and so on. Your turrets don't just magically fire through your ships, so firing arcs are a concern, and multiple turrets with mismatched areas of defense are possible. You can enlist specialists in your crew who cost you extra expense but provide bonuses, in addition to an amazing range of customizations. You can reassign power between guns-engines-shields on the fly.It's currently an open-world, with promises of guided story plots to come. At the moment you can mine and take run-of-the-mill and short missions, kill this scan that ferry those. You can buy hunting licenses for different groups froim their enemies. The game needs longer more immersive plots, but the dev has already stated there's more to come int hat regard.There's the controls. There is a wide range of things you can do in this game, giving somewhat detailed commands to your fleet and crew, cloaking, grappling (best to shoot the enemies' guns off first), instructing your crew which guns to shoot off first. It is... daunting... looking at your control customization options. I recommend playthrough with the control defaults at first until you find which controls you will actually use best in your personal play style. You will be using just about every key on your keyboard make no mistake.That takes me to the tutorials. Just suffer through them they are awful annoying popups but informative. *this is beta and there's a slight hiccup when moving from grid to grid			"

												I'm enjoying my first few sessions of Starpoint Gemini 2. Very nice atmosphere - graphics, music and sound have all had some close attention paid to them. It seems nicely polished and generates a really good backdrop and environment to play in.There are some frustrating elements for me - the battles have me circling round and round trying to get the enemy in view and I'm not sure which of my weapons are firing, there doesn't seem to be a way to select weapons. maybe they're all firing, who knows :-) to be able to interact more with the weapons would be nice, i'm looking forward to uprgading mine but i want to see the difference that makes  - I don't know if the battle system is going to show that nicely? I think these games all struggle with the combat elements - this ons is still probably better than most.  another frustrating is the ships automatic pilot to waypoints seems a bit weird, it heads in the wrong direction sometimes.  thats not a biggie really.All in all, at this early stage I would give this an 8/10 and I recommend it to anyone looking for this type of game - a mix of exploring, upgrading, with some combat thrown in - a quieter game to have a session on when needing a break from the fps shooters etc...  its good!

								Starpoint Gemini 2 maybe an early access game right now but the game feels a lot more complete than a number of new releases. The game is best described as a tactical space simulator in an open universe. The game in early access has no story mission i have found yet but a lot of small missions, exploration,mining and combat. The combat is a joy once you get used to the tactical use of gun turrets and weapon usage. The game has some really interesting ship to ship combat that is easy to get the hang of. Graphics at this stage are  excellant. Ship models are good and the effects are nice and are a lot more polished than what you would think for a game not completed yet. Sound and music are good with a nice musical track (although limited just now but will be increased when ame is finished)Would i recommend this game. Hell yes even at this stage and i look forward to seeing the end product.One other interesting note is the developers are always on the forums answering our questions and listining to our input and shows how dedicated they are to both the project and to their customers.

												It brings back that good feeling of having the galaxy at your fingertips, like in Freelancer and Elite, without the insane complexity of X3 etc. I still feel like I'm just starting out and I've put in some hours allready. It is not the new & perfect game. Some mechanics need some tweaking or better explanation (Turrets, all power to engines, etc.) but you can generally customize your ship to do exactly what you want it to. In particular the open world / sandbox play works nicely.In general I'd recommend the game, but be mindful of what the game is and isn't. It is not the hugely ambitious world of X, but then again, it is much easier to pick up and play; it is relatively approachable, but complex enough that you'll spend the first half hour at least going 'Now what? How do I do this?'. It is worth muddling through, though, if you're interested in this type of game.			"

								Ok, first I want to say that overall, this is a fun game.  Even though it is in it's alpha phase, it still has a lot of fine points to keep me playing for the time being.  There is one point about this game that is going to kill it for me, but I'll get to that later.The graphics are well done.  I have several hours into it, and have yet to experience a graphical glitch.  The ship models are well done and the stations aren't bad to look at.The flight controls are a bit weird at first, but it really doesn't take much to get used to them.  The biggest gripe I have is that there is no first person view so you can't fly directly at something.  If you try, you actually fly over it.  Not that big of a deal and after you get used to it, it works out.  If you are flying mouse mode, there isn't enough dead space for level flight.  Your ship is always changing direction.  I ended up not utilizing the mouse mode and stuck with WASD.As it is still in Alpha phase there are only a few different types of missions to work on.  These are called Freelances.  They are usually quick and easy.  It looks like there will be several different types of missions put in later on, so this isn't a slight, just an observation.  Also, the money doesn't keep up with your pilot level.  I'm currently level 25 and still can't afford to buy another version of the same ship I'm currently in.  I should have been able to upgrade ships a while ago.  I'm sure with the advent of other missions, the money thing will probably work itself out.There needs to be more tutorials.  There needs to be something on Grappling and taking over ships.  Might be offered farther down the road.  Also on derelicts.  Try as I might, I can't figure them out.  I don't seem to get anything off of them.  I might not understand their mechanics, but since there is no tutorial on them, I don't know.Now for the part that breaks this game for me personally.  I do enjoy combat and exploration.  I've never been huge into trading or diplomacy.  However, I love games where I can create things.  Crafting is huge for me.  Starpoint Gemini 2 has these huge asteroid fields that if I spent years playing, I wouldn't be able to empty them out.  However, all you can do with them is shoot them for ore and then vendor it...for a very small price I might add.  There is nothing else to do with all of this ore.  Now, your saying...wait, it is still alpha, they might add it in later.  Well, I've read up in their forums and one of the developers has already stated that they don't plan on adding in any kind of crafting utility to the game.If I could put a station out in the fields, and have them manufacturing ship equipment, weapons & and ships themselves, this game would be one that I kept and played for years to come.  As it is, I'm going to get tired of shooting random encounters pretty quick.As a single player game, I need something that is going on in the background while I'm out exploring and building for the economy would be great.  Without this ability, the game gets stale, at least for me.For most people, this game will be great.  I know that a good majority of people don't care to craft anything.  For me, without it, it is a game breaker.			"

In the Starchart, when you click on a waypoint option, I think the font on the little options menu that pops up should be bigger by about double.

								It's early in development, so my view may change as game progresses.Up to now I really like this game.  It has a bit of everything that is loved by space game fans, and although not too complex fills the part nicely.It is 3rd person only, with the option of a turret view which allows rotation of your view around your ship.  This design has a really nice feel to it allowing for some good tactical combat.I would warn you that it is different than most, in the way things are controlled or handled, so a hour or two of getting to grips with these is needed, but then rewarded.The dev's are very active on the forums and do pick up on fans good ideas for the game, which is a bonus.I would say that it IS worth the risk of purchase, even in this early state is is fun to play.

I have encoutered minimal bugs like when I'm on the starmap, my cursor has to be a little bit off of what I'm actually trying to click on... sure it's annoying but this is only in alpha, and that is my main concern?? Very well done game I'm extremely excited to see this game evolve! Although I am glad I got it on sale, 15$ maybe 20$ would be a better price than what it is. I'm getting tired of seeing alphas and early access games near full price. It's an alpha for a reason. Aside from the high price this game is definitely on my recommendations list.Cheers!			"

								This is a ""first (actually second) impression""It's shaping up.I bought this game a while back, in my seemingly neverending search for a satisfactory Space game.There is a text-only tutorial that I never bothered with, so I can't comment on that. You can skip ahead without worries since you can reread it later on if you need to. Graphics are pretty decent, the ship designs I've seen so far are varied and cool for the most part.The biggest plus part so far, is that this game seems to focus more on capital ship warfare, rather than on fighters and small corvettes like many of its rivals.The interface is also good, albeit a bit unintuitive and at some times utterly unresponsive. Some keybinds don't seem to work and it still needs some visual or audio queues as to what you just did, there is no indication anywhere on your screen whether your weapons are set to free fire or not (at least none I can spot). It seems sandboxy enough so far, with content appearantly procedurally generated and catered to your ship and level.It's a diamond in the rough and clearly unfinished, but already playable enough for me, I will surely be spending some more time in this game than before.So if you have the money and can live with the flaws listed above, give this game a try.

								There are a lot of really good space sims out there, this is one of them.  But one thing that sets this game apart from those other games is this:  Noob friendliness.  This games UI and setup is so easy/simple that even someone who has never played any space sims before can get the hang of within an hour or so, and that's FAST.  The UI may be simple, but it's still got the same flexibility to let you do what you want.  Every time I start a new space sim, I always think 'oh god, i gotta relearn the whole system again.'  but not for this one.  Also, that map UI reminds me soo much of google chrome.  Currently, the gameplay is extremely fun even for not being complete.  One could hardly tell, except for the fact that skill, equipment, and fighter keybinds don't work--but that's okay, they're all just a mouseclick away via the easy to use UI.  I haven't played long enough though to figure out how deep this game is, whether or not the trading system is static or dynamic, or whether or not what you do affects prices.  I haven't played long enough to see whether or not the universe is 'alive' like in other games, but this is good enough for someone who wants to pick up their first space sim and not be overwhelmed.

								This game is fantastic, especially for an Alpha release.  Several things are still in the works, but it is a fine game as is.  Right now it is essentially a space sandbox.  I tend to play the role of pirate, or privateer, rather (I only attack the bad guys, but I'm always trying to board them and steal their ships so I can tow them back to a planet or space station and sell off their guns, then the ships themselves... seems to be pretty lucrative).  You'll love it when you get a big carrier with a bunch of fighter wings or bombers... it's awesome having a swarm of firepower surrounding you.  The game is massive and consists largely of traveling between planets and space stations (press B to boost your engines to full and enjoy the ride and the amazing scenery), doing sidequests, mining asteroids, or being a merchant or pirate or whatever suits your fancy.  There is currently no storyline or any story missions (but plenty of sidequests are available and constantly appearing), and a lot of things are currently non-functional (like the useable items... thankfully they are super valuable so I just sell them for lots of money), but with that being said, this game is amazing... I'm really looking forward to years of fun with this thing.			"

								Love this! Have not stopped playing it since I downloaded it. Shows a huge amount of promise in terms of gameplay; the visuals of the spaceflight scenery, ships, asteroid belts, stations and nebulae are brilliant and very atmospheric. Even the icons and equipment images are polished and impressive.There are the inevitable comparisons to games like Elite and X, but even in this early incarnation I feel that Starpoint Gemini has the capacity to surpass them; I haven't seen much of the trade mechanic yet, but have enjoyed myself immensely with the freelance missions and grappling enemy ships before boarding, capturing and selling them.Some other memorable moments so far are the sound of the engines powering up when you leave a station, or slicing up asteroids to mine ores.I also really like the dimensions in the game - the stations are big, but the planets are massive and I like that you can land on them. I'm about 20 hours in and have covered maybe a quarter of the map (and most of that was a fleeting visit).The gameplay gets sticky on my machine moving between sectors but  this is only the Alpha build and I imagine there is still a lot of coding spit-and-polish to come.My wishlist for the finished game would be to be able to reduce the number of turrets as well as increase them (have been a bit overly-optimistic with power management for my Myrmydon weaponry) and for alliance ships to stop shooting at my captured enemy vessels while I'm trying to drag them back to port.Highly recommended if you like space exploration/combat/trade games.

								A really interesting looking game. I like the controls, highly customisable, flying star-fighter style seems equally as easy turret-based capital ship combat( depends only on the style of ship, which can be better suited to either, which is exactly what it should be). HUD and contextual control panel pack a LOT of options and info into a simple, streamlined system. Graphically it's easy on the eye, won't praise it, but there's nothing I can think of that would need pointing out.The thing that would need tweaking is a detail, but impacts the game heavily, since it does with navigation: The waypoints do not say WHAT they point to on the map. Can't tell whether it's my active mission, accepted but not active or a completely new one. To be fixed ASAP, as going from point to point IS the game.The only other minor thing doesn't impact gameplay, but would make it a bit more interesting:*Refine the weapon mounting system. Grouping them together for ship sides is a good idea, but it would be good to have access to all single individual mounts anyway, also showing where they are on the ship, Star Wolves style (since they avoid fireing THROUGH the ship, which is as unexpected as it is brilliant), for enabling a more tactical loadout.*Connecting to the former, make the whole drydock/store/exchange window bigger and clearer. As it is now is not very intuitive and requires spending at least a few minutes just studying it to finally grasp what half the options actually are, much less taking advantage of them.In general, a good game even at this stage, just needs tweak and a good plot implemented. The latter would make a good game a great game.			"

								Starpoint Gemini 2 a sequel with lots of improvements, while keeping to the free form of the predecessor.This game feels as motivating as Freelancer with its extensive Universe to explore, dozens of ships, different ship classes and moddable loadouts.I did enjoy this game very much, it plays like a cross-over between freelancer (free to explore universe, dozens o ships) and the Star Trek Fleet Command titles (tactical fights, commanding capships).Whether you want to relax mining and trading, or engage in combat missions and piracy, this game will be worth its money.Did i mention you can capture enemy ships by boarding combat? You can!If it flies, it is there for the taking!As a captain your first and foremost crucial choice will be your class.You can either be a Commander, featuring buffs for your fleet, empowered strike craft, retaliatory attacks and defensive boosts.Or you can try to outgun the enemy by becoming a Gunner, who can specialize his offensive power by adding effects like disabling hits to his beam weapons, firing more shells with railguns, adding a higher refire rate to his high damaging plasma canons or boosting his heavy weaponry (schockwave cannons, missiles and torpedos).Last but not least the Engineer, a very versatile class with a lot of debuffs.Ever got tired of fast moving corvettes and gunboats dodging your railgun shots?Just place a Rift-Anomaly and slow them down, then hit 'em hard!Your second decision might be to specialize in a ship-category, as you can boost the efficiency of your ship by spending perk-points granted every 5 levels.What will be your choice? A fast and mobile light ship(gunboat/corvette)A merchantship, to rule the market with your cunning? (transport/freighter/freight-liner)A medium class mobile Warship? (Frigate/Destroyer/Cruiser)A vessel of personified dread? (Battleship/Dreadnought/Carrier)The Choice is yours to make, though it is not final,for you can reset your spent skill- and perk-points while being docked to a station or planet and try anew.Currently this game is in Beta Version 0.7, so there are still some issues and lacks:- ingame descriptions of skills and mechanics lack some love and proper english translation - the weapons need some diversity, e.g. faster firing weapons need a higher projectile speed to use them against fast moving targets (railguns and plasma weapons)- boarding combat is currently a numbers game, lacking the predecessors ingame videos and feedback- the missions currently are restricted to Assassination (search and destroy), delivery, repair of beacons and rescue missions- they need to put in some ships from the predecessors (prokhorov for example) to add even more diversity to the allready well modeled and animated ships- ship special abilities are not included yet (like a full frontal arc auto-canon for baeldor frigates or high-energy blasts for dreadnoughts)			"

								I haven't played this game much to start, but I can say that for the time I have spent playing it that it is the space sim game I have been looking for. I've tried a few other space sim and space sim-like games such as ""Galaxy on Fire 2"", ""SpaceForce: Rogue Universe"", and (sadly to say) ""X-Rebirth"" and in my opinion and experience I have found them to be full of frustration and disappointment for me.But Starpoint Gemini 2 feels very intuitive. I'm not lost trying to figure out the controls because the tutorial at the beginning clearly and plainly explains them. I've had few issues with bugs or glitches. Iv'e only had to make screen resolution/graphics adjustments in the game settings to prevent slight lag, which I'm sure that it will either be sorted out soon or my pc just needs an upgrade. I am also thankful for the leveling out command so that when I am upside down or slighlty off level I can let the game level me out without me screaming/freaking out. (Which in space, no one can hear you scream... lol!)Also, if you're looking for a good space sim game don't waste your time on other ones like X-Rebirth (especially not X-Rebirth!) because S♥♥♥♥lso has a reliable dev team. So it's not just because of the graphics, controls, etc. that makes the game great, but also because there is support. I've noticed that the devs for this game actually care about user input/feedback and work on the game updates in a timely manner which makes me want to play more and get invovled in the developing.This one is truly promising and fun to play as it is now. I am eager to see this game finished but not rushed and with lots of new options, features, and plenty of storyline/campaigns to play through.			"

								Tracked one of the most notorious pirates through out several star systems. Cloaked my ship, and carefully positioned myself right behind his engines. Then all at once I unleashed a volley of plasma, beams, and fusion torpedos. After crippling his ship, and his crew members, I launched a viral torpedo to further reduce his fighting force. I next beamed over my superior marine forces and collected the bounty on his head. With his ship a drift, I tractored it to the closest friendly base where I added his battleship to my garage. Now I fly around fighting these pirates in his old ship. Big thumps up for this beta game.			"

								As a long-standing fan of the sci-fi genre, I can say that this is the kind of game I've been looking for. It has everything that any space-fan would enjoy! Anomalies, planets, asteroids, nebulas, and tons more! You can trade, customize your starship, upgrade, and fight against pirates as well as enemy factions. The gameplay is unlike anything I've played before, in a good way, and makes it feel like it's ship-on-ship combat. Fighting in space is dynamic, involved, and intricate so it can be challenging at times but never too difficult. The variety of weapons you can add to your starship also helps to give the game a unique feel in combat. The game has the look and expanse of Eve while remaining a single-player only game. Finally, it is workshop/mod friendly! Personally, I like to cross-over different franchises into my games so it's really cool to see a Federation Starship flying around space and using weapons from Star Trek as a way to create a personalized and awesome experience. Definitely would recommend to any sci-fi fan. Better than a lot of AAA titles I've bought. Keep up the good work!			"

For the price, I would say if you enjoyed any time with Starfleet, and being as fun as it is in early stage, it's well worth the $$ spent for the time I've already mined.I've not yet played the first iteration, but don't let it's low Metascore impact your opinion of the sequel.

												My first bit of advice is this, ignore the people who reviewed this with 2 hours or less in game, or even 5 hours or less in some cases.I've played EVE, the Wing Commander games, Star Citizen, and many other games in this genre.  Out of every game in my Steam library, this is the one that has most surprised me.  It surprised me because I hadn't heard much of it, and I got it at a very reasonable price.  It also has the polish of a game by a much larger developer, and depth galore.  Campaign is nothing super special, but there are so many side missions or freelance things, I don't see it as a big deal.  That said, I am pretty early in the campaign so I don't know how it ends up, could get better.I rate this as a must buy if it even looks remotely enjoyable to you.  Give it a bit of time for you to figure out the intracies, and for it to impress you.  Things might seem simple on the surface, but the game is actually just the right level of complexity.  I can't reccomend this game enough.			"

												This game is actually pretty damn sweet. If you enjoyed games like Freelancer or the X series, you will enjoy this without a doubt. It looks amazing, plays smoothly, has a big universe to explore and conquer, has staggering ship customization and upgrades, great trading, easy interface and decent tutorial so you feel comfortable playing it within 10 minutes. It's also surprisingly bug free, for a game that's still in beta, it doesn't crash, nothing. It misses a campaign (I think it will be added in a couple of weeks just in time for release), but even just the free roam mode is great fun. I also loved the idea of having different classes that you can choose with different abilities, some make your ship stronger while others buff your (future) fleet, along with a ton of perks that you can customize as you level up. Gives it a lot of replayability as you try different styles and approaches. Even the music's great. I honestly can't find anything to complain about, and that's pretty rare for m			"

It's devs are very active, taking player considerations seriously. The mods are pretty dang fun, it's cheaper than most other games of its type, you can fill a variety of roles in game, ect.. The only real con I can see with the game so far is it's single player exclusive. If multiplayer's eventually implemented, I can easily see this being the next big thing for online MMORPG space simulators.			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 + Secrets of Aethera DLC:Excellent sandbox space game, campaign missions are quite easy at first and then they aren't, you need a bigger ship. Which means credits.  Trading, pop-up missions, side missions, capturing ships and mining are your friends now.Once you get you fingers trained on flying it's a lot more fun...fly in hard and fast and then slow down to stay on the tail pipe of your target, watch out for the explosive radius of your own missiles.Trading/Mining could use some TLC. The small cargo space and low margins on items makes for a lot of trips for those playstyles to make a lot of credits. A dedicated mining ship would be a good idea, with maybe a compressor item or mining laser enhancement or something so that you can fit more than 1 ore in 1 cargo slot.The trading screens in the map could really use a mode to show best to/from, rather than a per-item best buy/sell, also remote buy/sell ala Eve would be great.But trading and mining isn't what this game is about. The real fun comes with capturing ships and running the various types of missions. Capturing takes a while to figure out, I suggest youtube and practise.  Basically, grapple, burn the hull down 2/3rds of the way, transport your troops and keep transporting them as long as you have troops. After you get the hang of it, you take every mission around your level just to try and capture another ship.The pop-up missions are rather generic, about 10 or so different types that I've found and they differ only in the difficulty of the enemies. Some are out-right free credits and XP (science, repair).The Side Missions are quite variable from the few I've done, more credits and XP and more difficult than the pop-ups.The Campaign Missions are similar to the Side Missions in reward and difficulty but advance the story-line.Exploring the map is a lot of fun, it's huge...also more areas to find capturable ships and missions. One downside, when you play windowed, if you focus off the game, it will pause. This is non-condusive to setting a long waypoint, maxing your engine power and doing something else on the other monitor. Very fast save/loads. The fights can be quite intense, the AI seems to be aggressive, but not stupid, it'll gang-tackle you quite happily. The auto-firing works great, but I'm not a fan of the way it keeps shifting targets to closest enemy as opposed to the target you've selected. I guess I have to learn manual firing.I suggest staying with the Tauris starter boat, pick a weapon type, level that type up  and stay with it for the first 20 levels or so. The gunboat is a paper-tiger, so you learn a lot about dodging, firing, and your equipment needs. Lot's of save and reloads figuring it out. ++Shield Boosters, Repair Nanobots, Hull Plates.66hrs, 8.5/10 and am still playing. It's not solo-Eve, but darn close.			"

												I love this game, I used to play EVE Online and other space sims like the X series, Elite dangerous etc this is a real gem. I have no idea why I did not buy it sooner even though not many campaigns are out (you only have the option of free roam or campaign with out mods I assume) the game has so much to do in it. I thought EVE had a ton of factions and corps but this game I swear theres at least like 40 factions and the idea of having a small fleet is amazing. Its a must buy for eve players.			"

												Campaign done, here's *thoughts*.Good:  To start off with, the music in SG2 is pretty great.  That's the first thing that hits me, and it's always good whenever I've booted the game.  A bit more variety would be nice too, after a while of free-roaming, it might get a little stale, but that goes for most games, really.Bad:  The dialog and cutscenes are terrible.  No, really REALLY terrible.  The dialog is cliche, and *hideously* over-acted.  And those accents?  AND NO SKIP??  And the game doesn't really pause during these tedious, cliche, dragging, unskippable cutscenes.  I've seen better cutscenes in pretty much any other game.Good:  Ships.  Mostly.  They're all quite recognizable, and have a lot of variety.  Once you know the ships, you can see a silhouette of most of them from most angles, and be able to ID the specific ship, or at least class.  Nexus ships a couple others in particular are EASY to spot.  Transports less so, but their class is obvious, so no matter.Bad:  Firing arcs.  These are SPACE ships, they should have minimal blind spots.  They are not floating in an ocean, they need coverage above and below.Bad:  There is a single ""best"" weapon, DPS-wise?  The stats show that, anyway.  Beams tickle, the only NPC weapons that seem to DO anything are rails and plasma.  This balance state made it out of early access?Bad:  Map and space design.  Freelancer got this right, and they had space with ""too much"" stuff in it.  The SG2 single solar system is both incredibly too small and insanely crowded.  It would be fine for say, underwater on an ocean planet, but for ""outer space"" it's just crowded.  And the ""movement"" field for dust floating past makes it feel like a fish tank with a broken filter and a bunch of pooping fish.Space Engineers and EVE and to a lesser extent Freelancer made the game FEEL spacious.  SG2 is a lot of LARGE factions crammed into a small fish tank with a bunch of stuff floating in the water.Bad:  I finally managed to get a ST-drive, yay!  ...Only to find that it doesn't actually work?  *All* the things should be working before the EA tag comes off.  At least implemented in some state.			"

												Once upon a time I played a 2D game called ""Escape Velocity"", a game about being a space guy with a ship, going around the galaxy doing things for money and getting involved in various shenanigens.  It was very open, and it instantly made you feel like you weren't just an actor in a story, but a person in a universe.  Maybe you were some poor shlub with a cheap ship just taking whatever work you could get to make a buck, often risking your neck in the process or maybe eventually you were the coolguy captain with a beastly ship deciding the fate of whatever chunk of space you ended up in.  Either way you would be involved in cool space battles, or running in a panic from a situation you couldn't handle, or spending time carefully picking upgrades for your ship, or even buying a whole new ship ( or dreaming about buying a giant really expensive ship ).Starpoint Gemini 2 is the 3D version of that experience.

												Game managed to get my attention for over 50 hours, however in the end it got a tad monotonous and in the end found it to become rather boring for me. It's not to say this is a bad game. I guess the replayability and scope of what you could do got a tad monotonous in the end.For those who want to fly around shooting up ships, defend stations from attack, upgrade to increasingly better ships which you can customize, it's a good game to have. Graphically it was average to above average for me. At the end of the day, I think there were just many other games out there which drew my interest away from this. 5.5/10			"

												9/10 This game is a total an amazing space simulator. You start off with a tiny little gunship and move up to commanding Dreadnaughts and Carriers. You can command a mini fleet of 2 other warships. The AI is decent, storyline is phenomenal, gameplay is great! I did not feel like there was any grind at all in this game, making money and moving on to the next level and ship was fast and easy. Game was very intuitive with a very helpful UI, biggest complaint is the blech voiceacting and the horrific accents. Other then that the devs are super responsive and made a great game. I own almost 200 games and rarely give out reviews, when I do I either loved the game or hated the heck out of it. I loved this game and if you enjoyed playing Freelancer, Wing Commander Series including Privateer, this is like those games except on crack.			"

								This game is amazingly developed! I dont think i have another space i'd rather play, it gets alot of praise from me for all that its striving to be and all that it has become. Fans of major space games like the X series, EVE, and Freelancer will really find great potential in this game. If you love space games, rpg's and shooting stuff this game is worth looking into.I give this game a 10/10pros to me for this early access are easy to use controls, randomly generated side missions, gamepad support, amazing backgrounds and visuals, assortment of ships, skills and perks, and lastly a developement team that is truely dedicated to bringing an amazing game to its community.The only con would be that the map is not large enough to contain this much awesome.

												I love this game but I am tired of games that have ""many ways to make money"" but only one that is effective.Ship that can hold 100 cargo:   Try being a trader at about a 20% return. What this means is if you buy something at 80 and sell at 100 you make 20. You can hold 100 things so you make a total of $2,000   Go mining. Best thing I found to mine sells for 900, get 100. 900x100=$90,000. This takes a lot of time   Go kill guys and loot them for random amounts so lets just say you only save the items worth 2,000+ so call it $100,000 but this takes a lot of time OR   Start the game and as soon as you have control of your ship hang out around a space station and board the weakest ship you can find. Then sell that ship at the space station for $400,000+ depending on the ship.... takes 5-10 minutes or less..... Late game is even worse as you will be selling ships for millions.			"

								pros:great ship designs, backgrounds and tunes. no really, the work put into the lighting etc is excellent and for a graphics junkie like me its was stunning.the variation in weapons and system additions is quite impressive for an alpha game as theres plenty to try out (if you can earn the credits)....the controls were easy to get to grips with and the learning curve isnt all that steep, more like a shallow bowl then the eiffel tower.i liked the ability to select missions from the system map as it saved soooo much time with reagrds to the: fly here > dock > mission select > fly there > kill whatever > done.  a novel and great idea and adds more of a flow to the game.mining is ok if thats your thing, point shoot collect as normal, however i couldnt find any indication of whether the rocks i were shooting were full of good stuff or crap...cons:couldnt work out if the shield was full coverage or sectional as in the previous gemini game as angling different sides of the ship would stop hull depletion, well sometimes not everytime. got quite confused.some enemies get stuck in space and dont move apart from shooting back, for some reason this makes them invulnerable too, so you die.currently no save feature in the game options, limited auto save though.combat, and this is my main gripe as its a space combat sim, theres no strafe or reverse!!  if you get to close to an object you have to bounce off it to turn around. increasing distance from targets means flying away from them all the while theyre pounding your ship. avoiding enemy fire is also very hard to do, spinning in a circle helps but only at range as the AI will fire at your current location almost without fail. however up close it just becomes a brawl between either who has the most energy or shield power...the main thing lacking is the fact theres no strafe (moving on the same access from left to right, up and down) the ability to dodge fire is essential in any fight but sadly gemini 2 does not provide this ability. in essence the fighter fights become nothing more then lancing, flying at each other trying to hit the enemy until you are in close, see above as to why this is bad... i suppose constantly changing the power distribution from shields to weapons to speed could help and some peeps will like that but i prefer flying by the seat of my pants and dodging for that true dogfighter feeling.furthermore, i loved the beam weapons, very powerful with exceptional rangedownsides, very power hungry and can empty your charge in seconds plus theres no zoom feature so no way of knowing if your shots are hitting the target until the enemies hull depletes and as previously stated power to the weapons depletes fast!!the only bug ive encountered so far was when the game freezes mid flight, not annoying yet as reminisent to PS1 games and their ""loading next area"" moments.overall for an alpha its quite enjoyable, very straight forward missions and great visuals.

								I am using the gunner class freeroaming the map which is pretty big , i like to bounty hunt those big marks for the credit pay outs.Combat has a very usefull auto fire or you can choose to manual fire, if you wish you can order fire on the systems of the target or just general hits.Favourite ship class is  the destroyer's but i'm currently using a carrier usefull for exploring when things get heavy launch the fighters.I honestly think this game has some real potential and have really enjoyed what they have done so far i look forward to them making the single player aspects.The market and trading and ultra silly cost of travelling the trade lanes needs a good sorting though but i'm sure they will iron out those minor things.Hint use T-Drives to jump to get to destinations.Found a pass that makes using the trade gates free to use anywhere very handy for trading i must have missed this on my first character it cost 250k credits but you will make it back eventually.Flight consists of mouse controll and keyboard activated specials allthough most of the special can be activated via the middle mouse  button, graphically it reminds me of freelancer space backgrounds. And it has some nice customization you can do to personlise your ship with unique colours and markings and abillity to name your ship.Overall i have to say i would recommend and seriously look forward to the up comming content  and i'm sure this game will give you plenty of hours of solid fun , just like freelancer did !Also there is an active mod community and the Devs seem active, these are promising signs for life beyond the single player mode and game life in the  long run.

It may take a little while to get into but there's plenty plenty of exploring, missions, ships, weapons and upgrades and also Workshop support.I haven't looked into the campaign much since the freeroam mode interested me more, but it seems to just be freeroam with story missions.The freeroam missions are a little samey after a while but there's enough variety of mission types for you to choose to be a pacifist or a full on fighter.Would recommend this if you like open world space sims, with factions and a good variety of ship classes and ships.

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is hours of constant enjoyment. I've been wanting a great space simulator for years and this fills that gap. Space combat ranges from you being overwhelmingly powerful and slaughtering a weaker enemy convoy, to suddenly being completely outmatched as hordes of enemy fleets warp in. You'll go from shifting your power-flow to fully charge your weapons; unleashing torrents of weapon-fire and watching enemy ships violently explode, to frantically diverting power to your shields and engines, cutting power from your weapon-batteries to overcharge your engines and jettison yourself free from the firestorm. The space combat, environment, and ships are all wonderful and deserve high praise. The only downfall is the narrative in the story mode. My only noted negative is that the plot dialogue is very poorly written: conversations are written with very simplistic wording, adding unnecessary filler dialogue in the middle of a conversation. The characters have no expression and sitting through the dialogue moments are frustrating to even hear the characters speak. All the character interactions are not written as real conversations, monologues occur at inappropriate times. A complete re-writing of the entire game's plot narrative (by someone with writing experience) would make the game perfect. 8.5/10			"

								Edit: So here we are after full release.In all honesty, the story is not presented in a manner I really find easily accessable, which is too bad but survivable. Besides that, everything I was told would be in this game is here, and all the fun I saw coming back in EA is also here. This is early access done right.In case you haven't read any other reviews, the game is very similar to EVE or X3 in sandbox mode. In story mode it feels quite a bit more linear, but as I said, this is simply because the method of presentation is just not my style, and you may find it's exactly what you like.Still, lots of fun, lots of freedom, and lots of beautiful, beautiful space in which to make your own story. Good use of your money if you like spaceship combat/trader/adventure sims.Original reviews:Even in beta, this is a good game. Not only is the game very playable, but the graphics are good and I personally find even the beta to be more stable and friendly to my recommended-spec rig than many full releases of other games I've played. Great forum community too and the devs are very open to feedback. There is not quite enough to do yet for freeroam to be worth $30,  but if you are reading this after the full release, then you should buy this!EDIT:Worth noting that the devs are so active on this that right now, only a few weeks after writing the initial review, enough stuff has been finalized or added to the current beta to probably make it worth your $30. Get on it!			"

Early Access Review
								This game is amazingly developed! I dont think i have another space i'd rather play, it gets alot of praise from me for all that its striving to be and all that it has become. Fans of major space games like the X series, EVE, and Freelancer will really find great potential in this game. If you love space games, rpg's and shooting stuff this game is worth looking into.I give this game a 10/10pros to me for this early access are easy to use controls, randomly generated side missions, gamepad support, amazing backgrounds and visuals, assortment of ships, skills and perks, and lastly a developement team that is truely dedicated to bringing an amazing game to its community.The only con would be that the map is not large enough to contain this much awesome.

												I love this game but I am tired of games that have ""many ways to make money"" but only one that is effective.Ship that can hold 100 cargo:   Try being a trader at about a 20% return. What this means is if you buy something at 80 and sell at 100 you make 20. You can hold 100 things so you make a total of $2,000   Go mining. Best thing I found to mine sells for 900, get 100. 900x100=$90,000. This takes a lot of time   Go kill guys and loot them for random amounts so lets just say you only save the items worth 2,000+ so call it $100,000 but this takes a lot of time OR   Start the game and as soon as you have control of your ship hang out around a space station and board the weakest ship you can find. Then sell that ship at the space station for $400,000+ depending on the ship.... takes 5-10 minutes or less..... Late game is even worse as you will be selling ships for millions.			"

												I'm going to start this review by being negative. This is not to savage the work that Little Green Men did on this game, but rather to emphasize the positive bits later.""Starpoint Gemini 2"" has some pretty rough areas. The campaign, framed through (sometimes yawn-inducing) text boxes and uneven voice-acting, didn't connect with me very well. There's an interesting twist here and there, but I just couldn't manage to care that much about what was going on. The necessary ""gloss-n-polish"" doesn't exist, especially with the game dialogue writers having a strange aversion to using the word ""the.""The game's difficulty curve is lumpy and strange, with the procedural mission generation apparently taking into account your level, but not what ship you have. This is also aggravated by a lack of mission information. Especially with the campaign, you don't know that much about what you're heading into. It's possible to get to a point where you just ""hit a wall,"" and get thrown into an engagment that you simply can't win without (at least) having gotten into the next class of ship. There's nothing wrong with this if you have some sort of warning, but for it to happen suddenly and with no advance notice is a kind of ""fake difficulty"" that I dislike.(I can appreciate a game that's not interested in hand-holding, but there's also a point where it all turns into sloppy experience design. ""Freelancer"" got this right by walling you off from taking the next campaign mission if you didn't have the prerequisites. ""SG2"" gets it wrong by basically telling you nothing aside from the story's flavortext. I simply don't equate legitimate game challenge with failing to communicate effectively.)I finally got to the point where seeing what happened next in the story was insufficient incentive to work my way up to a more durable spacecraft.But here's the thing - the above happened more than once. This is where things go positive; That I got pulled back into the experience is a testimony to just how well the basic gameplay loop was crafted.What the developers really managed to do beautifully is to create an addicting ""travel, do, upgrade, repeat"" cycle that keeps dragging you back in. The space you fly through is nicely crafted, with a sense of scale that is large without having interminable length between interesting features. The combat is generally satisfying (as long as you're not in a situation where it's overwhelming), and the other game mechanics manage to be pretty deep without being clunky or hard to get your mind around. Other free-roaming space games give you all kinds of controls, and then those controls don't behave consistently (or at all) as you expect. This title, on the other hand, is very solid in terms of behaving intelligently when you give commands.If Little Green Men Games built a sequel that was basically the same core mechanics, but with a far more refined mission (both campaign and procedural) experience, they would be in the same league as ""Freelancer."" The foundation is there - it just needs to be built upon. "

												A ""Must have"" for any Space Sim fan, SPG2 manage to deliver that ""freelanceresque"" feeling I've been looking for since... well FL itself. The game still have some things to be ironed out, like ship and weapon balance, trade and mining, and some minor bugs, but the devs are very active and truly listening to the community feedback. With some tweaks here and there this game could be a true successor to FL.You'll get sucked in by the wonderful surroundings, the ambient music, and the attention and love the small team of devs is putting into the game.If you loved Freelancer, you'll love Starpoint Gemini 2.

												i love flying around in space with no loads, but why cant we be in a solar system with a star in the middle and planets going around it, as far as we know thats how all solar systems work, this seems like just random rogue planets totally static in space. minor complaint tho its a great game already and its not even got main missions or even side missions but freelancing is what i wanna do anyway so im loving it, flying between planets and space stations, i just wish the map was the size of the actual universe... is that too much to ask? :)   for me its been a hit amongst a series of bad purchases, its really all im playing right now. i got it for 33% off and it was def worth that for me.   Edit: looks like it is more of a solar system than it looked like early on, the suns help. would be great to get the whole thing spinning, newtonian? capurnican? you know what i mean. maybe for starpoint gemini 3.

												I have been looking for a game to scratch the itch that Privateer left me with years ago.  This game takes me back to my fond memories of the open world joy that I love.  After trying the X series, Eve, and countless others I must say this one has been my favorite.  Its clean and easy to play but with enough complexity to keep things interesting for a while.I am looking forward to the game perhaps expanding in the future and going away from some of the predictability that i've noticed at 20+ hours of play.  Its nice and satisfying to have a game that i've purchased and feel like I got my money's worth.			"

												I bought this game during a Steam sale not expecting too much of it, but it's had me hooked for weeks now. It's fun to play and offers you a lot of things to do and ways to play. For instance, you can focus on the story, pirating, freelancing or trade goods that you either buy legally or gain by looting other ships. You can even specialize in mining asteroids and gasclouds and sell the gains. Or do all of the above!The game gets updated regularly and now has a very extensive tutorial library to help new players get started. You're able to customize your ship's weapon loadout and, to a certain level, it's color and decals.The only things I've noticed so far that could be improved is the voice acting in the storyline (which is pretty hilarious at times) and weapon impact effects. The latter look really poorly done compared to the sleek and smooth ship designs, explosions and absolutely beautiful galaxy you travel through.Oh, and the main menu music alone could have made me buy this game, just thought I'd mention that too.

												Bought this game in Early Access ~3 years ago.  Been playing it off an on.  I doubt I'll ever get over 200 hours but that doesn't mean I don't like the game.  It's amazing seeing how barebones it was back then come to life - as in, freelance missions gave you like 1000 credits and a few dozen XP. Half of the interface was useless and many things were still placeholders.  It's neat to come across a large battle and swoop in to help or to loot.Quick list of pros/cons+Beautiful environment+Living world+SPACESHIPS!+SPACESTATIONS!+Many ways to get money/XP-I have zero interest in the Campaign (don't let that sway you; just a personal preference)-In sandbox mode, it doesn't feel as though you're a big part of the solar system, which makes sense. I guess what I was looking for in this game won't be realized until Starpoint Gemini: Warlords.-Damn PTE disrupting pirates.-A few things are underexplained.-Ship size difference is not noticeable enough and was a complaint since Early Access.

												Finally, a game that scratches my decade-long Freelancer itch.But first, a disclaimer. While no longer an Early Access title, Starpoint Gemini 2 - as of October 2014 - is not quite the finished article. The game still has a number of items turned off in the options menu. Certain gameplay features seem to be half-finished, and the AI does not seem to be taking advantage of all the tools available in combat. In fact, many newcomers are bound to be turned off by the obtuse UI design and the text-heavy, non-interactive tutorials that spit out seemingly unending streams of text on things they have no idea about.Get past the initial frustrations, however, and you will find an absolute gem of a timesink. SG2 nails the three key elements of a good space sim: simple controls, a massive universe full of activities, and a million paths to success on your own terms. Starting off in a tiny gunship and a poorly-voiced campaign mission, you are quickly set loose and given freedom to roam the absolutely gigantic map to mine, trade, explore and fight to your heart's content. Veteran X players may be disappointed by the comparatively static world, limited fleet building options and inability to set up your own industrial empire in the stars, but everyone else should be more than satisfied with the wealth of choices at hand. This is more than worth it at full price, and absolutely unmissable in a sale.			"

												This game is fun for a little while but there's so little variation it gets very tedious, which is a shame becuase the game mechanics are good.Cons:There are three quests you can do: 1)Go here and kill these guys.2)Go here and scan this anomaly.3)Go here and take stuff over there.In order to make money you can either grind for days ferrying junk around, or buy a few upgrades for your crew and start hijacking enemy ships.  The former will take hours before you can buy your next ship, the latter will take minutes.  Rinse and repeat and winthin one afternoon you have the biggest, baddest ship with all the best hardware.There's no variation across the map: each sector feels identical.  I guess in real life the universe is very homogenous but you probably shouldn't use WMAP as your basis for a space RPG.The voice acting is pretty dull.  You can tell the actors aren't at all enthused by the story and nor was I.Pros:You can adjust the power balance of your shelds, weapons and engines, giving you a more hands on approach to aggresion, defence and running away.Each weapon and shield module has its own power and can be drained if over taxed during a fight, forcing you to keep manouvering to keep your better charged side towards the enemy.  This makes the big lumbering ships more interesting to play.You can take your unstoppable death machine, paint it shiny pink and name it ""Winnie the Pooh"".Summary:The game world is too big and too bland.  If the devs had put the effort into writing a better story and varying the world rather than inflating it, this game could be great.  Otherwise it feels more like work than fun.			"

												As much as I want to like this game, I cannot.  Plagued with bugs that make it completely unplayable on half of my systems, I regret spending the money on this.  Windowed mode made it so I can't select menu items and had to delete the config file.  Attempting to turn on the gamepad support for my wired 360 controller made it completely impossible for me to actually select a menu item to start a game change settings, or even exit the game, so I had to alt+f4 out of the game.  The games graphics settings are ridiculous.  My systems all far outpace the requirements for this game, but only a couple of them will actually run the game smoothly.  I won't say there are better games out there that have the same feel as the first Starpoint Gemini, a game I love to play, but this game was just a disappointment and buggy mess.  Iceberg should be ashamed of releasing this game in this state.			"

												What i liked:- Multiple options for combat (capture, shoot them up, cloaked assisn)- Vast universe with multiple factions- Many interesting travel options (jumpgates, gravity anomalies, wormholes, speed boosters and jumpdrive)What i disliked:- Poor storyline and terrible voiceacting- Horrid combat balance based on owned ship (if you have a tiny gunship and upgrade to a corvette or a frigate, suddenly all the enemies upgrade equally and you get blasted to smitherines in a matter of seconds)- Enemy difficulty based on player level (why on earth would i take a +xp perk - if i want increased difficulty i just do so in the option menu)- Due to scaling enemies almost instantly have many more troops in their ship than you can hope to send, which makes the troop capture option obsolete- Sinle use boost.. make them cost more (-> multiuse with cooldown) and dont make me run around half the universe looking for the ones i use- Class based skills - useless at best, let me at least replace them with usable items (boosts)SummaryI might give this game a thumbs up once balancing issues have been adressed and class skills make a difference.

												This is my methadone to keep me going until Star Citizen is out.TLDR: It's very relaxing and enjoyable to roam around popping pirate ships, and scooping up their loot while exploring each hex.Theres some nice progression with levels earning you skills and perks to your character.  Meanwhile spend that ill gotten cash to upgrade ship systems, buy fancier guns, and stock up on consumables to give your ship an edge in a fight, or i suppose help miners in their tedious rock popping. Hire troops for the wetwork, bridge officers for passive bonuses, and later on mercenary captains to back you up in a fight. Remember, it's OK to leave them to die.  Ultimately earn enough (or take over!) that fancy new ship you've been eying. There are also purchasable licenses for financial perks like earning extra credits when killing certain factions or cheaper goods from a certain corporation, even passive credits per month so you can sit around and do squat and still earn money just like the one percenter you are.Exploration stays enjoyable by providing several modes of travel.  Pay to use an established warp gate (there's a way to make a one time license purchase to make them free though), or risk some damage and redshirt lives by using wormholes.  There's also these odd green bands of gravitational anomolies than can pull you in and whip you across several sectors very quickly, and finally the convenience of a consumable that will jump you a limited distance but can go from anywhere to any place you've already explored (and have enough drives to reach). It's also financially useful as the more stations you find, the better options you'll have to buy low and sell high with a decent variety of trade goods, some of them illicit in certain regions.I wish the different parts of space were more varied, but at least it's all uniformly pretty with nebulas, asteroid fields, ice asteroids, and clouds of floating junk (all mineable if you're into that sort of thing) to add some variety. There are scannable anomolies, though only a few types and they all just do some sort of passive thing to surrounding space like scramble sensors or block teleporters. Scanning them down will get rid of the field, and earn some xp and credits if its a mission, otherwise they are ignorable.  Some of the more unique stations are very beautiful, like the Spire, but most of the space stuff is pretty samey.Combat is  pretty simplistic you can even (and its recommended) set your turrets to autofire and concentrate on turning your best shields towards the light show. I wish the different guns and damage types were a little more varied. Heavy weapons have limted ammo but help speed things up, and there are some other consumables that can be deployed to help increase offense or survivability.  Spice things up by locking your grappling array on a wounded ship and teleporting over boarding parties of expendable no name grunts who throw their lives away so you can get a big payday.  If you're lucky and manage to successfully take over a ship you get to loot it far more effectively that picking through its wreckage, then tow it to the nearest dock to either add to your stable or sell off. Remember to keep the redshirts stocked every time you come back to port. Out in the stars are a bunch of named elites with bounty's on their heads and suprisingly deadly offensive capabilities to test your mettle. Currently theres no real story, and a very limited number of missions that just help earn credits while doing the things you're already doing, but the foundation that is there is solid and fun, and surprisingly well polished for an early access title.

												""Full PTE ahead! Oh wait, Captain there's something wrong..""Honestly, I like it. It's a decent game, it has a strong core and does have entertaining values inside of it. It's pretty, runs well on my AMD machine, and keeps you at least somewhat busy. However, there are some very odd issues and difficulties I have with the game, I'll list them below.Game is too light; When I say this, I mean that the game is not that deep. The statistics for ships is relegated to a few simple stats (such as hull, cargo and crew). I feel that if I'm going to be driving around a big ship, I'd wanna know more about what's going on with it's internal systems. What makes ship A better than ship B? Well look at hull, cargo and troop capacity. That's it. Where's my statistics? Scaling for ship size; This is actually a big complaint. The ships don't look..big. They don't have imposing statures or good camera angles. They don't refelct how big (or small) they actually are. I have a small gunship and I'll go past ships marked as frigates or destroyer and I can't tell a size difference. That makes no sense to me. Sure, if I get within ""I'll melt you with point blank lasers range"" I'll notice a very small difference, but otherwise it's hard to tell. Reminds me of Star Trek (the show).Lots of loot, nothing to do with it; There's a plethora of loot in the game. Computers, drugs, minerals and ores. ALL YOU CAN DO IS SELL THEM. You can't craft, you can't allocate them for energy on the ship, they are just fluff. They don't have any real impact on the game other than that they can be sold (and what's worse, caputring enemy ships is far more benificial). I wish there was an in depth crafting system, something. Notifications; The game does not notify you when you pick up loot, meaning, that when I loot a ship with the ""auto loot"" function, it does not tell me what I got! I have to go into my menues and see what was put in. A prime example of how this is bad. I looted a big ship once, got an AMAZING missle system. I didn't know I had it, it never notified me. So I spent 250,000 credits on a missle system (worse by the way) and then, while equping it, realized I had the other one. Bye bye money! Camera angles; Not dynamic, not good. No cockpit view. Sadface.No real interaction with the universe; I will have to state, this is one of my biggest issues. Doing freelance quests gives you no satisfaction. When I'm picking up a VIP to transport, no chat initiates. It's a simple grab and go. Even the quest text is shallow. ""Pick up A, drop off at B."" There's no context as to what I'm doing this for. When I have a mission to go kill some pirate, there's nothing to it. It's just ""We of the Such-and-such want Pirate dead"". That's it! There's no interaction with the universe around you, it's all text and empty requests. You can't even interact with the ships system officers!! There's never a point where I feel truly a part of a living organism, I feel like the ONLY living organism in the game.Difficulty; Thus far, it makes no sense. I'll take on a quest to kill a pirate that's my level. Then I'll go to said zone and find that the pirate has two or more friends and he himself is listed as ""Impossible"" for my skill level. WHY? The game never notified me on what gear I should have when. The ships I'm going up against are a cool 2-10 MILLION credits, where as in my entire game play, dedicating time to making credits, I've made roughtly 800,000 at most, at one time. I read a forum post stating that some people ran into a sinkhole of difficulty, they leveled up too fast and the game scaled their enemies up too high, too quick. My point is, leveling should be more fluid and less wreckless. Don't allow me to level up to level 20 when I can't afford/fight level 20 ranked ships. EXP needs to be reworked, slow down leveling. Class ""System""; It's strait forward and dull. No real custiomization other than ""Put point here, see marginal benifits"". It's like old school WoW. Funny enough above I listed the games not deep, but it has a +% based level system. That's okay, I get it. But my skills don't feel impact, even against trivial ranked enemies, they still melt through my shield and kill me.I could go on, there's a lot to complain about with this game. However, give it a shot. If you really like space-sandbox-adventure action, you can't go wrong here. But there's better out there. ""General Statement. These are my thoughts on the game. Any opposing or likeminded feelings are welcome to be directed and discussed at me, however, don't be an idiot about it.""			"

												I'm going to try to make this as concise and clear as possible but I have a lot to say. Also note I have not played the main campagn yet although I've put around 30 hours into the sandbox mode.Pros: SG2 has a huge universe with a cool backstory that can be read on the wiki. This game allows you to change alignments based on your actions. For the first 10 hours I was just trying to get to the point where I can strike out on my own as a pirate but ended up feeling that I wouldn't want to betray the people I had been helping the whole time. I'm not RPing as a bounty hunter, hunting down all criminals with a bounty on their head. It's pretty great.The art direction is absolutely amazing. So much so that I got a SG2 background for my desktop. I feel like it really grasps the true beauty of space. The music is deep and emersive and it changes based on the situation in a smooth manner. Cons: The learning curve was pretty tough in the beginning. There was a tutorial but it was kind of a huge wall of text after another.Conclusion: This is a truly amazing game. I wish these devs had an EA budget so they could make even more content. I will definitely be purchasing Starpoint Gemini 3.			"

												To be honest, I am impressed. Good graphics, fun battles, large base of ships and weapons. It was money well spent.Game is stable, which, lately is not that common for games of this size. I haven't nodist major bugs.If you liked Freelancer, You will like this title. On the other end of spectrum, this is not X saga. It is not as complicated or deep. It is fun shooter, with options to mine, trade, change ships and thier equipment,  but it is not an empire building game.Campaing is ok, but I wasn't really waiting to find out what will happen next. On the other hand it is only small part of the game. Just flying around and blowing pirates, doing quests, and getting money for upgrades and new ships is fun in it self.There are some minor AI issues: - Your mercenaries will follow you... unless you decide to jump in any way (t-drive, wormhole, gate). They will stay there and wait. This is not really a problem, as for the most part of the game, they are not needed anyway.- Your turrets in auto mode and your fighters will not engage enemy sometimes in campaign missions. Outside missions everything is fine though, and issues was in maybe 3 missions.I haven't nodist anything more serious.All in all, it is a good buy.			"

												I am really enjoying this game.  To be fair, it has bugs, but overall it is fairly solid.  I used to play EVE Online for several years after it first came out and SG2 does have a *similar* feel.  The controls can be awkward at first, but after you make some fine-tuning on your own it becomes just as intuitive as any other mouse and keyboard based sim.  Note that in the last week+ since it came on steam, the community has been growing rapidly and there is a ton of good information to help new players adjust the game to fit their playstyle in this kind of sim.  If you are having difficulty, please look there and see if someone can help!One of the biggest factors for me is that the devs are continuously fixing the small things *and* the big picture as well.I'm excited to see where the game will go in the future...

												[Disclosure: Game copy purchased with own money]Quick update for my review.The game has continued to be supported with cheep DLC (with a free one on its way soon) and continued bug fixes and updates for controller support etc form the team. If your still on the fence (somehow) When I got this, I didn't buy a game... I just lent 10 new friends some money. Best wishes LGM teamFull launch review:1 Year in E/A It doesn't feel like it at all. Its went so fast and so smoothly I hardly noticed it, though looking back you could be forgiven for thinking the alpha/beta releases are a different monster from the full, and you'd be right. Shortly after typing this I shall be making a brand new ""from the start"" video and stick the link here. Check it out whydontcha?Also if it wasn't obvious already I whole heartedly 100% recommend this game. It oozes polish and shines as bright as Gemini's twin suns thanks to everyone's (with a special thanks to the early access-ors without whom this probably wouldn't have been half as good as a game that it is) hard work and dedication. Excellent Job Team SG2 (LGM, Iceberg Interactive, Steam and of course the Early Access-ors)Early Access Review begins: Despite this game being in alpha, it plays very well and is extremely fun. There is lots of work still to be done to it for sure but with and active community and devs that engage with their customers this is sure to be one of the best space sims around.Defos worth the price, was worth it back when it was in alpha, doubly so nowIf your still not sure feel free to check out my lets play on the game here:

												Pardon the format of my review, I am not formatting it very well.I bought Starpoint Gemini a couple of years back and just could not get into it.  I had put Starpoint Gemini 2 on my wishlist, hoping for a sale.  So I recently bought it on sale and I am find the freeroam mode very satisfying.I started out mining asteroids, then doing missions and all the while figuring out the different mechanisms for the game.  I had googled some ""Getting started"" guides and found out that boarding and selling ships was where most money could be made.  I had changed the game mode to easy, I wanted to check out all the different ships the game has to offer without too much of a struggle.   There is a clear progression with the choice of ships and going from your beginner Gunship and ending up with a Dreadnought is very satisfying.   The controls are a lot like Freelancer. Selling ships and taking out the most wanted from the Bounty board is a sure way to get rich fast.  There are different ""zones"" near friendly space stations that offer baddies from the different factions that are ideal for getting xp and capturing ships and dragging them to the spacestation.   Troopers are the currency that allow you to capture ships, space stations run out of them and then you have to go look for them somewhere else or wait until the space station has a new shipment of them.  I love the map with all the different factions and things to discover, there are structures called artefact vaults where you can collect an artefact, the objective is to collect all 50.  Some special kills (usually baddies from the most wanted board) yield unique weapons with better than average stats and some missions/kills yield   blueprint for unique equipment.  Most subsystems of  your ship can changed with upgrades that give bonuses.  You also can hire different officers that give bonuses. Furthermore once you reach a certain level,  you can hire mercs that join you so you end up with a little fleet.The combination of different ships (70 apparently), different officers, skills, perks, mercs and equipment and the huge map makes this game a great experience for me. I enjoy the grind of doing missions and capturing ships.   Overall a great Elite clone.  The story is a little thin and the game could use some world-lore detailing the history of the various factions beyond the news bulletins, something like the books in the Elder Scroll games would be nice. Also, the capture/trooper mechanic could be reworked a little, I never understand why some of my troopers still have to die when they are capturing an empty enemy ship.			"

												So I bought this on sale and it was one of those impulse buys, I did not get this game at all when I first tried it, but when I was in a more patient mood to learn the confusing interface I have now started playing it more and actually understand it as I read the tutorials carefully and just got used to everything, there is a learning curve with this game, but considering it's singleplayer so you don't have to worry about player population and it's a really massive space sim it is definitely worth it.Do you remember the days of Freelancer? Well I do and I played that game to death, one of the most fun aspects for me was the huge amounts of factions, the hidden bases, the exploration and the rather limited sandbox experience when it came to trading this game has decided to focus on all of that.I may actually even check out mining properly now, because I remember wanting to do it in Freelancer but because that game was primarily about combat it was all very limited oh and just like freelancer it looks like you mine by shooting stuff rather than having any sort of specialised ship, which, while is a bit silly I do wonder if that's a good mechanic because it means you don't have to worry so much about how to defend yourself in space sims.So to sum this game up, it very much has a learning curve, think of it as Freelancer on steroids because even the steering of your ship is very similar, but once you get into it you'll have no problem getting through the map and the various interfaces loaded with information.If anyone wants a possible tip on getting into the game quicker, I recommend just getting used to using the context menu which you access with the middle mouse button or clicking your scroll wheel. Unlike most context sensitive stuff on games this menu actually seems to work decently and you can use it to quickly navigate around space.			"

Or go freelance & complete missions for EVERYONE ranging from assasinations to station repair, Escorts & station defense to all round station assault! For bonus money! Or play a dashing rogue! Smuggle illegal contraband into neighboring systems-F*ck the establishment! For even MORE money! With enough weapons & variables to keep you armed & equipped well into the eventual heat-death of the universe, Starpoint Gemini 2 is a fantastic game. It's an absolute must-have when it goes on sale.  However,If I have one proper complaint though it's the voice acting for the single player missions. Long story short, it's bad. Not like Resident Evil cheesy jill sandwich master of unlocking good-bad, it's just bad. Like, people reading off a script for the first time bad. No soul.

												This is my impression of the game after about 39 hours of play. This game is mostly fun, as a game like this can be “fun”. This is a space simulation and as such, there is a lot of “space”. Moving from one place to another is a test of patience. It is very nice to look at and the music background/atmosphere is gorgeous; I can just listen to this game for hours. Unfortunately, the main story is not very interesting (after having done a few missions, I don’t even know what it is about). I am currently at level 17 but haven’t advanced much in the story because I don’t have any incentive to do so, or I don’t care for the story.I am mostly having fun exploring, mining, capturing ships and selling them to make money, because the game doesn’t give you much of that and selling ships is the best and the fastest way to make money. There doesn’t seem to any real purpose in this game; you just go around doing stuff that, ultimately, has no purpose. This is a nice game to play if you know what you are getting into. But I should point out that this is not a fast game to play so you need to have lots of time and patience on your hands. "

												Great game, one of the best, I should put as ""not recommend"" because of compatibility issues with some graphics cards that are the economic reality of my country because we can not pay for here more than US $ 70 in a graphics card, because boards $ 300 arrive at the price of a car close to $ 1600.If not for such technical misfortunes would have kept the game but the developer contacted me, which I found surprising, made some changes and even helped me in configuration, but unfortunately the problem persisted.I'd love to stay with the game but unfortunately I can not, maybe in the near future, even with the few minutes I played could delight me with the quality.I'll keep an eye on the game waiting for an update.Thank you all for support.

												Okay, I loved this game.  The ship models are fantastic and deeply customizable.  The ""Heroes"" that can optionally be hunted down have curiously ordinary names and faces - I think I've been killing the developers inside their own game.  The sandbox is massive, and while most of the missions really boil down to ""go here and kill this guy"" and ""go here without getting killed"", the enemies scale well enough that you're never really assured a victory.  Until you get a titan.  I didn't play the first game, but I get the feeling that the Levithan was the final battle.  Building your own ship off of that design, then, really skews the odds in your favor.  Fortunately, this is only an option at the very end, so look forward to scurrying away from enemy reinforcements.  Long story short, this will probably devour almost a hundred hours of your life and you won't resent it for that.			"

												Not bad at all, but it's no Freelancer or Eve Online. It's worth playing, but it's got a lot of bugs, a universal reputation system which annoys the crap out of me (you're either a good guy or a bad guy, rather than individual factions liking or disliking you to individual degrees.) It's all one star system - a very full star system, more full than in Freelancer or Eve, but just one rather than a galaxy. Long, poorly voiced, voice overs that can't be skipped. I could go on, but meh.Buy it if it's on sale and try it out.			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is a very good tactical space RTS game, there are many other good reviews out there that go into details about the game.I would like to point out that there are stability issues, I have had multiple crashes but I do not mind much as I frequently save.EDIT: The crashes are gone now, overal im really liking the game right now, workshop is amazing.

												I have been looking for a hybrid game that brings together EVE Online, X Series and others, that enables you to play at a faster rate that the games just mentioned. It is easy to start, the story line is decent, graphics are very neat, and its interface is easy use.So far I like it. "

												This game starts out simple and slow, but it starts to ramp up as you get bigger ships and explore. I really do find it fun. While it may not have the same depth of some other sandbox space sims its certainly kept me entertained. Well worth the money.			"

												This is my methadone to keep me going until Star Citizen is out.TLDR: It's very relaxing and enjoyable to roam around popping pirate ships, and scooping up their loot while exploring each hex.Theres some nice progression with levels earning you skills and perks to your character.  Meanwhile spend that ill gotten cash to upgrade ship systems, buy fancier guns, and stock up on consumables to give your ship an edge in a fight, or i suppose help miners in their tedious rock popping. Hire troops for the wetwork, bridge officers for passive bonuses, and later on mercenary captains to back you up in a fight. Remember, it's OK to leave them to die.  Ultimately earn enough (or take over!) that fancy new ship you've been eying. There are also purchasable licenses for financial perks like earning extra credits when killing certain factions or cheaper goods from a certain corporation, even passive credits per month so you can sit around and do squat and still earn money just like the one percenter you are.Exploration stays enjoyable by providing several modes of travel.  Pay to use an established warp gate (there's a way to make a one time license purchase to make them free though), or risk some damage and redshirt lives by using wormholes.  There's also these odd green bands of gravitational anomolies than can pull you in and whip you across several sectors very quickly, and finally the convenience of a consumable that will jump you a limited distance but can go from anywhere to any place you've already explored (and have enough drives to reach). It's also financially useful as the more stations you find, the better options you'll have to buy low and sell high with a decent variety of trade goods, some of them illicit in certain regions.I wish the different parts of space were more varied, but at least it's all uniformly pretty with nebulas, asteroid fields, ice asteroids, and clouds of floating junk (all mineable if you're into that sort of thing) to add some variety. There are scannable anomolies, though only a few types and they all just do some sort of passive thing to surrounding space like scramble sensors or block teleporters. Scanning them down will get rid of the field, and earn some xp and credits if its a mission, otherwise they are ignorable.  Some of the more unique stations are very beautiful, like the Spire, but most of the space stuff is pretty samey.Combat is  pretty simplistic you can even (and its recommended) set your turrets to autofire and concentrate on turning your best shields towards the light show. I wish the different guns and damage types were a little more varied. Heavy weapons have limted ammo but help speed things up, and there are some other consumables that can be deployed to help increase offense or survivability.  Spice things up by locking your grappling array on a wounded ship and teleporting over boarding parties of expendable no name grunts who throw their lives away so you can get a big payday.  If you're lucky and manage to successfully take over a ship you get to loot it far more effectively that picking through its wreckage, then tow it to the nearest dock to either add to your stable or sell off. Remember to keep the redshirts stocked every time you come back to port. Out in the stars are a bunch of named elites with bounty's on their heads and suprisingly deadly offensive capabilities to test your mettle. Currently theres no real story, and a very limited number of missions that just help earn credits while doing the things you're already doing, but the foundation that is there is solid and fun, and surprisingly well polished for an early access title.

												When i first tryed this game it didn't have a story mode it just had the sandbox mode, now i have been playing the story mode and i like the game, there isn't a lot of games i will play for hours on end without a story mode. The story in the game isn't the best but it gives you the out line and everything and you can do the story mission on your own time and do other things you want to do like trading of killing or capturing ships and than selling the ships or put them in your port, Mining or gas mining or side missions or a lot of little missions from different companys. The controls are supper easy for me at less i use the mouse 90% of the time. i have taking some pictures of the game. When you start off save your money for your first few ships is hard to do but its fun to do. As it sits at 32.4 hours in the game i have almost 50mil saved. The ranking system in the game it like every 5 or so levels you go up your rank goes up, I'm almost level 35 as of the time i posted this.			"

												This game really scratches the Freelancer itch.  It's fairly easy to pick up, although I wish it had a better tutorial.  One of the early main campaign missions tells you to do something, but did not explain how to actually do it.  After stumbling my way through that it's been fairly smooth sailing. It's fairly easy to make cash, and the missions are fairly fun.  I did have a couple of crashes, but they were few and far between.  The autosave system when you land somewhere works well, and ensures that even if you do crash, you don't lose much progress.Overall, I'm really enjoying this game, and it was worth picking up.			"

												Pros: Plays like Freelancer, in that you trade, kill, or quest to buy better ships and weapons - except if you are patient enough, you can get from one end to the other on engines alone.That is, of course, assuming that you do not encounter any enemies or anomalies along the way that will screw you over.Cons: The voice acting is laughably horrible and the lines themselves are poorly written. It's like a B-/C+ grade movie. Not to mention the typos, the faulty delete button which doesn't work, and the ""Active Only"" filter which, again, doesn't work.Bottom Line: Get it anyway. The dialogue and voice acting is, ultimately, a minor issue.			"

												This space simulation starts off a little slow but is a lot of fun once you get up and running. Think of it as a simplified version of the X series.  There seems to be a lot of things that aren't quite finished or shallow, but the developers have been quite activate in adding new content so far.  At this time, theres enough content to get about 25-35 hours worth out of this title at a minimum. Its very sandbox-y with an average story thrown on top.  The storyline itself was interesting, but the voice acting was pretty awful.  All in all, I'd recommend it only if you are into space sim games.			"

												I'll cover the game, but first I need to talk about the developers.This game is helmed by the best company/team I've ever encountered in a long time. They work & worked very hard on this SG2 which was even a joy to play incomplete in the earlier betas - constantly (like to the point of how do you get any work done?) reading, replying, and participating in forum discussions. They entertain ideas for how to approach planned features & possiblities of integrating new ones. This game is far from done in their eyes, and we are all excited to see how SG2 evolves over the long run.Oh yeah, the game: The graphics are awesome. The difficulty is varied enough to appeal to everyone (I'm in the extreme club, and find it quite challenging at times). You feel the constant itch to explore as available ship components, slot enhancements, crew officers, mercenaries, and new ship models differ between areas - and buying a ship direct from the manufacturer is cheaper than buying 3rd party from a different faction.Don't want to or can't buy a ship (because that faction hates you)? Grind rep and switch sides, or just board and capture the ship for yourself. Want to mine asteroid fields? You can do that. Want to capture ships and sell them for millions? You can do that too. Want to hunt down obsure achievements? They're here.And this game is only going to get better.Positive+ Awesome community+ Gameplay rewarding proper piloting+ Mod support (check out sound, graphics, and UI mods)+ Craftable rare drops (blueprints) that feel as good in use as they are frustrating to get+ Power management+ Huge map+ Wormholes!+ Great music+ Interesting campaign storylineNeutral+/- Slow start - it's very hard to begin classing up in ships, especially for new players. There are guides, but there is a bit of a grind. I like the payoff feeling from earning your way. Others will just go get a mod that gives them 1 billion credits. I suggest learning.Negative- Voice acting (there is a mod that improves a bit).- Illegal goods priced roughly equivalent to expensive legal goods.- Trade market prices could be more varied for better profits.- Few factors past pool numbers for shields and hulls.- Unrealistic aggro (2 gunships will ""think"" they can take on your dreadnought and rip you out of cruise speed).

												Game is very good for awhile, nice amount of things to do. Great controls, upgrades, options and visuals.But eventually, it's not the repetition of missions that grows old, it's the feeling that nothing around you changes, you can't own anything, build anything, destroy anything, push enemies back. So eventually becomes very stagnant. I totally get the dynamic stuff would be hard to implement, but then perhaps an easier way to liven things up is to throw in some random stuff like starports getting blown up (then coming back online after repairs), or certain races getting push back into the fringes or something. You can basically just settle into trading and fighting between two starports and essentially, aside from the background visuals not being different than another area... that.. is all the game becomes.  It's too bad because it has great potential and I admitedltly spent hours upon hours playing this game (65 I think). But I hit a point where the after reaching the 4 edges of the map, there was simply nothing else to do but even that is not bad, it's the feeling that nothing you do has any effect. Even trading seems to have no effect on prices or anything from what I can tell. I totally recommend it. But with the caveat that you too may hit this point where it just stops being interesting.

												If you enjoyed Freelancer, you'll love this. Many similar mechanics, with great ship customization. Maneuvering in space to get the best angles during a fight are fantastic, and managing your troops and ship's abilities and shields make every fight unique and fun.The story mode has bad writing and worse voice acting as well as being quite linear, so I'm mostly using it just for the experience to get bigger and better ships.The most frustrating bit of the game are the crashes. I've yet to have a single play session which didn't crash on me aty least 3 times. You'll be in the middle of a huge fight, and the game will suddenly die. The best thing the Devs did was implement auto save whenever you visit a space station or planet. But if you get in a middle of a big fight out in space and suddenly the game locks up, God help you.-- Edit: I wrote this mini-review/opinion piece a while ago, and the game is far, far, far more stable. Over the time since it was written, the Development team have been awesome in their implementation of not only new features, but bug fixes. The aforementioned random crashes are gone. Thoroughly enjoy this game.			"

												If you are into sims (as in simulating [duh] or role playing) this is a great space game. It is - as far as I can tell at this point - single player only and it reminds me of EVE from CCP but more beginner-friendly, although still not easy.If you dislike grinding, abort immediately. You'll grind A LOT. I find it worth, the ambiente is amazing, the somewhat small storyline is interesting (if you read and listen) but the action you take is repetitive. I read a lot about bugs, but have not encountered any yet (~29h). Every item has a nice description that is not generic, for example for the solar panels it says that they ""are an important part in Gemini due to the dual star system"" or similar.Workshop is available, you can get your Star Wars or StarTrek sounds, ships etc.__e.: My savegame was corrupted (after loading into the save a mission I wanted to accept was invisible), I do not know what happened, but the guys at LGM looked at the savegame and repaired it! That is some awesome dedication. Great game by great people!			"

								A space shooter that is good fun. You should definately RTFM because it is not a jump in and play sort of game. You can do that,  but you will miss out on many features . I keep wanting to play a little longer instead of doing important things,  like eating & sleeping! I got it on a sale or a bundle, I don't remember which. The price is a little high if it isn't on sale, but I am really cheap when it comes to games, since I do get them where I got this one. I'm glad I own it because it does have decent play value.If you like space shooters, trading, & mining. this is becoming quite polished. I like & recommend it if this type of game is your cup of tea. It doesn't seem to have all of the micromanagement like a lot of games in this genre but they might be there & I haven't investigated the game far enough to find that yet. Not bad at all.			"

It does, however, take a bit of time to get into the game and used to the control system (I kept shooting at friendlies by clicking the wrong mouse button).  But if you persevere its defintaely worth the wait.  Although still in Beta and without a campaign mode it is worth the money.  This is the first game I've played where you actually feel like other people are aboard your ship helping you - normally its do everything yourself, from steer, to fire to damage control - whereas with SG2 you can do as much or as little as you wish.

												I originally purchased this game during Early Access and have not been disappointed with the released product.  This title is a fine choice for those who enjoy an RPG in which one can be a starship captain.  With a wide variety of ships and missions, as well as Steam Workshop integration, there is a great deal of replayability.Having stated that, I recommend purchasing this game on sale, as the retail price is a bit steep.  I have noticed some minor graphical bugs, but nothing I would consider a ""show stopper"".  If you enjoy space captain RPG's with replayability, I recommend considering this particular title.			"

								Well, I have only played a short time so far but I must say that this  is looking like a winner.The graphics are smooth and quick. There are a few varied missions and it is looking like there is a real open play in here. You have freedom to go to quite a few places with missions on stations and planets so far with plenty of asteroids to mine for ore and stuff to sell. I will update this review as I get further into the game and as it changes from beta and so far I think that this will be a winner.			"

								Not normally I do any sort of reviews, played this one well into the night, grant you its beta, but you should get it whilst its on offer very enjoyable, with freedom to explore and decide which missions to accept.  Just needs a few brush up on the economic system.  Hard to tell whether you are getting a loss or a profit on each trade, a plus or minus on the items in cargo should do it.  Yet to commandeer a ship or salvage any derelicts though but gobbling up the hours here.			"

												First of all i have to say.... i love it .... it is an very nice space simulation...it has a great potential... still needs some more features, but the basic game is very nice...Update: Iam now playing this game for a while now....still love it^^....some small problems with the dlc here, but i think thats normal, of cause if you using mods.......I think Starpoint Gemini 2, stays here as an own concept of gameplay...dont try to compare it to other games like .... the X series....some elements are inside....but its very diffrent...You are exploring an dual star system here, with lots of planets, fractions, stations....A very nice thing is the functionality of the ship....you can upgrade your ships very nice, different weapon systems and mods for the systems.....your ship can be invisible, but not all ships.....Different fractions different ships.... So if you like space simulations....try it ....for me its worth it. ...			"

								I just purchased this game and havn't played much. However, all the positive reviews sold me on the game. I am new to the space sandbox genre, but I have to say this game is designed really well. I am impressed with how nice the game is for a Beta.So far here are a few cons that I noticed:1. Tutorials are too indepth and kind of annoying, but also give so much info at one time it is overwhelming.2. It take a little bit to get used to the controls and menu's3. You are a little lost when you first open the game because the games systems are new, if they have a more detailed tutorial that would help.Over all, I am very happy I purchased this game and look forward to further patches and changes.Highly recommend this game. And What a GREAT DEAL FOR $18! It should cost at least $50			"

								A really good game. So much you can do. Though it might be tough in the beginning you will end up loving the game. Reminds me of the cellphone game called Galaxy on Fire which i loved. This game is my favorite space game. Something i would like to see in this game is multiplayer. Simple multiplayer, like between 2 and 8 friends sitting there flying around in space.			"

								Make no mistake, this is an early access game.  What's currently there is enough to keep you entertained for a few hours if you're a fan of the X3 series or EVE online type of space sims.  But to be clear this game isn't a full experience yet.  However in those few hours you'll have a blast and the game shows so much promise (version 0.7021).  I'm really excited to see where further development takes this game.			"

								Got alot of promise... probably needs a streamlined getting started intro, as the included tutorial reading is vague.  The getting started basics youtube vid I found helped alot.  ship fights are enjoyable.  haven't ships are almost priced out of reach, and the game isn't real clear on the best ways to earn money.  selling cargo captured from enemy ships is kinda slow as your first ship has limited cargo... I wish they just gave you a starting balance and let you decide how to start you game.  I haven't tried capping a ship.  but i would figure turning off ""Fire-at-will"" would be a critical portion.  I would recommend this game if you liked the first one and also if you like open ended space games. I Haven't gotten into the storyline if there is oe or if it just hasn't been implemented yet.  so far my storylne i made is getting another ship in my flight or upgrading my curent ship to a larger model.

								Let me start by saying that if you have any interest at all in the Space/RPG genre you simply have to grab this game. Anyone who liked Freelancer, Freespace 1/2, Elite, I-War or any of the X games (apart from reunion) will be right at home here.Now for full disclosure I grabbed S♥♥♥♥ couple of months ago while it was still in Alpha stage and initially I wasn't too impressed. While issues are to be expected when you are playing an Alpha version, on my low-mid system, frame rate and stability issues kept me from playing for more than a couple of hours and I left the game alone for a while until some of these things were worked out.Boy! What a difference a couple of months makes. I figured since it finally got it's nice new ""Beta"" tag that I'd fire it up again and I'm really glad that I did, over 12 hours in the last 3 days can attest to how much fun I've been having with it.The basic premise of the game is your a star ship captain dropped into a dynamic living game world and your free to do pretty much whatever you want in a sandbox environment. (As of this writing the more linear campaign option has not been added yet, but is coming down the pipe shortly) : Feel like transporting VIPs or cargo from one sector to another, while enjoying the scenery? Check.Want to make your fortune by mining asteroids and junk yards? Check.Indescriminately want to blow up (Or at least try) any ship that comes near you? Check.Pros:Mind blowing number of ships to choose from (If you have the cash of course!)Plenty of factions to work with or against.3 unique classes with choices on which enhancements and perks to put into different skills when you level up.Galactic news and events that actually happen in the gameworld rather than being just Lore or Fluff.Excellent ship to ship tactical combat.Player driven goals, shall I save my money for a new ship or shall i upgrade my weapons and components?Cons:UI needs to provide more feedback. (Not being able to see the target summary unless your looking right at it, is a bit of a pain)Easy for a new player to be a little lost when first starting out, text tutorials are not ideal, but they do the job.Still a few performance and stability issues at times, which is to be expected with the game still being in BETA stage.Still some balancing issues with certain weapon types that need to be fleshed out, Beams being the prime example.Suggestions:Trading - Someway of knowing where to buy low and sell high would be nice, right now it's a bit of a crapshoot.Mission markers - How about different markers for each mission type? Would also be nice in the case of a point A to point B mission if the point B marker was a different color on the map screen.Event markers - After reading galactic news it would be nice to be able to at least select a few of them and have location specific news appear on the galactic map. (Bob spotted in the smith sector, should be able to mark the smith sector on the map so you don't have to go hunting around)Overall SG2 is shaping up very nicely and I highly recommend it, with a great DEV team who constantly provide feedback to player comments, it's only going to get better and better.

								I purchaced this game just a few days after it was released as an alpha. While i tried many times to play it, i never really got into it. I found the tutorial annoying. I'm not a fan of pop ups after all. So i shelved it for some time. After it went beta, i gave it a go again, and i must say, im very impressed with it. The graphics are decent, it has endless gameplay, with trading, missions and hunting the space rift raft. One complaint i do have is it seems when you enter a planet or station, time outside is mearly paused until you exit again. I really wish there was still time elapsing while you are docked. Perhaps im missing something, but that is how i understand it. Overall tho, if you are a fan of space games, this is a decent one to give a go. I am pleased with the direction the game is going.			"

								For a beta this is a stable experience. So far I have 6 hours in and no crashes. Fullscreen and in a window on an Win 7 x64 install; AMD FX4130 Quad core 3.8hgz 8gb, Radeon HD 7700 4gb.  Holding my interest even without a storyline but I wonder if Ill be done with it as soon as the map is explored to return for a well fleshed out full version. There is certainly an enthusiastic and active community with recent relevant posts.Whilst looking for a space or 4x or Freelancer fix this won out over Space Engineers and Mission to Mars by a gnats♥♥♥♥♥ They are still in the oven. This seems playable and solid with a developer that is working on a 4x game as well. That just put me over the top.Gameplay doesnt feel like a time sink so far. The hud layout covers the basics for letting you know whats going on. Navigation and camera took some getting used to. The combination of mouse follow (toggle space bar) and camera view (toggle TAB) threw me at first. The depth of menus (ship, officers, fleet) makes traveling to a remote station worthwhile if not for a trade then perhaps some rare talent or other. Im just scratching the surface and have to note the AI ship voice doesn't annoy the crap outta me and is useful as I tool around with this for the first time.			"

								Great game!  In the tradition of Wing Commander, Starlancer, and Freelancer.  Bought the game since I was stuck at home, sick anyway, and was waiting for Star Citizen to come out.  I'm not going to review this in depth, because most of the existing reviews already cover it.  I'm just agreeing with them.Of course, for the purpose of testing, I cheated and gave myself $999 million credits, but hey... had to test the ships.  It's a great game so far for the price (bought it on sale).  Can't wait to see what the full story game plays out as.  Minor bugs here and there.  Not a real deal breaker.  Would definitely recommend for any space flight sim and RPG fan.			"

								OK, so the game is great. Looks great, sounds great, fun to play, everything about it is awesome.EXCEPT that it's Beta, like really Beta. While it's a fun as hell game to play it crashes pretty consistently every 30 minutes or so. It has done this to me so many times that while I have 11 hours on record with steam I have only actually progressed through the game for 6.5, so just over half. The main reason for this huge loss of time has to do with the save system. It's pretty stupid: you can only save while docked, and (right now at least) you loose those missions (not failed, you loose access to those missions as if they never existed) so every time the game crahes before I can save I loose whatever time I invested into the game.So consider this game in an update or two. Or play at your own risk. Granted right now there is no story so you're really loosing free play, which is no real big deal.			"

								I'm quite impressed with this game so far. There is only one playable mode at the moment and that is the free roam sandbox mode. However, there are plenty of missions and other activities to keep you busy. I'm really impressed by some of the mechanics in this game that I have not seen in other space RPGs. The interface is sleek and functional without being too complicated and everything is easily accessible with the push of a button. Also, this is one beautiful game. The environments are detailed and really make you feel like you are a small piece of a very large universe.Summed up, I recommend this game to lovers of space RPGs as this is one of the best that I have seen and it is not even complete yet. It is definitely worth it in this beta stage, which assures me that once this is released, it will be a major player in the space RPG market.			"

								Quite simply, there have been very few worthy space RPGs and combat games in recent history. I'm finicky about buying games, and no space offerings in the last few years have captured my interest enough to buy them. Now it's 2014, and two games in development have had me seriously interested: Elite: Dangerous and this one, Starpoint Gemini 2. I have to say, although this game is in Beta stage, it's quite beautiful and very functional already. It seems very stable at this point. The freelance missions are plenty to keep me engaged as the game begins to blossom for official release. Space feels huge in this game, and I really get a sense of a living, breathing Gemini system. Also, the MUSIC. It's wonderful, and I really love that there is no cliche ""combat music"" when I inevitiably run into skirmishes enroute on my mission. Developers- please don't change this. The music really captures the vastness of the universe, making it almost surreal. The game also lets you soak in beautiful surroundings and lets you play at your own pace. Sure, there are a few hiccups being that it's in Beta stage, like the occasional short freeze while loading new territory and a few framerate slowdowns when near a lot of stuff like asteroid belts. But those are so few and far between, they don't really take anything from playing the Beta, I highly recommend this game for anyone who is interested in space and space games. I'm looking forward to the upcoming updates and release of this game!!			"

								So far, I'm impressed enough with the game to keep my eye on it.  It has some nice ""widgets"" implemented (I especially dig the animation of the tactical display starting up), and it is definitely pretty.  I am particularly enjoying having traded my beam weapons for longer-ranged railguns, especially since the beam weapons didn't have the ""oomph"" factor for me.  Now I just need to find some enemies that give me a challenge (but don't just blast me out of the stars with their first volley).One thing I'd love to see is the ability to add/remove various mount types.  For instance:  I would rather have two railgun mounts up front and ditch my heavy weapon (since I tend to go ""no ammo"" on anything where I can build my own loadout).  Having a little more control over ""ship engineering"" would be grand.  For all I know, this is planned; it just doesn't exist at the moment (as of 2014.04.29).The only real downside I've experienced so far is a few seemingly-random CTDs.   While not entirely a ""downside,"" there can be a ""boredom factor"" (which is not unique to S♥♥♥♥t all - I have the same issue with the X-universe games):  not enough mission variety, so it feels like a click-fest instead of a space game at times.  It IS early-access, though, so this could be an instance of ""it's not in yet.""  Regardless, a little more attempted piracy or some events that feel like they have meaning (anomalies that actually affect you rather than just ""drain shields/sap engines/etc,"" or other such challenges might help).All told, I'm glad I got in on early access for SG2, and I'm excited to see where they take it!

								i've bought it in beta, so i was very suprised by it's possibilities... I was so f...ing dissapointed by x-rebirth because of its bugs wich are still not resolved, so i searched for an altenative to the x -games.I found this one and i have to say: Althought in beta version (without sp campaign) it is 100 times better than x-rebirth. There are 100% lesser bugs than x-rebirth and 100% more fun exploring the galaxy and doing freelance missions. Even the Ai is not that tough and  graphics are kind of oldschool (remember: it is still in early access) it is  GREAT!!! Can't wait until it is finished!!! Can't wait until the singleplayer campaign is ready!!! Can' wait until this game will be the best space shooter/rpg on the market!!!Please excuse my dialect, I'm german and haven't used the english language active (writing) for years :-)			"

								Great game!  In the tradition of Wing Commander, Starlancer, and Freelancer.  Bought the game since I was stuck at home, sick anyway, and was waiting for Star Citizen to come out.  I'm not going to review this in depth, because most of the existing reviews already cover it.  I'm just agreeing with them.Of course, for the purpose of testing, I cheated and gave myself $999 million credits, but hey... had to test the ships.  It's a great game so far for the price (bought it on sale).  Can't wait to see what the full story game plays out as.  Minor bugs here and there.  Not a real deal breaker.  Would definitely recommend for any space flight sim and RPG fan.			"

								OK, so the game is great. Looks great, sounds great, fun to play, everything about it is awesome.EXCEPT that it's Beta, like really Beta. While it's a fun as hell game to play it crashes pretty consistently every 30 minutes or so. It has done this to me so many times that while I have 11 hours on record with steam I have only actually progressed through the game for 6.5, so just over half. The main reason for this huge loss of time has to do with the save system. It's pretty stupid: you can only save while docked, and (right now at least) you loose those missions (not failed, you loose access to those missions as if they never existed) so every time the game crahes before I can save I loose whatever time I invested into the game.So consider this game in an update or two.

								As an ALPHA BUILD, it is a pretty good game. I recommend it based on what I have seen and the possibilities that can follow. Energy allocation is a pretty nice touch. Weapon dynamics based on direction as well. However, I believe they are still unbalanced. Right now, there's not much to do. Not a lot of quest variety and some of them are very confusing (DAMN YOU TAXI MISSIONS). However, it is a lot of fun dominating multiple ships by yourself. If you like mindless sandbox gameplay, I recommend getting this game now. If you want a storyline, you may buy it later when scenarios are added. Eitherway, this is a pretty good casual game with nice pickups when multiple fleets are against you.			"

								This is one of those games that just looks so damn good, you can't help but just stop and look around at where you are sometimes. Add in it's intuitive UI and control setup, epic combat mechanics, and ease of navigation and you have the makings of what could be one of the best games in the genre.Even in it's beta form, there is enough sandbox, 4x, space sim fun to make it worth the price of admission. With the new modes and 'scenarios' promised for the full version (hopefully one of which is a story campaign that's epic enough to keep up with the setting and gameplay), this one could turn in to a true gem (No pun. Shut up. Don't judge me).That said there are a few balancing issues with the missions at the moment. Right now, the randomly generated missions seem to cap their pay at around 5000-10000 credits a piece, and none of them give you more than 100 XP, no matter how far you level up. The only way get enough XP to meet the prequisite for buying a better ship is to kill bad guys. LOTS of them. This makes buying a frieghter and becoming a miner or a trader pointless. Not that you would ever be able to afford that new ship since the pricetag for anything better than the frigate you start with starts at around 3,000,000. Factor in expenses and costly ship upgrades you have to keep up with and after 10 hours of play, I only had about a third of that. 30+ hours of play before you can even buy your first ship seems like a bit much to me. The missions are way too repetitive to justify that much grind.Same story with trading and mining. Mining never makes you more than a couple thousand creds a trip, and the amount of XP you get is effectively useless. It's even worse with trading. I haven't noticed any difference in prices of goods from one place to another, which means you can't make money (or XP for that matter) buying low at one place and selling high at another like you can in games like X3.Add a story mode, balance the missions so the pay and XP increase steadily as your level goes up, make them a bit less repetitive, and make the trading/mining mechanics of the game more lucrative, and this game would be just a tick below perfect.

								 I'm new to Steam and one of the first games I searched for was Freelancer, no luck there unfortunatly. So I was keeping an eye out for a similar, if not even better after ten years, replacment for my space combat kicks. The vids on the Store page for Starpoint Gemini 2 look amazing, it seemed to tick all the boxes.  Regardless of your Class you start with an awesome ship, it reminded me of B5s WhiteStar. It's a beast, easily crushing the initial waves of pirate scum who think they're hard enough. As you progress slightly you come up against larger foes and more drawn out battles that require a little more thought. You can upgrade your weapons or change them out, improve your crew to improve your boarding party and the idea of having a Merc fleet to command sounds great. There is a very solid foundation for an epic game here.Combat is on the whole more tactical than Freelancers wild dog-fights, although in fairness I'm not expecting a Cruiser or Frigate Class ship to turn on a dime like a Fighter. A bit more pace wouldn't hurt though. There is currently no story mode and I didn't think I would miss it so much untill it wasn't there. The good news is that it's yet to come, so that's really something to look forward to. For the the time being however, I'm done flying about on other faceless peoples errands as it really has no impact on the greater Galactic Goings-On. The Devs have done a superb job so far but they've a real task ahead to fill out Gemini and the players role in the galaxy.			"

I love being able to fly around a giant galaxy taking little side missions (only missions in the game right now) and blasting enemy ships out of the sky. I ended up moding the save file to give myself some more money to buy a better ship and some weapons but only did so to see how the game progression was. Lots of ships to collect and fly around in and the gameplay is actually kind of addicting.			"

								Well, it is a beta, but it does not really feel like a beta. Aside from a couple of mistakes/wrong textures applied, I have so far not had a problem.At first, the mix between joystick and mouse + keyboard was a bit hard to get hold of, but you can get the turrets to automatic, which works perfectly fine.Im not sure how the threat is assigned however, as I had no issues bringing down deadly ships, without my shields going down.So far the game is very repetitive, which is the only bad thing about it, however, being in beta still, I'm hoping more missions will be added over time, less repetitive.I like how the bounty system works, and it is very rewarding to get a bounty.I'd recommend the game, as it seems quite polished, and seems to work just fine :)			"

												I'm loving Starpoint Gemini 2: probably the best space game in year. It's transitioned out of beta nicely, with minimal bugs, and improved optimization. The game has two modes, story and sandbox, and both are quite enjoyable. The control scheme feels a little like Nexus the Jupiter (but not exactly), in the sense that you're the commander of a large ship with various systems (and not just a fighter). Much better than the X series imo.The game excells at allowing you to create the kind of space captain you want to be, and the kind of ship you want to fly. There are three classes, commander, gunner, and engineer, and each excells at different specializations. Commanders are great pilots, and augment their fleets; while, gunners excell at blowing things up; the engineer can create space anomalies like vortexes that suck enemy ships in, deal radiation damage to crews, or they can hack and shut down ship systems.The ships are fantastic. Nearly a hundred different ships of varying classes that you can customize and taylor to your play style. You can control frigates and battleships - and command squadrons of fighters (but there are no fighters you can fly). Place different systems, weapons, and then tweak those systems and weapons with different modules. So, for example, you can tweak your teleporter to improve its capacity, or give it a defensive characteristic, and use it to block enemy teleports. (your ships have troops which can defend against and invade and take over other ships which you can later keep or sell.) Do you install a module with better accuracy, damage, or, for a little more money, both?Finally, there are a variety of things to do. You can be a trader, a smuggler, a pirate (raid and steal ships), or a fleet commander of some sorts. There are anomalies in space that you can simply go out, explore, scan, and document, and gain experience from this. You can ferry VIP or desparately needed supplies between stations. As much variety to the missions as in any space game.My only real complaints, and by no means are these game breaking, is the lack of documentation (there's very little information available on what different game mechanics do, exactly. Which is frustrating, since they obviously took the time to put different mechanics into the game. For example, some guns do ""emp"" damages, or ""radiation"" damage, and no where does it say exactly what it means by this, one is just left to assume that radiation hurts crews and emp drains batteries or shields. My second complaint is that there's just too much clutter. Don't get me wrong, the game is beautiful, but everywhere you look there's some beautiful nebulae, star, or simply space debry all around you. Your eyes get overwhelmed by the clutter, never are you allowed to enjoy the simplicity of being amongst the stars. You never get the sense that you're exploring unchartered territory, as there are ships and stations everywhere you go.All in all, excellent game. 8/10.			"

								So I used to play EVE online a lot, and when I say alot I mean a social life endagering amount. Dont get me wrong, its an awesome game, but I always felt underpressure from my corperation and the fact it was a pay monthy subscription to play as much as I possibly/physically could. Due to this I eventually stopped playing and have ever since been on the lookout for something that comes even remotley close to EVE visually, mechanically and diversly. Starpoint Gemini 2 is the best I have found yet, and (as at the time of writing this) is still only in BETA!! Really looking forward to where they are going to take this, and no pay monthly fee so I can pick up and put down as I wish without feeling like I'm losing money. Ok so its not as complex as EVE but EVE was (imho) massivley complex and this game does just enough without frying your brain. Diversity is there, the amount of stuff you can do already without the campain is huge, visuals are breathtaking and the playable area is massive, not EVE massive but I ve been playing now for about 20 hours with 1 character and I've only explored about 1/8 of the map. Very well done on this guys and a big thumbs up on how much feedback you take from the forums. Its so nice to see deleopvers actually listening to us gamers and implementing changes directly off the back of feedback/critisims/ideas that come straight from the community. If you used to (or still do) play EVE, love space sims (or not) or are just looking for something to fill the gap between now and Star Citizen, look no further.All in all I give Starpoint Gemini 2 9/10 and watch this space, its only gonna get better			"

								I have yet to try any other space sims. But At the time, Starpoint Gemini, just seemed to be the exact kind of game to fill the game drought currently occuring in my life. I love RPGS and Space. Seeing that it was on sale I decided to take the plunge and purchase it.... It was at that point I discovered I had already owned this game for quite some time,( which happens more often that I should admit). Anywho, I installed and was immediately overwhelmed with the tutorial making me memorize a million different commands and interactions that seemed to be mostly Jibberish. Being my first step into the Space-sim genre as well as one of the only 4X strategy games  i've ever played, I gave no fault to the game or it's design. This was strictly me being a dummy.3 hours later I'm a bonafide Space pirate. THIS GAME IS GOOD! Like stay up until 3 in the morning on a work night kinds of good.			"

								I don't normally play space related games, nor did I play the first SP Gemini but I decided to give this one a chance based on what I saw and was pleasantly surprised.  Compared to other early access games I wasn't as disappointed as normal, in fact at this point this game could pass as an alpha.As far as the gameplay this is more of a you against the galaxy type of deal, you fly a spaceship, you may have multiple garaged spaceships that you own but (somewhat like ace combat in a way) but it is 100% open*galaxy*.  Normal gameplay consists of going on randomized missions such as assassinate, ferry cargo/passengers, capture ships, smuggle counterfiet goods etc, you level up/rank up and have a skill tree/rank tree.  You may earn money through missions, trading, mining (asteroids and other such objects), plundering derelict ships, and the best is to find rare high level bounty ships which earn you considerable profits.  You spend your money on new ships, ship systems (weapons) and system upgrades.Sorry for the long review but I tried to explain what I would have wanted to see before I bought it (well worth the money by the way!)

								I really like the licenses that you can buy but for the price of the licenses maybe the perk you get when you buy the license  should be increased or the prices of the licenses lowered.the auto-pilot is awesome and sometimes theres nothing better than just drifting through space but at times i find it a bit uneventful, other than the stunning scenery and the the enemy factions and pirates that you run into theres not much else that makes the trip exciting. maybe turning the autopilot off when the ship has to travel through asteroid fields or maybe even grouping the asteroids closer together so that the ship has to be manouveredthe map is really easy to read and finding my bearings isnt a problem, i have played similar games and have found them vey complicated, i find this one the easiest to understand and play but its not to say that its not a very challenging game although  a better tutorial could be made. i found the current tutorial a bit too much to remember at once.all in all it is an amazing game and i would recomend it to all my friends. i am curious to see multiplayer or even mass multiplayer capabilities. the graphics are a 10/10 and the ship controll is challenging but fun to master. it would be great to see a few more classes introduced as well.

												At first I thought this game sucked but the more I play it the more fun it is. It reminds me a lot of freespace 2 which is a great thing because that game rocked! However if your looking for a dogfight space sim then this isnt it. You get to fly huge ships which are more like gigantic gun boats. The voice acting is terible but dont let that put you off as the core gameplay is solid. I wish these guys had more money to spend on the game and add better social comms like the old wing commander 4. The game does feel lifeless sometimes as you do't really commincate with anyone, be it friendlies enemies or neutrals. So far this game has sucked up 11 hours of my life and I'm sure many hours to follow.  Hint: Leave your joystick unplugged, you won't need it. This games designed for mouse and keyboard and works well with it.Overall 7/10			"

												If you missed the sale recently, wait for it to come around again. Obsessively wait.This game was fun before I got to the modding community, but afterwards this game is awesome. Anyone looking for a good space ""do what you want"" sim will be well rewarded with the purchase.If you're into the Star Trek experience, then look no further. Best game for individual space ship combat in a Star Wars theme since Bridge Commander. Way better than that MMO I tried briefly. Some of the mods that I recommend for Star Trek immersion include: Federation Fleet, TNGAmbience, and TNGComputer.			"

												This game is super fun; I like Star Trek, Firefly, Cowboy Bebop, etc. and when I'm in that mood SG2 in perfect. Every time I resume my game the first thought I have is that this is a great, immersive game. It's really frustrating to see negative reviews because I love this game so much. The developers continue working on it and it keeps getting better which is really saying something since I loved it at early access. recommend for any sci-fi fan that wants a single player open world experience with a ton of ways to play. It's viable to be a miner and buy ships and outfit them just for that. I personally spent several fun hours just doing that, it was great. You can buy and upgrade ships just for smuggle or escort or freelancing. People complain about the expense of ships versus reward of missions; these people simply don't get it. There are lots of ways to build your bank roll and the time and effort it takes make the game more rewarding and immersive. The balance makes it so much better as you progress, you can't just jump from the first ship to the most powerful ship or even the most powerful weapons right away, and that is good. You actually get to enjoy and explore each level of progress , as you get a new ship, or a new upgrade and you slowly work toward that next purchase. All the while playing however you want, avoiding combat in favor of mining and trade which is super fun, figuring out how to avoid destruction or detection while making the kesel run in under 3 parsecs. Or you can be a pirate, good or bad, hijacking ships with a ship optimized just for that sort of activity. So good. So highly recommended.			"

												Great space exploration game, the storyline is enjoyable but not extremely content packed and not very interesting. The best part of the game is really exploring the very large map and choosing your own path, you can be whoever you want to be in a vast variety of ships and missions in different regions on the map.I have also had a lot of fun customizing my ship, whether that be the colors of the ship, or the weaponry on board, to the name of the ship (The SwagginWaggin)... I have also enjoyed aligning myself with the various factions, there seem to be at least 30-40 of them.Pro's --> Great space exploration game, complex enough to make it enjoyable for more experienced gamers but also doesn't have a huge learning curve.Con's --> Storyline is pretty weak and the quests and farming for gold can get a little repetitive if you don't enjoy the exploration aspect too much.7/10			"

												I actually really enjoyed this game. I was just starting to get annoyed at the quests. It looked like an impossible cash grind to get the top teir ships.  Then I managed to capture a tiny ship by fluke. I was amazed how much cash it was worth so started building a ship built for capping instead of pure combat. with the right upgrades, perks and officers I was able to capture same level ships to buy my way to top tier upgrades and cap ships higher classes than mine and work my way up the food chain. The going was slow at first but I ended up never having to actually buy anything larger than a frigate. I had some issues with the game crashing trying to do the Titan DLC but managed to get around it by save scumming every step of the quest. An at times flawed but still great space game.			"

								So I have spent almost 30 hours with this game, and I have to say the boys at LGM have out done themselves. Even in Beta this game is shining, bringing back thoughts of games Like Free Lancer and EVE, while not directly copping them or stealing anything from them.For all the negative reviews its still in BETA, I have not seen one complaint or gripe that has not been or is not being addressed, they are putting all the spit and polish on this as we speak and it shows in every aspect.The Community for this game, even before release, is awesome, they care about what happens to it, what happens in it, and I think for the first time, atleast for me, the Devs of this game actually listen and work with the community to better it.I've spent some scratch here at steam, I've been looking a long time for a quality game that I can enjoy, I've spent, I've looked, I've played, and when I say that even in Beta this was one of the best buys I've made here I am not kidding, its a gem pardon the pun.If your looking for a game thats exciting, has RPG elements, space tactics, gun fights, top gun like action, look no further than SPG2!

												The game has come a LONG way since my initital review, so time to update the thing. 1. The developers are awesome. 2. This game, in early days, was a fun amusement. With their improvements as time has gone on, it has lived up to its potential. This game is now king of the hill in its genre, as far as I'm concerned.3. At the time of this writing, developers are still improving and enhancing the game. 4. A number of game files (such as savegames) are in human-readable formats, making fixes (like if you screwed up a mod) or various changes suprrisngly doable if you want to go beyond the game's core gameplay.5. The game is beautifully made, graphically speaking. Voice acting is still getting all the lines filled out as far as I can tell, and some characters have better voices than others, and not all are voiced, but it's good for the most part.6. Why are you still reading this review, BUY THE GAME ALREADY!			"

												This is a really good space game.The game offers various control methods to let you fly your ship like a pilot/dogfighter or play more of a commander role using turret view. At first it takes a while to get used to the controls and fight effectively with a style you like but once you play out a few battles out you will find a control style that suits you and probably end up switching between them depending on the situation and the ship you are using.The graphics and interface are really nice and the game runs very well on my medium system which is an AMD APU with integrated graphics.The sound effects are good but some cool warp like sound effect for the t-drive would be nice. The music is very good although perhaps some more variety would be nice especially for the battle music. The story and voice acting is probably the weakest part of the game but the game offers plenty of freedom to explore space and play how you want to. So you can play like a pirate or a trader, mine or do missions etc. There's plenty to do and it's all fun.The game has a nice rpg element which means you can upgrade your skills for when you are in battle and upgrade perks for various different effects like trading bonuses or ship capture bonuses etc. You can customise your ships weapons and buy bigger and better guns and ships as you progress through the ranks and acquire more credits. Overall I would recommend getting this game, especially if you are into space games.			"

												I am loving this game - it feels like a mashup of X3, Elite and  a couple of other games.Your starter ship is good mix of everything, good size cargo bay, two weapon points (light - railguns, heavy missiles).  upgrading it is expensive so take care of it.You earn money by trading, completing missions, mining.  You can also try pirating, though this doesn't suit my game play.The universe is a series of hex's that you fly across normally.  Alternatively, their are gateways between locations that require jump drives, worm holes that require increased health (haven't managed to get through one yet) and rift lines, which accelerate your speed whilst you are in the rift.  The subtle difference between worm hole and rift - I think - is that you are exposed to enemy fire in the rift, but not in the wormhole.There is a story (and with the DLC, a second one), but often you will find yourself doing ""things"".  I targeted a level 2 pirate and thought it would be easy, but he called for help, deciding to avoid the agro, I pushed the engines to max, turned and flew through a rift and ended up in the middle of an uncharted system, alive, but with a battered ship.It is a slow paced game - so far at least - but you have to learn that your ship is NOT a fighter, but a small frigate with a crew and gimballed turrets which you can either fire, or have the crew fire.  Later you can buy carrier vessels or cloaked vessels.  You can also command some sort of fleet (hiring mercenaries to accompany you).Like I say, I am loving this.			"

												This is a great space combat game, with RPG elements.  Cruising through space, capturing ships, looting and upgrading is a lot of fun.  There are not too many games in this genre. They all seeml to be too old, too complex or they require subscriptions.  Starpoint Gemini 2 is a winner. Short comments on the game:- It is more arcade than simualtion. - The story is not bad, but the presentation is very weak. - At times the voice acting is rediculously bad-  Dont worry about the story becuase the gameplay is engaging and addictive- The graphics are great, minus a few hiccups here and there- Would take about 30-40 hours to play through campaign- Lots to do in this game. DLC is also available and the devs love to support this game- Stop and take a screen capture! F11 will hide all the HUDs so your screen capture comes out like a Carl Sagan wet dream. - The trading and mining is weak, but the value and money making is in capturing enemy ships and selling them and their cargo. Its 5x better than running materials from one side of the map to the other to make money.- There are some great video tutorials on youtube that can jumpstart your ship capturing / pirating skils .  Search: ""Tensiaka"" on youtube for valuable ship cap[turing and combat tutorials,. They helped me a lot. Make a few million in your first couple hrs ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Despite a few flaws, the gameplay, ship options and open world win out.  I  give it   --   8.5/10			"

												This game could be so great. A real worthy successor for the likes of Freelancer and Privateer but it has so many flaws that it is very close to not being recommendable...I still recommend it though for those in urgent need of a space sim who don’t like Elite: Dangerous and can’t wait for Star Citizen since chances are good that you still will get lost in the vicious circle of just one more mission to be one step closer to the next upgrade/weapon/ship.Let’s start with the good things:I really like the music…ok… that’s not all, there is so much to see and do in this game, too. The galaxy is huge and there are many (unique) space stations and planets to visit, missions to do, artifacts/blueprints to track down and especially ships to destroy, buy or capture. Yes, you can capture enemy ships – in theory – that is one part where the design just doesn’t work out so well, more on that later. You also gain experience and level up which will give you skill points and every 5 level a point for perks. Skills feel rather cheap and bad for me. There are 4 active skills (temporary boosts) you can invest your points in, each skill for one of the available weapon systems (railgun, plasma, beam and heavy (missiles)). So you basically decide which is your favorite weapon system and put your skill points into that skill. Perks are passive but also don’t feel that well thought out. Again you can increase the effectiveness of your favorite weapon system up to 3 times and then there are a lot of semi useful perks to invest in. Additionally you get permanent bonuses by getting (steam) achievements (never seen that before in a game...)The actual space simulation needs to get used to, too. I was expecting a feeling like in the old games and even bought a joystick to get the good old times back, but that just doesn’t work out (for me). The shooting is turret based (you have chase cam and no cockpit view anyway), meaning you can see around your ship and you just move the camera freely and aim with your mouse (depending on the turret placement on the ship). Furthermore the hit feedback is so bad that I quickly decided to switch to beam weapons that are instant hit so I know where I aim is what I hit. Railgun and plasma are projectiles flying somewhere in the direction of the enemy and unless you are not fighting a huge freighter close combat you barely see if you hit or not and especially if not why not (ok, it might just need to get used to but beam seems the better solution). Also you can just tell the system to auto fire (that's why there are acurracy stats you can influence, but I want to play the game as space shooter and not strategy game like star wolves so I don't want to use autoaim...)What is really bad and I don’t understand how the design can fail so hard is that you can’t see your enemy information in the hud. Instead the hud is clustered with stupid, bad looking buttons I barely use (which I could easily access by keys). You only see the enemy information when the enemy is in sight and when he is close it is so fast moving that you can barely read it. So what is happening all the time is: There is a bunch of enemies closing in, you see them in the radar, you can target them (via hotkey) but you have either to start flying into their direction (which is a great idea when it turns out that they are deadly) or switch to turret and target mode and move your camera wildly to get them into focus and be able to identify their threat level. Both very inconvenient since you should be able to quickly cycle through all targets and identify them with one glance. Well perhaps I’m missing something, there even is an info hotkey but it won’t work for enemy ships, only for special objects.The other really bad design issue is the character level system. You level up quite fast and the missions you can get (you don’t have to visit stations to get missions, you will get them while in space, which is good) show the suggested level you should have to take that mission. The problem is: the character level does tell♥♥♥♥♥♥about your actual strength. That only depends on your ship and weaponry. So this indicator is useless in the first place. Coincidentally it is also useless in the second place because there are types of missions that are just no brainers – regardless of which level they show. If you have maintenance or science missions you just fly to the target, repair or inspect it aaand… it’s done. On the other hand, good luck with rescue or capture missions, which are often impossible even on low level. So the balancing is very bad in general but luckily you can cheat your way out most of the time: Early game you just start your engine boosters and outrun every enemy, mid game they sometimes start blocking your boost mode but you can have a ship with cloaking device by then and just turn that on. Later this doesn't work and thats when you get in real trouble…Talking about capturing… first you can’t capture 90% of the enemies because they have a larger crew than you have (capturing works this way: grapple the enemy with a tractor beam, send troops via teleporter to his ship, if you have more than him you possibly take over the ship). You can focus on capturing by searching for a cheap ship which allows a large army of troopers on board and you can get perks or officers (you can hire 3 officers for your ship, by the way, you can also hire merc ships that follow you and certain ships allow to take fighters on board you can launch during combat so you end up having your own fleet) that give a bonus on the capturing chances.Second most of the time there are other ships around. So even when you manage to find a capturable ship chances are high that it will get blown apart by some other ship nearby. So it is a great feature in theory that just is no real fun most of the time but satisfying when it finally works.Other weaknesses I like to mention:The presentation is really bad. The main story has a ridiculous voice over most of the time, sometimes just dialog (not sure if it is a bug that voiceover is not playing because the music gets muted anyway) and sometimes just a text popup – atmosphere = 0.The balancing of the main and some side missions is also a bad joke. You will be stuck for hours until you have enough money for a capable ship and after you finally progress you often get much easier missions afterwards.The menus are confusing and tedious to use. E.g. you can either sell all cargo or one good at the merchant, but if you have more than 1 of a good you always have to go to the next screen to select how much of the good you want to sell (well everything!). And you will do that a lot because the screen shows if you are having good, mediocre or bad prices so you most likely don’t want to sell the goods with bad prices and rather fly to the next station. I think the ship loadout menu is simply bugged. edit: it is not bugged, turret handling is just another unintuive feature. Also when I unmount a rocket launcher I lose my missiles. The good thing is that I can store my ships with their loadout in my garage and can swap them easily depending on the situation (cargo space/troop count/gun power).But the weapon/ship prices balancing could be much better. The next better systems are so expensive that it takes hours until you can afford something new that actually feels more powerful. The upgrade flow was much better/faster in Freelancer.Last but not least there are that most annoying situations where a cutscene triggers in the middle of a fight, you can’t do anything but the fight continues in the background usually resulting in your death or at least a great headstart for your enemies.So there are many occasions in the game where I ask myself: Did the developers actually play what they created?And then I go back to the game desperately hunting for the next better ship…			"

Early Access Review
								DON'T BUY IN CURRENT STATE. i know its early access but its currently unplayable. iv spent 40 minutes ""in game"" trying to get this to work. upon beginning the free roam, there are 2 missions immidiately available. kill some♥♥♥♥♥♥ and dock at the nearest planet. so, naturally i killed some♥♥♥♥♥♥first and thought id dock after as id likely need to repair my ship or something. upon docking i did all the things needed and tried to leave.... ""starpoint gemini 2.exe stopped responding"".I have tried everything, even resorting to deleting the game and installing to a different hard drive. no luck. the game is unplayable as docking is an essential part of the game! I'll update this review once another update comes along, but for now its money wasted.---UPDATE---This review was posted shortly after posting on the starpoint gemini 2 forum.I have to say, the devs are absolutely awesome. I posted a post on their forum and within an hour I had a response by both email and on the forum by 2 different devs. I was asked to send them the log and dxdiag report, which i did. By process of elimination they found that the autosave system had corrupted a save file causing the crash i was getting.This is the first time I have had such a great fast response for a problem with a game.10/10 for the devs!--On to the game--It's awesome! I have wanted to play space sims for ages since the first homeworld game, but there just wasn't anything on the market that hit exactly what I wanted. Having read a lot of reviews and watched some on youtube i decided to take the plunge on this... and boy am i glad i did, although i've only played an hour or 2 i can see myself being sucked into this world like i was with homeworld. Graphically it looks beautiful and although i have not played many space games since homeworld i can say its the best iv seen on steam so far.The audio is great! not to intrusive like many games of this kind, but not lacking so much that it gets boring.At present the only option is freeroam which is exactly what I was after. Do what you want, when you want! Although when the campaign is added it will be a great bonus!Mods! its available on the steam workshop! endless possibilities await avid modders! there isnt much on there at  the moment but i can see it blowing up pretty fast!The ONLY thing i have against this game is the tutorial... or lack of one. being completely new to this type of game it would have been a little helpful for it to have some sort of single mission tutorial or something like that. At present it only offers lots of reading.... and if your like me, reading isnt the way you take things in. DOING is the way i find easiest to learn.This is only a minor gripe i have to what i have to say is a superb game. one of my favourites this year so far! :D			"

												The game has come a LONG way since my initital review, so time to update the thing. 1. The developers are awesome. 2. This game, in early days, was a fun amusement. With their improvements as time has gone on, it has lived up to its potential. This game is now king of the hill in its genre, as far as I'm concerned.3. At the time of this writing, developers are still improving and enhancing the game. 4. A number of game files (such as savegames) are in human-readable formats, making fixes (like if you screwed up a mod) or various changes suprrisngly doable if you want to go beyond the game's core gameplay.5. The game is beautifully made, graphically speaking. Voice acting is still getting all the lines filled out as far as I can tell, and some characters have better voices than others, and not all are voiced, but it's good for the most part.6. Why are you still reading this review, BUY THE GAME ALREADY!			"

Early Access Review
								Okay...I've been playing for a week or so now, and am overall VERY pleased with the game.  There are several bugs that obviously need to be chased down and cleaned up, but if you are a fan of the space (trading) games of the past, then this will win your heart.  There isn't much of a story line yet, but the sandbox (freeform) mode is exceptional, not to mention HUGE!  Did I mention that the map is HUGE?For a fact, there are more opponents, stations, friends, and asteroids to keep you busy for a VERY long time.  It's because the map is HUGE!The game is more akin to Freelancer than to Mass Effect (at least until they get the story part released), and you have so many options to build and customize your ship(s) it's going to make GOTY for space sims.The visuals are a little less important than the action and details, and you get to blow stuff up.  A LOT of stuff.  It's probably because the map is HUGE!Spend the money.  Buy the game.  Enjoy wiping out lots of enemies on the HUGE map. "

								IN GAME THE MOUSE WILL NOT MOVE ONTO THE LOWER PORTION OF THE SCREEN. Then I restarted the game, and it looks, like the active-x and direct-x files had to syncronise correctly, which they did, after the second startup. Now it works pretty good, but this is a beta game, and that is why some of the graphics enhancements do not detect as usable, like reflections and shadows, could not be used, but my 2 gig NVIDIA 660 definately has those abilities.Ok that said... Listen up. This game has real potential, because its very open to modding, so it could getvery incredible. There are allready a good number of mods on steam for it, and it's just in BETA...Plus you can use HOTAS joystick to control things. I'm guessing that everything may just end up with beautiful cockpits too for every type of ship.  So get in there and mod and use wordpad !			"

												I actually really enjoyed this game. I was just starting to get annoyed at the quests. It looked like an impossible cash grind to get the top teir ships.  Then I managed to capture a tiny ship by fluke. I was amazed how much cash it was worth so started building a ship built for capping instead of pure combat. with the right upgrades, perks and officers I was able to capture same level ships to buy my way to top tier upgrades and cap ships higher classes than mine and work my way up the food chain. The going was slow at first but I ended up never having to actually buy anything larger than a frigate. I had some issues with the game crashing trying to do the Titan DLC but managed to get around it by save scumming every step of the quest. An at times flawed but still great space game.			"

Alot of different ships, combat can be quite hard at times if you havent prepared first.Devs are also more active than most, creating more and more different storylines for free. One of few developers going from early access to release that actually fullfill their promises although StarDrive is a different story for many.I would reccomend it for those of you that need a game to pass time with or just have a blast.

												Amazingly fun early game.Decent middle game.Slow endgame.And I mean slow. Literally. The final ships are next to stationary in combat, and the lack of variety of options in combat makes this quite boring.  As you can only aim a fraction of your turrets at once you're left to turn on auto turrets with large ships which automatically takes care of firing all turrets so you have all your guns firing and just kind of sit there and occasionally use an ability if you need to kill a bit faster.I can still happily recommend this game based on the great early and midgame that's highly reminiscent of Freelancer, but the endgame is poorly balanced and not particularly fun.

												I purchased this game almost immediately during early access because I had been wanting to play a good space sim for quite a long time. It is a vast improvement over the previous title in the series and successfully creates a fun space sim experience with some rpg progression for your character. Initially after release the game was somewhat buggy, but the developers have ironed out the rough edges and even successfully adapted most of the user interface for gamepad control. Thus far I have spent most of my time in the sandbox mode, but I have recently begun the story playthrough. Both modes are fun to play with the story mode featuring a rather standard, but competently-executed space sim plot. Best of all is that steam workshop is available for the game and there have been many great mods that improve aspects of the gameplay as well as those that create custom content. There is a good diversity of ships and weaponry in the game, with ship types ranging from small gunships and shuttle craft up to battleship size vessels available to be purchased. You can also hire officers who confer stat bonuses and other ships piloted by mercenaries to join you. There are numerous ways to make money including a robust trading economy, asteroids to mine, spatial phenomena to explore, odd jobs to be done, transport/taxi missions, and of course bounty hunter missions.Combat is satisfying, though you certainly feel like more of a ship commander than a pilot. This is probably due to the game's third person perspective which suits the game well because most of the ships you will use are more like capital ships than fighters. To sum it up, this is one of the best single player space sim/rpg's to come out in a very long time. In some ways I enjoy this game more than Elite: Dangerous.			"

												This game a is a tough one to decide. It really isn't a game that I can sit and dump 8 hours into daily like some of the other games I've played, but it is fun to come back to it every once in a while and get my ""freelancer"" fix for the week. I personally found this game to be pretty fun when in sandbox/exploration mode. Story mode on the other hand.. was poorly completed, I believe I spent about 20 minutes in, and dumped it due to the appalling voice acting and poorly scripted story.  Now for sandbox I loved flying around blasting and capturing ships to sell at the local stations. I loved upgrading my ship from the inventories of captured  ships. I'm always looking for the shield or weapon improvment. I loved exploring the map and seeing all the cool spacial anomalies. UnfortunateIy, though I did find some general weaknesses in the way content is utilized in the game, there are only a handful of side mission types such as capture ship A, Destroy ship B, or Haul element C these side missions do get old pretty quickly and is a main reason why I cannot dump countless hours into the game in one sitting. Sometimes I also receive missions I have no way in hell of completing, the AI levels way faster than I do... I'll be level 4 with missions that are level 12 around the beginning area. It's ok as you can just drop the mission, but is kinda annoying all the same. Overall, I find the game to be pretty engaging when played casually, but any longer than a couple of hours and I'm ready for something else. I've been looking at Elite: Dangerous but it looks like a tremendous amount of tedious work to play, just from peoples reviews, that and it's much more expensive.To the developer: I really hope you guys haven't given up on this game now that it's considered ""Complete"" there is still a tremendous amount of possibilities with it, and I would love to see more content(More engaging space stations, etc.) Thanks a ton for creating a game that allows me to get my space sim fix when I feel the urge.

UnfortunateIy, though I did find some general weaknesses in the way content is utilized in the game, there are only a handful of side mission types such as capture ship A, Destroy ship B, or Haul element C these side missions do get old pretty quickly and is a main reason why I cannot dump countless hours into the game in one sitting. Sometimes I also receive missions I have no way in hell of completing, the AI levels way faster than I do... I'll be level 4 with missions that are level 12 around the beginning area. It's ok as you can just drop the mission, but is kinda annoying all the same. Overall, I find the game to be pretty engaging when played casually, but any longer than a couple of hours and I'm ready for something else. I've been looking at Elite: Dangerous but it looks like a tremendous amount of tedious work to play, just from peoples reviews, that and it's much more expensive.To the developer: I really hope you guys haven't given up on this game now that it's considered ""Complete"" there is still a tremendous amount of possibilities with it, and I would love to see more content(More engaging space stations, etc.) Thanks a ton for creating a game that allows me to get my space sim fix when I feel the urge.

												Bad game! Horribly frustrating, has some good points, but overall its a very bad game.The main thing, the fighting - it sucks, 99% of the time you have to turn on auto shooting, because you can't find on the screen enemies, they just keep flying outside of your view all the time, and it doesnt matter if it is a destroyer and you are flying with corvette it still jumps around you like if it was a small fly.   As for different ship types, they all behave the same way, you don't feel any difference between piloting small ship or huge one, it looks almost the same and moves the same way.As for trade, colors of prices are cool, but otherwise trade is tedious and just a waste of time, especially that you start a game with a tiny ship, you could get better cash form mining, but it still is insignificant.You can get huge rewards for capturng ships and doing it is the most fun feature of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game... the storyline is also interesting, it kept me into the game for some time, until finally i had enought of other flaws and deleted it.You shouldn't go into long travels/explorations, save as often as you can because game like to punish you for no reason... you fly, fly, fly, die... just like that, no attack, no hazard, you just suddenly see your ship explode. Or you fly, fly, fly, game crash.... ;DOr if you want to use speed booster to get quickly to new area... the game crashes almost every time you use this item.During fights, you can read target info only when it is on the screen so it makes it quite problematic since as i said they always stay outside of your FOV.I should also mention that it has horrible localization, had to switch to English as in my native language it was horrible.And one last thing, the RPG elements... its a bad joke, not worth mentioning.

												I liked the game so far, but I play a lot. I am an avid player of sci fi games, medieval, simulation battle and strategy. I play games so much I do not have any other form of life except work and games. I do stay in shape as I work out a lot. I can practically tell you exactly how to make a good game and it will be a #1 top seller, I have even made games myself constucting whole citys and governments with plots and story lines along with political agendas on governments and war. This Starpoint Gemini is very promising and is a good game. Couple of pointers to the developers, you should have ships hunt you down as if looking for you and then take off before being destoyed. Somone you can recognize that you have seen before but make some what elusive so he/she can come back again to hunt you from a jurisdiction you are not welcomed of course, but this should be once in great while not an everytime thing. Another thing is that when you get high level in the game all you see is big hard ships all the time, almost no small ones. In the begining you would see them a lot. I am level 80 and it does not seem to be going any highier(no complaints). But sometimes you exit from a station or a star gate and you are jumped by a horde of big ships just out of the blue(c'mon a little ridiculouse at times)it happens often and half the time you dont stand a chance unless you have big hired mercenarys that are expensive to maintain, which does take a big toll on the money you make. Sometimes you fall behind unless you really try to keep up the hustle and bustle of making money, then its more stress instead of pure enjoyment to try and keep good powerfull mercenarys at youre side. You should fan it out more to where at least 50% of the time there are still smaller groups of ships, or one or two important people(hunters) that show up to hunt you like I said previously, Instaed of being mobbed by a lot of big powerfull ships all the time. There still needs to be smaller ships around of all sizes. All I see now are big ships everywhere and almost no small ones traversing through space or hanging out at space stations. Its almost as if everybodys super rich now and got dreadnaughts and carriers becouse I am level 80 now. You need to tone that down to be more normal. If you did that the game would excell in greatness, otherwise that is a major downfall. But I do see it getting bigger more powerfull ships to attack you as you are highier in level that makes sense, but overall it needs to be re-worked to how i mentioned previously, thank you...... Several hours later on re-editing, I am now back to write what I said. There is more randomness, I guess i was just to fast to express at 80th level. I went back in different parts of the galaxy, it does get heavy at times and then again light on battles just depends. Also what i like is there are also missions you can take that can be much lower than youre level and also much highier. There still needs to  be ones that hunt you down and occasionally escape to come back another time but with a name to them you can recognize. May i also add i have not played the story line yet and am looking forward to it, its just in the free roam you can choose other characters instead of bieng stuck with the same story line one. Overall its all good and was very enjoyable playing. Would be nice to have another dozen songs in the game, the music is similar to eve music which I liked a lot when I played eve back in 2009.			"

												Well so far after 14 hour i must say it a great game. what i can tell is that could be a bit more uppdates like : The Turial is all reading but could be easier if they give a short intro in a video and make you try it self (Fighting, bording and much more). It took me several hours before i really understand how to do the basic stuff like bording and easier way to lvl up with good money. This game reminds me of Galaxy on Fire 2 but its much more bigger galaxy and more hours of play time :) only thing i miss its the mining. In this game you only have to shoot the asteroids to collect the Minerals			"

												I loved freelancer and this game has that feel to it. You can even capture ships and sale them which quickly becomes the best way to make money. However a few things that I dislike in base game (though since you can mod it heavily some things can be fixed), the way ship levels are done and strength of weapons allowed on ships bothered me as a lot of money spent for so little gained. I felt like (without mods) that upgrading my ship to a much more expensive version often didn't gain any DPS. I wound up using a lot of modding to make this flow better for me.			"

												Poor mans X Universe game. Here is how you defeat every ship that attacks you: Come to a complete stop, (because the space fighting is a joke and he enemy ships will stop with you) then because the targeting system is non existent, turn on auto fire, then spin 360 degrees spamming your heavy weapons. It may be a space game but everything is on a 2D plane. this may not sound bad, but fighting in space NEEDS three dimenshions. Every single ship in the game plays the same. Bigger ones just have more hitpoints, turrets, and hangars. And they still suck. If you want a true space fighter sim, get any ""X"" game. Except ""Rebirth"" ♥♥♥♥ that game.			"

												Really enjoyable space game. Unlike Elite: Dangerous, it's fun to play for more than three hours, and unlike EVE online, it's fun to play for less than three years. The storyline aint the grandest or most unique experience, but the gameplay and space combat is engaging and fun. The pilot skill progression and the upgrading to better ships provides a compelling reason to keep blasting away.I say, if you enjoyed freelancer, give this a crack.			"

												I'll go on to say that if you enjoyed Freespace 2 or similar space themed games then you will find yourself immersed in this game. I will also add that the game requires a decent PC for the optimal smooth gameplay experience. In Starpoint Gemini 2 you get to upgrade and purchase ships as well as level up your character. There is a story ark mode available and freeroam option where you can try and emulate a raider, trader, mercenary and more. Combat in this game is extremely satisfying and blowing up combatant ships nearly never gets old. Even though this game is slated as a finished product the developers are still adding in more functions to add to the replayability and longevity of the base game. Plus all those Steam Workshop mods add to the overall experience if you want to mix things up a tad. Overall I rate this game a 7.8/10.			"

												I thought this would be the Mount and Blade of Space. It isn't. I got this for five bucks, its not worth itIf you like dicking around in space doing basically nothing then here ya go. There is no reason to progress and get better weapons, as I was able to take down ships with an ""Impossible"" Rating without taking any damage at all. Combat is useless, as you make more money shooting rocks and selling what you find than being a pirate.I'm sure this game apeals to more methodical players that want to learn all the ins and outs, but if your a guy like me who doesn't have the time or patience to do that, this isn't for you.Note I didnt try the story so keep that in mind when making your decision to buy the game or not.

												It is interesting but fairly basic compared to other spaceship exploration type of games.  The combat is very fast and takes some of the nuance out of the skills.  The UI is clunky and ship movement isn't very intuitive.  Trading is simpliofied but won't really make you much money. Just doing the same 4 types of missions will net you the bulk of your income and experience.  But I would have still have left a positive review if it weren't for the frequent crashes.  These crashes aren't just the game, they often freeze up my system in a way I haven't experienced in years.In researching this problem one comes across many attempted solutions (which I tried many) from others and then dev posts that point to it being a problem with Windows 10, and that they do not and will not support this game under Windows 10.  Also read from the dev posts that ""this game is 2 years old"" so they are not focused on supporting it further.  So, buyer beware.			"

												I wanted to like this game, but the texts everywhere are too small, hard to read, and so reading through the tutorial was a chore. The campaign was boring, but the Freeroam mode just leaves you out in the open. Quests you get are too straightforward, not even giving you a small background on why you have to put down a ship, it just appears on your starchart and you'd be free to grab it if you want. Ultimately, the voice acting is very bad, which was really off-putting. I was looking for an experience similar to Sid Meier's Pirates! and Mount and Blade: Warband, but I sadly didn't get that here.			"

Posted: October 9, 2014
												There's quite a few things to like in this space trading/shooter game. The developers have managed to infuse a fair bit of live into this one, and it does have some pretty neat game mechanics. The best way of defining it is as a crossover of Freelancer and Starfleet Command, even if I find SPG 2 to be neatly an inferior game to both. Compared with Freelancer, this title hasn't delivered for me the same degree of immersion and engagement with the storyline and the universe that I remember of playing Freelancer. Compared to the second, the tactical combat in this game to be flawed in some departments and shallower, even if there are some cool ideas in here.The stuff I like Even if we're restricted to one single system, there's indeed a lot of places to go and things to see. This is a *big* game. Trading and mining are actually viable professions, not just an side to mercenary or piratical activities. There's lots of ships, and lots of modules to fit your ships with.  Combat is engaging, and fun, at least for some time. I do like very much the ""ammo-based"" modules (scavenger drones, mining torpedoes, etc.). These modules can be swapped in flight - which might detract from a plausibility point of view, but I personally don't mind it much - and you can actually feel like having a purpose (they're quite useful actually). The game is highly moddable.The stuff that leaves me indifferent or I am not very impressed by While there's a great variety of weapons, I find that rather than having 5 varieties of the same thing with slightly tweaks to range, damage, power drain, etc. it would have made sense to have just one type and increase the ""rigging possibilities"". Per-module rigging is in  the game, but you can just add one type of rig to one specific module. You can recruit crew, but this crew is reduced to specific buffs to your ship (weapon accuracy, speed, etc.). They level out, and do provide with an extra layer of ship customization. But sometimes the bonuses are so specific that one wonders why are you paying religiously salaries on a monthly basis. There's no enemy leveling - that is, if you go to certain places you may find yourself vastly overmatched by NPC ships. Knowing when to engage and when to fly is an important skill to develop. The problem comes when these ""hero"" NPCs basically can appear anywhere and the information that allows you to assess whether or not you're outclassed is only visible if you keep it in your sights. Which can be quite difficult. The combat skills system looks good, but very much as with the crew, lacks some depth (and you also wonder why you should bother with those skills).The stuff I plainly don't like The HUD is functional, but I would have really liked that I could have waypoints (that is, locking on locations) and targets (that is, locking on ships and stations) at the same time. Currently, you either have a waypoint or a target. Even worse is that the waypoint/target data is only visible if you have your bow pointed towards the object you locked on. That makes stuff like checking on nearby hostile ships while travelling towards your destination disorienting or just plainly dangerous (since you will close onto these enemies). The world is very much structured like that of Privateer/Freelancer, but crammed into one single star system. What was plausible in those games, here feels a bit uncomfortably contrived. Even if the world is big, I didn't get that ""to boldly go where nobody has before"" kind of vibe that you get in Elite Dangerous or Evochron Mercenary, for instance. I find the main storyline to be completely uninteresting, and delivered in a very unappealing way.It's a cheap game, indeed, but since I haven't enjoyed it much, I can't really recommend it to anyone.

Its not hardcore and even people who dont like space sims could love kinda arcade side of the game.GO BUY IT IF U CAN...THROW MONEY AT THE DEVELOPERS CAUSE THEY DESERVE IT.			"

												This game is more fun than I thought it would be... the plot (although kinda shallow on the side quests) is entertaining.The thing I find most enjoyable is that you can play it as a first-person space dogfighting game, or you can use the fire at will feature and just fly the ship while the computer does the shooting. Trading seems to be a waste of time at least early on up to where I'm at same for mining although its a little more lucrative. The gameplay is pretty addictive and you have to really grind pretty hard to earn enough money to build a decent ship - unless you use the cheats, which would probably instantly ruin the game completely.Definitely worth the couple bucks I spent on it, I probably wouldn't pay retail for it. However I'm a cheapskate in general so that statement holds true for me with pretty much anything.			"

Anway i started free roaming and collected stuff from junk out in space and traded them at nearest planet.

BUT!  the fact that it never fails to crash and force-close numerous times in an hour has me INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED.  i am on a tight schedule being a full time student. so my time i do have to play around on this chosen game  can easily be spoiled by the disturbing malfunctions.  pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee look into this DEVS!  its so good but so 50-50.

												It's still buggy.  I've been locked up 5 times in the last 5 hours... it's basically the way I stop playing I guess.  Everything from transitioning across the galaxy (next sector) to opening the options menu.  Needs to get a bit more stable.  I'd like to see landing (anchor) sequences and maybe some basic docking grapics like Darkstar One, showing that you are IN a station.  Other than the graphics, it reminds me of Elite from 1984-ish.  Keep it up though... I hope the modders really get with it.  I play Skyrim with hundreds of mods and it's pushed that game past 1000 hours and I'm still on my first character.			"

												Great game, great devs. The game is constantly updated and at it's $34.99 price it's a great buy, forget the sales. If you can get it on sale, 100% grab it, buy one for your friends too. The game's everything you could want in a space themed game and it only gets better!10/10 would recommend.			"

I recall having stability issued with the original game, but have had little to none with this one. Fun space exploring and trading with plenty of pew pew pew. Great visuals. Crappy camera in my opinion, and minimalist control scheme, I thought.  Still, a  great game. 8/10			"

												An enjoyable but rather limited single player experience. Graphics, music and sound effects are good. Side-missions are a tad repetitive and being a space simulation, I wish there was some more content. In that regard it's a bit too shallow for my taste and not comparable to the superb Freelancer. Don't bother with the lackluster campaign and it's weak story, but go straight for the enjoyable freeroam sandbox game. The mod community offers some nice content, which enriches the game experience.			"

												A solid open world space sim in the vein of Elite, X-series, Evochron, Oolite, etc.  Purchased at release, I haven't gotten around to it until recently, and was quite surprised at what I found.  Often games in this genre can be a bit overwhelming in the beginning, but that's not the case here - very easy to jump into and play.  In fact, straight out of the gate I've been able to do bounty hunter missions...  very cool.I have yet to try out mods, but I suspect they will add quite a bit to this game.  Really looking forward to deliving deeper into this one.			"

												As a fan of the X-series I can see a huge amount of potential here. I really hope people keep checking it out so the developers will have an incentive to expand the scope of their enjoyable and stylish foundation, continue to add more items, characters, goals, and areas to explore. I monitor their patches and updates because side missions were hinted at in the menu systems but not implemented when I played.

								Regularly updated by the developers and quickly nearing completion. How many EA titles can say that?A great space flier with fairly simple flight mechanics - a nice change after some recent space game fails. This is not a dogfighting game. You spend most of your time flying bigger boats and trying to keep as many turrets on your target as possible. Standard mission running, war participation, trading and mining. The developers are keeping the campaign under wraps until release, so I don't have enough information to say how well it all ties together. I will say that the game is playable, as is, without the campaign. Random missions pop up on your map so it is more than possible to advance without it.The price is great for the gameplay value and the campaign isn't even implimented yet. Very few bugs or flaws, and the ones that do make it in are quickly squished.			"

												18 hours in and so far this game is exellent. VERY similar to Freelancer for old school gamers out there. For new people think 3rd person space shooter with trading, mission, piracy or whatever. There are tons of different ships, weapons, loadouts and play styles.Graphics are excellent and it runs really well on my rig.It can be hard in places, so don't be afraid to go away, save up and buy a bigger ship. The mission level indicators can be a little bit off. Some are waaaaaay harder than you think, then others will be easy money.Still that is life in space:I don't careI'm still freeYou can't take the sky from me.			"

								I find it hard to say that I recommend this game, or even that I do not.I was a huge fan of Freelancer, and I have spent years looking for something that could fill the hole that Freelancer left behind. While Starpoint Gemini 2 comes close, it's not... quite... there yet. This game is still in development (just recently in beta), so bear that in mind.All of the pieces are there - free roaming, trading, space battles - however, SG2 seems to fall flat a key area - ship movement. The starting vessel, a frigate, I believe, looks like a fish, moves like a fish, but steers like a cow. Most combat is spent circling around trying to get a bead on your enemy for about 1/2 a second before they move out of view once more. By that point, his buddy has been firing lasers up your butt. I'm a space combat noob with this game, but even Freelancer felt like it had more ""zip"" to ship movement. I had to crank the mouse sensitivity just to feel like there was some kind of response to the controls.Graphically, it's quite nice. Ships, planets, stations and space ""stuff"" is lovely to look at.The game requires some optimization. When you are in a serious furball with many other ships, I find that the game really chugs and slows down - even if you are not involved in the combat, and it's just nearby.The game is not multiplayer, and I am not clear on whether or not it is ever going to be multiplayer. That is also a major wall for a lot of people. Freelancer was great. Freelancer with friends was amazing.This is not a Freelancer replacement, though it comes close. If you're not concerned about a multiplayer experience, you're not going to find a game that delivers what this one does at this price point. However, I would wait for later in the beta cycle or even for wide release. It's not quite ready for prime time.			"

												My original review (while the game was still in EA) is shown at the bottom. Please note that the sections on performance are not entirely relevant now, since the game runs much better.REVIEW AFTER RELEASE:---------------------------------------------------------The game is a mix between Freelancer and X3. You can command fleets, hire wingmen, level up skills, buy massive battleships, trade, do missions. It's a lot like Darkstar One too, if we are comparing - but a lot better.The focus here is on large ship battles - and with many ships, rather than smaller dogfigthing. Your starting ship is fairly large ( gunship), and some of the stuff I have seen to buy looks cool. You can climb the ranks and get battleships, dreadnoughts and the like, and command officers and mercs to help you out in battle, either on your own ship or as a wingman. You can even board enemy ships and take control of them, or tractor ships back to stations to sell them.It looks lovely and has a massive open map to explore, complete with anomalies, slipstreams, wormholes, gates, planets, stations asteroid fields, nebula etc. - all you would come to expect from such a game and more.The campaign is basic, but enjoyable. The voice-acting is absolutely atrocious though - the accents are all over the place and it is detrimental in an necessary way. You also have the option to free-roam, doing missions as they come along, trading or becoming a pirate. It has a complete reputation and trading system, allowing you to become anything you want.A lack of multiplayer hits hard, since this game would be infinitely better with it and a real shame it is not included. It also seems to have a fairly repetitive and grindy feel to it - hence the mark of 6/10. If it had multiplayer I think my score would jump to 8/10 instantly though.Jimbo Rating: 6/10REVIEW WHILE IN EA:---------------------------------------------------------It's a mix between Freelancer and X3. You can command fleets, hire wingmen, level up skills, buy massive battleships, trade, do missions.

Your starting ship is fairly large, and some of the stuff I have seen to buy looks cool. You can even board enemy ships and take control of them, or tractor ships back to stations to sell them.It looks lovely, but does seem to suffer from some performance issues. Putting the lengthy loading screens aside, I frequently experienced 0FPS drops when entering new sectors (occurrs quite often), which is a royal pain in the♥♥♥♥♥- especially if it happens to be a wing of enemy fighters.It's still beta, but if they can fix the performance issues (severe slow downs, long load times, crashing) then this game will be a winner.Jimbo Rating: 6/10Note: why have I ""not recommended"" this game - even though it's good? Simple: it's nigh-on un-playable (or very frustrating) at the moment, what with the aforementioned performance issues.			"

Its not hardcore and even people who dont like space sims could love kinda arcade side of the game.GO BUY IT IF U CAN...THROW MONEY AT THE DEVELOPERS CAUSE THEY DESERVE IT.			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is easily the best space adventure game available!  Little Green Men Games did a superb job in incorporating those features that make a space exploration game enjoyable while avoiding anything that would be dull.There is a main-story quest line to keep you engaged with multiple side quests to mix things up.  Space travel feels exciting and scenic without taking years in between events (with added wormholes to speed things up a little more).  There are space pirates, some dangerous while others are targets of opportunity for some quick cash, especially if you capture their ship to sell to a nearby friendly space station.There seems to be just the right number of ship and weapon variety to not get overwhelmed while still feeling like you have a choice in weapon loadout and ship type.  There are even some that you acquire through quest lines or obtaining blueprints for exceptional weapon types, including torpedoes, plasma cannons, railguns, etc.Lots of Steam achievements, beautiful scenery, fantastic spacestation design.

												I went into this game as a buffer between waiting on a few other games im looking forward to.  Keeping that in mind I do love all scifi/space games in general.  The beginning was difficult i was having a hard time learning the controls and ended up giving up within the first two hours.  I gave it another try and got the basics down and now am 36 hours into the game.  I found myself loving it and enjoying the mystery of the story.  From what i expect from a 30 usd game it surpasses in all categories.  Yeah tutorials are not great,  the voice overs are off sometimes  and not perfect, finding the help section or explainations in the game about buying selling or how to bounty hunt and null and void.  But with all that it is a 30 buck game reg price and i bought it for under 10 bucks.  I rather enjoy figuring out how to figure out all the aspects of making money in game.  I say 2 thumbs up for what it is and i enjoy it even though i dislike 3rd person or control the ship games where im not in a first person view.  36 hours into it im not even in the dlc yet and havent even explored all the space available in the game aswell.  I say its a win win!!!!			"

Easy money there when you tow it to station or planet. Then you can use that money to buy better ships and better equipment.It is somewhat grindy i agree, but any game can be grindy just like EVE for example. It's how you play it i suppose.			"

												Yes get this game, wait do you need to hear the dialog and be given direction? Okay less one sided. But if those are both no then hell yes get this game.Where to start, I got this game on sale, and wanted to refund it. However I gave it one more try and managed to get through the first little bit, and all of a sudden I loved it like crazy...Side notes I guessI really like the ship details and variety, although I wish there were more. (I always want more ships)The story line got kind of lame and or broken near the end.The main dialog is painful. Punishment for warcrimes painful...So if you are going to give it a go -Turn off the dialog! ----Do IT! (the music is nice though, and in freeroam the dialog is much less death)-And get ready to be spammed like crazy by ""helpful"" tutorial pop ups as soon as you start. (some are very helpful)----You can skip them or dissable them at your discretion though so not a big deal.-You can zoom out with the numpad +/- keys-You need to restore default keybinds when you start, or the delete key doesn't bring up your tactical view (which once up is handy)I think those are the main things that coloured my lack of enjoyment with it at first, so knowing that you should have a much better run of it. Oh I found the gunner class was less entertaining than the other two classes, even if you are mostly planning on shooting everythingBut seriously I have had a heck of a lot of fun with this game, and will likely continue to do so for a good bit more. I haven't tried all the ships yet and there are still some achievements to go. "

												Up front:  Not deep enough or fun enough to warrant a $35 entry fee.  Definitely worth it for $10.Pros:+Artwork.  Ships and backdrops are pleasant enough to look at and cruising through space in your ride of choice is nice.+Simple, easy to use interface and controls.  Love the interface.+Straightforward missions+Stable and nicely refined.  Have yet to run in to a ""broken quest"" or a significant bug of any kind.+Decent enough sized sandbox system to play in.  It takes 15 minutes to fly across Gemini even with the fastest ship. +Game adjusts difficulty rather well as you progress to bigger ships.+Soundtrack is a definite plus that matches the mood of the task at hand.+Lots of factions.  No, they don't really fight all that differently but...they are labeled differently.+Faction loyalty.  It is simple to see who you are friends with and who you should avoid.  System is easy and intuitive.+Decent variety of ships, loots and weapons keeps things interesting.+Fighters and bombers can be launched from you ship.+Perk system.  As you gain rank you can shape your fighting style and abilities.  Easy and effective without being OP.+Steam workshop enabled.  I find looking at the hind end of an Intrepid Class is nicer than the stock ships.Cons:-Game progression can be very grindy at times.-Uncompelling campaign became unbearable because of horrid voice acting.  I began playing free-roam instead.-Ships all fly and feel the same.  A battleship handles just as well as a frigate, it just has more weapons, shields etc. :(-Unable to target specific enemy ship systems.-Sensor range is pitifully low.  You'll always see things before your sensors do.-Combat feels shallow a good portion of the time.  Tactics rarely decide outcome, usually ship stats are it.-Combat AI is downright stupid at times. As a level 18 I destroyed a level 70 pirate because they kept chasing me.  My one pea-shooter gun could hit them from 800 out, their guns could only reach 550.  As they chased me I eventually wore down their forward shield and nearly destroyed them before they turned and ran.  At that point I ran them down, overtook and finished by shooting through their non-existent forward shield.-Controls are simple, but can be awkward at times.  No target padlock option. (Really?)-3rd person views only.  You will never be ""in your ship""and that hurts immersion.-No sense of running a crew.  Your ""crewmen"" are cards with stats that don't progress.-Game does not track ships destroyed, troops lost, total money accrued etc.  Nice touches that are easy to make.-Small variety in mission types.

												I Love this game. Its a space RPG but you never you leave your ship. Sure its a bit old but graphics and gameplay are great.Its not too simplistic to be considered an arcade space shooter but not a mad in depth space simulator. Its quite easy to learn how to pilot, fight, nav and trade. Along the way you got many ship upgrades and ships. However be prepared to earn the credits to buy these. The space fighting is alot of fun, however its very level dependent if you engage with an emeny above your level you die. So run away tactics are sometime needed until you own a fleet of ships. There are a few problems sometimes the space fights can just kill you in seconds. You can only save you game at stations which adds to tension but alot of time you just end up replaying the same mission or area of space because of it. The soundtrack I tured off within 4 hours of gameplay its repitive and anoying and the sound effects could be better.So gamrplay is quickly learned but sometimes the fights are too difficult.soundtrack could be better.graphics are up to standard.A fun space adventure.

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is a pretty fun Space Sim in my opinion. Trading, Capturing Ships, Fleet battles, Exploring, and just flying around and admiring the skyboxes are all a treat in this game. The graphics are good looking in many areas. The Gemini system is pretty damn big, too. On the down side, the game seems to have a hard time keeping a steady frame-rate, no matter how powerful your rig is. It's especially bad in large fleet battles. Other than that, I'd say it's definitely worth checking out. At least until Star Citizen comes out.			"

												I want to like this game however the lower quality voice acting and the eventual repetitiveness of all of the mission are what broke it for me. There are still some missions that completely bug out for me and I am unable to complete them until I fail it and try again. The main story missions can be long and you can only save at the space stations so when it does fail half way through you have to start all over again and push through the voice acting once more.Other than mousing over the faction and reading it's description there is nothing that makes any of the factions feel personal in any way.There is the basis for a great game here and some might enjoy this title. I however cannot recommend it.Update:For a 9 man indie team then this is a very well done game. I must admit I did no research before reviewing. I'm very impressed that the developers care so deeply about their project to comment on my small post and describe their plans and ambitions for the future. I have decided to change my recommendation because in light of this I want this game to succeed. Space games are the future!			"

												A quick review for this really cool space game.I spent 35 hours on this game, In that time I finished the base game + one DLC, reached maximum Level and bought on the best ship. So even if I am not an expert, I think I can write a fair review.+ Great Value.  You easily can beat the game 2 / 3 times without feeling bored. And the Dev team enhanced the First Starpoint to the new engine, it should give you around 50 hours more of gameplay.+ Cool graphic; not realistic like Elite Dangerous for example, but a very nice representation of space.+ Nice gameplay /  Mix of Rpg and tactic space game ; if you play in high difficulty it can be very challenging.+ A lot of things to do.+ A lot of ships and weapons to suit all tastes.+ A extremely nice and responsive Dev Team. Basically if you post anything ( interesting ) on the steam forum, there is good chances that a Dev will be the first to answer.+ A perfect example of how a Early Access should be done and handled.+ Mod support.- Scenario not great.- A little bit short. I know it is against my + on greate value, but the thing is  I think 35 hours to reach max level is a little bit to quick; of course if you want the best weapons you will have to spend a lot of times, but it lacks the motivation of leveling up.- At the end you are incredibly overpowered. Some may consider that a + , as a kind of reward but not for me.So highly recommend this game made by a very nice and little team of passionate Dev.Will by their next project without hesitation. "

												I went into this game as a buffer between waiting on a few other games im looking forward to.  Keeping that in mind I do love all scifi/space games in general.  The beginning was difficult i was having a hard time learning the controls and ended up giving up within the first two hours.  I gave it another try and got the basics down and now am 36 hours into the game.  I found myself loving it and enjoying the mystery of the story.  From what i expect from a 30 usd game it surpasses in all categories.  Yeah tutorials are not great,  the voice overs are off sometimes  and not perfect, finding the help section or explainations in the game about buying selling or how to bounty hunt and null and void.  But with all that it is a 30 buck game reg price and i bought it for under 10 bucks.  I rather enjoy figuring out how to figure out all the aspects of making money in game.  I say 2 thumbs up for what it is and i enjoy it even though i dislike 3rd person or control the ship games where im not in a first person view.  36 hours into it im not even in the dlc yet and havent even explored all the space available in the game aswell.  I say its a win win!!!!			"

												Yes get this game, wait do you need to hear the dialog and be given direction? Okay less one sided. But if those are both no then hell yes get this game.Where to start, I got this game on sale, and wanted to refund it. However I gave it one more try and managed to get through the first little bit, and all of a sudden I loved it like crazy...Side notes I guessI really like the ship details and variety, although I wish there were more. (I always want more ships)The story line got kind of lame and or broken near the end.The main dialog is painful. Punishment for warcrimes painful...So if you are going to give it a go -Turn off the dialog! ----Do IT! (the music is nice though, and in freeroam the dialog is much less death)-And get ready to be spammed like crazy by ""helpful"" tutorial pop ups as soon as you start. (some are very helpful)----You can skip them or dissable them at your discretion though so not a big deal.-You can zoom out with the numpad +/- keys-You need to restore default keybinds when you start, or the delete key doesn't bring up your tactical view (which once up is handy)I think those are the main things that coloured my lack of enjoyment with it at first, so knowing that you should have a much better run of it. Oh I found the gunner class was less entertaining than the other two classes, even if you are mostly planning on shooting everythingBut seriously I have had a heck of a lot of fun with this game, and will likely continue to do so for a good bit more. I haven't tried all the ships yet and there are still some achievements to go. "

												Up front:  Not deep enough or fun enough to warrant a $35 entry fee.  Definitely worth it for $10.Pros:+Artwork.  Ships and backdrops are pleasant enough to look at and cruising through space in your ride of choice is nice.+Simple, easy to use interface and controls.  Love the interface.+Straightforward missions+Stable and nicely refined.  Have yet to run in to a ""broken quest"" or a significant bug of any kind.+Decent enough sized sandbox system to play in.  It takes 15 minutes to fly across Gemini even with the fastest ship. +Game adjusts difficulty rather well as you progress to bigger ships.+Soundtrack is a definite plus that matches the mood of the task at hand.+Lots of factions.  No, they don't really fight all that differently but...they are labeled differently.+Faction loyalty.  It is simple to see who you are friends with and who you should avoid.  System is easy and intuitive.+Decent variety of ships, loots and weapons keeps things interesting.+Fighters and bombers can be launched from you ship.+Perk system.  As you gain rank you can shape your fighting style and abilities.  Easy and effective without being OP.+Steam workshop enabled.  I find looking at the hind end of an Intrepid Class is nicer than the stock ships.Cons:-Game progression can be very grindy at times.-Uncompelling campaign became unbearable because of horrid voice acting.  I began playing free-roam instead.-Ships all fly and feel the same.  A battleship handles just as well as a frigate, it just has more weapons, shields etc. :(-Unable to target specific enemy ship systems.-Sensor range is pitifully low.  You'll always see things before your sensors do.-Combat feels shallow a good portion of the time.  Tactics rarely decide outcome, usually ship stats are it.-Combat AI is downright stupid at times. As a level 18 I destroyed a level 70 pirate because they kept chasing me.  My one pea-shooter gun could hit them from 800 out, their guns could only reach 550.  As they chased me I eventually wore down their forward shield and nearly destroyed them before they turned and ran.  At that point I ran them down, overtook and finished by shooting through their non-existent forward shield.-Controls are simple, but can be awkward at times.  No target padlock option. (Really?)-3rd person views only.  You will never be ""in your ship""and that hurts immersion.-No sense of running a crew.  Your ""crewmen"" are cards with stats that don't progress.-Game does not track ships destroyed, troops lost, total money accrued etc.  Nice touches that are easy to make.-Small variety in mission types.  Scan something, shoot something, ferry something.  That's pretty much it.-No ability to build up a true fleet, can just hire a couple mercs.-No feel of actually influencing events in the game world.-When you dock at a station or planet, all interactions are handled through a simple splash screen.Summary:Starpoint Gemini 2 is a nice little space romp for casual/arcade crowds.  I would personally prefer options available to transform this basic game experience into something a little more hardcore.  Replayability is hurt by lack of simulation options, inability to shape conflict and shallow combat mechanics.  Less than 20 hours in I have a dreadnought class warship, have maxed out alliances with half the factions and explored roughly 60% of the systems in the game.  I do not feel as though I will make any substantial new discoveries at this point, just find combinations of things already previously seen.  The game has begun to feel like a ""digital fishbowl"" but may come back if I find myself in the mood for mindless point and click with a spaceship involved.  Score: 7.5			"

												A slight variation on the standard space-battle game in that you get more firing control and ship manouvrability.  The tutorial is a little sketchy, simply as list of thing to read as you play along, rather than a hands-on episode specially designed for beginners.  Some great movie clips along the way, and graphics in general somewhat superior to the more basic plethora of space games out there.  Looks like it will hold my interest for longer than the ""usual"" disappointing games of this type.			"

												I love this game!! Though it should come with a warning: ""Warning, this game will make you lose sleep!"" heh. I've played quite a few space games throughout the years, X3 series, Wing Commander, Freespace 2, Starlancer, EVE, Star Wars X-Wing and more and this one ranks right up there imo. If you're into these types of games I highly recommend checking this one out! Pros:-Great graphics-Epic music-Fun sandboxy type of do whatever you want freedom-Devs are very active and responsive (big seller for me)-Ease of modding (probably my favorite aspect of this game)Cons:-Requires a bit of tweaking to optimize and run smoothly on lower end systems. (Though there are mods that help, and the community is always willing to help with this)-No Multiplayer (but this isn't a factor for me, in fact, it's one of the reasons I bought this game...no griefers, no obsessively overpowerful others pwning you within the first ten seconds of you logging in. And it doesn't take 8 months to be able to fly a battleship! :) )I can't think of too many cons because the devs are always working on improving things, and fixing the few bugs that have surfaced here and there. Every time I think of a con, I find out they've already fixed it!Also, I have never actually published a mod before this game. It is insanely easy to mod...you want to change your loading screen? Easy. Want to change the music? Sure, you don't have to go through some maddening process of decrypting game files just to get to them, and then re-encrypt them using 20 different programs just to do that. Want to fly a ship that looks like a banana? Yep. And you don't have to learn eleventy different programming languages to do that. There are fantastic guides that help as well. And the devs are always around somewhere willing to help. Yea, big plus for me.The sandboxy aspect is a big plus too. Want to just roam around for a bit and blow stuff up? Sure. Want to just mine and get rich trading? Yep. Want to be a wanted criminal with a limited life expectancy? No worries.			"

												This is (in my opinion) one of the greater games on Steam. For those who are looking for a TASTE of EVE here you go. This game is almost like a baby stepping stone into the EVE universe. While the game does have its flaws as I will state, I believe that this sandbox game has great potental. Now, I will say that I do not believe it is worth $40 just yet. The modding community has yet to take off and you can cheat the game by simply opening your save in Notepad++ and editing the data. Which I believe somewhat cuts the fun out of comparing achievements to other players globally. The missions of hunting the heros are somewhat wonky as well because it seems they jump systems if you watch the map. Just as well, there is a very large difficulty spike in the game that you must prepare for. As you reach a certain level your enemies gain vet rank and you probably have yet to make enough money to even afford a ship that can stand up to them. (Unless you did what I do and stole a ship from the pirates) Now for the positives. This game has BEAUTIFUL scenery. For an indie game, a lot of time was put into this game and its atmosphere. The story and voice acting are a bit stale, but the fact that they are there is awesome. And the story, while being a bit dry, actually does make some form of sense. So kudos! At the start of the game you may pick to be a captain, engineer or another class that excels in firing. You may hire mercenaries to board ships or even follow you in to battle which is what the captains perks stand for. The shooter class perks somwhat speaks for itself. But I played as an engineer as the perks seemed to outweigh the others. The story is the same regardless of your class, but each class has its own specialties with 4 main ""moves"" But those moves have 5 evolutions within each allowing you to alter them as you go to tailor your playstyle up to the max level of 80. There are a plethora of planets to explore as well as tons of ships to purchase and try out. All in all, if you enjoy sandbox style games and as well as enjoy the beauty of flight or space travel, I recommend this game. I also recommend trying it if your thinking about EVE online. This game is a MUCH simpler thing. But it has many of the same aspects as well as can help you decide if you would even enjoy the simple aspects of what EVE offers before you worry about the more complex matters.			"

												So far really enjoying this game. I am a huge fan of open-universe space games with ship and fleet customisations, but I do not like MMO-games (so unfortunately EVE is out of the picture for me). This game, to me, fills an X shaped void. It really offers a lot of what X3 had, and with some new and fresh ideas because it isn't X! And where the original Starpoint Gemini I couldn't get into because it simply wasn't as good as X, SG2 genuinly is. It is also particularly well timed, I loved all of the previous X games, until they released X reunion, which is probably the most sad, dissapointing and pathetic game ever made and totally missed the point of X and why it was good. I am glad to see that the developers of Starpoint Gemini have worked on, enhanced and listened to what space-gamers really want, and developed something that really fits. I am excitedly looking forward to where they take SG games in the future. I know I am basically saying ""it is the new X"", believe me when I say that coming from me, that is huge praise. If I were to nit pick, I would say that SG2s UI could use a little tweaking, the ability to zoom out on the map and a tool for selecting your own ships on the map and I'd like to see some of the fleet controls from X3 (for example telling a ships computer to go somewhere, protect something or trade something). I would also like to see space station ownership, and more skills and mods aimed at ship capture. But these are not huge criticisms, just where I think SG could be improved.			"

The modding community has yet to take off and you can cheat the game by simply opening your save in Notepad++ and editing the data. Which I believe somewhat cuts the fun out of comparing achievements to other players globally. The missions of hunting the heros are somewhat wonky as well because it seems they jump systems if you watch the map. Just as well, there is a very large difficulty spike in the game that you must prepare for. As you reach a certain level your enemies gain vet rank and you probably have yet to make enough money to even afford a ship that can stand up to them. (Unless you did what I do and stole a ship from the pirates) Now for the positives. This game has BEAUTIFUL scenery. For an indie game, a lot of time was put into this game and its atmosphere. The story and voice acting are a bit stale, but the fact that they are there is awesome. And the story, while being a bit dry, actually does make some form of sense. So kudos! At the start of the game you may pick to be a captain, engineer or another class that excels in firing. You may hire mercenaries to board ships or even follow you in to battle which is what the captains perks stand for. The shooter class perks somwhat speaks for itself. But I played as an engineer as the perks seemed to outweigh the others. The story is the same regardless of your class, but each class has its own specialties with 4 main ""moves"" But those moves have 5 evolutions within each allowing you to alter them as you go to tailor your playstyle up to the max level of 80. There are a plethora of planets to explore as well as tons of ships to purchase and try out. All in all, if you enjoy sandbox style games and as well as enjoy the beauty of flight or space travel, I recommend this game. I also recommend trying it if your thinking about EVE online. This game is a MUCH simpler thing. But it has many of the same aspects as well as can help you decide if you would even enjoy the simple aspects of what EVE offers before you worry about the more complex matters.			"

												So far really enjoying this game. I am a huge fan of open-universe space games with ship and fleet customisations, but I do not like MMO-games (so unfortunately EVE is out of the picture for me). This game, to me, fills an X shaped void. It really offers a lot of what X3 had, and with some new and fresh ideas because it isn't X! And where the original Starpoint Gemini I couldn't get into because it simply wasn't as good as X, SG2 genuinly is. It is also particularly well timed, I loved all of the previous X games, until they released X reunion, which is probably the most sad, dissapointing and pathetic game ever made and totally missed the point of X and why it was good. I am glad to see that the developers of Starpoint Gemini have worked on, enhanced and listened to what space-gamers really want, and developed something that really fits. I am excitedly looking forward to where they take SG games in the future. I know I am basically saying ""it is the new X"", believe me when I say that coming from me, that is huge praise. If I were to nit pick, I would say that SG2s UI could use a little tweaking, the ability to zoom out on the map and a tool for selecting your own ships on the map and I'd like to see some of the fleet controls from X3 (for example telling a ships computer to go somewhere, protect something or trade something). I would also like to see space station ownership, and more skills and mods aimed at ship capture. But these are not huge criticisms, just where I think SG could be improved.			"

												If you were a fan of the old Freelancer games then this game is for you. There is nothign cooler then sneaking up on your bounty target cloaked then firing a barage of missiles at its critical systems and then hacking the ship while your blasters tear it apart. The combat is engaging as well as the other aspects of the game. It is like a mix of Freelancer and the X series with a very user friendly interface. Fight pirates, trade, explore and everything else you love about a good 4X game. I recommend this to all fans of the genre.			"

												Starpint Gemini 2 is the definite successor of Wing Commander: Privateer and Freelancer.  I have been waiting for many years for a team to go back to the simple roots of many upgradeable ships and challenging freelance type missions and this game DELIVERS BOTH!  The learning curve is relatively easy and the incorporation of using the mouse and keypad versus a joystick has been accomplished (IMO) flawlessly.  I am enthralled by the fact that regardless of how much I upgrade my ship (currently running a Cruiser and looking to upgrade to a Dreadnaught) that the missions are still challenging.This is not a game of incredible voice acting or a fantastic storyline but the visuals and extremely sound mechanics make the game a pleasure to play.  My favortie addition is the boarding feature!  Wait until you have a ship with 90 or so troops and you can take Frigates with 30 - 50 tropps with ease and make a big payday when you tow your capture into port.  (NOTE:  Click on the GREEN flag in the troop transport window, after it turns from gray to green, to send more troops.  This is not spelled out in the manual.)Congrats to theis set of independent game creators!  Great job!			"

												I wrote this review in January of 2015 on Metacritic.  I thought I posted it to Steam, but did not.  This game deserves a review.  Here's a copy/paste of my former review.  The game has only gotten better through expansions.I am a Star Citizen backer. Want to know a dirty little secret? I love and crave 3rd person space games. En route to searching for something to fill this desire, I came across this game. ""A Steam sale?"" I asked. ""Twenty-four bucks?"" I blinked. ""I spend that on 2-3 drinks at a restaurant with the wife..."" So, I plucked this one out of the Steam shelf, downloaded and started playing. Eight hours later I looked up and saw it was 4am. ""Woah..."" The next (read: later that) day I dove into the Starpoint Gemini 2 Community and learned I was late to a really cool party. Did you love Freelancer? Are you craving a 3rd person Space game? What are you waiting for...? Pick this gem up ASAP. There are few games that are so worth your money that you'll want to encourage others to purchase, but this is certainly one for me. In a day when space sims are seeing a great resurgence, it's refreshing to see a game that's not afraid to be 3rd person and give the player a bit of a relaxed take on space. I feel like a Malcom Reynolds, flying around in my ship, always with my eye on a new shiny, but lovingly holding onto, in my case, ""Big Red,"" until the time is truly right. There's dangers around every planet, but I've got a crew, a purpose, seemingly endless space to explore (certainly more than my limited time allows), and a ship. There's even a fun plot-line to follow along as you make your way in the galaxy--or don't; whatever--it's all up to you. I can assure you that if you want a rewarding, relaxing, and immersive (but not taking itself too seriously) space game, this is it. I give it a 9 (I'd have done 9.5 if it let me) because of the somewhat outdated UI, and the graphics are not the most polished. That said, the graphics do not detract from the game too much and again, it's sort of a breath of fresh air of late with the Elite: Dangerous's and Star Citizen's of the world. The development team has their ear to the forums and though I am new to the scene, they appear to be largely shaping the game around their community. It's mod friendly, and seemingly more so as time goes on, and there's already some great mods out there. It's much of anything you want in a fun game. Cheers.			"

												Star Point Gemin 2 is a fantasic starship space genre game that will have you playing for hours on end. I’ve spent more than 60 hours with the game at this point and I’ve only just scratched the surface. I’ve primarily been playing in the games “free roam” mode as that was the real draw of the game for me. I knew from the outset that I wanted a game that gave me the ability to explore, fight, mine and trade at my own leisure and do so in my own ship like a “real” space captain. After researching SP♥♥♥♥ bit I realized that this would be the game that would allow me to do all of that.I’m not a diehard space sim player so games like EVE Online and Star Trek Online have always kind of intimidated me. I’ve never really had an interest in the X3 series (my loss probably) but I have played Sins of a Solar Empire and the Homeworld series. It's been a while since I've played anything space related but lately I’ve become re-interested in the genre with games like Star Citizen and Elite: Dangerous on the horizon. I knew I wanted to play a game that felt huge and expansive but I didn’t want to play a game that made me feel like a small fish in a huge pond. I’m a casual player so the size and scope of this game feels just right to me. The game's setting is huge and there is a lot to do in it. Also, it seems like the devs are really committed to making the game better all the time which made the choice to buy it all the more easy to make. The fact that I’ve continued to play it so much is a testament to how good it actually is.SPG2 reminds me specifically of two games I’ve played before, Nexus: The Jupiter Incident and Star Trek: Starfleet Command. Although I’ve played many other space genre games since, I really wanted to play something that felt similar to those two games. SPG2 has a surprising amount in common with Starfleet Command which also allowed you to “tractor beam” aka grapple ships, scan anomalies and commandeer other spacecraft with “marines” aka troopers. I haven’t played that game in over 15 years but I remember how much fun it was to do those things in the game.These are some of the things I like about SPG2:-	the music is great especially the main theme-	the ship designs are cool and I know there are still tons more to discover-	the space station designs are great and varied which is a plus-	the variety of weapons and their FX in game look great-       the descriptions for items and npcs in the game are numerous and often amusing-       there are many mods availiable which help to enhance gamplayThe randomness of missions and enemies is great but whether or not you like this aspect of the game will depend on how much you like doing things in this universe. After awhile the missions can seem repetitive but luckily the fact that the level required to do each mission changes all the time, forces you to decide which missions to do or not to do. This in turn helps mix things up a bit and keep things interesting.The only issues I have with the game so far are the way the menus in stations and on planets were a bit confusing at first and still seem a bit cumbersome to navigate. Also I wish there was a bit more 'humanity' in the game. By that I just mean it would be cool if officers had portraits in addition to their names and when ships attacked you they too had portraits instead of just insignias. I know that's a huge 'ask' as there are already a huge amount of randomized officer names in the game. Perhaps a feature that allowed you upload your own portraits to the game (specifically for officers) could be cool. Also, I’m not entirely sure, but I think officers gain experience the longer they are on your ship. I hope so but it would also be cool if they could steadily gain loyalty for additional bonuses.Other than that I’ve really enjoyed this game and am glad I bought it.			"

												I'm going to give this a 5/10 at the moment.  The content that is present is well done and relatively stable/bug free.  Ship combat is fun for a while, and space is visually interesting with a few suprises.  But get a few hours in and the game starts to feel kind of pointless.  There is a faction system, but it doesn't do much of anything.  There is trading and mining, but neither give money at anywhere near the rate fighting does.  There are generated ""missions"", but they are extremely easy and give very little in the way of rewards (you'll probably do them just to have something to do).  There are enemy bases and structures, but you can't destroy them (you can get them to one health and they just hang there, and frankly it isn't hard at all to do that).  You end up collecting money to buy a bigger ship to collect more money to buy an even bigger ship (which isn't very rewarding, as the ship models are so small in relation to one another you dont get the sense that you have a bigger ship)...The game isn't garbage, and the devs are very nice and responsive.  At $5-$10 give it a shot, but not at $40.  The caveat here is there is a very soid framework to make a much better game (really this game is in the bin with so many others that are really in early-mid beta, but release early to make money).  If there is a content update that adds player bases and the ability to capture territory, balances out mining and trading, and puts in other end-game content and empire building mechanics, this game will be a 9/10 easy.  It feels like these things were intended, but just haven't made it in.  So, if you see a big update after this review, maybe give it a try.  Otherwise, skip it until there is a big steam sale (or skip entirely, if a space grind isn't your thing).			"

												With the sudden increase in popularity of Space Sims thank's to the Star Citizen crowdfunding campaign I went looking for a Freelancer successor to keep me busy in the meantime. This game is it.Freeroam mode is great and you should get at least 5-10 hours of good fun out of it. In that time you should be able to get to the endgame with the best ship and after that there's not much else to do - short of restarting as another character or on another path.The campaign feels like a hurried add-on. The writing is cheesy, the voice acting cringe-worthy. If you want a single player game that stands toe to toe with Freelancer, you won't find it here.Get this game for the sandbox mode that is freeroam and go explore the Gemini star system!			"

								GREAT GAME!  This blows other open-""world"" space games (Evochron Merc, X: Rebirth, etc.) out of the water as far as fun and dynamics go.  You don't have to grind too much to make geat profits.  Want a new ship?  Find one you can beat, board it, capture it, captain it, then work your way up the food chain.  Environments beautifully done, as well as artwork on the ships and weapons effects.  Combat is very tactical and lgical, taking into account where your weapons are placed and requiring you be at a certain azimuth to fire from them (left side, right side, front, back), so it takes some thought and power management during battles, especially when against tough ships.  I definitely recommend!			"

												Very slow to start; the controls could be explained better.   Crashed into Trinity about 5 times when I was supposed to ""LAND ON PLANET""  wasnt until I asked on Forums that ""Land""= ""Anchor"".   Scanning of ship wasnt vry helpful either until I accidently hit the Middle mouse button (which I seldom ever used before)Travel is slow, have to have lots of patience, although I think with upgraded ships & a better knowledge of the travel short-cuts (t gates, rifts, blackholes) it could be faster.   Admittedly im less than a couple hour in, first impressions only.Not for everyone.			"

								This game has a TON of potential!  It is basically Privateer/Freelancer but with a 3rd person view and tactical style controls, and so far looks amazing.  I find the combat very enjoyable.  It's already better than X-Rebirth in its current state.  I can see I will be dumping a lot of hours into this before it is even released.  Now that there is a workshop, there are going to be lots of reasons to keep coming back to this before it is released.  Still lots of work to be done, but I am having fun regardless!			"

												I am mostly a multiplayer gamer, love COOP, most multiplayer games, however there are some which are fun offline, of course, and this is one of them. Unique gameplay, easy controls, especially when you're mostly committed to mouse and keyboard style gameplay, Haven't played in a while, though I haven't played much of anything lately; landscraping, as opposed to computer work which I've done for 20+ years, these days, am just tired when I get home from work, though if I didn't have a wonderful woman, cooking amazing food and keeping me enthralled with her ways, I'd probably game more, and before long I'll be back gaming and doing computer work. I love to work out-of-doors, but my skills are strong on the side of the technical realm. Back to the game, It is not too complex, don't get me wrong, I love complexity, but Starpoint Gemini does require quick thinking and reaction; observing it evolve through updates / patches since I bought it in the spring of 2014, the developers seem pretty intent on making this game something to speak of and they are certainly not ditching their creation, unlike other devs I've seen veer away from working on a game, not keeping to their promises.I recommend this game, for sure, especiallyl at this sale price, $10.49 as of September 28, 2015. For this price you absolutely cannot pass it up. To me, it is one of those games, I'll pick back up on, finish a few missions, upgrade my ship and be content, looking forward to playing again to utilize the new hardware and getting a feel for the upgrades and their impact on gameplay.Cheers to the devs and all who enjoy the style of gameplay.

												Good game. I got it in Humble bundle for about 11 pounds, its worth more. I have played for about 30 hours and havent completed the story line yet. Lots of different things to do. My issue with the game is the simplicity of it, its not always a bad thing but I would have preferred a bit more difficulty in scanning and docking etc. Its like freelancer pretty much. Pretty straighforward. good graphics, nothing mindblowing and I would have preffered nicer and more varied skyboxes and a better drawdistance. That said its still pretty and will run on most computers I would imagine even very old one but I could be wrong.The amount of weapon syustems and ships is also very good.oh, I would have preferred a bit more depth in the trading aspect, larger storage etc but again what it does is enough to entertain.I would definately recommend this game to people, and even though I paid only a fraction for the gold edition I would say the game with its dlc would be worth a whole lot more in terms of gameplay value, dare I say 30 pounds or so.7/10			"

												An addicting game that makes you want that super expensive ship. Capturing ships is most fun, and also the quickest way to earn a lot of money. Though after 18 hours, and having bought the best carrier-class ship, I'm not so eager to get back in and play again. But it was definitely a great 18 hours.Just some thoughts, a story-line, more insanely expensive ships to want, ability to hire captains who go out and do work for you as well, would make add more hours into the game.Also, a cockpit view with people would be nice to see the scale of different ships. All the ships look the same size and the planets just feel teeny ;)			"

												This games is awesome, hands down. You pilot a ship, it starts out a bit small but you can get very large ones. The thing that makes this game awesome is that you can just go anywhere and do anything. There is a story mode but it's not really important or vital to follow, I have mostly ignored it so far. Combat is a lot of fun, there is no ""strategic pausing"" or anything to strategize, and you really have a ton of stuff to micromanage. That said, your mechanical ability to think quickly, pilot your ship, use items/abilities, and position properly have HUGE outcomes on the combat. If you're good, you can do a lot with a little ship, if you're bad you can to little with a big ship. Combat is definitely an extremely fun aspect in this game but there is also so much more than just fighting other ships. The exploration in this game is really amazing. The landmarks (stations, planets, asteroid field locations etc) are static, everything else, the quests, the enemies, etc are completely random. You can pick a direction, put all power to engines, and fly to your hearts content. I actually spent an hour flying completely off the map. There isn't really anything noticeable out there except for a few enemies and such but it  definitely took me an hour to fly back. So yea, the exploration aspect in this game is huge, think skyrim in space but no drauger. So yea, awesome space battles, great exploration in a beautiful backdrop, it's really a lot of fun. The icing on the cake is the soundtrack. It's just ambient electronic but man it sets the mood well. I swear, this is the most relaxing game to play. Just mine asteroids, listen to the music, and be wisked away to a whole other solar system.Anyway, if you like exploring, enjoy space, and like relaxing for hours on end running cargo, hunting pirates, and looking at stars, you'll like this game.

												NOT A FINAL REVIEW, Amazing game even thou i have only played for a few hours i can already see a great game in the making. the detail of the ships as will as the weapons placement make sense. thou the ark of some are questionable. nothing that a few tweaks won't fix. Also supports mods which  i already install one, and audio mod for the engines. even so the game is looking to be one that i will play for months if not years. the ship sized feel a bit off as they are not that different from smaller ships. maybe the dev will consider resizing some of the ships. some of the weapons sound could use some work as the laser as they are dont sound very flashy. i hope more options open up interms of upgrades you can do too the ships such as larger shield if the ship can handle it. Also ships you capture can be added to your fleet at a cost but not to the level of mercs after all they are your factions (player influence ) i do hope they add medium shields, turrets, the heavy weapons as they are now require rearming. would be nice to have some that are laser base that shot out a massive beam but take a long time to reg at no cost to rearming. that would be a good trade off.  shield don't always work as they should i often taken hits from the left only to take damage from the right shield ? as if the shots went right through my ship. none the less considering your getting a massive open sandbox world and lots of things you can do will keep you coming back.  I'm sure the dev will balance the classes as will as the damage in time. i really hope they continue to expand the RPG side of this game a bit more and add some more side mission (freelancer). Also be able to take bases for a faction. joining a fleet in order to win over a terrorties would be cool. so far i would give this game a 7 out of 10 and when its complete i'll review it again			"

												Played for almost 20 hours now.  Good open galaxy, fairly easy to learn and develop.  One has said a mix between Freelance and Skyrim, and that's a pretty good idea of the game.  Begin by mining some astroids to get some dough.  Build up your ship a bit, then try a few missions.  Tells you the recommended level for the mission, so that's a plus.  Can hire some mercs to help out.  Build up an armada to go for big missions.  I expect this will get a LOT of play time, similar to Skyrim.  Looks like a random generator for missions, so the game isn't over until YOU say it's over.  Advice I heard was, buy it, you won't regret it.  I don't.			"

												At first I found this game a bit frustrating. I ran out of money by unmounting and remounting my turrets as I didn't realise it cost money to do so. Then when I reloaded the main quest bugged and I couldn't fly to the place the quest was supposed to take place in. A simple restart of the game fixed this and I've been hooked ever since. There are still some minor bugs to be ironed out but none of them really affect the game play. The game looks gorgeous on high settings and the mechanics are well done, the combat is great as well-it starts with a lot of one-on-one but later on the fights get very chaotic and fun. The voice acting isn't exactly stellar but it has a decent story in campaign mode. If you were a fan of Freelancer, the X series, space sims in general get this game.			"

I've not had a single crash to desktop.  It is sad that these days, that is a tall order even for many AAA games.   The developers seem to be very responsive and involved with the community and even wholeheartedly support modders from looking at the game forums.  I suspect this game will keep growing in functionality. see a few balance passes and refinements and so on.

At the moment it's going through a bug fix phase since it was just released to the general public, some skills branches don't work (at least for engineer that I picked), and there's a lot unexplained mechanics, this will no doubt be resolved.

												This gem is somewhere between the X series (vertical learning curve) and Galaxy on Fire 2 (my dog plays this game) in terms of difficulty with some of the best combat in any space game I've ever played.  SPG2 may not have any entirely new concepts or features but it has taken a lot from past games and the end product does all the little things right.  Ultimately this game meets the same fate as Skyrim, a giant world that is unfortunately only about 5 feet deep.  While I have absolutely no regrets throwing out $28 for it, I can't help but feel this game will be so much better in a year thanks to workshop support and a dev team that truly cares about their B - level game.  While the voice acting is pretty bad, It isn't House of the Dead 2 bad so it's playable, other than the voices the sound is pretty good, I could wish for a few more effects and songs but that's just nitpicking.  The one thing I truly don't like about this game is the faction system, if you do assignments in the Trinity sector your reputation goes towards lawful...Which means all lawful factions like you more, the unlwaful (pirates) well, they never liked you anyway.  If I do things in the Trinity sectors I want perks in the Trinity sectors, not halfway across the solar system.Unlike most titles I am actively looking forward to DLC for this game, which I'm hoping will greatly increase depth.-Throw in some: player built space stations, automating a freight company that I have built/stolen and funded, faction control, and territory conquering and this could truly be something special.8.5/10			"

												many hrs in....8 out of 10 stars. :) - Huge sandbox universe to explore and interact within. :) - Beautiful graphics and framerates with settings maxed out :) - Many Corporations with their own ship visual styles:) - Solid game - not the typical steam crowd-funded title.:( - All ships are the same graphic scale, regardless of the class size you are playing.  So be prepared to be underwhelmed by the Corvette or Frigate upgrade visually, as well as tactically - especially given the amount of time saving up for them.  You gain only an extra weapons mounting point or two each upgrade.:( - Fleet Commander? No, not really. You to hire mercenaries (max 2) that follow you (bumping into each other) that you have no command or interaction over what so ever.  Most of the time they go off and get themselves destroyed or wirte you off as MIA when the green rifts take you for a ride.Restarted many times to try all the player skill sets, and starting ship types.  I will continue to play it for now as I anxiously await patches and expansions - or as usual, the steam community to mod out the oversights that the devs / testers missed (ship scale, enemy bases don't consider you a threat, complexity doesn't scale with firepower).Perfectly priced for what you get - especially if you catch a STEAM sale.

												gotta say this was exactly what i hoped it would be. an awesome galaxy surfing vehicle combat game with excellent mods and dev support. endless replay value and more ships to choose from than you will ever even see in one playthrough. seriously ive played about 100 hours so far and still half my map is unexplored. as all good games are you start out weak and end up becoming a juggernaut of near infinite power. and yet you can still get ganged up on to the point where your only choice is flee or die. tactical decisions go a long way and you definitely want to gather the best weapons, enhancments, officers and skills. but the best part is the freedom to choose what you do. do you mine asteroid and gas with a freightliner, or become wealthy thru the destruction of your enemies in a carrier, or do you become the master trader soaring around the galaxy at incredible speeds trading resources and transporting vip's in a cruiser. its totally up to you how you play this game. if i had complaints about this game it would be these. 1) more mods, 2) more weapon levels and choices, 3) more levels, and 4) better explained stats. so 3 out of 4 complaints are that i just want more. thats always a good thing. to play a game you can never get enough of. and if boredom ever does set in i can always start anew with a different approach, class or end goal. THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!!!!!			"

												With the sudden increase in popularity of Space Sims thank's to the Star Citizen crowdfunding campaign I went looking for a Freelancer successor to keep me busy in the meantime. This game is it.Freeroam mode is great and you should get at least 5-10 hours of good fun out of it. In that time you should be able to get to the endgame with the best ship and after that there's not much else to do - short of restarting as another character or on another path.The campaign feels like a hurried add-on. The writing is cheesy, the voice acting cringe-worthy. If you want a single player game that stands toe to toe with Freelancer, you won't find it here.Get this game for the sandbox mode that is freeroam and go explore the Gemini star system!			"

												Where to start... The game itself requires some minor polish, mainly in the balancing sector, but it's already at a very good/stable state otherwise. There are various tasks to do inside the game, such as exploration, boarding ships, mining, trading(These do still need balancing.) and ofcourse, the campaign mode and pewpew fighting. The game is fairly complex, once you start getting into it, learning to fly and maneuver different ship classes, the firing arcs of various ships, finding fighting tactics that work for you and your ship, the enhancement system... And for those who get bored quickly after having played through the storyline, which did happen to a lot of players in other games such as Freelancer, you do have a nice amount of achievements to hunt, some of which aren't exactly easy to accomplish. Nothing is stopping you from hunting down the ""Heros"" either. ;)The community and the devs are active and communicating a lot, which reflects into the product and the pace patches, fixes and balancing attempts are coming through. There are plans for an expansion and DLC, which will further add to the amount of content in the game and ofcourse, the community made mods, which will be the crowning jewel of this game. The tools might not be fully functional yet, but as soon as the game itself is at a state where the devs and community are happy, the tools will be recieving some much needed love.A lot has been said about the game in many of the reviews, but here's another list of just some of the features already in the game and some which are being worked on:Already in:-Boarding Ships.-Working Campaign.-Lots and lots of ships.-Weapon/ship system enhancement.-Trading.-Dynamic events which effect item prices.-A large amount of space to explore, which can also be further expanded.-Lots of different factions.(Which will also get some more love in the future.)-Freeroam mode for those who don't wish to play the campaign.-Mercenaries to act as your backup.-Blueprints.-Working collision system.-Cloaking!-Heroes to hunt,-Mods.Planned/in the works:-Player owned faction and base(s).-Dynamic struggles for power/regional control between factions. Once this is implemented, every single playthrough will be and feel different!-Expansion/DLC.-Modding Tools.(Currently some work, some don't. Somewhat prone to crashes.)-Improvements to the HUD and other elements of the UI.-An entirely new ship class.(Larger, naturally. Bigger is always better!)... and the list goes on.If you aren't a fan of space sims or dislike games with emphasis on exploration, this might not be for you, as there is no MP in the game to increase its lifespan. However, if you do like what you've seen/read and can get past the fact that there is no MP and that the game relies entirely on mods/expansions/DLC to keep breathing fresh life into it, then this game just might be a perfect fit for you. Atleast I've completely fallen in love with the game.			"

												Star Point Gemin 2 is a fantasic starship space genre game that will have you playing for hours on end. I’ve spent more than 60 hours with the game at this point and I’ve only just scratched the surface. I’ve primarily been playing in the games “free roam” mode as that was the real draw of the game for me. I knew from the outset that I wanted a game that gave me the ability to explore, fight, mine and trade at my own leisure and do so in my own ship like a “real” space captain. After researching SP♥♥♥♥ bit I realized that this would be the game that would allow me to do all of that.I’m not a diehard space sim player so games like EVE Online and Star Trek Online have always kind of intimidated me. I’ve never really had an interest in the X3 series (my loss probably) but I have played Sins of a Solar Empire and the Homeworld series. It's been a while since I've played anything space related but lately I’ve become re-interested in the genre with games like Star Citizen and Elite: Dangerous on the horizon. I knew I wanted to play a game that felt huge and expansive but I didn’t want to play a game that made me feel like a small fish in a huge pond. I’m a casual player so the size and scope of this game feels just right to me. The game's setting is huge and there is a lot to do in it. Also, it seems like the devs are really committed to making the game better all the time which made the choice to buy it all the more easy to make. The fact that I’ve continued to play it so much is a testament to how good it actually is.SPG2 reminds me specifically of two games I’ve played before, Nexus: The Jupiter Incident and Star Trek: Starfleet Command. Although I’ve played many other space genre games since, I really wanted to play something that felt similar to those two games. SPG2 has a surprising amount in common with Starfleet Command which also allowed you to “tractor beam” aka grapple ships, scan anomalies and commandeer other spacecraft with “marines” aka troopers. I haven’t played that game in over 15 years but I remember how much fun it was to do those things in the game.These are some of the things I like about SPG2:-	the music is great especially the main theme-	the ship designs are cool and I know there are still tons more to discover-	the space station designs are great and varied which is a plus-	the variety of weapons and their FX in game look great-       the descriptions for items and npcs in the game are numerous and often amusing-       there are many mods availiable which help to enhance gamplayThe randomness of missions and enemies is great but whether or not you like this aspect of the game will depend on how much you like doing things in this universe. After awhile the missions can seem repetitive but luckily the fact that the level required to do each mission changes all the time, forces you to decide which missions to do or not to do. This in turn helps mix things up a bit and keep things interesting.The only issues I have with the game so far are the way the menus in stations and on planets were a bit confusing at first and still seem a bit cumbersome to navigate. Also I wish there was a bit more 'humanity' in the game. By that I just mean it would be cool if officers had portraits in addition to their names and when ships attacked you they too had portraits instead of just insignias. I know that's a huge 'ask' as there are already a huge amount of randomized officer names in the game. Perhaps a feature that allowed you upload your own portraits to the game (specifically for officers) could be cool. Also, I’m not entirely sure, but I think officers gain experience the longer they are on your ship. I hope so but it would also be cool if they could steadily gain loyalty for additional bonuses.Other than that I’ve really enjoyed this game and am glad I bought it.			"

												I'm going to give this a 5/10 at the moment.  The content that is present is well done and relatively stable/bug free.  Ship combat is fun for a while, and space is visually interesting with a few suprises.  But get a few hours in and the game starts to feel kind of pointless.  There is a faction system, but it doesn't do much of anything.  There is trading and mining, but neither give money at anywhere near the rate fighting does.  There are generated ""missions"", but they are extremely easy and give very little in the way of rewards (you'll probably do them just to have something to do).  There are enemy bases and structures, but you can't destroy them (you can get them to one health and they just hang there, and frankly it isn't hard at all to do that).  You end up collecting money to buy a bigger ship to collect more money to buy an even bigger ship (which isn't very rewarding, as the ship models are so small in relation to one another you dont get the sense that you have a bigger ship)...The game isn't garbage, and the devs are very nice and responsive.  At $5-$10 give it a shot, but not at $40.  The caveat here is there is a very soid framework to make a much better game (really this game is in the bin with so many others that are really in early-mid beta, but release early to make money).  If there is a content update that adds player bases and the ability to capture territory, balances out mining and trading, and puts in other end-game content and empire building mechanics, this game will be a 9/10 easy.  It feels like these things were intended, but just haven't made it in.  So, if you see a big update after this review, maybe give it a try.  Otherwise, skip it until there is a big steam sale (or skip entirely, if a space grind isn't your thing).			"

												Very slow to start; the controls could be explained better.   Crashed into Trinity about 5 times when I was supposed to ""LAND ON PLANET""  wasnt until I asked on Forums that ""Land""= ""Anchor"".   Scanning of ship wasnt vry helpful either until I accidently hit the Middle mouse button (which I seldom ever used before)Travel is slow, have to have lots of patience, although I think with upgraded ships & a better knowledge of the travel short-cuts (t gates, rifts, blackholes) it could be faster.   Admittedly im less than a couple hour in, first impressions only.Not for everyone.			"

Posted: October 5, 2014
												Okay, where to begin. I bought this game less then a week after official release, so i can imagine that some things will change, and they rightly should, but i do hope they leave it mostly together! It takes a bit to get used to (especially after playing Freelancer like a fan boy for years) and let's get this straight: IT'S NOT FREELANCER! But that's not exactly a terrible thing. i guess i'll just list the negative points first:1 - tracking speed is too slow, especially in turret view (and yes i have turned my sensitivity higher, no help)2 - enemies spawn too close to friendly bases sometimes, and prevent you from docking (especially annoying when trying to complete a taxi mission or bring in a captured ship)3 - friendlies don't care that you are trying to cap that expensive ship, and is REALLY annoying when they destroy it within SECONDS of capturing it!4 - trying to capture a ship too close to certain anomoly's (spelling is crap, but im drinking, so understand) and wormholes can lead to MASSIVE frustration, as your grappling beam will disconnect, but granted, is generally not a problem.5 - auto pilot can be worse then having a drunk, blind, parapalegic man (or women) with 1 arm and 2 fingers try to drive a car with half a steering wheel through a mine field... (seriously, it will take me in multiple 360 degree circles, then crash me into a station and multiple asteroids, just for good measure, i assume)i'll edit more in when i think of them, but only 5 reletivly minor things to complain about! pretty good! Also, the price is NOT ♥♥♥♥ing 60 bucks, for a BRAND NEW GAME where im sure the moderators will edit on a regular basis!TL:DR: buy it. now. all this game really needs is a little smoothing over, and it'll be a 10/10. as it is, i'd give it 8.5/10 which is pretty high praise for a brand new game! (also, some sort of multiplayer would be cool, at least a co-op, although i have no idea how they'd implement this... just a pipe dream for now). Did i mention it's mod friendly!?P.S. buy it. now... why haven't you yet?			"

												8/10 Free Roam Space Sandbox. Limited to one ship at a time, like Elite or Freelancer, but the options are very wide. Uncloak and Pirate hapless enemies, Haul freight, Mine, Smuggle, command a Battleship with it's own fighters like Galactica, explore space with an independent powerful Cruiser with beams & torpedo loadout- it's all possible.  Collect Troopers at planets & stations to build up a fighting space marine force, and take over enemy ships! Huge spaceship selection, and storage at stations make collecting your own fleet a long term hobby. Limited customizing possible on the visuals, but you can spend time tinkering with engines, cloaks, weapons loadouts, transporters etc till you get her exactly how you like.  Random missions in Freeroam mode give you a foothold on things to do, but they are entirely optional. You can switch sides, and support any faction you like.			"

								Solid Sci-Fi game! The only real negative thing I have to say is making money. Missions don't seem to give enough reward for the cost of upgrades. Especially when you can just roam in a hostile region and loot your victims and make way more money selling that loot to friendly NPCs. That was the only agonizer for me. Combat system is solid, unless your wanting to be in control of the guns and not use auto-fire at all, that's challenging but in a good way. We're not flying fighters, so piloting and gunning at the same time should be hard. The UI is different but once you get around the med level learning curve it works really well.			"

								I want to enjoy this game.  I can honestly see all the potential it has.  But I I have to hesitate in giving it a full thumbs up, but it's also not a full thumbs down.  As this is being written during Early Access, I can forgive any shortcomings.  Like I said, I can see the potential.  But try as I might, I'm just not feeling it.To start, I've always loved these types of games and felt they never made enough.  A space sim seems to have unlimited potential, but I prefer to avoid things that require subscriptions and groups like MMOs.  Conversely, I recall fond memories of doing just that in Earth and Beyond, lo so many years ago.  But what I loved most about Earth and Beyond is I recall enjoying crafting my ship and making it mine.  I'd say the same for the Lightspeed add-on to Star Wars Galaxies.  Clunky though it was, I thoroughly enjoyed taking those ship parts I blasted out of enemy ships and hoarding them, finally upgrading when I would get the time and adding it to my ship.  I felt like I owned that more.  Though you can certainly buy different ship parts here, there aren't that many right now, and some of the differences aren't readily apparent.  I can't even easily compare the old with the new.Funny enough, I started drawing comparisons to, of all things, the game FTL.  Though you don't actively fly a single thing, and the game basically consists of just a handful of screens, it does give you the ability to upgrade your ship in a way that makes you feel like you're in control of it.  And while even the upgrades themselves are a simple thing, I never really find myself using the same configuration over and over again because I find random things and random times.  Here, I feel less like I'm thinking on my feet and thinking more about where I'm flying next (fun, yes, but limited).Similarly, again, Early Access-itis: you get plopped into the game and are told nothing.  Zippo.  Sure, the tutorial is there, but it's not interactive.  It tells you what to do on one screen, then you need to close it out to try it, and  then reactivate the tutorial screen to move on.  Very clunky.  On the plus side, the controls feel pretty good and are easily customized, and yet, for it being space, it feels rather tight.  Granted, it's a game, so not everyone wants to sit there and patiently watch the seconds tick away, but it almost feels too quick.  It is space, after all.  If only to hammer the point home, once I figured out how to get where I was going, it didn't seem like I had to do much once I got there.  I also wonder about the items you get.  They don't seem to have much more purpose than to provide you with money.  And while that's all good, it also seems very limited.  Okay, I've got a cargo hold full of all these different things...that don't have anything special about them other than how much money they fetch you.  Then what?  Wash, rinse, repeat?  I could see where  the full game, story and all, would provide more substance, but I would hope it's substantial, because right now, like I said, I don't feel ""at home"" in this game.  I don't feel like I have a reason to be out flying, that my ship is no different than any other NPC ship flying around, randomly doing things ""just because.""So, like I said to start, I can see the potential: it looks amazing, the controls are customizable and feel natural, and there appears to be a real desire to embrace the mysteries of space.  Unfortunately, things feel like they move real fast, that customization needs to be greatly expanded to get some real tinkering done on ship, and that I'm not just moving from A to B to A again.That said, I eagerly await more content and gladly support the game.

Early Access Review
								Alright. First of all, I am not going to comment on the technical issues currently existing in the game. It's very resource hungry, and there's an unpatched memory leak forcing you to close the game roughly every hour. The devs will have to address this before the final version is released. Also: What this game IS NOT, is ""Eve Offline"". Anyone who says such things is severely overhyping the title. It is, at best, a Freelancer clone.Now for the meat of the review.=THE GOOD=1. Fluid interesting combat, but don't expect dogfights. It plays more like traditional naval battles with turrets and missiles.2. Responsive dev team. They take community input to heart and make changes as needed.3. Very large map. So large, that travelling from one corner to the other would take you probably 20-30 minutes.4. Seamless travel. There's still warpgates and jumpdrives available to the player, but no ""zones"" or loading screens.5. Many different factions enables you to work with and shoot whoever you want.6. Many different ships. Enough variety to keep it fresh and interesting. 7. A bounty system that enables you to live out your inner Boba Fett. Be the space cop you always dreamed of being!=THE BAD=1. Ship designs are... different. Maybe I'm used to the look of EVE, or WingCommander, or Homeworld, but I expect space ships to have a certain bulkiness and weight to them. Most of the ships in this game either look like some derivative of a shark/fish, or an insect. It's very strange cruising along and seeing a flying praying mantis scoot by. The rest look dated. It's like the devs took the Freelancer inspiration a little too far, and saddening that the mod community is starting to produce models far better than the ""official"" ones shipping with release. You can have more than 5,000 polys on a model these days, guys...2. Combat. I know I said it was a ""good"" aspect, but I just want to make something clear here. 90% of battles I've been in, no matter what ship I'm using, no matter what my loadout is, I can win by pushing three buttons on my keyboard: Railgun skill -> Damage amp -> Fire at will. Done. And this is playing on Hard Mode. There is something inherently wrong with being able to destroy a dreadnought with a frigate.3. Combat (again). Missiles and other 'heavy weapons' are very pointless. It's odd you can only fire them once the little orange bar on your reticle fills up, nearly defeating the point of having them. On one ship, the Oppenheimer, I opted for no missiles or heavy weapons of any kind and noticed absolutely no difference in my ability to destroy anything and everything. They're effectively redundant, and with the current system in place I cannot see this ever changing.4. Ship customization is basically not a thing. People have been praising customization in their reviews, but I feel they are being dishonest. You can customize your ships in-so-far as being able to change their paint job or logo, or how shiny it is. That's it. As far as gear and parts are concerned, you're only tuning stuff already on your ship, and you do so by scrolling down a list and simply getting the most expensive thing on there. You're not really buying new engines, or an expanded cargo hold, or a different powerplant. You're not weighing the options and going ""Hmm! If I get this, then I can't have that!"" It's not at all a mod system like what's in EVE. If your ship doesn't have a cloak, you'll never have a cloak. If your ship has crappy shields, you'll always have crappy shields. Etc. I hope this changes before release, but I somehow doubt it.5. There's no reason to go beyond a cruiser. I can kill or capture anything with a Saratoga. I basically stopped playing when I towed a dreadnought into port and cashed it in. Apparently 90 guys can overpower a ship staffed by thousands.6. It's far too easy to hit 'end game'. The first few hours of playing was just me saving up to buy a frigate. From my frigate, I captured a destroyer. From my destroyer, I captured enough ships to get a cruiser. From my cruiser, I was unstoppable. I did this very rapidly, despite pouring tens of hours into simple exploration. 7. Bugs. Yeah yeah, it's beta. I know. But it is rather silly flying up to a bounty, seeing they're ""blue"" (allied), and then just following them around until someone kills them, yet -I- get rewarded with the bounty. I wish that worked in real life where if I watch the cops bust someone, cash magically appears in my pocket.8. No main quest. It's supposed to have one eventually, but despite being beta none of it is playable. You're stuck doing random low-paying generated missions, or inventing your own fun. The the latter can be quite enjoyable, but you will run out of stuff to do in a hurry. =Final Thoughts=Despite its issues, Starpoint Gemini 2 is quite the fun little sandbox and probably the closest thing we're ever going to get to a successor to Freelancer. Freelancer was far more polished as an overall product, however, and until SG2 introduces a TRUE parts and customization system (which I consider to be a much greater problem than combat, or even optimization woes), it will not hold a candle to Eve Online. This is a beta that plays like an alpha, but if you're hungry for a spaceship game with solid promise, then this is it.6/10.			"

Early Access Review
								I would like to give the marines every help they can get for boarding.So a tab in the inventory for equiping the marines with armor, weapons, shields and mods.Would be a nice adon for this game. The reason for this is that boarding in this game is better than fighting. Don't get me wrong I like shoothing ships it's just that in the beginning of this game you try to get a bigger ship as fast as possible. And the fastest way to get a new shipis by boarding. And maybe that is a problem in this game. It is possible to get a big battleshipby repeatedly trying to board the ship flying back to a station for new marines and going back tothe big battleship and capture it. And not only you can get the battleship it you target acaptain with a price on it's head you can get a new ship and a few millions in reward money. Fighting in this game is hard in the beginning of this game. Trying to board a ship and run to a station for new marines for a new attempt is to easy. And that's a problem. First try 100 crew vs 60 crew remaining = 60 crew. Second try 60 crew vs 60 crew remaining = 50 crew.Third try 50 crew vs 60 crew remaining = 20 crew.Fourth try 20 crew vs 60 crew remaining = 0 crew. Boarding attempt succeeded.  You just got a new Battlecruiser. Game is over.			"

								Wow, suprised! This game was actually dang good! The reviews werent wrong at all. Its very similar to the X3 / X series of games except without the headaches, no laggy menus, no shoddy UI/maps, basically its everything that you wanted X:rebirth to be.. almostIts not the best game in the world, however the developers are hard at work polishing this title into a true gem. Its esentially flying around in space doing rpg-like stuff and creating your own armada/fleet and waging war.  Theres a few small issues and bugs left to be fixed and some features that will be implemented in the future, so this title has a bright future ahead of it, even though its worth buying As-is.  Theres moddability in the game itself so im sure the modding community will be able to fix/implement what the devs do not. The devs are actually active on the forums and not just to censor creativity and announce p2w and microtransaction garbage. If you like RPGs, buy it, support it, who knows? This platform/title could have a VERY bright future ahead of it.  This is probably the only Early Access title that isnt a rip off out of the lot.... And that's coming from one of the most virilent critics of the early-access system, so you know its for real.			"

								Starpoint Gemini 2(Just Released into Beta) is exactly what you want from this genre.Compared to other space games in its genre, this game has more of an arcade style of gameplay.  If you are expecting the depth and simulation of something such as the X-Universe then you will probably want to avoid this game.   However if you want to just fly around in a beautiful world, and combat enemies with responsive and fuild controls then this game is for you. The ship designs are very beautiful and unique. The enviornments are very good and beautiful to look at as you go through the game.There are many different factions within the game that will end up fighting each other.  As well as many you can gain or lose rep with that will effect your standing with them.   The controls are easy to understand and reponsive.   Combat can be fought in several ways, you can hire a crew to improve stats of your ship such as accuracy, dodge, shields, etc.  However you can also tell the gunner to shoot for you, so either you can fly and have the A.I. shoot for you or you can Shoot and fly yourself.  This provides a nice change of pace for when you are wanting the A.I. to focus on defense or attack while you just maneuver the ship. "

								This games has tons of potential. It has decent graphics, good game controls, easy to learn and best of all, it's pretty addicting. There are three character classes, different type of ship classes, different kinds of ships within the classes, four different weapon types and tons of missions to do in sandbox mode.  I've been playing as the gunner,  especializing on weapons systems,with the ability to adds different bonuses to the weapon system of choice. My weapon of choice being rail-guns.  It's up to you how you want to play. You have the option of playing as a pirate, enforcer, bounty hunter, miner, trader or a freelancer (combination of all). How effective you are doing each type of job depends on the ship, the combination of skills you select as you increase in experience and buying a license. License determine how much money you will receive depending on what the license is for. For example, a mining license will get you more money when selling ore, a police license will reward you with moneyfor everykill, and so on so forth. The point of it all is to make money, so you can get better ships and better gear, you know, the same old formula that keeps us coming back for more.  Overall I really like this game and if you are a fan of freelancer and games likes these I dont think you will be disappointed. The best part? It's only  going to get better.			"

								Excellent balance of the best features found in other games.  Lots of attention to detail evident.  If you are even slightly interested in sci-fi space exploration and rpg  then you will not regret giving this game closer look.			"

								I won't talk about gameplay etc.. others have done that.What I will say is SG2 is one of the very few open alpha/beta games i've bought into that has NOT disapointed me greatly.They (DEV team) work hard, take time to listen to the players (check out there website & forums), hunt down and exterminate spaceBUGS. This makes me believe that SG2 will be superGREEN (yes, this is a quote from a movie, go watch it) at launch!!So, in my opinion, if you don't grab SG2 when its on SALE (and you like/love space games) your NUTS!!!! lolgood hunting			"

								This, game. I am enjoying it for all the reasons I bought it. Specifically, the play a game with the full freedom to drift aimlessly in space to look at something and say to myself... ""I should go there"" and be able to go there.  Issues arise in that so far there is no campaign, so there is a no guided leveling structure. Which is nice and freeform, but leaves you with a... ""hrmm, now what"", feeling similar to the sims or minecraft if you don't have a personal goal.  So far, you start off as  a rather beefy frigate off the bat, and from there are told there are other things you can do with your life beyond be a pirate/merc. Don't listen to that voice, stealing ships via boarding parties is the only way of acquiring money relatively quickly beyond the rare, bounty list job.  Which brings up space combat! This is both so much fun, and so much rage. Fun part! Depending on your choice of weapons, you are able to join random battles in space with next to no reprecursions as the two parties fight for life and you zap your enemy (see red guy), due to some laughably long range and guess shooting. Or you are able to watch in horror as you enter an area of space where everyone has some horrifyingly powerful guns that destroy your shields, hull, and happiness before you can make a pass at escape. Major issue is that you don't know what they are packing in weapons, you can't tell untill they open up on you, and the little info blerp provided is vague, very much so. The description varies from ""trivial"" to ""Impossible"", but you are not informed how they are rated to determine threat level to you. I seem to think it is an unspoken amalgamation of your ships type, and load out mixed with your level. But!  Trivial enemies in twos can wreck your life for reasons you are unsure of (maybe they are small glass cannons that are only GUN). Deadly enemies can just float around you in vain trying to bring their weapons to bare before dying to the explosion of their metal death trap.  Also, each ship has a load out of weapons, that are placed on four compass based directions on your ship, and each has a firing arc that is not discussed much, and even some of the fully decked vessels will always have blind spots in their firing patern.  So you are shooting, zapping, and hitting with all due fun then slightly tilt your ship to the left and stop. The weapons also have a range... which is an ignorable text box since it only matters in ""Fire at Will"" mode, unless you are being shot at then your AI ignore it just like you do and open up shooting everything like a Ork Freeboota.Exploration is fun, though potentially deadly since the whole area is teeming with bandits looking for the sweet rolls in your ships captain's quarters. There are about four mains ways of travel. Cruising, which is deadly and fun since for no reason at you can be cruising at a great speed (you think) then are knocked out of your cruise mode by pirates wanting you dead even if they are in no way a threat.  Or there are T-gates! Think stargate and that is exactly it, you anchor at the place and for a modest fee, travel in safety from one end of space to another point in space! T-gates are almost always at a space station/planet you can dock at (if your faction rep says so) and are the safest (relatively) way to go long distances.  Then there are wormholes..... wormholes are kinda like t-gates, if t-gates were a game you pay for up front, wormholes are the f2p that suck you in and slowly rob you with you having no knowledge where you are going. They are free to use, but they will kill your troopers (dudes you have on board to steal ships or keep yours from being stolen) each time and break your ship a little. And when I said sucked in I mean they have a gravity well that pull you into it and spits you out of another one, which is great but that other one has a gravity well too that pulls you into it. If not careful and if there are different pairs of wormholes nearby you can end up alone on your now burning ship on the other side of the map not really wanting to try to return.   Lastly there is an item that lets your teleport your ship in a circular radius of map hexes based on how many you want to use at time. Only to hexes you have already been to, semi safe since you have no clue what is waiting for you, can get expensive (you need a massive amount of the already costly items to even trying moving halfway cross map) but you wont get jumped on route like in cruising so, win?Lastly for now is the level up process... You can get experience from quests (variable from oh, nice to meh), and pirati- I mean defending your local area from them pirates and invaders. What does it do? lets you level certain skills you have chosen based on a life style of play I do not think impacts game too greatly. Really for most of the area I forget to use the things until I am nearly dying and go Save Me Buttons!  And Perks, perks are like skills but they are not tied to the action skills, they are always active.   Skills and Perks I think would be more impacting if they were not so dang situational, the buttons are very much a maybe use. Perks are very tied to certain aspects of the game, but are not acquired quickly enough to even remember to check for them. Or feel like they even do much when used.  It is a nice, balanced feature, but when you are able to reset your skills and perks the choices are less impacting on your decision time. I still am very happy I spent the cash on it, and if you like SPESS PIRATEZ, then you can be one in this one.  I do hope they keep this mode active if they come out with a story mode too.			"

								AWSOME GAME!!!! I have no idea whats going on in this game universe but this game is amazing, It gives you a background if you did not play the first game(This Guy) and throws you into a waring universe. you start out with a decent ship and can go around doing missions, mining ore, killing lots and lots of people. Most of those screen shots they are using to sell the game are real gameplay with the hud gone(all but that planet shot of the city are real ingame places). I love the game play. not too complex but you will need to get used to space flight. One thing I never realized that will help is when boarding another ship the Green and Red arrows that appear can be clicked to send or retreat your troops! Buy the game and go find out what i mean!

												Great game while I'm waiting for Elite: Dangerous. Seems to push all the right buttons - it's one of those games where you keep telling yourself ""I'll just to this one last mission"" and before you know it you've spend the whole day on it. For me, it is what I wanted from X: Rebirth - note I never bought X:Rebirth due to the abysmal reviews at release.The developers of Starpoint Gemini 2are active on Steam and seem to take comments & reports serious. At version 1.0001 it's not perfect yet and the GFX could need some performance optimization but that's to be expected two days after release. Overall a good start. If you're into space freeroaming, get it.			"

												This game's excellent. It's like what you'd get if you mixed Eve-Online with the original Privateer game from the 90s. There's a huge world to explore, lots of backstory and content, and you can decid to freeplay it or follow the plot at any point. The developers are very responsive about fixing bugs or improving the game. I emailed in a couple of bug reports with log files, and they responded that they were working on it, and released a patch the next day. They have released two minor patches in the day since they have released.			"

												This is (in my opinion) one of the greater games on Steam. For those who are looking for a TASTE of EVE here you go. This game is almost like a baby stepping stone into the EVE universe. While the game does have its flaws as I will state, I believe that this sandbox game has great potental. Now, I will say that I do not believe it is worth $40 just yet. The modding community has yet to take off and you can cheat the game by simply opening your save in Notepad++ and editing the data. Which I believe somewhat cuts the fun out of comparing achievements to other players globally. The missions of hunting the heros are somewhat wonky as well because it seems they jump systems if you watch the map. Just as well, there is a very large difficulty spike in the game that you must prepare for. As you reach a certain level your enemies gain vet rank and you probably have yet to make enough money to even afford a ship that can stand up to them. (Unless you did what I do and stole a ship from the pirates) Now for the positives. This game has BEAUTIFUL scenery. For an indie game, a lot of time was put into this game and its atmosphere. The story and voice acting are a bit stale, but the fact that they are there is awesome. And the story, while being a bit dry, actually does make some form of sense. So kudos! At the start of the game you may pick to be a captain, engineer or another class that excels in firing. You may hire mercenaries to board ships or even follow you in to battle which is what the captains perks stand for. The shooter class perks somwhat speaks for itself. But I played as an engineer as the perks seemed to outweigh the others. The story is the same regardless of your class, but each class has its own specialties with 4 main ""moves"" But those moves have 5 evolutions within each allowing you to alter them as you go to tailor your playstyle up to the max level of 80. There are a plethora of planets to explore as well as tons of ships to purchase and try out. All in all, if you enjoy sandbox style games and as well as enjoy the beauty of flight or space travel, I recommend this game. I also recommend trying it if your thinking about EVE online. This game is a MUCH simpler thing. But it has many of the same aspects as well as can help you decide if you would even enjoy the simple aspects of what EVE offers before you worry about the more complex matters.			"

												If you were a fan of the old Freelancer games then this game is for you. There is nothign cooler then sneaking up on your bounty target cloaked then firing a barage of missiles at its critical systems and then hacking the ship while your blasters tear it apart. The combat is engaging as well as the other aspects of the game. It is like a mix of Freelancer and the X series with a very user friendly interface. Fight pirates, trade, explore and everything else you love about a good 4X game. I recommend this to all fans of the genre.			"

												An addicting game that makes you want that super expensive ship. Capturing ships is most fun, and also the quickest way to earn a lot of money. Though after 18 hours, and having bought the best carrier-class ship, I'm not so eager to get back in and play again. But it was definitely a great 18 hours.Just some thoughts, a story-line, more insanely expensive ships to want, ability to hire captains who go out and do work for you as well, would make add more hours into the game.Also, a cockpit view with people would be nice to see the scale of different ships. All the ships look the same size and the planets just feel teeny ;)			"

												This games is awesome, hands down. You pilot a ship, it starts out a bit small but you can get very large ones. The thing that makes this game awesome is that you can just go anywhere and do anything. There is a story mode but it's not really important or vital to follow, I have mostly ignored it so far. Combat is a lot of fun, there is no ""strategic pausing"" or anything to strategize, and you really have a ton of stuff to micromanage. That said, your mechanical ability to think quickly, pilot your ship, use items/abilities, and position properly have HUGE outcomes on the combat. If you're good, you can do a lot with a little ship, if you're bad you can to little with a big ship. Combat is definitely an extremely fun aspect in this game but there is also so much more than just fighting other ships. The exploration in this game is really amazing. The landmarks (stations, planets, asteroid field locations etc) are static, everything else, the quests, the enemies, etc are completely random. You can pick a direction, put all power to engines, and fly to your hearts content. I actually spent an hour flying completely off the map. There isn't really anything noticeable out there except for a few enemies and such but it  definitely took me an hour to fly back. So yea, the exploration aspect in this game is huge, think skyrim in space but no drauger. So yea, awesome space battles, great exploration in a beautiful backdrop, it's really a lot of fun. The icing on the cake is the soundtrack. It's just ambient electronic but man it sets the mood well. I swear, this is the most relaxing game to play. Just mine asteroids, listen to the music, and be wisked away to a whole other solar system.Anyway, if you like exploring, enjoy space, and like relaxing for hours on end running cargo, hunting pirates, and looking at stars, you'll like this game.

												NOT A FINAL REVIEW, Amazing game even thou i have only played for a few hours i can already see a great game in the making. the detail of the ships as will as the weapons placement make sense. thou the ark of some are questionable. nothing that a few tweaks won't fix. Also supports mods which  i already install one, and audio mod for the engines. even so the game is looking to be one that i will play for months if not years. the ship sized feel a bit off as they are not that different from smaller ships. maybe the dev will consider resizing some of the ships. some of the weapons sound could use some work as the laser as they are dont sound very flashy. i hope more options open up interms of upgrades you can do too the ships such as larger shield if the ship can handle it. Also ships you capture can be added to your fleet at a cost but not to the level of mercs after all they are your factions (player influence ) i do hope they add medium shields, turrets, the heavy weapons as they are now require rearming. would be nice to have some that are laser base that shot out a massive beam but take a long time to reg at no cost to rearming. that would be a good trade off.  shield don't always work as they should i often taken hits from the left only to take damage from the right shield ? as if the shots went right through my ship. none the less considering your getting a massive open sandbox world and lots of things you can do will keep you coming back.  I'm sure the dev will balance the classes as will as the damage in time. i really hope they continue to expand the RPG side of this game a bit more and add some more side mission (freelancer). Also be able to take bases for a faction. joining a fleet in order to win over a terrorties would be cool. so far i would give this game a 7 out of 10 and when its complete i'll review it again			"

												Played for almost 20 hours now.  Good open galaxy, fairly easy to learn and develop.  One has said a mix between Freelance and Skyrim, and that's a pretty good idea of the game.  Begin by mining some astroids to get some dough.  Build up your ship a bit, then try a few missions.  Tells you the recommended level for the mission, so that's a plus.  Can hire some mercs to help out.  Build up an armada to go for big missions.  I expect this will get a LOT of play time, similar to Skyrim.  Looks like a random generator for missions, so the game isn't over until YOU say it's over.  Advice I heard was, buy it, you won't regret it.  I don't.			"

												At first I found this game a bit frustrating. I ran out of money by unmounting and remounting my turrets as I didn't realise it cost money to do so. Then when I reloaded the main quest bugged and I couldn't fly to the place the quest was supposed to take place in. A simple restart of the game fixed this and I've been hooked ever since. There are still some minor bugs to be ironed out but none of them really affect the game play. The game looks gorgeous on high settings and the mechanics are well done, the combat is great as well-it starts with a lot of one-on-one but later on the fights get very chaotic and fun. The voice acting isn't exactly stellar but it has a decent story in campaign mode. If you were a fan of Freelancer, the X series, space sims in general get this game.			"

												Highly recommend this for a good Space RPG. Seems to be running stable. It's got a tad bit of grind in good RPG fashion but still has that solid space sim feel to it. Much like Freelancer. It seems emphasis is palced more on efficient captaining (This is the RPG aspect, with abilities and consumables) than direct combat skills although it does allow you to manually aim and focus fire. So far I really enjoy it. The story isn't as enthralling as a story driven RPG like the Witcher, but hey we're a mighty space captain who goes around blowing up everyone around us and stealing their loot so it doesn't matter much anyway. Did I just describe a space hack 'n slash, yes I think that's what I'd call this. The story gives you some primary goals to focus on while exploring the game and shooting up the place ;3			"

												Loved it! I loved that computers aimed my turrets. I loved the progression of ships, upgrades and mission difficulty. I never had to capture ships for money like some people seem to think is necessary, because I only bought a new ship when the old one couldn't survive the fight anymore (even with shield boosters and damage boosters), so I was able to skip corvette and never needed anything more than destroyer.  I also looked up the ship differences online so I bought the best in class for my fighting style.I would have loved more:Ability to buy a system to shunt energy distribution to 100% engine when activating PTE.Ability to buy HUD system to see tactical info on current target, even if it's behind me.Someone to buy 50 artifacts.Ability to buy more equipment slots, for non-combat equipment.I reconfiged Skip Dialog to the period key at the start and it never worked. Had to sit through some dialog while retrying a few tough missions more than I wanted to.			"

												Great game, only played a few hours so far but every minute of it is awesome. Anyone that remembers Independence War 2 will find a great game in this. I have yet to play the campaign, opting instead for the freeroam mode and while it took a few minutes to get on my feet I have found loads to explore and do in a galaxy that is filled with friend and foe alike. Good graphics, smooth controls, easy to learn interface, and lots to explore and do. If ya can I highly suggest ya check this one out.			"

												The graphics are very good, gameplay is decent with smooth controls that really work for this type of game, the story however wasn't crafted very well. But I will recommend this game because I'm sure there are people out there who will fully enjoy it.			"

												This game does not reinvent the genre but I would have to say that it has the most friendly learning curve and decent story/graphics to get someone who has difficulty getting into games like X series and Eve a fair shot at playing the campaign.  A little bit of a grind in the beginning but if you stick with it you will be gaining levels and access to bigger ships before you know it.			"

												Leveled a bit with sidemissions, traded some things, started to steal ships, got rich af, bought a bigger stealth ship to steal bigger ships, sold bigger ships, bought licenses, bought even more licenses, bought ALL of them, found a station that sells me my best weapons for less than they buy them, stayed on that station for several months making money(haha, nice joke! ingametime doesnt pass on stations and planets), got out with an enourmously huge monster ship that can steal even bigger ships, got to the other side of the universe and bought the absolutly best ship to steal ships, kept all expensive weapons i found, i mean stole, went back to the station with the same full trading skills and trading skill mercenaries i found the stations trading logic with (yes, i wrote down on a sheet of paper where i can find them, just like with any of the ship slot upgrades), made 100bio in like half an hour of trading the same weapons over and over again. bought the universe.I legitimately broke the game.I even sold ships that i will never use anyway just for the overview. kept the cool ones ofc.At this point Im just hunting down Heroes, stopped the story at like mission 14 because overly upgraded and overly well equipped me and 2 uber mercenary ships wreck just anything, no matter the title.didnt get the artifact looting stuff, either its bugged for me, or i just didnt try to switch my reputation to the negative to be able to loot them.

												Great game while I'm waiting for Elite: Dangerous. Seems to push all the right buttons - it's one of those games where you keep telling yourself ""I'll just to this one last mission"" and before you know it you've spend the whole day on it. For me, it is what I wanted from X: Rebirth - note I never bought X:Rebirth due to the abysmal reviews at release.The developers of Starpoint Gemini 2are active on Steam and seem to take comments & reports serious. At version 1.0001 it's not perfect yet and the GFX could need some performance optimization but that's to be expected two days after release. Overall a good start. If you're into space freeroaming, get it.			"

												This game's excellent. It's like what you'd get if you mixed Eve-Online with the original Privateer game from the 90s. There's a huge world to explore, lots of backstory and content, and you can decid to freeplay it or follow the plot at any point. The developers are very responsive about fixing bugs or improving the game. I emailed in a couple of bug reports with log files, and they responded that they were working on it, and released a patch the next day. They have released two minor patches in the day since they have released.			"

												I obtained this game in early April 2016 during a great sale. The TL;DR is this: simple enough to pick up, complex enough not to put down. For me The game is marred only by its poor save mechanic and truly terrible voice acting. I was a bit surprised at how good this game was. Others have called it “Eve Light” and guess what? Its good enough comparison. Like other games such as “evochron Mercenary”, the Various “X” games like X3:Terren Conflict” , Freelancer etc, you fly around and do stuff for folks and get money from that. You can mine, salvage, build an economic power house, play taxi, attack the meannies, etc. What sets this game apart from the rest is a mix of easier to use controls, a good mix of things to do, good pace and an active community. If you think many space games are just too complicated without a joystick and throttle then you may like this game. Since I am not a pilot in real life, do not have a us$200 joystick, and have no desire to learn an intricate set of controls, I think this game is much easier to play and enjoy then many others of the same genre. Pros-	Controls are easy to learn but hard to master without needing an expensive joystick and throttle-	Enough choice to feel in control-	Good selection of mission types-	Fun achievements-	Good mix of things to do-	Fun exploration-	Developers are active in the community-	Enjoyable forum community-	Single player offline goodness. -	Survives repeated alt-tabbing out of the game.-	A slower pace then some space games -	Enough choices to feel in control without being so overwhelmed that you cant wrap your head around where to even begin-	Long tutorial campaign is kind of fun but not mandatory you can start it and pick the main campaign back up when you want to. Cons-	Really poor voice acting. Seriously BAD. Its cringe worthy how poor the voice acting is. -	Poor save game mechanic you can’t just save when you want to.  you’ll have to fly back to a station so its not the right choice for busy life if you can’t set aside a block of play time. This sis not a game that you can start to play if there is much chance of interruption since you may often find you cant save for another 5 or 10 minutes. -	Boring choice of ships in the start – just your own ship, nothing compares for some time into the game. There is nothing wrong with your starting ship but you can’t just swap it out for another other until much later in the game the other choices are simply too weak compared to what you start out using. -	Often inscrutable choices – you’ll need to use google allot to get a hang of what is going on. It’s a good thing that alt-tab does not break the game. It is a good thing the community is so active and there is plenty of information out there. -	Tutorial is bit thin you’ll need to google allot. it will help if you have played other space games like Eve Online, Freelancer, etc before this game.-	If you have played other space sims and want an immersive dog fighting, pirating power house this is not the right game for you.-	Single player may be a snooze fest if you are used to the pace of online games "

												It's a space sim.If you expect soul-mouving roleplay or vast army battles or deep scale business management, you'll be disapopointed cause... it's a space sim.It's a pretty darn good space sim at that. It's pretty, atmospheric and quite fun to play.  There are a few bugs still out there but nothing major, nothing to break the game.  The map is huge.  You have good control over your ship and character. There are more factions than you need and there's always stuff happening.  Nothing heavilly scripted, it's all pretty much standard space sim missions.  Destroy that guy, smuggle this, escort that, repair this, explore that. You know.  Space sim.The voice acting is abysmal.  So abysmal, it's awesome.  Honestly, it feels like a game made by people who have a lot of love for the genre.  I expect to spend many, many more hours exploring space. I just throw a few Malcolm Reynolds one liners here and there and suddenly, I'm in space, doing space stuff. I'm cool like that. (I may or may not be taking meds regarding this)Oh and the music... I would have bought the game for the music alone.			"

												Game sometimes crashes on Windows 10 for no apparent reason. All requirements are met or exceeded, with the exception of using Windows 7 or 8.Aside from the occasional random crash, game has a nice EVE Online feel, which is something I have been looking for. Once you've gone through the tutorial, the game becomes easier to understand and play. Something I have not been able to figure out how to do and that doesn't seem to be explained, is capturing a ship. There doesn't seem to be a tutorial that covers the basics on how to go about doing it.The downside to this game as mentioned above is the lack of ""capturing"" tutorial and the occasional crash on Windows 10.If you're into space-themed games and want to pilot a spaceship or you're looking for a good EVE Online alternative with a focus on singel player, give this game a try.

The game play can be a bit daunting at first, but after a fashon it ends up adding to the total game experience.  The Steam workshop mod support is quite extensive and can create a completely unique and individulized experience.  Is it a true AAA title, no, is it a bit different and fun to play yes.			"

Balance is kind of an issue as trading earns you much less then fighting and auto-aiming is much better then manual fighting but the game works very well and offers a lot of content.			"

Posted: October 3, 2014
												First off: I like this game quite a bit. It is neither too expensive, nor bad looking or somehow broken or buggy.This is a first impressions, not a 100% review, because the game is huge.The good stuff:- Fly around in space in your own ""capital"" ship. I put that in quotes, because your first ship is a small semi-freighter whatever, but packs quite a punch. Apparently you can go all the way up to cruisers, destroyers, carriers and stuff.- Simple, yet efficient trading system (X3 would have done good to use that). You can see all available goods for trade as well as best buy and sell prices on the star map and can automaticall plot a course to the desired station.- Space looks good. Graphics are really not all that bad.- Combat is interesting in a sense that it's a mix between flying and shooting yourself and also using several skills to enhance damage, survivability etc. I'd just have hoped to have more interesting skills to use. You can also use items and fire your heavy guns like missiles etc. The coolest part, however, is to just have your turrets fire automatically while you concentrate on evading. This is not advised 100% of the time, but it's neat. Turrets will also have fire arcs to take into account. You can easily see the status of your shields and hull and can high tail it out of a fight with max engine power. You can also distribute power between engines, shields and weapons, so that is all very solid if basic (whoever played Freespace 2 for example knows what I mean). I would have liked to redistribute power from my forward shields to my rearward shields for example or have some sort of pause mode where I could issue my gunners or fighters to target a certain area of a ship. Either I just have not found a way to pause the game (because I see comments that it was supposed to be a thing) or it isn't there. I also don't know if you can target different subsystems on a ship. So far I have found an option to target ""ship systems"", but not individual ones. It would have been great to target a ship's engines or weapons individually to disable it, but I guess that would be a task better suited to fighters than capital ships. There are apparently also boarding torpedoes so you can take over enemy ships. The weapon types encompass all you really need, from railguns, to beams, plasma weapons, rockets and torpedoes. I'd just look forward to getting a bigger ship, but the only bigger thing I see costs a million credits and money is hard to come by if you don't invest a lot of time into trade or something like that. The cruiser even costs 15 million! Long way to go.- The map is huge and full of different factions and pirates.The not so good stuff:- You can apparently only have control over 1 ship (and some mercs) but not command your own fleet (maybe in an expansion or so I've heard), which is kind of disappointing, but ok. - Automated freighters. I don't see a possibility to have those either. You can own different ships, yes, but there seems to be no way to assign a freighter to go trading on his own in order to generate money while you do something more interesting, because seriously...trading is great and all but it IS extremely boring to have to fly the routes yourself every time...that is a ♥♥♥♥ing slow way of making money...but I think you can have stations or something like that at least...- The flight distance. Crossing from one point of the map to the other could potentially take a looooong time. There are fast travel routes, but those cost money...lots of money as far as I can see...that kinda sucks. There are also worm holes at least.- The campaign is...ugh...so utterly boring thus far? Go here, collect a core here, help this dude we totally don't even know or get to know...destroy a ship, bam 30 secs, go back...and all the while suffering through the TERRIBLE dialogue...I'm sorry, but this is definitely the weakest part of the game. Especially the main character just does not have an enticing voice to listen to in a game. Some spoken dialogue is even missing lol.- Scale. The fighting is a bit weird sometimes, because you don't even see a lot of the enemies you are shooting. At least not in the earlier stages of the game. Keeping track of multiple enemies in a fight is painful, because your automated gunners will not necessarily target your target, but whatever they damn well please. Also, the fighting is kind of weird some times. I've encountered an enemy that was apparently ""impossible"" for me to take on according to the game. I was level 1. I killed it. By staying on its tail and out of the reach of its main guns...really? ;) That was kind of anticlimactic...- Weapons and ships. I can currently buy some different ships and lots of different weapons systems and stuff, but it all seems worse than what I have, so either the game is not good at giving me information or there is no purpose in me buying new stuff. For example, I can buy a gunship for about 250k. That gunship has less hps than my starting ship, cannot carry missiles and has less power available, so why would I buy that? Also most weapons systems seem to deal less damage than what I have installed. That is weird.- Contraband. I once picked up illegal drugs from a destroyed ship. I was told I was entering an area where these drugs are illegal. I sold them. Nothing happened. Why can I sell this stuff at a station in a system where the drug is supposedly illegal? I don't get it.So, take everything with a grain of salt, but I'd say the game is definitely worth the asking price. If I had to rate it I would give it a solid 80+ I'd say. It does what it says it would do. It controls nicely, looks good and thus far I have not encountered any real bugs. There is always room for improvements and I hope an expansion or dlc will come out.			"

												While I've played this a ton over past 2 weeks, was very tough call on whether to recommend this for others.Pros:- Generally entertaining, I love the premise of an open-world space sim in general- Good performance & interesting visuals (no sigificant lag or graphics issues on my rig with GTX770)- Enjoyed exploring and ""freeroam"" option to explore galaxy & amass wealth as I desired- Fair amount of flexibility to do different activities such as trading, mining, fighting pirates, capturing ships, smuggling & choose to side with ""good"" or ""bad"" factionsCons:- Capturing vastly overpowered for gathering wealth quickly, breaks scaling- Enemies scale ... inconsistantly ... with your level & ship power, if don't gather a lot of wealth early can be very rough- Lots of late game special add-ons not quite working right yet / buggy (blueprints) and take a ton of work to collect- You can't actually land or explore planets (just get same menu interface as at any shipyard by clicking on it)- Factions vastly simplified, no complex interactions (while having something like 20+ factions, they all break down into 3 options: the hate everyone factions, the good factions, and the evil factions)- Also, as a ""space sim"" I find it extremely jarring from immersion that it disregards most aspects of physics as they operate in our universe (severe viloations or completely ignoring gravity with all objects permanently hung in same spots in space & no orbital mechanics observed at all, relative sizes/scale of objects at distance are wildly inconsistant and in particular planets are massively distorted relative to distance and relative to stars, optics of light/dark side of planets not shown, vacuum transmits sound, no conservation of momentum, space completely littered with stationary debris everywhere)Basically if you love the idea of an open world single player space sim with some very light RPG elements in upgrades/statistics, you might find this entertaining for a while as I did.  If looking for a movie-like story, or any realism in economics, politics/diplomacy, or physics, or multi-player options, or longer term RPG depth, you won't find it here.			"

												**UPDATE**(9/30/14)The game is now at full release. I will break the game into categories below and comment my opinion on them.(+ means positive, * means neutral, - means negative)Gameplay:+Fast, exciting and action packed combat+Plenty of ship customization+Controls are fairly intuitive and easy to use+Plenty to explore and collect+Moddability*RPG style progression (skilltree and leveling)*Unrealistic physics makes things easier to play but undesirable to some*No multiplayer-Limited to 3 class choice on start of new game, cannot change later-Unrealistic scale of universe (mainly planets and stars are WAY too small)-No docking animation for stations-Occasional crashesStory:*Typical story, nothing special-Bad voice acting/racial steriotypes detract from story-Some missions ""vanish"" from map meaning you must load old save to continue storyGraphics/Sound:+Good quality graphics and visuals+Good sound effects and music overall-FPS takes a large hit during a few mission scenes or large battles-Aforementioned poor voice acting-Visual bugs with space background images (visible ""skyboxes"") are occasionally seenOverall Impression:This game has been quite a fun experience coming from a fan of RPG style games. The level progression system and skilltree coupled with a highly moddable ship means you have a reason to keep playing and improving. You are able to pilot anything from a tiny gunship to a powerful carrier but do not expect to be a fleet commander. Emphasis on is your ship. The story gives you a reason to play but it is not where the game shines. The most fun to be had is exploring, lucrative bounties and close encounters with tough enemies. Its a shame the game crashes on occassion and the story has some bugs. These things will hopefully be ironed out soon.			"

Early Access Review
								If you enjoyed Freelancer or the X series, you will probably like this game too.It took me about 30 minutes or so to figure out what the hell I was doing. The tutorial was decent, if intrusive (you can turn it off and access it later), and gives you a basic run down of how to control your ship, and some information on the various HUD icons and such. After that, its up to you to explore and play around with things. The (arguably) nice thing about this game is that, unlike the X series, it seems difficult, if not impossible, to fatally screw up in the early stages of your game.Give that this is early access, there are, of course, some issues:  Choppy performance - I bold this because it made the game very difficult to play. I am not sure if its simply my machine, or if others are experiencing it too, but it is a tad annoying.  Enemies are too easy - I am not sure whether they get more difficult as you play and level up. At the moment, if feels somewhat final fantasy-ish in that early enemies are deliberately easier to give the player time to power up and such before throwing them to the wolves. If that is the case, then cool I suppose, but right now, given how easily I seem to be able to wipe the asteroid belt with these pirate's ships, I'm not sure why anyone would pick a fight with me at this point.  Weird random graphical bugs - Whilst switching from auto to manual targetting, suddenly thousands of beam weapon streams fired out from my ship, followed my curser wherever it went. Looked cool though.  Lack of clear explanations - It took me a little bit to figure out what the different colours on various commodity prices actually meant. Yes, I did assume that red meant something bad (probably a bad selling price) and green was good, but it would be nice to have a tooltip, or something, to confirm my gamer's hypothesis. I'm still not certain what yellow means.  Probably some other issues I've either forogtten, or those I""ll encounter as I play...Despite the issues mentioned, I think this will turn out to be a really awesome game. I'm quite impressed with what the developers have done so far, and look forward to more updates. "

												I'm only an hour or so in, but already I have that feeling as with many games I've loved over the years. Love the size of the system, love the campaign mode, love the visuals... combat is great fun and the addition of expendable modules is really clever. The Fleet isn't that well expanded on, I don't quite understand how best to use them or how to upgrade them.The way you access menus is fantastically intuitive, I didn't need a tutorial (which come thick and fast without any real sense of being anchored to what you're doing in-game) to reload weapons or move cargo, the buttons were just... where they should be.EDIT: Three hours in and still loving it. Worked out a few more of the game mechanics (loving the tactical overlay which you have to manually map, I have it on left-shift) and realised that I don't have a fleet yet! The RPG-lite elements are great, incremental improvements on all sorts of things means you have to really put some thought into what gameplay you want to get involved in. At this stage, unsure if it was wise to go with campaign mode, I think this could be even better in pure sandbox.			"

												This is a fantastic game that truly expands on an experience given to us by games like Freelancer. If you've played Freelancer or any other game like it, then you should have a great idea of what to expect.That being said though, there are problems that should be mentioned. Right now, in it's current state, the economy is ridiculous, or at least feels that way. Everything is ridiculously expensive (and by everything, I mean everything, including fast travel). And the only way to deal with an economy like this and still be able to buy stuff every once in a while is to hijack ships.So yes, you are allowed the freedom to do whatever you want when you want to which is nice, but if you ever want to advance your ship, you're going to eventually have to hijack other ships to be able to earn enough money. Or be prepared for a really long drawn out game of mining, trading, or being a freelancer.			"

								[Please note: I'm reviewing the Beta, played a few hours so far]You liked Freelancer, you like the (working) parts of the X-universe? You like to cloak your ship, sneak upon enemies, beam your crew abord and capture their vessels just to sell them at the next starbase? Then you should consider to buy Starpoint Gemini 2. It's just the far better game in comparision to the newest X-Game (and it's a little cheaper I guess).It's kind of different as well: you can slide your energy to different systems on the fly (i.e. shields and weapons), you can upgrade your ships systems one by one, you have a decent skilltree as far as I took a look and the performance is good so far -at least for a beta, what you really should have in mind. If you are willing to take a second for the game to load in new sectors the game runs just fine (on my system at least: nvidia 760,8gig,phenomII).Can't really say anything about trading though. I'm not much of a trader, but there are plenty of ships, stations and so on in which you can buy and sell stuff. What hits me is the option to smuggle: you got illegal stuff from the pirate you just blew up? Smuggle it on a planet and make some profit! :DWell, let's talk about the downs as well: Sure, there are some missions. Kill that, transport that, press a button to repair a station, look for a vessel in distress and so on. But there is quite a lack of background to me. Sure, nice music does a lot, but I didn't run into any NPCs/dialogues so far.______I strongly recommend the game at this point, I really did not regret to back up the developers here like I did with the newest X (yeah, you see, can't even remember it's name....aww god, I hate it so much xD).

Early Access Review
								This is my early access review - I will change my review for the final product.If you love the Sci-fi and the adventure of exploring space - particularly Star Trek, Babylon 5, or Star Wars - you will absolutely love this game! It's truly a unique space sim/rpg experience, and this is the first game that has done justice to this genre I believe. The universe is your sandbox, and you're free to do whatever you want - trade, mine asteroids, hunt down criminals, or take part in space battles - take command and boldly go into the beautiful, yet dangerous, reaches of space. - So far the graphics are excellent; the art style is beatiful; ship designs are unique, yet they will remind you of your favorite Sci'fi. At the moment, I'm flying a ship that reminds me of a Tau Empire or a Homeworld Kadeshi ship - love it. Being able to customize and design your weapon systems, costmetic look of your ship, and having access to a wide range of various kinds of ships, is the best feature of the game for me. Working to get that special ship you always wanted - whether it be a large Carrier class that can launch swarming fighters/bombers; a massive heavily armed Dreadnought armed to the teeth with Missile Launcers and Rail Guns; a swift Gunship or Corevette, decked out in Plasma Cannons; or a stealthy fighter class with cloaking - is all possible for you here.  - Music is atmospheric, and fits the setting perfectly - although, I would like to hear an extended soundtrack in the finished product, or post-launch. - Combat Missions are fun, and Space combat is the by far the best part of the game. Scientific explorations; Repairing Space stations, Science Vessels/outposts, or even Space prisons, is a nice touch to fill in the world, and make it feel like you're in a living universe. Although, there is need for more variations in these missions; though this is early access, and there is still more content in the works to make the universe feel more alive, and give you more to do as you explore. The game may be early access, but it's very well made in every way so far - I can only imagine how good the finished product will be. The Developers are the most friendly, and helpful ones I ever came across; they're transparent in their work on the game, and very open in sharing ideas with fans and are open to suggestions and feedback. This is a top notch game in it's genre; and both this game, and it's fantastic devs, deserve your support. Starpoint Gemini 2 has an exciting future, and I'm glad I've taken part in it's journey.

								This is the game I've been looking for for a while. It's a bit like Skyrim in space. Be a bounty hunter, be a space miner, or be a pirate. There's endless possibilities, and the storyline for the game hasn't even come into play yet.There is a MASSIVE amount of space to explore, and it seems each faction has their own look and design. They're currently lacking in personality at the moment, but I would guess that will come with the story mode. For now the general rule is red=bad and green=good. There are a bunch of randomly generated missions available that would be side quests once the story takes center stage. The rewards for these though aren't exactly enough to purchase an upgraded ship, but hopefully the economy system will be more polished further down the track. For now, it's fun enough to just cruise through space and explore the huge map.			"

								 Do you remember the space sim Elite, or perhaps Freelancer, or the X universe games?If like me you have been looking for a new game to scratch that space sim itch, then look no further than Starpoint Gemini 2.Though still in Beta, this is already a very polished game with most of the content needed to get a good feel for the finished product in place.The game allows you to roam freely and explore, with multiple factions and dynamic missions, ( a campaign mode will be added for release ) there is already plenty to keep you occupied for many an hour.The game also has a great community following, with regular contact from the dev team at LGM who are very willing to engage with the players and to listen to their input.If like me you have been disappointed by the recent offerings in the space sim genre, then get yourself a copy of this game.

								tl;dr if you don't own this and you like space sims you are simply crazy.  With the recent updates to this game there is no excuse to not own it.  There is so much you can do and so far you can go and I've watched it all from EA on and it's still moving and growing.  Stop reading this review and buy it, if you don't like it please post it on this review.I could leave an in-depth review about the game but you've read a few of those by now.  Here's the meat instead.If you like space sims, in particular X3 et al, you should give this game a try.For a Beta it's surprisingly polished but don't expect a story or a lot of variations in missions.  Expect to explore and learn the game.  Also expect to be looking up ship stats and info on forums.... that's going to happen.  Expect the game to be quick and easy to pick up (in the beta). You'll be given a seriously nice ship that you will want to upgrade almost instantly, because that's what you do.  Then you'll want a bigger ship and you'll end up in the forums checking stats.  The bottom line here is that if you like this genre you can waste some perfectly good hours in complete bliss enjoying the fact that this game is still a beta and you'll get access to new goodies all the time plus the full game, that's one solid win-win there. Money well spent.Update: No longer early access and even better, but expect to give it time and get to love it, not a hard game but something tha tknowing the controls and using them will make a huge difference.  Keyboard/mouse is still the best bet though you cna now use a controller or gamepad and (IMHO) get 75% functionality.  There are just too many controls to get 100% out of a X360 controller and make it awesome, because believe me it's awesome.			"

												This was a great game in beta and even better now that it's fully released. It may take a little while to get into but there's plenty plenty of exploring, missions, ships, weapons and upgrades and also Workshop support.I haven't looked into the campaign much since the freeroam mode interested me more, but it seems to just be freeroam with story missions.The freeroam missions are a little samey after a while but there's enough variety of mission types for you to choose to be a pacifist or a full on fighter.Would recommend this if you like open world space sims, with factions and a good variety of ship classes and ships.

												This game is the spiritual successor to Freelancer I've been waiting for since 2003, but with everything I wish Freelancer had. Starpoint Gemini 2 is an absolute blast. Once you get going, it's rather hard to stop. My girlfriend has had to pry me away from the screen several times. The dynamic economy, fun combat, and RPG elements make this an all-around awesome game. I highly recommend getting it!			"

Posted: October 3, 2014
												First off: I like this game quite a bit. It is neither too expensive, nor bad looking or somehow broken or buggy.This is a first impressions, not a 100% review, because the game is huge.The good stuff:- Fly around in space in your own ""capital"" ship. I put that in quotes, because your first ship is a small semi-freighter whatever, but packs quite a punch. Apparently you can go all the way up to cruisers, destroyers, carriers and stuff.- Simple, yet efficient trading system (X3 would have done good to use that). You can see all available goods for trade as well as best buy and sell prices on the star map and can automaticall plot a course to the desired station.- Space looks good. Graphics are really not all that bad.- Combat is interesting in a sense that it's a mix between flying and shooting yourself and also using several skills to enhance damage, survivability etc. I'd just have hoped to have more interesting skills to use. You can also use items and fire your heavy guns like missiles etc. The coolest part, however, is to just have your turrets fire automatically while you concentrate on evading. This is not advised 100% of the time, but it's neat. Turrets will also have fire arcs to take into account. You can easily see the status of your shields and hull and can high tail it out of a fight with max engine power. You can also distribute power between engines, shields and weapons, so that is all very solid if basic (whoever played Freespace 2 for example knows what I mean). I would have liked to redistribute power from my forward shields to my rearward shields for example or have some sort of pause mode where I could issue my gunners or fighters to target a certain area of a ship. Either I just have not found a way to pause the game (because I see comments that it was supposed to be a thing) or it isn't there. I also don't know if you can target different subsystems on a ship. So far I have found an option to target ""ship systems"", but not individual ones. It would have been great to target a ship's engines or weapons individually to disable it, but I guess that would be a task better suited to fighters than capital ships. There are apparently also boarding torpedoes so you can take over enemy ships. The weapon types encompass all you really need, from railguns, to beams, plasma weapons, rockets and torpedoes. I'd just look forward to getting a bigger ship, but the only bigger thing I see costs a million credits and money is hard to come by if you don't invest a lot of time into trade or something like that. The cruiser even costs 15 million! Long way to go.- The map is huge and full of different factions and pirates.The not so good stuff:- You can apparently only have control over 1 ship (and some mercs) but not command your own fleet (maybe in an expansion or so I've heard), which is kind of disappointing, but ok. - Automated freighters. I don't see a possibility to have those either. You can own different ships, yes, but there seems to be no way to assign a freighter to go trading on his own in order to generate money while you do something more interesting, because seriously...trading is great and all but it IS extremely boring to have to fly the routes yourself every time...that is a ♥♥♥♥ing slow way of making money...but I think you can have stations or something like that at least...- The flight distance. Crossing from one point of the map to the other could potentially take a looooong time. There are fast travel routes, but those cost money...lots of money as far as I can see...that kinda sucks. There are also worm holes at least.- The campaign is...ugh...so utterly boring thus far? Go here, collect a core here, help this dude we totally don't even know or get to know...destroy a ship, bam 30 secs, go back...and all the while suffering through the TERRIBLE dialogue...I'm sorry, but this is definitely the weakest part of the game. Especially the main character just does not have an enticing voice to listen to in a game. Some spoken dialogue is even missing lol.- Scale. The fighting is a bit weird sometimes, because you don't even see a lot of the enemies you are shooting. At least not in the earlier stages of the game. Keeping track of multiple enemies in a fight is painful, because your automated gunners will not necessarily target your target, but whatever they damn well please. Also, the fighting is kind of weird some times. I've encountered an enemy that was apparently ""impossible"" for me to take on according to the game. I was level 1. I killed it. By staying on its tail and out of the reach of its main guns...really? ;) That was kind of anticlimactic...- Weapons and ships. I can currently buy some different ships and lots of different weapons systems and stuff, but it all seems worse than what I have, so either the game is not good at giving me information or there is no purpose in me buying new stuff. For example, I can buy a gunship for about 250k. That gunship has less hps than my starting ship, cannot carry missiles and has less power available, so why would I buy that? Also most weapons systems seem to deal less damage than what I have installed. That is weird.- Contraband. I once picked up illegal drugs from a destroyed ship. I was told I was entering an area where these drugs are illegal. I sold them. Nothing happened. Why can I sell this stuff at a station in a system where the drug is supposedly illegal? I don't get it.So, take everything with a grain of salt, but I'd say the game is definitely worth the asking price. If I had to rate it I would give it a solid 80+ I'd say. It does what it says it would do. It controls nicely, looks good and thus far I have not encountered any real bugs. There is always room for improvements and I hope an expansion or dlc will come out.			"

												While I've played this a ton over past 2 weeks, was very tough call on whether to recommend this for others.Pros:- Generally entertaining, I love the premise of an open-world space sim in general- Good performance & interesting visuals (no sigificant lag or graphics issues on my rig with GTX770)- Enjoyed exploring and ""freeroam"" option to explore galaxy & amass wealth as I desired- Fair amount of flexibility to do different activities such as trading, mining, fighting pirates, capturing ships, smuggling & choose to side with ""good"" or ""bad"" factionsCons:- Capturing vastly overpowered for gathering wealth quickly, breaks scaling- Enemies scale ... inconsistantly ... with your level & ship power, if don't gather a lot of wealth early can be very rough- Lots of late game special add-ons not quite working right yet / buggy (blueprints) and take a ton of work to collect- You can't actually land or explore planets (just get same menu interface as at any shipyard by clicking on it)- Factions vastly simplified, no complex interactions (while having something like 20+ factions, they all break down into 3 options: the hate everyone factions, the good factions, and the evil factions)- Also, as a ""space sim"" I find it extremely jarring from immersion that it disregards most aspects of physics as they operate in our universe (severe viloations or completely ignoring gravity with all objects permanently hung in same spots in space & no orbital mechanics observed at all, relative sizes/scale of objects at distance are wildly inconsistant and in particular planets are massively distorted relative to distance and relative to stars, optics of light/dark side of planets not shown, vacuum transmits sound, no conservation of momentum, space completely littered with stationary debris everywhere)Basically if you love the idea of an open world single player space sim with some very light RPG elements in upgrades/statistics, you might find this entertaining for a while as I did.  If looking for a movie-like story, or any realism in economics, politics/diplomacy, or physics, or multi-player options, or longer term RPG depth, you won't find it here.			"

Early Access Review
								Hey, I happen to like Starpoint Gemini 2 quite a bit.The game reminds me of Freelancer with the relatively simplistic, but still very satisfying combat.  You have your typical guns of various types, potentially including turrets with a 360° field of fire...  and a selection of quite useful torpedos/missiles.  I haven't gotten very far into the game yet, though...  so I can't say much about how the faction system plays out, or anything on purchasing new hardware.  I still STRONGLY RECCOMEND THIS GAME for anyone who enjoyed Freelancer or anyone who finds the thought of an open-world space sim with an emphasis on combat.			"

The atmosphere is great with a nice feeling of exploration, opening new sectors, finding derelicsts, enemies, etc.  Its open ended in a very assesable way.  Also, being captain of capital ships is a lot of fun with turrets, large weapons, crew and marines.  Super fun to capture other vessels by deploying your marines (best way IMO to make money early on).  Tons of fun stuff to do (mining, exploration, cap ships, smuggling, missions, etc.), and I haven't really played the campaign other than the first couple missions.  Also, the community is great and the developers are very hands on and make changes based on feedback.  Highly recommended.			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is to space exploration games what Skyrim is to fantasy adventure games. Vast, full of lore and play styles and activities for everyone, and just so beautiful to stroll through and appreciate the scenery. The long list of buttons and actions appear daunting at first, but are easy to learn and facilitate a rich level of interactivity that makes an enjoyable experience for both the casual gamer and the hardcore strategist. Stats, activities and tricks offer a healthy challenge for micromanagement fiends, and movement and combat are simple yet satisfying enough for someone who has an actual job and no time to micromanage in a virtual world. Also like in Skyrim, the voice acting is endearing and the accents are so thick you could cut through them with a knife. It's not often I play a game with just the right balance of exploration, story, environment, gameplay and general polish that I don't mind playing all day on a day off. Also like with Skyrim, STEAM WORKSHOP! Can't wait to find some funny mods in the future. Little Green Men Games nailed it. 10/10, would buy for the wife and kids.			"

												The best I can say for this game is: Meh.The combat is kinda fun at first, and there is potential there, but after playing space games in the past, this one makes a lot of the mistakes with not many of the successes. Pros: -It's an open world, and from what I have played so far, it's a pretty large space.-visual effects look pretty nice.Cons: -The writting/voicing are really vanilla. I spent more time wishing they would shut up than getting into the story or caring about backstory. as an example, once you complete a main quest, it just initiates another main quest. No cut scenes, no story development at all aside from 15 seconds of text being read by a character that you won't see again.-RPG is an exageration. you can spend points on different perks, yes, but thats it. instead of a new ability, you get a 5% increase in ""fleet soak"", whatever that is... speaking of:-The game doesn't really explain things like folks are used to now-a-days. Is it too much to ask for a tool tip to tell me what some of the features are?Overall, I bought the game on sale at 80% off, and still think I overpaid a bit.. Maybe the game will get a lot more exciting and in depth once I spend more than 10 hours on it, but I'm not going to slog through to find out.			"

												Did you like Privateer and Freelancer?  Did you read the reviews comparing this game to those, as well as Outlaw Star and other anime classics?  Don't believe them!  I did and I regret it.  If you like tutorials that are either outdated and no longer have any bearing on the game, or ""tutorials"" that are nothing more that a summary of key bindings, this game is for you.  (By the way, anyone who points out the shortcomings and is desperate to learn how to play the game they just bought are often derided as 5 year old simpletons in their tutorial forums.)Combat system is a joke:  The manual controls are wonky and attempting to manually control flight will send your ship into endless oscillations and fishtails.  If you let the computer take over this function by using the fire at will command, the ship stands still and shoots randomly at enemys off the edge of the screen, occasionally getting a hit but never resolving combat.  (I tried this, walked away for 1/2 hour, came back and it was still randomly firing at the same enemy with no real damage to my ship or theirs.)Don't care about combat and want to be a trader?  Good luck!  When you try to go somewhere, you are ambushed and drawn into combat, resulting in the frustration loop that I described above.Feels like an Alpha.  Despite what the developers say, this game is unplayable.  It has too many rough edges and still needs alot of work.Don't buy it.  I did and I regret it.Spend your money on X3, or some other legitimate franchise. "

												After a few hours in freeroam I feel like I've experience enough of Starpoint Gemini 2 to review it. First of all, this is mostly a classic space sim when playing in freeroam. It's mining/trading/mercenary grind to get better equipment and ships but it has some differences - there's skill points and experience levels, which is nice if you enjoy playing RPG's (I do)You don't start in fighter class ships. In fact - you can't fly the fighter class ships. You start in a Gunship class ship (or above if you have the DLC's). Your crew can man the turret hardpoints for you, and you will want them to. They are perfect shots every time. The turret AI is *very* good. You don't need to concentrate on weapons except to line up for heavy weapon shots, which are ammo limited but deal more damage per shot than your turrets. But....you probably won't even have to use them. Starpoint Gemini 2 has a problem if you're a pilot who knows basic concepts of space sim combat. If you can assess firing arcs, manage shield energy and experience in MMO type skill buffs, normal difficulty is a relaxing grind even if you take assassination missions 6 to 10 levels above your level. Most enemy ships don't have cloak scanners, so you can drop out and unleash hell with an undetected approach and take down ""Deadly"" and even with a little luck ""Impossible"" targets. This is a bit of a shame as this game wants to force you to fly combat role ships. I haven't seen ore freighters or transports. You can seemingly only buy Gunships and above with military kitting. Mining/Trading is viable but the cargo holds are disgustingly small and the mods that increase them in the workshop do not work with the DLC. You can not upgrade cargo capacity. If you're a frieghter captain your best bet is to get something with the biggest hold in the class which is marginally bigger than the rest and prepare to make MANY trips to and from asteroids and debris fields. Which is also a bit strange - asteroid and debris fields are EVERYWHERE, and you can't take advantage of it. Unfortunately most of the modders seem intent on putting in ridiculous godships instead of addressing the lack of civilian vessels. I usually like to play as a frieghter captain, in my game now I'm just a mercenary taking contracts well above my level for the massive increase in EXP and Credits. Overall I'm very pleased with this game. It's very underrated. I can expect I'll be putting many many more hours into it, as I have with X. This isn't Starpoint Gemini 1 for sure, and it's not the mess that is Star Wolves. It's not X either, but it's a better game than say Tachyon or Darkstar One and a nice alternative. Haven't played story yet. Not sure I will. Also this game and the Rebel Galaxy soundtrack works very nicely together. 10/10 Exploded a frigate as a gunship by exploiting cloak and firing arcs.			"

Its like they recorded all this♥♥♥♥♥♥in their ♥♥♥♥in garage.- Gameplay is fun in itself, I wish there was a tad bit more customization options for your ships- Oprah Winfry lives in your ship- I don't think shooting asteroids for mining is that great, I prefer more indepth mining in space sims- The job thing is kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I'd buy discounted.6/10 "

												Another space ship game which I love but this particular game is very shallow. It has a boring storyline and a bunch of missions, all very similar, which you need to run over and over again to get better ships so you can run the same, but tougher, missons over and over.Gets boring fast and I would not recommend this game unless you just want a few hours of space ship shooting. And dont be fooled by the variety of ships in the game. They all handle similary to each other and the size difference between the smallest and the largest playable ships is barely noticeable. So a gunship can fly side by side to a dreadnought and they are pretty much the same size. The dreadnought is maybe 20% bigger, that's it. So dont expect epic capital ships battles, you wont find it here.			"

												The game itself if phenomenal, and can be played for as many hours as you have to give it. Unfortunately you have to restart completely now and again, as every single save game past a certain level becomes corrupt with 100% accuraccy. You can't collect all the ships, can't amass a fortune, can't get deep enough to experience all that it might otherwise have to offer.Buy it on sale, worth $5 for the game play, maybe.			"

												A Freelancer-Style Space shooter with little rpg and the illusion of a sandbox.The main problem is... there is nothing to do. While the universe is huge, and filled with stations, orbital bodies and spaceships... everything is very generic and becomes boring quite quickly. Player interaction with the universe is rather pointless, things like trading and ""mining"" are not profitable enough to even bother with and almost all actions have no consequences for anyone. So, after a while you end up capturing random ships and towing them to station for sale, over and over again, because its the only way to actually make enough money to buy the higher tiers of ships.The gameplay is messed up so horribly, that a couple of patches will not turn this into a great game.Basically... just stay away from this game. Unless you can pick it up for less than 5 bucks. It'll do for an afternoon, but nothing else. "

												This game should come with a label warning that it is highly addictive.  For the price - around $17 US - it provides hours of fun exploring a huge universe, considering and accepting contracts to perform various missions, engaging in battles that can become nail-biters, gradually enhancing your ship and personal capabilities, getting a sense of satisfaction when your new fusion missile blasts a higher rated ship into space debris, and always wanting to take on just one more mission before going to bed.  So far, I've only played freelance and am enjoying it immensely.  There's also a story line option that I'll try later.  My only ding is that the manual is inadequate causing some minor frustration.  This is offset by ample online help in the forums.  The developers are highly responsive to forum topics and continue to improve on the game.  I view it as a solid long-term investment in fun!			"

												Once I got around the confusing controls and figured out how to configure the ship and upgrades the game started to be playable right up until it crashed. So I reloaded it, Crashed again. Then I turned off all the graphics goodies. Crashed. The game has serious issues and until they are patched the game is unplayable. I am using version 1.302 (latest Steam version). I don't recommend this until the crashing issue is resolved. P.S. I am running a 3.6 GHZ Intel  with Nvidia 650 Ti Boost , 8 GB ram. No other Steam games I bought have this issue. Update on the crashing: It seems to happen when I use a non-Trinity ship. I can play ok if I am using a Trinity bought ship. This ponits to database errors. I have to change my recomendation since the game is quite playable now.			"

												Fun at first, but a little more shallow than you'd think at first blush.  The combat is good, the graphics are good - but it will start to feel very repetitive and boring long before you discover/uncover the whole map.  At least it did for me.   For the asking price, I was expecting more gameplay depth.  It's a $35 game for the combat and graphics with a $15 game's depth of core gameplay mechanics?  That's my take, anyway.  Take with a grain of salt.			"

												Firstly, understand that although my review will say I've only logged 9 hours on this game, it's more like 20 because I played a lot in offline mode.This game is beautiful, both visually and with the music. But other than some eye candy and a few atmospheric soundtracks it doesn't feel like it has anything else going for it. Saving up for better ships is a slow grind, and combat becomes repetitive quickly. Once you get the better ships all you really accomplish is the ability to throw some more bullets/lasers at people at some different angles, but gameplay never fundamentally changes. Stronger enemies are just like the easier ones only they have more health and higher damage output, but you fight them all fundamentally the same way. The enemy AI is terrible; they have a self-preservation instinct akin to plastic ducks in a carnival shooting gallery. Killing enemies ranges from extremely easy to just downright tedious, but never feels challenging. The universe is clutterred with interesting stuff (real space doesn't have objects this close to each other) so there's no shortage of places to explore, but there's no real incentive to explore anything. One region might just be another solar system but with a blue nebula instead of a red one and the asteroids are made of some different resource. I'll give this game an alright/10. It's fun when you first pick it up, but playing for long periods will make the game stale quickly. I'm at a point where I want to play this game, but I just can't stomach flying around in space shooting at the same pirate ships to travel to some samey looking region- not for more than maybe 5 minutes at a time. I feel like there's nothing to do in this big universe the game presents. Hopefully the mod community will be able to salvage the game so I can feel like I got my money's worth.			"

It may take a little while to get into but there's plenty plenty of exploring, missions, ships, weapons and upgrades and also Workshop support.I haven't looked into the campaign much since the freeroam mode interested me more, but it seems to just be freeroam with story missions.The freeroam missions are a little samey after a while but there's enough variety of mission types for you to choose to be a pacifist or a full on fighter.Would recommend this if you like open world space sims, with factions and a good variety of ship classes and ships.

Game shaped very well after a rocky start and got filled with life and different quests. Compared to Eltite: Dangerous with quite the same gameplay approach (open world, trading etc.) This one is the better because the world is filled with much more life and gameplay is not as boring as in elite where 90% of gameplay is flying around with almost nothing happening. Worth buying on a sale with the big regular 5$ very cheap Secrets of Aethera DLC. update: Starpoint Gemini2 now contains the whole campaign of the first game for free!!!			"

												First off ignore my play time. I do most of my gaming at work and dont have an internet connection. Unfortunately Steam doesnt keep track of play time while in offline mode. As of writing this I have around 24 hours of gameplay in. In short this game is excellent and well worth the money.The universe is huge. And it would take a long while to fly from one side to the other. The ships are awesome. There is a lot to do.. You can be a trader, a pirate, a bounty hunter... The list goes on. It takes a lot of work to acquire new ships and level up. Not in a bad way.  I actually love it.. In my 24 hours of playtime I've only recently just captured a ship worth keeping and transferring to. Its not really grindy in my opinion as there is so much to do it seems you're all the time doing something different or new. I see that as a really good value for my money. I have only done 3 main/campaign quests at this point as you have to take time to level up and gear up for them. So its not a game you're going to beat within a few hours. Capturing ships better than yours is a real challenge and its very rewarding when you finally get one. So far Ive found capturing ships to be the funnest and most profitable thing to do. And when you finally get out of the starting gunship into something better it gets a little easier and much more profitable. The learning curve is easy. Not like learning X3 or anything. You can pick it up fairly quick.The game doesnt baby you.. You can run into a battleship that will destroy within minutes of starting the game so you always have to be careful and keep an eye out. There's always a challenge..It's not a game that will allow you to feel like a god that just steam rolls everything that comes along. I like that as it gives you something to strive for. However I will say now that I've gotten a better ship (Its a corvette btw) i come across a lot more ships that are weak or trivial. Its extremely cool when you come into an area with a bunch of them.. I just turn on Auto fire and watch my ship just destroy 5 or 6 ships within minutes.. It's awesome.So far the only things that Ive found to be less than great are the voice acting and traveling..The voice acting is far from good. Its not so bad that it destroys the campaign for you.. But its not good either lol. Your ships computer voice is great though and thats the one you'll hear 90% of the time. The traveling.. When you first start you dont really have a choice but to fly all the way to each location. As warp gates are expensive and not really an option at first. Worm holes do damage and really dont have enough of them to justify them as a good way to travel. Rifts help but they are kind of hard to stay in. So at first the traveling gets kind of old as the map is just so hufmge it can really take a long while to get from one point to another. But after you get a decent income going and you can afford the warp gates its not bad. All in all the game has been an excellent experience. And I feel the user rating should be quite a bit better than it is now. It's a game that I've quickly became addicted to and I already know I'll have hundreds of hours into before I get tired of it.If your looking for a good space rpg, sandbox, freelancer type game this one will not dissappoint.

												Pros:-It's pretty straightforward and fun. You don't need a month to learn all the controls.-lots of ships to collect and fill your garage-upgrades and things to spend money on-pretty good atmospheric space with things in itCons:-the ships feel a little same-y. After progressing from gunship through cruiser so far, there's little real difference-the missions feel a little same-y, side quests are just the same as the randomly generated quests. Main quests are only slightly different so far.-no dynamic economy, at least as far as I can tell. Gods are such small money compared to capturing ships and doing missions that you'll find yourself just hitting'sell all' instead of telling around for best pricesThis closest game to compare I've played is x2. This stacks up as a much simplified relative. It's more fun much faster, but there's also less depth. In x2 I would leave my computer running all day with time compression on and come back to see how much money I'd made reading. A game that can pay itself, and you build in the means to speed it up, should probably put a little more focus on fun. But it also was a much more engaging dog fighter. Here ask guns are on turrets, so the most effective combat is to just set them on automatic. Not the most engaging. The capture mechanic is decent, better than the x2 random bail out thing. But you can't command your own fleet and start and trade empire or manufacturing empire. There just seen to be fee ways to interact with the world. You can shoot things, scan them, grapple them, shoot them... I like the grapple mechanic by the way. But the ships don't feel different and lack a grand sense of scale. So yeah it's fun to capture and collect a bunch of ships, but the upgrades are a little wonky and there's not a ton to do outside of that. The weapons can be upgraded and swapped out, but all the other systems on the ship are fixed and can only have upgrades added. Why can't I customize whether I wasn't cloaking or a hanger? Style of pay is dictated by ship choice, not Games are cool and the most fun when you feel like you're discovering something special. An abandoned derelict that you can salvage for special items? Or one that's functional and maybe had a special feature. Hidden upgrades, officers, unique items that you can find as you explore would all help the depth of the game world. Overall 7.5/10Fun, but comes across a little flat. Could use some flair to make it feel more special.			"

												Pro- Many ships - Hard and addictive game play- Many items- Good guns variety  - Stealth +++- PvE is awesome - The feeling of power - Drones <3- Achievements Cons- Add more levels (heroes and missions can reach 120 level and the player has no chance)- The story is not so good (I played 50 H and then I make the story in a carrier :))- The game crashes randomly (this forced me to save on every station / planet I docked in very frustrating) - The game sends the user to main menu randomly with no warning - Playing the game with both ""Secrets of Aethera"" + ""TItans"" and perform them = Original -> TItans and then start Secrets will not let you board the station (station was already discovered before the walkthrough) and so the WTB (walkthrough breaker) will occur - Performing ALT + TAB while in FULL SCREEN or just press on the secondary display by mistake and then return to the game will cause the game to remain in window mode with all game text cut off and almost unreadable (restart required)- HUD is so 2006 - AI’s missile follow the player in “Power to engine” speed forever but the users have a range  "

When I browsed the discussion boards I was gobsmacked at how well and often the development team engaged with the community, for this reason I bought it and hopefully once I've done with the current games I'm playing I will sink my teeth into it.

												Ok, to get the good stuff out of the way this is a vast open universe with many missions and some cool ship designs. Now for everything else... really this is just a shadow of freelancer, the game it tries so very hard to imitate, the UI is far clunkier in feel, the graphics though nice aren't as in your face and don't lead to an immersive feel. While it allows things like fighter wings and other ship systems that freelancer did not, the mod community has provided the majority of those things for freelancer. Even with the whole process of mission selection, buying, trading and the storyline freelancer sadly just does it better with the cut scenes and even just being able to talk to people and get rumors around the bar providing a much greater level of immersion.A perfect succesor this is not but if you enjoyed freelancer there is still probably a place on your shelf for this game.

If you are looking for an open sandbox to just play in space, this is a great game.  You can mine asteroids, take down pirates, explore space anomalies, and overall just roam the galaxy.  There is a story option, I have not tried it, I wanted the sandbox.  Controls are explained, there is no tutorial, you're just dropped in space and free to go and figure things out.  Finding an asteroid belt of rare minerals sound fun?  This is your game.  Sound dull?  Move along.			"

												I've had the game crash a couple of times. Not sure if it's my computer not being up to snuff, or if the game just doesn't like me exploring from sector to sector too quickly...In any case, SG2 is really fun. The controls make sense, the combat is simple to grasp - but easy to toy with, the ability to simply mine for ore, or loot derelicts and debris for cash combined with the ability to attack any ship you come into contact with for their goods makes for a good choice. Annoying that one destroyed ship means the whole faction turns against you, though. You'd think it should be like a heat meter, or something along those lines.I haven't gone too much into it (work gets in the way - don't grow up, kids), but it's fun from what I've played. I do agree with what Zaayl says - that there could and should be more to the game - but it's definitely a game I recommend.			"

												What can I say...The voice acting is bad.The story is mediocre.The economy is not alive.Ways to make money are not balanced.Cargo space is far too limited even in freighter type ships.Ships are not really balanced in their own classes, much less beyond them.Every ship turns like an oil tanker with its anchor down including the light gunships and corvettes.Ships in general feel a little small. It's hard to tell a battleship from a corvette at even a relatively close distance. You need to be in molester range to see the difference.Most of the systems aren't explained even though there's about a billion tutorials in the first hour.Tethering a captured ship is painfully boring what with not being able to use PTE else the grapple breaks so I hope you captured one next to a friendly station and not one deep in hostile territory.Overall...I give Freelancer 2 a 6/10. It could have been much worse.			"

However, this is probably the only space game that does a good job of the whole space captain thing by giving total freedom in the star system and with the cell loading stutters aside, it is actually quite enjoyable to fly around. The ship customization is also done very well, allowing cosmetic modifications and system modifications to fit your preferred playstyle. This is not a AAA game, but I feel confident in saying that it is worth the buy.			"

There's always a ship which excels in it's category, which means most of the ships you fly - if you do choose one other than the obvious (or one of the obvious) best choice, for it's aethetics alone.

												Don't be fooled by the 30 factions, there are essentially 2 - good or bad, and even then being ""bad"" is difficult due to how reputation is managed.The gameplay is alright, but the most effective way of making money is SLOWLY towing in captured ships to salvage them. Cargo is incredibly limited on anything but freighters, but why would you ever fly a freighter? There is no sandbox or dynamic economy to speak of, so there's not point in being a pacifist. Regions are locked to one faction, the map is entirely static and the campaign is laughable. Large ships are only marginally slower than tiny ships, and no ship ever reaches the size of even the smallest EVE Online capital ship, so piloting a ""fighter"" is essentially the same as a carrier.Still, I love this game.The music is fantastic, the fetch quests are in an atmospheric enough universe that I don't mind the skinner box, the modding tools seem to be very powerful so a few of these issues could (or are already fixed). The ships don't look all that great (I don't think any game is going to reach the same level of lore and style as EVE Online), but I still love piloting them.I love it, but I wouldn't recommend it if you don't have a specific itch.

												My first take on this game after 13 hours of play: Commander storylineCompletely Kick A$$...Pros:-Gorgeous visuals -Fantastic UI design -Superb mission system -Good voice acting  (Similar quality to EvE)-Awesome background music (Similar quality to EvE)-Combat system - **check description below**-Load times are almost instant once you are ""in game"". Stations load instantly.Cons:-Still Slightly Glitchy start-up from desktop (3/3/14)-Plot is a little ""flat"". Good story, but the dialogue could have been much much better. Main character is scripted and voiced as kind of a D-bag. (unlikeable) The initial character development feels rushed, especially after the looooonng and verbose introduction.-lack of tutorials on ""fast"" travel options-Tutorial design is kind of tedious. Tons of clicking through to reach the end of each tutorial and lots of reading small print. IMO tutorials should be highly engaging and interactive. Possible spoilers ahead.Possible spoilers ahead.**I have enjoyed the combat system so far, but I am still in the original ship given to the ""commander"". It seems challenging (I have died 4-5 times), but not so much that I got annoyed with frequent reloads. SAVE OFTEN.I pilot my ship in the game's equivalent of an FPS mode. I have not tried the other (turret view) types of view. I highly recommend that begginers try the different types of weapons as some are much much more effective than others when running combat missions.Further review will follow			"

												This game has come a LONG way since the pre-release versions. The story/campaign is filled out with good voiceovers and an interesting plot with tight mission mechanics. There are some very interesting and rewarding side quests. The sandbox random encounters and freelance missions are still there and very good. There are very few bugs, and the performance is outstanding.This game is much less ambitious than, say, Star Citizen, in scope. It is a fairly limited third-person arcade-ish space shooter and trading game. However, everything that it does, it does WELL. That's a very respectable trait of a game, in this day and age, where the tendency is to over-promise and under-deliver. Starpoint Gemini 2 is intended to be an enjoyable single-player space opera where you acquire resources, build a fleet, gain renown and reputation, help some factions and war against others, and complete a storyline -- kind of like Skyrim in space. In attempting to implement these goals, it succeeds at them extremely well. I can highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good space adventure, with graphics that are slightly above average for 2015 (though not cutting-edge), tight game mechanics, and an interesting main plot.

												This gets a thumbs-up but only barely.  I've had a lot of fun playing in spite of the quirks.  The voice acting isn't as bad as others have made it out to be, but it is very inconsistent.  A lot of the time, the NPCs will start taking (along with text), then the audo just stops but the story can't progress until the audio (if it was there) finishes.My biggest gripe is how inaccurate the mission difficulties are.  More than a few times, I picked up a level-appropriate mission only to find myself facing an enemy listed as ""Impossible"".   It gets very frustrating considering how long it takes to travel to each mission.			"

												Good game, nice combat and beautiful graphics, but needs some engine optimizations and meaningful NPC's that actually do the same activities that you can do to make the universe seem more alive. As it is now it seems that you are the only miner or trader in the universe. Also, it'd be nice to have more interaction between you and the other pilots you encounter in the universe. With that said, since the devs are really active in the forums and are working to add more features to the game and the game as it is now is already pretty good I still recommend it.			"

								As it stands now, even in Beta, it's a gorgeus game, and you can have great fun with it if you are a fan of the X4 genre or the more arcadish space sims out there. Well worth the money asked for.But I feel it needs a little push in some directions. It can become much more than it is now, if given enough deep and polish. For instance, weapon stats are confusing, and they have no description. Uniqueness and a little story for each weapon/ship/commodity in the world would make it deeper. The huge starmap needs more deepness too, the different factions are not different enough, more involvement in each of them would make it more fun. You need to love some factions and hate others, to be really immersed in the world. Currently, there are only good guys, and bad guys. You shoot the bad guys, that's it :-). Voiceovers and images of the different factions are a must to achieve this.Balance is still a little off, but it's to be expected in beta after all. You can destroy large enemy ships (destroyers or battleships) with your starter ship, without much sweating, but overall it's very fun and asks you for fairly involved gameplay, you need to use special powers and equipment to see it through the large battles unscathed.I know for a fact that the team is constantly updating and expanding the game daily, so I have high hopes for it all to be fullfilled in the end.Must buy for every space combat, space trader lover out there!

								Not a fanboy of this game, I just found it 2 days ago. It's still in beta and I'm pretty impressed. It obviously has a few little issues, but is really really stable for me and has great graphics and mostly good gameplay.I think it has potential and the best way fo describe the game - for me - is that it's somewhat like skyrim in space. The game obviously has huge influences from freelancer and elite from back in the day.Unfortunately along those lines I think getting mission after mission that appears randomly and is just spawned from a list of standard missions - the time for this kind of gameplay is over. This is no different than grabbing a dungeon RPG and only getting random encounters in the dungeons which spawn from a known list.I think the missions could be far more interesting but there needs to be more hand crafted missions for this to get the replayability that something like skyrim has.There are a few UI issues but they are minor nuisances more than anything.The AI is also needing some serious fixing, I got into the game and killed a ""hero"" in the first few minutes netting me 5 million credits which is a gigantic amount.I am totally looking forward to this release, the space flight and combat are fluid and fun.Definitely a thumbs up on this game, with the proviso that current beta issues are dealt with.*Hopefully* it's a must have game.

								Starpoint Gemini 2 has the potential to be a serious contender in the space simulation and RPG categories.  The game is enjoyable.  It doesn't have a significant learning curve, and it's easy to get started right away without too much fumbling around trying to figure out which key does what.It doesn't appear to have any mechanism for owning/operating stations or multi-ship fleets that I've seen so far, but I'm only up to level 15 and haven't played very long.Despite this, I think it will be far more enjoyable than the recent disappointment in a long-running franchise (x).

WTF?Just lost 1 hour of game time because it doesn't autosave in missions, even the campaign mission. It didn't let me save when I was docked and then I failed mission because I left mission area, just wanted to farm some junk before returning. No warning, just RELOAD or stop playing camping options! And reload was on another station, had done freelance missions on the way and everything.Sad how a 10 year old game Freelancer beets this on everything except graphics.Don't waste your money on this piece of crap!

												I can only recommend this game for people who have no problem with simply flying around blowing things up and nothing else. Because that is essentially everything you will do in this game. Blow things up.Blow enemy ships up, blow wreckages up, blow asteroids up...The trading system is a bare bones basic ""pick things up that enemies drop and sell them at the nearest station""Sometimes you might come across illegal goods that might have the local authorities in a hissy fit but thats about it. Theres no system in place to actually figure out the best place to sell your goods so trade routes are a chore and not really worth it.The graphics are really nice but poorly optimized and some of the graphics options are locked at ""high"" like ship details and cant be lowered.The balancing is also all over the place with alot of weaponsystems being rather useless (all beam weapons for example) compared to the railgun type wich obliterates everything. Also even thought you can hire mercenaries to fly with you for a ingame monthly fee it never feels like you are actually in command of a fleet... wich is another missed oportunity.All in all what this game lacks is content... alot of content and a healthy dose of polish. There is a really great game hiding in starpoint gemini 2 but it just doesnt has any meat on its bones.So at its current state i can only recommend this game to hardcore space sim lovers who are starved for a title where you controll a battleship instead of a flimsy little one man fightercraft.  If you feel like youre that type you will get a lot of optical diverse ship designs... Thought there is hope that the modding community will jump in and polish things up a bit.			"

Too many bugs like being unable to target smaller ships (you miss them both aiming manualy or giving orders - sometimes only heavy attack helps) only one viable capitan class (two other are almost useless), frequent crashes and lacks of optimalisation. It could be great game. Sadly, it's really bad now. I can see some progress from 1.0 to 1.2 but still freezing at least every 2 hours makes this game a horrible experience.			"

												I'm enjoying the game quite a bit because the graphics and core gameplay are enjoyable.  There's also a relaxed atmosphere to the game - I don't feel pressured into ""grinding in order to get to the good part"".  The story is decent and there's plenty of ""flavor text"",  galactic ""news"", and loads of other ships flying around that altogether make the game world feel alive.  The GUI is well-designed and easily accessable with the mouse - I don't even bother using the hotkeys 90% of the time.  This also means that learning to play the game does not require memorizing a bunch of hotkeys!The random mission system is better than average compared to other games in this genre.  Also, progression happens at whatever pace you choose - you can sit near a station and shoot asteroids in relative safety for small rewards, or you can do the level-adjusted missions for a modest reward at minimal risk, or you can rush straight to the hostile sectors and do missions 30 levels higher than your own.  Or you can skip the missions entirely and capture ships, selling them for massive profits if you have the skill to pull it off.On the negative side, the game's ambient music lacks variety, so it gets annoying quickly.  Also, the ship's computer sometimes repeats warnings more frequently than necessary, which is especially annoying if the shields repeatedly drop due to EMP effects.  These problems are simply fixed by adjusting the volume settings.  I recommend listening to some space ambient music on youtube/spotify/whatever.I bought the game and DLC (""gold pack""), and I feel like I got my money's worth.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is excellent.  I'm only a few hours into it and don't even know the full extent of what it has to offer, but even what I've seen so far is extremely well done.  The system is open.  The ships pilot well from the keyboard or the mouse (haven't tried using a flight stick, yet).  The customization is extensive.  Overall, I'd say it's extremely good as beta releases go.  That's not to say there isn't some room for improvement.  There is.  But, the overall state of the game is very good and shows great promise.As far as negatives go, I'd have to say the biggest one for me is that there is not enough feedback when your shots impact an enemy vessel, especially on beam weapons.  The beams fire out and follow your targeting cursor, so the actual firing is good and responsive.  But, even at near point blank ranges, there isn't much to let you know that your beams are impacting a solid object.  Even a sound effect would be nice, a sort of deep rumble or a sort of cutting sound as you hit the enemy hull.  Close up, it's not a big deal.  But, at long distances, you aren't sure if you're connecting and wind up squinting at the screen to watch the enemy shield indicator.As I said, overall, this game is excellent, and it's still in beta.  I suspect there will be a lot more in the way of improvements.  I got this for $16.74 when it went on sale, and I'd say it's well worth that price.  Knowing what I know about it now, I'd likely buy it at full price.  As Early Access or beta games go, this is among the best.  Give it a shot.			"

								This game is really fun, mostly a good time killer. What it lacks in combat is the availibilty of guns and enemy ships in numbers and types. The sound is decent, a better sound track is needed as well as ship sounds. When it comes to money the only way to get it is by destroying wanted ships and that is not hard but just very long, but it adds to the game than taking something away.			"

								Interesting.  The beta is quite polished, so high marks there.  This game has huge potential.  Someone else called it ""EVE Offline"" and I'd agree with that, but naturally the economy is not as robust and combat is pretty easy.  I'm impressed with the modding community so far and I think this game can be something great if the community sticks around.  Well worth the price, great value.			"

								I'll update my review as the game continues development.7/19/2014, First ImpressionsI bought Startpoint Gemini 2, in spite of not really caring too much for the first one, but since it was on sale, and since it seemed to be so popular, I thought I would give this development studio another shot.  So far, I am glad I did.  Being an early access game, I expected some features needing polishing, and other features not yet to be fully implemented, which indeed is the case at the time of this initial post.  Having said that, I must say I find the gameplay mechanics very interesting, and the combat compelling.  If you are a fan of the old ""X"" games (except for X: Rebirth), you'll find some familiar concepts such as trading and boarding.  I also enjoyed how functional the developers made their starmap, making it easy to find missions, side jobs, or other distractions, whilst providing a wealth of information such as reputation and factions of each sector.  My only complaint here, is the lack of a legend.  I hope, in the near future, that will be provided as an on/off toggle.The combat is fun and flexible.  With the ability to upgrade, enhance, or otherwise customise your ship, each ship type you are capable of flying provides a wealth of possible combat configurations to fit your playstyle, or to try out different tactics.  I found the tactical overlay in combat especially helpful, though I had to manually assign a hotkey for it.  Of course, being an early access game, there are several areas upon which they can improve, such as providing a text-based battle log, or some other method of communicating more detail on what exactly is happening.  For example, when targeting an enemy, you have no consistent view of their shields.  There is some kind of HUD element that pops up when you first target them, but it does not stay up, and there is no clue on how to consistently get the information available.  It would be nice to be able to see, at least, the target's shield status on a consistent basis.  Likewise, critical hits are communicated, but no details are provided, such as what systems were critically hit.The Skills & Perk system of your officer is pretty cool.  It adds a lot of depth by allowing skills to provide several affects at once, while at the same time keeping the amount of button mashing (or mouse clicking) to a minimum.I will say one thing in this ""first impressions"" entry, and that is I was disappointed at not being able to command a fleet whilst directly controlling a ship of my own.  It is my hope that the developers have plans to allow this, as some of the game menus and screens suggest (such as ""fleet management""...implying the ability to manage more than one ship in your fleet).

												Awesome awesome game. Well worth playing. Much improved over the original game. Features a very decent free roaming space 4X style experience, that looks and feels great. With X:Rebirth being disappointing, this game seems like a snug fit to fill the gap. Buy goods, sell goods, get rich or die trying. Definitely a game up my alley.It's not without flaws unfortunately. The campaign kind of is best ignored. The voice-overs just aren't on par with the gameplay and visuals and as a result make the campaign look fairly bad. It's also super short, so it's ultimately not that much of a problem. Another thing that bothered me slightly was how the camera system could do with a 'free mode' where the mouse would actually turn the camera around your ship in 360 degrees. The standard camera views are very acceptable though, but battle fought using the auto-targeting system can get kind of chaotic. It's also chaotic in a very good way, combat in this game is one of it's strong points. All in all, very satisfied. With the current holiday sale offer, I'd probably pick it up right about now for added value.			"

												Pros:-It's pretty straightforward and fun. You don't need a month to learn all the controls.-lots of ships to collect and fill your garage-upgrades and things to spend money on-pretty good atmospheric space with things in itCons:-the ships feel a little same-y. After progressing from gunship through cruiser so far, there's little real difference-the missions feel a little same-y, side quests are just the same as the randomly generated quests. Main quests are only slightly different so far.-no dynamic economy, at least as far as I can tell. Gods are such small money compared to capturing ships and doing missions that you'll find yourself just hitting'sell all' instead of telling around for best pricesThis closest game to compare I've played is x2. This stacks up as a much simplified relative. It's more fun much faster, but there's also less depth. In x2 I would leave my computer running all day with time compression on and come back to see how much money I'd made reading. A game that can pay itself, and you build in the means to speed it up, should probably put a little more focus on fun. But it also was a much more engaging dog fighter. Here ask guns are on turrets, so the most effective combat is to just set them on automatic. Not the most engaging. The capture mechanic is decent, better than the x2 random bail out thing. But you can't command your own fleet and start and trade empire or manufacturing empire. There just seen to be fee ways to interact with the world. You can shoot things, scan them, grapple them, shoot them... I like the grapple mechanic by the way. But the ships don't feel different and lack a grand sense of scale. So yeah it's fun to capture and collect a bunch of ships, but the upgrades are a little wonky and there's not a ton to do outside of that. The weapons can be upgraded and swapped out, but all the other systems on the ship are fixed and can only have upgrades added. Why can't I customize whether I wasn't cloaking or a hanger? Style of pay is dictated by ship choice, not Games are cool and the most fun when you feel like you're discovering something special. An abandoned derelict that you can salvage for special items? Or one that's functional and maybe had a special feature. Hidden upgrades, officers, unique items that you can find as you explore would all help the depth of the game world. Overall 7.5/10Fun, but comes across a little flat. Could use some flair to make it feel more special.			"

												First off ignore my play time. I do most of my gaming at work and dont have an internet connection. Unfortunately Steam doesnt keep track of play time while in offline mode. As of writing this I have around 24 hours of gameplay in. In short this game is excellent and well worth the money.The universe is huge. And it would take a long while to fly from one side to the other. The ships are awesome. There is a lot to do.. You can be a trader, a pirate, a bounty hunter... The list goes on. It takes a lot of work to acquire new ships and level up. Not in a bad way.  I actually love it.. In my 24 hours of playtime I've only recently just captured a ship worth keeping and transferring to. Its not really grindy in my opinion as there is so much to do it seems you're all the time doing something different or new. I see that as a really good value for my money. I have only done 3 main/campaign quests at this point as you have to take time to level up and gear up for them. So its not a game you're going to beat within a few hours. Capturing ships better than yours is a real challenge and its very rewarding when you finally get one. So far Ive found capturing ships to be the funnest and most profitable thing to do. And when you finally get out of the starting gunship into something better it gets a little easier and much more profitable. The learning curve is easy. Not like learning X3 or anything. You can pick it up fairly quick.The game doesnt baby you.. You can run into a battleship that will destroy within minutes of starting the game so you always have to be careful and keep an eye out. There's always a challenge..It's not a game that will allow you to feel like a god that just steam rolls everything that comes along. I like that as it gives you something to strive for. However I will say now that I've gotten a better ship (Its a corvette btw) i come across a lot more ships that are weak or trivial. Its extremely cool when you come into an area with a bunch of them.. I just turn on Auto fire and watch my ship just destroy 5 or 6 ships within minutes.. It's awesome.So far the only things that Ive found to be less than great are the voice acting and traveling..The voice acting is far from good. Its not so bad that it destroys the campaign for you.. But its not good either lol. Your ships computer voice is great though and thats the one you'll hear 90% of the time. The traveling.. When you first start you dont really have a choice but to fly all the way to each location. As warp gates are expensive and not really an option at first. Worm holes do damage and really dont have enough of them to justify them as a good way to travel. Rifts help but they are kind of hard to stay in. So at first the traveling gets kind of old as the map is just so hufmge it can really take a long while to get from one point to another. But after you get a decent income going and you can afford the warp gates its not bad. All in all the game has been an excellent experience. And I feel the user rating should be quite a bit better than it is now. It's a game that I've quickly became addicted to and I already know I'll have hundreds of hours into before I get tired of it.If your looking for a good space rpg, sandbox, freelancer type game this one will not dissappoint.

								I've logged about 6 hours so far. It's absolutely cut of the same cloth as the freelancer style games. I'm enjoying it, esp. since it scratches an itch I haven't been able to in ages.It runs fine on my aged machine, without ratcheting down the video options. Haven't had any glitches or crashes. It looks pretty, similar to EVE.The UI is taking some getting used to, but I'm pretty competent in a fight now. Only down side there is bounty targets are hard to locate (I've only done so by accident so far.) It's nice that each ""role"" has some special abilities you can use in combat. Combat flows smoothly. It's neat how you can switch back and forth between direct control and letting your crew fire your guns for you if you need to focus on flying.Oh, yeah: crew. This game isn't single-man fighters like those older games. You CAN stay small, but even then it's a corvette or gunship. But you can also go big, with battleships and carriers. You can hire crew (which grant buffs), and eventually add wingmen to fly a small fleet. I'm looking forward to that.The trading is what you'd expect, and I'm grateful the game tracks high & low prices for you. Currently [in beta] earnings from hunting outstrip trading, so I hope they tweak the economy by launch. You can also mine asteroids and salvage defeated ships.The map starts concealed, and reveals as you explore. This often uncovers missions (bounties, supply or taxi runs, science scans, and rescues so far).Levelling up serves two functions. First you get points to make your special abilities better. Second, for unlocking the better ships. Because it doesn't just give you bigger numbers like a traditional RPG, there isn't a power creep.Over all I'm pretty happy. This is MUCH more playable than the X games.			"

								As it stands now, even in Beta, it's a gorgeus game, and you can have great fun with it if you are a fan of the X4 genre or the more arcadish space sims out there. Well worth the money asked for.But I feel it needs a little push in some directions. It can become much more than it is now, if given enough deep and polish. For instance, weapon stats are confusing, and they have no description. Uniqueness and a little story for each weapon/ship/commodity in the world would make it deeper. The huge starmap needs more deepness too, the different factions are not different enough, more involvement in each of them would make it more fun. You need to love some factions and hate others, to be really immersed in the world. Currently, there are only good guys, and bad guys. You shoot the bad guys, that's it :-). Voiceovers and images of the different factions are a must to achieve this.Balance is still a little off, but it's to be expected in beta after all. You can destroy large enemy ships (destroyers or battleships) with your starter ship, without much sweating, but overall it's very fun and asks you for fairly involved gameplay, you need to use special powers and equipment to see it through the large battles unscathed.I know for a fact that the team is constantly updating and expanding the game daily, so I have high hopes for it all to be fullfilled in the end.Must buy for every space combat, space trader lover out there!

												Early impressions.The game looks like it has a lot to do once you spend the time to set up your controls.  If you have a flightstick with several configurable buttons, it may take you a bit to figure out what is combat relevant and what you can leave as a menu driven item. Visually the game isn't bad for something a couple of years old.  The interface is uninspired but functional and the flight system is acceptable.  Keep in mind you're not flying a fighter and you'll enjoy it more.If you are having some difficulty getting the hang of it, there are several well done Youtube videos to help get you going.			"

												The apeal of this game is very specific.  If you are looking for a thrilling story filled action packed game, this is NOT it!  If you are looking for an open sandbox to just play in space, this is a great game.  You can mine asteroids, take down pirates, explore space anomalies, and overall just roam the galaxy.  There is a story option, I have not tried it, I wanted the sandbox.  Controls are explained, there is no tutorial, you're just dropped in space and free to go and figure things out.  Finding an asteroid belt of rare minerals sound fun?  This is your game.  Sound dull?  Move along.			"

												i have played tons of RPG games over the decades, and this has got to be in the top 10. you choose the way you want to play, no matter what, you got the free will to do it. yes, you got to earn money to get better ships, just like you got to do in any RPG game for getting armor and weapons, WoW, Ritf ,Star Wars, D3, but, guess what....... tell ya a little secret.this game is fun do do it. and you feel like doing it again, to play it a different way. maybe a bad guy the next time, or just get a cloaked ship and ninja your way around. its all up to you, its your sand box,and you play it the way you like ; )   i dont do hardly no reviews, but i just had to on this one. give it a try, dont pay any attenion to the negitive reviews on this one, them are the  people that are never happy with anything, heh. so what you waiting for, stop reading and get inro the game : )P.S. on a scale of 1 to 10. i will give it a 12 ; )			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2, Offers a lot to the genre I am a fan of space shooters and strategy games,  I loved Sins of a Solar Empire, Rebellion for its multiplayer aspect. This game only lacks one thing in my opinion and that is a lan multiplayer option allowing a steam friend to join you in the adventure in this game would be an awesome way to enjoy this game even further.  everything else for me it seems to tick all the boxes.  I would love to see the next Starpoint to offer a multiplayer option as that would allow a co-op play :)			"

								Having had this game for quite some time but only having checked it out for a couple of minutes, today I decided to check it out how it has come along in the months since I originally bought it. Needless to say I was instantly hooked and immensely enjoying myself.I am a Freelancer fan and although this game is not the same, it bears some resemblance with it.For anyone looking for a very good looking space action/strategy/trade game with lots of depth and very nice graphics (and music - I just love the soundtrack !) I can heartily recommend Starpoint Gemini 2.One last thing I would like to mention : the developers of this game are very active in their community and reply almost instantly to questions / remarks / suggestions. Thumbs up !Also : Steam Workshop support !			"

								I've logged about 6 hours so far. It's absolutely cut of the same cloth as the freelancer style games. I'm enjoying it, esp. since it scratches an itch I haven't been able to in ages.It runs fine on my aged machine, without ratcheting down the video options. Haven't had any glitches or crashes. It looks pretty, similar to EVE.The UI is taking some getting used to, but I'm pretty competent in a fight now. Only down side there is bounty targets are hard to locate (I've only done so by accident so far.) It's nice that each ""role"" has some special abilities you can use in combat. Combat flows smoothly. It's neat how you can switch back and forth between direct control and letting your crew fire your guns for you if you need to focus on flying.Oh, yeah: crew. This game isn't single-man fighters like those older games. You CAN stay small, but even then it's a corvette or gunship. But you can also go big, with battleships and carriers. You can hire crew (which grant buffs), and eventually add wingmen to fly a small fleet. I'm looking forward to that.The trading is what you'd expect, and I'm grateful the game tracks high & low prices for you. Currently [in beta] earnings from hunting outstrip trading, so I hope they tweak the economy by launch. You can also mine asteroids and salvage defeated ships.The map starts concealed, and reveals as you explore. This often uncovers missions (bounties, supply or taxi runs, science scans, and rescues so far).Levelling up serves two functions. First you get points to make your special abilities better. Second, for unlocking the better ships. Because it doesn't just give you bigger numbers like a traditional RPG, there isn't a power creep.Over all I'm pretty happy. This is MUCH more playable than the X games.			"

								As it stands now, even in Beta, it's a gorgeus game, and you can have great fun with it if you are a fan of the X4 genre or the more arcadish space sims out there. Well worth the money asked for.But I feel it needs a little push in some directions. It can become much more than it is now, if given enough deep and polish. For instance, weapon stats are confusing, and they have no description. Uniqueness and a little story for each weapon/ship/commodity in the world would make it deeper. The huge starmap needs more deepness too, the different factions are not different enough, more involvement in each of them would make it more fun. You need to love some factions and hate others, to be really immersed in the world. Currently, there are only good guys, and bad guys. You shoot the bad guys, that's it :-). Voiceovers and images of the different factions are a must to achieve this.Balance is still a little off, but it's to be expected in beta after all. You can destroy large enemy ships (destroyers or battleships) with your starter ship, without much sweating, but overall it's very fun and asks you for fairly involved gameplay, you need to use special powers and equipment to see it through the large battles unscathed.I know for a fact that the team is constantly updating and expanding the game daily, so I have high hopes for it all to be fullfilled in the end.Must buy for every space combat, space trader lover out there!

Can't wait till they come out with the campaign!So its been released for awhile and I've played a good amount since then, definately the funnest space game out right now(I have all the recent major ones), lots of stuff to do, some really great looking areas too such as nebula's and asteroid fields,  Campaign is decent, not exactly all I was hoping for but it still gives you direction.

												Pro- Many ships - Hard and addictive game play- Many items- Good guns variety  - Stealth +++- PvE is awesome - The feeling of power - Drones <3- Achievements Cons- Add more levels (heroes and missions can reach 120 level and the player has no chance)- The story is not so good (I played 50 H and then I make the story in a carrier :))- The game crashes randomly (this forced me to save on every station / planet I docked in very frustrating) - The game sends the user to main menu randomly with no warning - Playing the game with both ""Secrets of Aethera"" + ""TItans"" and perform them = Original -> TItans and then start Secrets will not let you board the station (station was already discovered before the walkthrough) and so the WTB (walkthrough breaker) will occur - Performing ALT + TAB while in FULL SCREEN or just press on the secondary display by mistake and then return to the game will cause the game to remain in window mode with all game text cut off and almost unreadable (restart required)- HUD is so 2006 - AI’s missile follow the player in “Power to engine” speed forever but the users have a range  "

												Dread. Really hate to give this review but here goes.Even the much aligned (by me) Dark Star One is better. It held my attention for 45 hours.7.5 hours into S♥♥♥♥nd I need to give it a thumbs down. I hate to do that given it's an acceptance of money down the drain. You can't win them all.I played Elite on the BBC B computer and all its subsequent upgrades. Long-time player of Eve Online, Freelancer, I War, X Wing and blah blah. Lots of them.Happy to give credit to the developers for trying and improving. I will definitely keep an eye on the new game and hope that is more my cup of tea.The game has a story driven content and a free roaming side. In fact even in the story mode you are quite free to roam around too which is a huge plus. It looks like to me the developers must have tacked the story line late in development as some of the beta testers much have shouted very loud ""Ho, hum, what do we do exactly?""Freelancer was the last great Space game and this is not a bad recreation of that. Just that in every aspect it is worse. It has me trying and failing to fit a DVD drive back into my PC so I could install it again.The in-flight movement and combat of your ship is pretty good. There are a few modes and modules to use. There is innovation where you can mostly destroy an opponent and then send some ruffians over to board it. If successful you can tow the ship back to a dock for huge income. Combat is pretty satisfying with options to fire yourself or computer controlled auto-fire. All thumbs up. I am told that as you upgrade your ship the movement in flight will also change. So big cargo ships move slower than smaller fast ships.Your pilot can improve his skills as you level up. This is also innovation for this type of game. To my rookie eye though these skills seem to be mostly +5% this and that. Your on-board computer scans the local area and identifies bounty opportunities and exploration is positively encouraged. The computer even remembers prices of commodities in every place you have docked which makes it very easy to trade away at the beginning. Whether you can do that as a main way of attaining riches I can't say. The prices of ships are very high.The universe itself feels slightly alive as you can pass fellow ships in your travels and scan and attack them for piracy fun. Planets and space stations have some small radio chatter that comes across.So why the thumbs down? Freelancer remains better and that was released years ago. It had better story line, graphics, ships, reputation system. Well, almost everything. I have hope though and if I ever play this one more will update this review. You might like it. "

								I haven't written a review in a while.  I have to tell you about this game.  For those of you looking for freelancer 2, well look no further.  What can I say about this game.  I am playing Beta version 0.8004, the release date is right around the corner.  The combat is fun and not too terribly difficult.  The number of ships is high, I think there are 70 purchasable ships available right now.  All ships are upgradeable and can be customized with paint, ship name, custom logos as well.  I've been playing for about 7 hours and have only explored maybe 1% of the universe.  Right now its only a sandbox game, but they will have a story mode on release.  There is no limit to what you can do in just the sandbox mode.  You can mine asteroids for money, you can trade commodities, you can hunt pirates, you can destroy and/or capture ships and tow them to the nearest starbase and either add it to your garage or sell it.  The game also has RPG elements.  You can take freelance missions that are everything from simple taxi runs to assassination missions, sector patrols, capture missions, science missions where you scan anomolies, and I've even done a smuggle mission for big bucks.  Most of all, there is a huge universe to explore.  Its awesome.  Get it.  Do it now!			"

Early Access Review
								Ok so im not very far into it so far just about a hour or so, but i would like to wright a quick review on the controls from a joystick user such as my self(i use the Logitech extreme 3Dpro). First i wasnt to say the game seems perty cool so far and i have a very good feeling about it that i will enjoy it e lot. That being said lets talk about some of the things im not liking off the git go. Controls-  I notice i cant set multiple keys to do the same thing. By this i mean on my JS(js=joystick for rest of review) i cant set the triger to fire my weapon and keep the left click on the mouse to do the same. For my style of play i find it use full to some times use the joystick then at others my mouse and key bord. This is just one exp of this issue. If it was at all possible to set it so you can bind up to two keys to 1 actions that would be great. I hope this is possible but it is a minor issue that is not game crushing. Another thing is the targeting system, i do like the way it is set up and do so much enjoy it. There are a few things i feel could be tweaked however. First i would like to see if it is at all possible to use the HAT key on my JS as a 2nd way to move the crosshairs around as you do with the mouse? I know this one would be a big hard to do i think but a ideal anyways. Then it would also be very nice if for when im flying around with my JS only and getting into a few space fights that my crosshairs stayed centerd to the front of my ship so as i turn it kinda move that way and so on not just at the postion i left it last with the mouse. This last thing i post about the JS is my only big upset so far.Over all the game at this point seems very interesting and enjoyable. Ill wright another review after i get some real hours put into it. P.S. Sorry for grammr and spelling issues my MSword is down atm so cant do a spell check. Hope its all easy to understand and ty for your time.Ok so after  some more gameplay:First thing i want to talk about is i went and put away the joystick and am trying the x-box 360 controller. So far it seems to be a bit smoother and more easy then my js but i notice that i can not bind the key 100% to my likings. Ex. The num-pad i am unable to bind any key to these and thats a big issue even if you do just up down left right thats 4 keys your missing out on as well as 4 more if you go NE SE SW NW as well. So that is one thing that can be greatly improved. Also this duel joystick type controller (x-box360) if at all possible would be nice too to have it move your crosshairs around the screen or be centerd to ship as well as i mention on js. Another thing i would like to ask about and maybe suggest is straff comands. This seems like such a important part of space flying and maneuverability. If these commands are intended to be left out please let me know if just not thought of that would be a great fix to the flying and maneuverability of your ships.			"

But heres the mindblowing TRUTH this game is infinately better than eve better than star citizen which so far is a catastrophe and X rebirth a game for which egosoft should be stripped naked in public and pelted with rotten eggs. If you want a goode game similar to no sorry directly plageriseing Freelancer this is the game you want its a lot more fun than Elite dangerous too so BUY IT NOW before it gets banned. 8 out of 10			"

												Dread. Really hate to give this review but here goes.Even the much aligned (by me) Dark Star One is better. It held my attention for 45 hours.7.5 hours into S♥♥♥♥nd I need to give it a thumbs down. I hate to do that given it's an acceptance of money down the drain. You can't win them all.I played Elite on the BBC B computer and all its subsequent upgrades. Long-time player of Eve Online, Freelancer, I War, X Wing and blah blah. Lots of them.Happy to give credit to the developers for trying and improving. I will definitely keep an eye on the new game and hope that is more my cup of tea.The game has a story driven content and a free roaming side. In fact even in the story mode you are quite free to roam around too which is a huge plus. It looks like to me the developers must have tacked the story line late in development as some of the beta testers much have shouted very loud ""Ho, hum, what do we do exactly?""Freelancer was the last great Space game and this is not a bad recreation of that. Just that in every aspect it is worse. It has me trying and failing to fit a DVD drive back into my PC so I could install it again.The in-flight movement and combat of your ship is pretty good. There are a few modes and modules to use. There is innovation where you can mostly destroy an opponent and then send some ruffians over to board it. If successful you can tow the ship back to a dock for huge income. Combat is pretty satisfying with options to fire yourself or computer controlled auto-fire. All thumbs up. I am told that as you upgrade your ship the movement in flight will also change. So big cargo ships move slower than smaller fast ships.Your pilot can improve his skills as you level up. This is also innovation for this type of game. To my rookie eye though these skills seem to be mostly +5% this and that. Your on-board computer scans the local area and identifies bounty opportunities and exploration is positively encouraged. The computer even remembers prices of commodities in every place you have docked which makes it very easy to trade away at the beginning. Whether you can do that as a main way of attaining riches I can't say. The prices of ships are very high.The universe itself feels slightly alive as you can pass fellow ships in your travels and scan and attack them for piracy fun. Planets and space stations have some small radio chatter that comes across.So why the thumbs down? Freelancer remains better and that was released years ago. It had better story line, graphics, ships, reputation system. Well, almost everything. I have hope though and if I ever play this one more will update this review. You might like it. "

												Damn good space comabt sim with skills and perks like in an RPG, even in beta with no story line there are hours of fun to be had bounty hunting trading and doing freelance missions.The Dev team and community for this game are second to none and have helped shape this game from alpha to the stage it is at now and this will continue until the game in finished.Visually this game is very nice and will only get better and the MOD support makes this a real stand out game for me I can see years of good MODs coming. If you like me are waiting for Elite dangerous and need something to fill the void left after X rebirth was released in a poor state pick this game up. For me i'd say this game is 8/10 right now and when finished may even be a rare 10/10 gem of a game.Post release update:Now the game's story line has been added and there have been many good updates the past few months the game has moved into post release development. The Devs are far from done adding content this title infact there is at least one planned expanshion that will be free of charge and further implementation on community ideas to improve on what is a fantastic base game.With that in mind the game has improved no end and i logged 215+ hours in early access and i'll be looking to easly double that amount of play time. The game is now sitting at 9/10 for me and with a little more polish and the the planned updates will be a clear 10/10, the games is an instant classic in that it has all the elements of some of the classic space sims and the graphicial polish of modern space sims.Update 12 June 2015 Origin DLC for Free. The Free Origin DLC came out on the 11th and is a port of the first game into this games engine and offers a new campgain that is around 30 hours long and then you can free roam like the in the first paid DLC or the base game. There have been a steady stream of patches and improvements made to this title and for any spce combat sim lover this is a must have it's not a first person fly from the cocpit game which there are many but a capital ship sim which I enjoy mostly in 3rd person view.

												Good game, nice combat and beautiful graphics, but needs some engine optimizations and meaningful NPC's that actually do the same activities that you can do to make the universe seem more alive. As it is now it seems that you are the only miner or trader in the universe. Also, it'd be nice to have more interaction between you and the other pilots you encounter in the universe. With that said, since the devs are really active in the forums and are working to add more features to the game and the game as it is now is already pretty good I still recommend it.			"

												this is very much like Freelancer it seems, BUT - there are four major problems sticking out right from the beginning. this might be somewhat personal preference, but its important to know for a lot of people Im sure:1. ship class like ""battleship"" or ""dreadnought"" are anything but what it says on the tin. theyre tiny, Im talking not even Rhino size, in FL terms, or, for those that didnt play FL, maybe three times the tiny ship you start with. and they dont have battleship models, either, they look like fighters. see here for instance: http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140824163327/starpoint-gemini-2/images/thumb/3/39/Helios_scene.jpg/954px-Helios_scene.jpg http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140824170102/starpoint-gemini-2/images/thumb/0/06/Tokio_scene.jpg/954px-Tokio_scene.jpg2. the art direction is really weak. as in, no distinct factions, no remarkable designs on any ship or station Ive seen yet. quite the opposite, most stuff looks astonishingly generic and uninspired.3. the sound assets are really weak as well. the traveling speed sound gets annoying really quickly because its a short, noticeable loop, and the weapons sound like tiny pew pews, no matter if beam or railgun.4. the interface is giant and ugly. but theres a mod that makes it less giant and less ugly, so it remains only fairly giant and fairly ugly.buuut, ther rests a lot like Freelancer, minus the multiplayer and the story, for now, and its early access. so there you go.

												This is just another generic, mediocre space fighting sim. There's no real hook in the story- in fact, the voice acting and scripts are just stupid. It's fun for a while, but very forgettable and probably not worth your time unless you like generic space fighting games that take very little brain power and have few customization/crafting options. The gameplay itself will keep you entertained in a casual gamer type of way, but this isn't anything special.			"

Зависает по собственной прихоти, не убирает окошки с экрана, всплывающая информация иногда представлена в виде странного набора цифр. Переработали интерфейс и управление. Теперь у нас космос трехмерен и управление похоже на, к примеру, Фрилансер. Проблем не возникает 8) Все стало более очеловеченное. ""Спеллы в космосе"" остались. ""Фриланс"" подбирается на карте - вышел на нее, кликнул на значок, ознакомился и взял/отклонил миссию. Патруль (пострелушки), сканирование аномалии и т.п. Можно копать, можно не копать. Астероиды. Товары в ассортименте. Общее впечатление скорее положительное, нежели отрицательное. Но все попытки чего-нибудь основательного прерываются зависанием - так что нормально пощупать не получается.			"

												So I got this game for gifted to me for 80% off. And I still feel a little bad about it, because it took 7 hours for it to dawn on me that it was probably something to refund. Which I now can't.Graphics: They aren't bad, but they seem bland, and even the skyboxes are a bit flat. It doesn't look like you're looking into deep space.Gameplay: Very little, mostly decision making. Which of these 3-4 Missions do I want to do? Enemy ships very rapidly become tanky and spawn in more than you can handle fairly quickly. Buying new gear or a new ship isn't really an option because gear is about 150-300k for the lower end stuff. And a new ship would be upwards of 500k-2m. Did I mention missions dole out currency in shots of 5k? 400 missions for a new ship.Trading is functionally nonexistant.Mining is there but is about as profitable as searching around a new york street for coins.Using manual firing is just an unpleasant experience, using automatic turret firing is derp and doesn't shoot at the targetted enemy, it just picks a random enemy.Scale: Everything feels very small, the planets feel small, the stations feel small, the ships feel small (even the ""dreadnought"" ships which honestly, between firepower, hp and size, do not deserve such a title).

												This is not an easy review to write.. As a veteran, sometimes elitist, critical gamer, I have a lot of reasons to not like this game in it's release condition, and this review is probably going to drag on a while, to TLDR: Yes, it's worth getting, if for no other reason than the potential it has as a modding platform for other game ideas.So, where to start?... Contrary to the normal rant I been seeing in the review of how special it is, I see it as a rather run of the mill space game, not too undifferent from many others I've played over the past few decades. It's an external space shooter with turrets, which leads many people to compare it to Eve, but it is nothing like Eve.Though I have yet to finish it, much resembles the game model set by classics like Elite or Privateer in which you fly around in your ship, in a go wild, lots of things to do and keep you busy, bad guys everywhere type setting with a pretty basic storyline that is format enought (so far) that it coulda been adapted to any setting and is not really science fiction in it's core, but they have set the story in space.It is definitely fictional through and through, as there is almost nothing realistic about anything in the game.. No real physics, a very cluttered space and so much graphics effects crammed into it that it's a wonder you can see through all the fog, debri, warp tunnels, nebula, etc. that are floating around... The game suffers through and through with what the guys at Penny Arcade's Extra Credits would call designing for coolness, not for actual plot value or realistic immersion... It's clearly programed for visual bells and whistles, cramming in things like they had a long list of 'It would be cool if you could have X"" type design notes with little thought or reason to how it all fits together or in any way helps the plot... There are junk clouds, asteroid clouds, nebula, Stargates, wormholes, slipstream channels (or green tubes of suckage as many have taken to calling them).. and most of the combat is pretty basic and uninspired... and it's got it's bugs and design issues as well.All that said, why do I still recommend it? Well, for two reasons.1.) It's definitely modable and almost from day 1 various 1st gen mods started rolling out, so the game can be loaded with features and has potential far beyond the state it's in now.2.) The devs seem extremely involved, are active in the community, take bug reports and comlaints seriously and are still very much in the polishing and debugging state of the game with a very fast iteration speed on fixes.Putting all this together, it's an okay game that was designed more for visual coolness than anything serious, but it has potential far beyond what it currently is, and will probably get much better before the Devs are done polishing it.

When you issue a go to command, the on board AI is not clever enough to redirect power to engines... yes, you have to do it every single time yourself. The AI is only there to annoy with its badly recorded voice.I just can't play the game like this, and quite frankly i do not have high hopes for the upcoming sequel either.			"

												Great game, apart from the physics.It's the game Freelancer could have become if Microsoft hadn't killed it. The artwork is impressive, the variety is good, and in general I liked it.The only issue I have with the game, and this is a major issue for me, is the flight physics. It's a SPACE sim. That means that when I turn off my engine, I expect to keep going until I say otherwise. Not here. In this game, they've decided that space is really just air-based fighters where you can't fall down. Turn off the engine? Immediate stop. Try to coast so you can move in one direction but face another? Not possible - you only move forward. Freelancer had this right. These guys? Not at all. I initially recommended the game, but find that I can't honestly do that. If you want a jet fighter game set in space then yes, I'd strongly recommend this game.  If you're expecting a SPACE game look somewhere else, as I'm doing.I'm still searching for a game that was as elegant as Freelancer, with newtonian* physics, simplified flight systems (so Evochron Mercenary, with its ridiculously overcomplicated flight systems and 90's inspired console graphics doesn't really do it for me either), and a decent single-player campaign but sufficiently creative random campaigns to keep things interesting afterwords. Drop me a note if you have any suggestions.======* After reading several reviews, I see that ""newtonian"" needs to be defined. ""Newtonian"" physics is simple. It means that if I put my ship in motion on a specific vector, I will remain on that vector unless I do something to change it. Turning off the engines should NOT stop me cold in ""space"". I should just keep going until I do something to change my vector. That ""something"" includes turning on docking assist, braking thrusters, or what-have-you. I'll accept ""slowing down slowly"" (space dust, donchaknow) but not ""stops as if stuck in mud"". If I wanted to play ""cars in thick mud"" I'd play a land-based game.			"

												This is a re-review implementing suggestions in comments:It's needlessly complicated, the z-axis doesn't add to the game compared to the original, and it generally isn't fun.Let me elaborate:-Although the single continuous world is an improvement, getting around said world is tedius and time consuming unless you happen to be near one of the shortcuts and that shortcut happens to end up where you need to be.-The combat is underwhelming. Basically, you tell the ship it can fire, it fires, you get shot at which is absorbed by shields, who wins is basically which of the parties has better shields and guns. Really the only thing you change is your facing so different shields absorb their attacks. Doesn't sound exciting, does it?-The user interface is complicated and it really has no reason to be. I came back to play Titans and I was constantly pushing the wrong buttons. The controls are not intuitive.-The story (including the DLCs) is uninspired, boring, completely forgettable, short, and ends before it feels like it should.There's only two things I enjoyed in this game:1) Exploring the galaxy.2) The SG1 campaign imported into SG2. This fixed a lot of the gripes I had about the original (especially having to grind to proceed) which is why I liked it.These things don't offset all of the other problems with the game though so still not recommended.As for why there are so many hours registered, it's most likely a product of running in the taskbar.  I repeatedly got bored of the game, alt+tabbed out, browsed the internet, and resumed later.  It does not reflect what it actuallly took to finish the game (as is the case with a lot of games).			"

So, this is  a very cool game from my homeland of North Kor...err, I mean Croatia. Not much difference anyway. I'll try something coherent here but can't promise anything:Gameplay:  - Not like Freespace/X/Elite: Dangerous Gliches Attack- If some game I haven't played before...ever, and Elite: Something something had a baby, that would be...well, something I still haven't had a chance to play.- Actually it's a slower paced game than those shooters first, trader last.

And looks better than every ""HEI I WANNA MAEK TEH INDEH MINECROFT STILEZ SURVIVAL BECOZ I HAEV NO SKILZ LOL"" (Terraria and so on)- This game hates me. Seriously, nVidia driver reminds me every day that I'm a stupid redneck. Why? Well, because I bought nVidia card...Even better... BLOODY SLI nVidia. Don't do that folks, you could die.Sound:- Nice soundtrack but honestly dear sound engineer/musician or whatever you like to repeat to yourself in front of the mirror.

												I picked this game up during a bundle but I wouldn't recommend it at any price point. Aweful voice acting, boring gameplay, and a seemingly nonsensical map structure are among the valid criticisms left by other negative reviews of this game.  I don't typically take time out of my day to publicly trash on a game but there are quite simply much better options out there for your time and money.			"

												For the ""tl;dr"" crowd:  7/10Almost 80 hours in, I found the game to be enjoyable for a space sim.  Many similarities to the ""X"" franchise (I have over 200 hours in ""X2: The Threat""), but somewhat ""lighter"" in comparison.Game mechanics are adequate (stations, planets, commodities, equipment, etc,), and do not get in the way of game play.  Conversely, they are not ""deep"" (no stock exchange, no station building/owning, no empire building), so there comes a point where it becomes routine and a bit boring.  I only played a ""Gunner"", and did not engage in all of the the game's offerings (mining, bounty hunting, etc.).I found leveling to be almost too easy.  I would expect higher levels to become asymptotically harder to achieve, but the experience points required to level seemed to be rather linear.  After 78 hours of simultaneous freelance and story line, I was at level 79 (""Fleet Admiral""), where the story campaign was only requiring level 40.  If you want the story line to remain challenging, you should probably stick to it until it is complete, and then freelance.Graphics are above average.  I always play with everything on high, so the space junk, asteroids, nebulea, visual effects, etc. really added to the immersion.  One of the bright points of the game engine is that nothing in space is instanced.  You fly through space, going from one grid tile to another, without having to transition in any way.  The only transitions in the game happen with the Jump Gates, T-Drive or Wormholes, which one would expect.Combat is enjoyable, with enough going on to keep it interesting.  It doesn't take long, however, to know when enemies will ambush you, what specific loadout will let you take down a Hero, etc.  I rarely died in the game, and when I did, it was typically when there were just too many enemies concentrating their fire on me (and no allies in the vicinity to pull aggro for me), or when I accidently left my ""Fire At Will"" mode engaged and approached a station with enemies docked.It is a 1.2 release as of this writing, and I have still experienced a few bugs.  The most ubiquitous is a ""Maintenence"" mission not completing following combat enroute (either by ambush or just encountering enemies along the way).  One that just hit me, that caused me to stop playing, was my entire equipment inventory suddenly disappeared after a T-Drive jump and an ambush when I materialized.  I went to change my equipement loadout (swap the T-Drive with Energy Shield for the fight), and my rather robust equipment inventory was just gone!  I tried several things, but I couldn't get it back, and decided that was enough.I recommend the game to anybody who enjoys this genre (my favorite), and who is looking for a less-stressful diversion from the higher-order space simulations.

Good luck :)			"

												The proper successor for the Honourable Freelancer series, made by Croatian indy studio.Game is superb, devs dedication is unparalled in so far (record of a  moment is 2 patches in a day).Game has fantastic GFX on better GFX cards, has a beautifully sculped universe and setting (check manual about intro), has a sandbox mode for leisure and a story mode for those interested in movies, stories, mysteries, politics, aliens etc...Game offers a player to fly many types (and lot of models) of ships from minute ones, to dreadnoughts and carriers.One can fly alone, or with wings of AI pilots (who receive orders, and yes, there is unavoidable chitchat occasionaly).One is a pilot with roleplaying options/skills...and other pilots...Unfortunately, at the moment, game has no MP support or option.Strategic layer in game is also planned as expansion/free addition ...Modding is about to be fully supported, and community has a major say in direction of that and further content that is being planned to be added into he game.There is a famous ""wishlist"" on the devs forums which puts everyone and their SF dreams to shame. A promise to incorporate most of it will be a small wonder in itself if it succeedes in 50%, let alone all.I wish there were more publishers and devs like those guys and those at witcher2 camp. PS There is one extremely dangerous and moraly questionable forum (search for M.e.e.P, no dots should be included) under SG2 steam forums, which defies bans, modding and steam overediting for ages now. It is however not for the fainthearted since it is said one can get nightmares involving the running bird, spaceships and space operas, folks of low moral values, and those of high. It is however said that people searching for enlightment have been heard of saying that they found what they were looking for.......därför, inte vänta! Springa!)			"

												Bought this (and the expansions) for just under $7 at the recent steam sale.  I have to admit, I feel like I'm ""Cheating"" the devs.  This is a quality game well beyond what they ask for it.  I'm the type who loves space sims.  X series, Elite series, and various other space games (KSP!).  This stands up to them (and much better than X Rebirth!).  Large sandbox and mission style play.  On the downside (compared to the other games): No ""Base building"" and it's economy is rudimentary.   But space combat , movement, travel, and general sandbox is very good.  Last 40 hours I've played just the base game, will soon turn on the expansion.  Capturing ships is fun, and on par with the X series.Good job, will buy the devs new game: Starpoint Gemini Warlards.

												If you are going to play this game, don't bother opening it until you see a video that teaches you how to board ships. This game's economy is useless/broken without this feature, and it isn't taught ingame. First time I played I got bored to death in two hours and left it. Months later, I saw a gameplay, found out how to board ships, and tadaaa, new game!It's not going to be the best game of your life, but you can spend a few hours having fun.And for those that say that it's like a solo EVE, it has absolutely nothing to do, EVE is much better, but it's a great PvP gank feast built exclusively for gankers.

												Great Game !Having a ball, If you like the X games or freelancer you will like this game loads of ships, missions, mining, boarding and capturing other ships, stations, tradeing, pirating, large galaxy, steam workishop. campain, its got it all and its done well , people might say its not as deep as games like X3, But personally i think its better (x games are only good with hundreds of community mods anyway and x rebirth was rubbish.) Its easy to get into once you get used to the controls and im hooked,  will be playing this for a long time, Devs are great, loads of updates and are working hard on community suggestions and updates regular.Graphics are very nice maxed out and it runs well on my machine, music and Fx are good and combat is fun there are perks and pilot types to choose from at game start, plus loads of weapons, upgrades, expendables, custom ships paint logos names etc...All in All i only  write reviews for games that if think are VERY underated and that should be bought to support these indie devs, soooooo what are you waiting for its well worth the money.....go buy it NOW!  8/10 in its current state if they keep adding things the community requests and more end game content it will get a 9.9/10 ..........one of the best game ive played this year!

												Star Point Genimini 2 is an open world space sim with tons of ships to choose from and plenty of space to blow them up in. The combat is fairly basic but in a good fight can become tactical in some manners, such as shield/armor/speed tanking. The weapons are not too exciting, small variety and needs some randomization to help with the very few good weapons in the game (Rail guns are basically the best i have noted, accuracy and dmg).The graphics are pretty and the ships are fun to look at.  Though even on low settings my computer has a lot of lag when traveling from sector to sector (specs below*).  It runs alright on a laptop but still laggy.The map is fairly big with random events that are basically all you do, which in turn makes the story line very bland.  The story line itself is lethargic and not very engaging and the voice acting does not help.  The missions get fairly repetitve, go here blow this up or repair that thing, however, there is a fair variety of ways to make cash.  I thought its cool you can capture enemy ships and sell them. Trading and mining are pretty mediocre, but in a big ship you can haul more. You need a constant income to keep up your fleet, this can be challenging sometimes because you just bought a bunch of shiny stuff, which will just bottom out later in the game because you have the best crap. All in all i recommend this game, its pretty dope and simple to play, it definately needs some balancing and factions dont really matter.  It can be a little CPU heavy at times on a laptop.  Be prepared for a lot of down times, there can be a lot of flying around to do.7.5/10Pros: Fun and Easy GameplayGood Looking Ships And Tons Of ThemChallengingAddictiveGood Diversity Of Money MakingCons:Lame Story Line HUD Needs Some Help (Mostly Needs A Target Disply On The HUD)Controls Can Be A Little WonkyNeeds Balancing (Ships and Weapons / Not Enough Actual Variety)Faction Relations Only Matter If You Are Trying To DockIntel Core i3-6100U 2.3 GHzIntel HD 5204 GB RAM			"

												This game is unbalanced. Apart from an unengaging story line with bare-bones, tired story missions, the free roam (the idea of which I love) becomes stalled and unsatisfying because of the unbalanced gameplay. Your rank quickly surpasses your ability to upgrade to better ships. This means the missions generated for your rank level are mostly impossible - as noted by the threat lvl attached to your target's info display IMPOSSIBLE - because you're still flying around in a pea shooter. Impossible engagements for missions of my level? That's absurd! I quickly realized that at around lvl 10, the only time I was actually completing those missions was when heavy allied ships were there to do the brunt of the damage. I realized I was doing next to nothing, very unsatifying, and only survived because the target's fire was directed elsewhere. So you spend your time wandering aimlessly trying to find easier missions which are few and far between. Also maddening is capturing ships - far and away the best means for generating credits - but which is nearly always hampered by allied ships blowing your target away before you can either commence or complete a capture attemptSo, if you like withering fire directed at your ship (who's shields are about as strong as plastic wrap), love constantly wrangling with camera controls, love grinding hour after hour after hour for little gain, and you absolutely adore constantly reloading save games, go get this thing. You'll love it.			"

												Many people have already mentioned the mediocre(to say the least) main campaign with the poor voice acting and the uninteresting plot. The map on the other hand is quite large but for the most part empty except for some generic space stations( used to buy and sell loot and save the game) and mining platforms(used for nothing whatsover).  There are quite a few ship types but the way they are used is quite similar so the difference between a small gunboat and a massive carrier is relatively minimum.There are some RPG elements where you can choose perks for your hero but they are rudimentary at best.And as a final thought the DLC Secrets of Aethera has a ""beautiful"" bug that forbids you from advancing the campaign after you discover Kepler station while the Titans DLC completely lacks voiceovers even for your protagonist.

Assaulting your player with a wall of text is not only unnessecary it's the kind of thing that makes someone not want to learn at all.So far my experience with playing is trying to learn a bunch of features that look like they aren't really useful by reading text that's almost too small to read. Waiting for my slow as♥♥♥♥♥♥ship with no boost of any kind to EVENTUALLY reach the destination. Fighting something, taking almost no damage then suddenly after the fight finding myself in a different place looking at the planet ahead from a different angle with significant ship damage. and eventually reaching the planet at which point I quit because the game was too slow and poorly made.

												Game is pretty bland, there are hardly any other ships around.  The trading and mining options are not worth the hassle, I gave it a try and found I was just wasting time. This game is good at churning your time for no feeling of accomplishment, I've sunk heaps of time trying to get somewhere!!  It gets very much the same experience at each sector and becomes pretty predictable.Pretty much you have one option, which is try to find a weaker/same strength ship, attack it, capture it and take it back for $$.  There is no other way that I've found to make any money that will make any significant difference to your bank balance, trading and mining are useless. The amount of time I have spent in the game has hardly earned me any decent upgrades.Some of the physics are cool, like going through wormholes that make you go through sectors faster and get away from strong enemies.  I kept trying to like this game, but it's not for me.			"

								I have read many reviews saying that the alpha version of Starpoint Gemini 2 is perfectly playable. Unfortunately it was not what happened when I installed the game on my PC. The game has had a lot of lag (my video card is old but has 2 GB, DDR3). I tried to change the video settings, but several options are displayed but not available. The pixel font in the game interface is distorted in my video resolution. In smaller text, is unreadable. I am waiting for the final version to see if I can finally play for real, because the game is graphically beautiful and have a promising gameplay.			"

												Not going to put alot of effort into this since it has been nothing but a pain. Like the premise for the game and even the game mechanics. Seems like it would be an awesome game if it would actually play. Keeps crashing, using gtx980 GPU so there should not be any graphics limitations yet it still keep going to a white screen while game continues to run and allow commands. Tried a bunch of different things to fix it, playing in windowed mode, not overclocking the GPU which it usually is for the hell of it, and even disabling nvidia experience (which seemed to fix it, turns out it didnt just let it play longer). Done trying to play this, THANK GOD the game was on sale, so im only out 8 bucks for buying the game and all DLC in one go. Won't try to play this game again until i see that it updates and says something about fixing crash issues. Hope this helps anyone reading. P.S. using windows 10			"

												TL; DR Its a trap! Great fun at start, absolutely mind numbingly boring towards the end. You start with a gunship and the map is huge right? Then you fly around doing freelance missions (10k each) to get your first ship which costs around 200k. After a while, you notice the 200k ship is not so different then the one you have, so you start eyeing that 2m ship which is significantly better. But how can you get 2m? By boarding other ships, thats how. The game is as long as it takes you to get that first 2m ship, philedelphia if I remember correctly. After that you resupply your marines and look for other ships. doing it will net you around 30m + some dreads. It took me 3-4 days to get that 2m ship since I enjoyed every view, mission and etc for a while. Everything was challenging. I thought the game was a little like eve. No.Around the 5 day mark I almost had/sold/destroyed every ship in the game and I was invincible. A mission? let me just warp in to melee range and press f (auto fire). A side mission 15 levels above? No problem. Massive battle near station with 10+ enemy ships packed together + hero? Let me just warp in melee again and turn different sides of my ship since shields on one side went down to 50%.  After 5 days of casual play there was NOTHING to contest my ship and I had not even started the MAIN CAMPAIGN. Noticing this, I immediately started the campaign and finished it in several hours. Everyone was saved, lots of joy, yay. But, nothing changed on the map. I had somehow brought the dlc's as well, and there is a bug in titans main quest which forces you to free roam. There are fixes for it but I do not have the patience to ""play"" this anymore.Oh and you can't destroy enemy stations, hell the shots go right through.Also why are there so few weapons and systems. You buy/capture a 30m ship and all you can put on them are the same measly crap that exists in almost all stations everywhere. There is no chance of variation or strategy. Why the hell would you cloak? "

												When it works it's a fun basic space fighting sim.  You can't make money to save your life unless you capture other ships.  You'll be doing that a lot.The problem is that it doesn't work.  I accepted that I would have to start it at least five times before it would load a game, and that I would have to save at least two files every few stops in case one gets corrupted (btw, I have a new gaming rig so everything else is working fine).  Now it won't load at all.  I've reinstalled the entire software, tried disabling vsync, tried in windowed mode, etc.  It isn't worth it anymore.  It's more frustrating than fun, and the manufacturer has not responded to my email about this.  Good luck.			"

It's impossible to do some missions untill you finish grinding to next ship. I /really/ don't enjoy the grind it is just to do anything in the game.

												It's not a bad game.I wouldn't pay the full price for this game. If you get it on sale, it's definately worth about 40 hrs of your time.--The space combat was very straightforward. Point and shoot. You win, you lose.Exploration was... very simple, almost entirely predictable.There were a lot of asteroid and debri fields. I don't think I spent more than 30min fumbling around in the very first one. I could have missed out on a very important part of the game by ignoring this activity.Trade was well thought out. Unfortunately there was no reason to participate in it. Overwhelming amounts of money had no real purpose. In other games, you could use massive fortunes to create space stations, buy sectors, buy planets, enable trade routes. I never saw that in this game (maybe I just missed it). Capturing and selling ships was more profitable, more entertaining.Money could be used to upgrade a particular weapon, endlessly, but it felt like a lazy money-sink. Investing in it made combat too easy. You could rent wing-men, but they were largely pointless if you acquired the above weapon.An alarming number of ships were useless in almost all situations. There didn't seem to be a way to improve a ship, if you liked it. There were modular upgrades that could be added and removed, but this seemed more like a standard approach - the upgrades must be done or this ship will be even more useless. I mention this, specifically, because I would have traded the money-sink weapon for a money-sink ship improvement system.The acting was good enough. The story was below average (which made the acting seem a lot worse than it was). Playing the main story may actually lower your over-all opinion of this game, which isn't uncommon for a space game. You have the option, in the game, to skip the main story entirely.There were some bugs in the game. Some of the bugs enabled exploits, so I'll avoid detailing them.			"

Early Access Review
								Cant say that at this point in the games dev that i recommend it... It is a very good looking game but for the time i've played there just isnt anything to do...Unless u want to blow up chunks of rocks or do the i think 3-5 repetitive ""freelance"" missions...I think the game will have the freelancer feel maybe when the story line is added in but yea as of right now the game is just open space and boring missions.....Kill this guy,take this guy somewhere,rescue that guy,repair this station,scan this thing....The ship controls for me seem very slow, i find i have to slow right down to almost stopping to come around to be able to fire on the bad guys..And then on some missions to kill some ship i find that no matter how long i shoot at it the shields dont go down past halfway...and sometimes the viewing angle is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that when i am aiming straight at the ship my lasers fly off nowhere near where im aiming...Because the view is over the top of the ship on an agle i feel that trying to fly somewhere is a challenge because i think im aiming my ship at the mark but im actually over or under it,never straight at it...The game seems to play pretty good, there is a little bit of jumpiness sometimes but its not that bad..I find that everything like new guns and upgrades are really expensive and doing the little missions on offer dont pay enough so havent been able to really do much to my ship...So to sum up.... Game right now = Nothing to do....maybe when story is added it might get better :)So as of this point in time i would not spend the $25 bucks like i did because this game is a shell....I would find a copy of freelancer cause i think thats the kind of game that eventually this game will become...

												Not a good game at all. Poor controllers, poor storyline. The idea is good, but the execution flawed. I bought this game thinking it could be a modern sucessor of Freelancer, a game I had several hours of playing experience and nice memories. Starpoint Gemini 2 is nothing of that. Save your money to purchase other stuff.			"

												Lots of positive reviews on here convinced me to pick this one up while I wait for Star Citizen to drop. The comparisons to EVE are a joke and the two hold nearly nothing in common. Freelancer and Privateer? Sure. More recently, I'd compare this to Galaxy on Fire.SG2 is nothing more than a sandbox space game. If that's all you want then you'll get a decent game. The interface and user experience could use a bit of work as well as additional options to sort/organize commodities and equipment. I honestly didn't expect it to reach version 1 in it's current state and really it could have benefited from several more months of dev time. Customization is very limited. Combat is fairly solid. You're free to do as you please, exploring the galaxy and making friends/enemies wherever you go.I just wish there was something to drive the player beside their own goal. SG2 is lacking any sort of story. No big deal, it's a sandbox; I get it. Little story arc type missions would add so much though. Or a mission board to pick up missions in a more traditional fashion. Or the notion of of carrying out jobs for a particular company as a series of missions and work your way up. As it is, the game consists of flying around without direction, checking your map for freelance opportunities, accepting an opportunity, fly to the waypoint and either kill the badguy, or pick up and deliver cargo.  Mission done. Repeat until you can afford an ungodly expensive new ship and start again. They're the typical space game missions. It's a grind. And for me, if I'm going to grind at least give a me sense of purpose in doing so. Overall, this to me, is still a beta and was rushed out without any clear direction.			"

												OK guys. If i were you, i would wait to pick this up. This game on the serface looks really good. And dont get me wrong, a game like this is good. I like the idea and game play.... Its just it still has alot of work to go, even though its released.There is alot of bugs... and i do mean alot.Alot of the voices are missing. And it has bad voice acting... realy really bad voice acting. Like ""2 worlds"" kind of bad (well maybey not that bad, but still).The game lags out the butt. I had to turn the graphics down just so i could travle around. There is no fast travle so most of the time, you are just flying from mission to mission. Everything in the game is rediculusly expensive so expect to grind for ever for a decent ship. (but i have herd you can modify saved games if you want to cheat.) I have had the game crash on me 3 times so far. Missions some times bug out, leaving you to restart the game or mision. You can only save while your docked, so  that long travle that took you like 10 mins... your going to have to do that again if you die or fail. (Witch will happen alot because the missions dont give you clear orders, so you might end up killing something your suposed to board, or boarding something you have to kill) No checkpoints in this game. I love space sims/games... but i am going to be on the look out for an update. This game does suport moding though. so there is that.Any way like i said... wait to pick up this game... if its on sale that would be the only reason i would pick it up. (sry for miss spells).			"

												People really liked this game and it has tons of positive reviews but honestly i found the game really boring, there is just a lack of things to do, its just go here kill this all the time. combat was good, trading is not my cup of tea, and i could never try any of the vast amount of ships because i could never make much money and progress in the game. storry was very well done though. theres nothing glaringly wrong with the game but it doesnt exactly shine either. its like EVE with no spreadsheets and more exciting combat. so i personnaly didnt like this game but thats not to say that it is a bad game in any way, just painfully mediocre.

												6/10I really wanted to like/recommend this game but I simply can't. After almost 12 hours of playing the game has been almost nothing but grinding randomly generated assassinate/repair/transport missions with weak bits of poorly voiced story sprinkled in.++Really vast galaxy, beautiful to fly through.+Good combat mechanics+Large space battles are fun to participate in.+Not half bad if played as a trading game, buying and selling commodities--TERRIBLY bland voice acting guiding you through a dull, uninspired ""story"".--Game almost immediately becomes a random mission grind-fest.--Galaxy feels empty, like a pretty picture that you can't really do anything with.-Scale of ships seems off, everything from a corvette to a dreadnought is almost the same size.-Suddenly every ship is rated Deadly/Impossible, even in the missions that fall in my level range.-A ship with a Weak rating will for some reason sometimes kill you in a couple shots.-Impossible ships will suddenly attack you even in the beginning of the game, killing you in a shot or twoEven now, looking at the screen shots as I write this I feel that this looks like a great game. It has the trappings of something awesome but never seems to follow through and do anything really well.  "

												Great concept, but falls well short of the X3 series.The storyline isn't bad, but the only decent way to make any speedy money is capturing ships.I love doing that, but Freelancer did a better job of letting you make money trading.I wouldn't have even written a review if it wasn't for the bugs.Ships that are 'trivial' ranked randomly had weapons that could one-shot your ship. I'm talking about a frigate that drops your cruiser or dreadnaught to 0 with a single beam blast or missile.  Break the Line had it happen time and time again. I only beat that mission by going back to a station each time I went to another waypoint to save.Towards (what I assume) is the end I was supposed to jump somewhere to take back the starpoint, only the game just went to a black screen.  I had become so increasingly buggy and the gameplay so slow at that point that I've decided to cut my losses and uninstall the game.			"

This Review is based on the ""Freeroam"" game and does not concern the storylinesStarpoint Gemini 2 (SP2) is a sort of tactical space-combat simulator with RPG elements. At the start of the game you pick a character avatar and name, a class and one of three starter ships. Then it plops you down in the newbie-friendly area of Planet Trinity and gets you started with some context-sensitive tutorials.Gameplay is fairly straightforward. You have a map of the universe, and as you fly around various missions become available. You can accept any of these missions; they can be a number of things: straight Assassination missions (destroy the target), Escort or protection missions (preserve an allied target and destroy enemy targets), repair missions (fly to a structure and use the middle-click context menu to repair it), taxi missions (fly VIP from point A to point B), smuggle missions (fly contraband cargo from point A to point B). Each mission provides some cash, experience and either positive or negative reputation.The reputation system is not spectacular. There are ""bad"" factions and ""good"" factions. Doing missions for the good factions, or blowing up the ships of bad factions, rewards positive rep. Vice-versa for the bad factions. If you want to work with the ""bad"" factions, you need to acquire negative rep. However, there are a handful of ""fanatic"" factions that you can never join, and destroying them ALSO rewards positive reputation, even if they are the target of a bad faction mission. I tried a couple playthroughs; the first time I didn't pay any attention to rep and within a few hours I was close to maxing out my positive rep (+2500 points). The next day I attempted to build negative rep, not knowing how the rep system worked (it's not explained well in the tutorials or anywhere else) and it took many hours of trial and error, and reading the Steam discussion forum, to figure out what was going on. In short the game is heavily balanced in favor of working for the ""good"" factions. The only way to change reputation outside of missions and combat is to find a ""good"" or ""bad"" structure and kill it (actually disable it, it's still there in a deactivated state) by holding down the fire button for a solid minute or two.Making cash in the game is equally frustrating. Most missions provide piddly amounts of cash, and the biggest incentive to earn money is to buy a bigger, badder ship. Missions also award experience, however, and raising your level tends to raise the level of threats you face. At level 10 there is a rather steep increase to the difficulty of missions involving combat. You are probably still in your gunship, when your targets become freighters and destroyers. This is even in the easiest area of the map (areas of the map are ""leveled"" in some aspect; how exactly is somewhat opaque). Effectively this locks you out of the most fun and rewarding missions, those involving combat. Inquiries to the devs on the Steam forums as to how this leveling-scaling works were ineffective.Ironically, the best way to make money is to simply pirate other ships. This is not inherently a ""bad"" move: as long as you are pirating the ships of the ""bad"" factions, you will gain positive reputation. Pirated ships call sell for between 100k to a million or more, depending on the ship and it's cargo. Capturing a ship is a fairly simple game of ""who has more troopers"". Even with extensive buffing of your troopers strength via skills and perks, it's effectively impossible to take a ship that has more men; taking one with equal numbers is a roll of the dice. There are videos available on the interwebs explaining this in more detail. Again, none of this is addressed in-game.There is more to talk about, such as the levelling, the exploration aspect, and the ""sideline"" missions that advance some sort of story in freeroam (it seems to be a ""good"" centric story, unfortunately for people hoping to be an enterprising space pirate; it is however completely optional). But I don't want to go on for ages. Is this game worth $42.00 (core game + DLC)? Absolutely not. It's a fairly amateur product that is struggling with balance and weird game-crashing bugs years after it's debut. The dev company is by their own admission very small, and their players seem to know the game better than them; unfortunately the wiki is highly underdeveloped, leaving brand-new players in the dark. This game was bought while it was on sale at 80% off; $10 is a perfectly reasonable price for a game that will entertain for about a week. If you're interested in deep simulation and RP opportunities, look elsewhere. If you want a pretty simple, fun game that looks good and doesn't take a lot of research to grasp, this may be the title for you.			"

												Seriously boring!!!!! I`ve only been playing a couple of hours and im finding this game incredibly repetitive. I bought the game based on the good reviews left on here but now ive played the game i have no idea why people have left such good reviews. The voice acting through the campaign is shockingly bad, every mission is the same - left click a point on the map to fly there, shoot something till its dead, listen to bad voice acting, open map and repeat. The combat is awful, you and your opponent just keep circling each other exchanging fire until he dies. If this game had cost me a fiver i`d of been like ""meh, fair enough"" but i think i paid about 25 quid and after just a couple of hours of playing i can honestly say ill never play this game again. Dont waste you money folks!!!!!			"

												I really wanted to buy this game a while back but finally they dropped the price and I managed to install this... this bitter disappointment. From graphical point of view this game is looking quite nice. They sound effects aren't half bad either. You will very, very quickly find yourself listening to some horrible voice acting. There isn't an ounce of soul in the dialogs. Also the whole tutorial is very simplistic (form of pictures) and brief. There is nothing, what so ever, that would phase you into the story and keep you there. I tried to force myself to get the value back, but failed miserably. Save yourself some catch and better buy some other indie game which are cheaper and more fun.			"

												The game is nice with its large map to explore, but it feels so empty. It also gets quite boring moving from one place to another continuously for quests and side mission to rack up cash. The one thing I really liked from it was the ship capturing feature. It's just annoying to get used to. I layed about 24 hours on this game and it was fun...ish. I'm glad I got it on sale because $35 is not worth the little content contained in the game.			"

												ProsWorks fine with keyboard/mouseConsBad storyBad writingBad voice actingCapturing ships is the only way to make money.  Mining and trading have no point to them.  You'll get attacked, capping just one ship will earn you 10x of what you'll make doing that ONE run.  Capturing ships has a faction of the risk of mining/trading and takes just so much less time.  The way things are priced, capturing is the only way to go.HORRIBLE user interface.  Its like the game does its best to hold you back any way it can through the UI.  When docked it hides useful information, rather than showing it on the main screen.  Things like your hitpoints, your ammo, troopers, cargo room etc.  Plently of room for it when docked, but its hidden behind DIFFERENT tabs.  So before undocking, you have to check several tabs just to make sure you didnt forget anything.           No ways to compare ships you dont own in game.            No weapon comparision.             No in game encyclopedia to see what gear you can get (I'd settle for what I've only seen          even)          Ships have stats hidden in hard to find spots.  You get a better idea of the stats on the web than ingame.          No market list of items available in each station (But you can check trade items, so the fuctionality is there)Just avoid this game.  Not worth the money, or even the time if it was free.			"

												Gameplay is alright, it's probably what you'd expect from a spaceship simulator or w/e.The devs are also really good at interacting with the community on steam forums (or at least they used to in early access, not sure about now)But the game has a lot of flaws & bugs.- Voice acting is probably the worst ive ever seen, and sometimes theres no voice during cutscenes (bug)- the cutscenes (where some side character talks to you before a mission) freeze your mouse & ship, but not everyone else around you. What does this mean? If enemies are in the area when the cutscene starts, you pretty much just get shot at for half a minute before you're able to react.-The supposed larger ship classes like Dreadnoughts and battleships are more or less the same size as smaller ship classes (like frigates and gunships, etc.). It's somewhat of a let down. I'll post a screenshot.-plot is pretty trash and repetitive. (Find NPC, Kill a few ships, repeat)screenshot: Frigate/Dreadnought Size Comparison


That dreadnought (one of the largest ship classes) isn't much larger than my Frigate.

												Kind of feel sad to write a negative review for this game, as my first impressions were so positive. It does many things right, but the bottom line is without an engaging story theres really very little to keep your interest.Credit to the developers for helping to bring the space genre back alive, but they really need to go back to basics and provide a real experience like freespace instead of a sandbox hoping we'll just amuse ourselves.

												Although it's now 1.0 version and has campaign it's very buggy, and campaign is not worth it in any way. Take it if you like to find your own motivation in the game in a freeroam mode, but don't expect anything more from the game. It's like a cool ""sandbox"" space shooter with nothing else to it. missions that are there are all the same and boring. I'd give it a solid 4 if they did not say it's ""out"" already. If I would to judge this as a finished product - it's a solid 3, nice try.  "

												Thousands of backers and fans who were eager for this game to come out; several years of development to get it just so; and even early-access availability, supposedly to alpha and beta-test the game before its official release.  Yet still, the game is awful.I have only played a few hours of it, but I've managed to compile a small list of incredibly important things that you should know before deciding to purchase this game, in the order of importance:1.  Making in-game currency is slow, almost tedious about 90% of the time.  Granted, you can choose a number of ways in which to generate the income dependent on how you would like to play the game (mining, trading, bounty-hunting, completing freelance missions, etc), but ultimately the amount of money that you generate over time is a very slow crawl and makes purchasing better ships, weapon systems, and other important ship equipment almost not even worth the grind.2.  Because of the fact that you have to grind in order to make any money, you level up faster than you can improve on your equipment.  Upon checking the official forums, I discovered that this is apparently a known issue that they haven't had the chance to fix yet, so it might be patched up at a later time.  As a result of your leveling which outpaces your ship class and ship's equipment, you will continue to face increasing numbers, frequencies, and difficulties of enemies that you will have more and more trouble dealing with until you can finally purchase better equipment.  Of course, this basically means that you're almost always behind the curve no matter what as there is no way to slow down your leveling and everything gives you experience.3.  The statistics which indicate to you how difficult a challenge something is in the game are arbitrary.  For instance, the game will tell you the general threat level of red-outlined ships which are about to attack you, which should be an indication of whether you should stand your ground or turn and flee.  This ranges from ""Trivial"" to ""Impossible.""  I have been able to easily beat ""Impossible"" targets with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ships and almost be totally destroyed by a ""Trivial"" ship in my brand new cruiser.  This same arbitrary system can be found in the instance of determining whether or not an enemy ship can be boarded and taken over by your troopers.  Generally, the lower the number of troopers on the enemy ship, the easier it'll be to overwhelm them.  This stops being the case after a few levels and, even with the maxed-out perk which increases your troopers' effectiveness by 15%, the smaller number of enemy troopers will steam-roll yours every time.Anyway, that's my two-cents.  On the plus side, the game is pretty and I liked where the setting was headed, but ultimately this is just a ♥♥♥♥♥ier version of EvE Online and not necessarily worth the price.			"

												I'll keep this short. I bought the game expecting someting even kind of like freelancer considering all of the positive reviews urging freelancer fans to buy the game. Unfortunetly I wish I could get my money back, this game has no depth. Really the only reason to play is to try and aquire better ships and equipment, but then it kind of pointless because there's nothing really to do other than these super generic missions. Also for some reason no space sim seems to get the freelancer esque formula for creating interesting swaths of space. In freelancer you would jump to a new star system through some sketchy wormhole and have to fight for your life to survive even just passing through. Only a few hours in and I've seen all this game has to offer. I'll waste my time doing something else.			"

												-Awful HUD: clearly designed by people who have no experience doing UX. To see the status of your ship you have to look in 3 different places- one of which is only visible when you are looking at the ship from 3rd person mode. -Awful story: it barely even exists.-Awful gameplay: boring, grindy, even the dogfights are lame and the AI moronic. The last game of this sort I played was Freelancer way back when, and that was about 1000x better than any element of this game.			"

												Freelancer 2.0 is a more appropriate title for this game.  It feels like an exact clone of Freelancer, it has taken some of the good points and missed out on a few of the vital enjoyable parts.  One of it's major shortcomings is the poor combat system.  It requires no thought, or real strategy, it almost feels as dumbed down as eve online's pathetic combat.  Another sour point is that the universe is rather small for a $35 game.  I managed to get it for $7 and I feel it's real worth is about the $15 mark.  For the most part it is enjoyable, but the lack luster combat system lets the game down.  You could just become a trader and not have to endure any combat but then you would be better off gettting something like elite dnagerous and trade to your hearts content.  An ok buy for $7 an over priced pile of crap for $35.			"

Early Access Review
								worth playing. Still Alpha\beta version is quite unfinished, but it will be a great game,as it have alot of abilities,perks, clsasses, SHIPS.You can be a large carrier,and send the huge waves of interceptors into battlefield to completely demolish enemy,OR you can be a battlecruiser, equipping alot of turrets on your hull,and make a real bullet storm,that consumes anything in its path.There are about 10-15 ship classes, and more than 10 weapons, of each of 4 classes of weapons(beams,Railguns,Plasma,and heavy)Economics in this game is great, but it is hard to earn money on lower lvls.10\10 MUST HAVE!But better wait untill release, to see all ingame stuff,not unfinished beta version.TRUST me, it is really nice RPG space battle simulator.

								Pretty cool, so far. I've not been turned off by any menu complexity or unintuitive features. I would even go so far as to say that the game is not only straight forward, but actually intuitive.It has a bit of an MMO feel to it, in the sense that you can move freely around the star system and blow stuff up to collect experience and items. I have a long way to go, before I will have a deeper impression of the game, but I am actually looking forward to getting into the game, which is more than I can say about a lot of games on the market these days.

Sadly I cannot get far enough into this turkey to find out if its any good. I have had repeated crashes on load, on reload, on popups from tutorials. Just looking at the screen is enough to make it crash. I have updated my drivers (doesn't help) and done a large set of ""usual troubleshooting tests"". I bitterly regret buying it - if you get it to work for you then maybe there is a good game here. Good luck with the endless crashes though. Its worth noting that this was written a few days after the proper release. Not early access, or public beta. It has been sold in a state that can be best described as unworkable. "

												I wanted to like this game and I did at first but my ""gotta finish"" OCD is only what drove me to finish (on the plus side, this game may have cured me of said OCD).  It got boring and repetitive quickly.Pros:- Nice artwork- Nice concept- Workshop/modsCons:- Most time is spent travelling/watching stars go by- Story has a LOT of useless/droning on text and dialogue that CANNOT be skipped- Classes aren't remotely balanced- Ships have no variety, only ""good/better/best"" with no trade-offs, not even cost- No penalty mechanic: you die, it bounces to the main menu where you reload your last save- No real side-missions, just grind trash when not doing the story- UI is annoying, no combat log, no explanation of different damage types/weapon types- Constant hitching/stuttering when non-threaded scripts run- Crashes to desktopIf you must play it, play Engineer class, use railguns and missiles, buff trooper capability and capture ships; you will earn money far more quickly (especially early-game) to keep max gear.  Don't waste time on ""artefacts"" [sic] or blueprints/salvage.  Use the wiki to see which ships are available and their features and locations to buy.  Get the speed boost to 200% mod and the graphics mods (wall textures, particle effects, and clear UI).			"

The voice acting is bad and the first thing that happens is they say, ""let's do a brief tutorial to defend yourself from pirates"" and then she says, ""I'm sure I don't have to remind you"" and...no tutorial.I'm playing with an Xbox controller (it's supposed to be supported) but none of the buttons are properly mapped and the control buttons in the options menu are labelled as, ""Joystickvertaxis1"" and such. When brief little tutorial text blurbs show up LATER, I have no idea what they are talking about regarding what buttons do what. The game doesn't tell you what you need to know and I felt like the learning curve was so daunting, I gave up fairly quickly. Not only for that, but because the combat....You press one button to automatically fire and you just jet in circles until your AI kills everything. Boring as sin.

												I totally see the potential of this game, but dont get fooled by all the positive Reviews on the HUB.This game gets compared ALOT to FreeLancer and if you´re a FreeLancer Veteran who bought it becaus of that, you will be hugely dissapointed.Besides the combat-system, FreeLancer, no matter if in terms of the world, the reputation system or the details, beats this game in EVERY aspect. And i mean the raw FreeLancer, i dont even wanna compare it to FreeLancer upgraded with something like the Discovery mod!It is FAR from finished and still filled with some serious bugs. It still needs ALOT of balacing, new content and more detail.Its actually SO far from finished that (Spoiler) the aliens you meet later in the Story actually use human ships. You heard right, they dont even have their own ships yet.I also hope, the devs take care of the longevity, because if they dont, this game will suffer the same form of death FreeLancer did:Once you completed the story, there still was alot to see and alot to get but sooner or later, you sat in your Titan Heavy fighter, you knew every single system no matter of Core, Border, Independent or Edge, you had all the rare special weapons and on your bank-account you had 10.000.000 credits you couldnt spend on anything.To all that, i want to mention something more: Remember how i said its not finished and still needs ALOT of work to be a game that´l survive longer than 10 minutes?Thats why i actually waited for it to get officially released. Turns out its one of those games, who gets more expensive the closer release gets. For months it has been on 21,99€ and once it got released, i got this half-finished game with an added bonus: A price increase from 21,99€ to 31,99€.Conclusion: The 25€ bucks i´ve paid would have been better spended on TF2 cosmetics.Wait a few months for the devs to finish it and for the Steam-Community to kick in via Workshop and even then, looking at how the review system misguides people on this one, you better wait for an special offer.As for now, i cannot recommend it.

												In reading through the description, seeing all of the videos, and having now played this game, all of the promotional material for it makes me think of a slick movie trailer that takes a train wreck of a horrible movie and condenses it down into a 1 minute clip that does an amazing job trying to convince you that the whole movie isn't complete crap; at least until you've unwisely purchased a ticket. That's this game. A turd with some slick packaging. It presents itself as a space exploration/trading/combat game, and while I suppose it can claim all of those things, it does them about as well as the Chicago Cubs do at  winning the World Series. Every aspect of this game feels underwhelming, if not painfully lacking. The game provides little information about how the various systems work, despite pushing many tutorial screens on you, that only server to annoy you with how much they leave out. Add to that all of the almost could have been's with the combat, UI, graphics, sounds design, and trading system, the travel system feels like it's there to punish you for playing. The travel time it takes to get between the mission is insanely boring. It's not just the time it takes, but they did a great job of making a horrible star field to torture you with. My greatest regret is that I gave this game a chance thinking it might get better and went over the two hours of play time and can't get a refund. The developers of this game should be ashamed of the final product they made, especially if you want to charge people what you're asking. My life would have been better served buying burritos and making use of my life time supply of Chipotlaway.			"

												I die way too much.  It seems there's a significant grind just to get anywhere in the campaign.  I did a few of the go here missions for the main campaign and by the time I made it to the escort mission, I was way out of my league.  Bear in mind, by this point I had done 10 side missions.  The game put me up against some freighter that just absolutely wrecked me and no ability or rerouting of shields could help me.  I barely put a dent in the freighter.This game's difficulty ramps up way too fast.  Either that or a glitched enemy ship spawned.  Still incredibly annoying and I wish I could get a refund.			"

												Frankly the worst game I've played in a LONG time.The flight controls want to be simple, but they completely destroy physics to make it possible.  When you throttle down from full speed, you stop on a dime, and when you turn the front of your ship, all of your momentum magically matches the new direction you're pointing.  The old game ""Darkstar One"" has a similar ""fly-by-mouse"" control scheme, but has at least SOME concept of physics.Combat in this one is pointless: 50% of the time, the enemies are blown up by mysteriously appearing ""friends"" before you can even fire a shot, 40% of the time they can be killed with ""stop next to them and blow them up with your laser/railgun/whatever"" tactics, and 10% of the time you get jumped by a ship so much more powerful than you that it cannot be killed or run away from.If you get tired of the pointless combat, there's a pointless trade economy (any station seems to buy anything you happen to be carrying, so all you do to ensure massive profit is buy anything that's green on the merchant's side, and sell anything that's green on your side).Most of all, there's the insanely boring flying between points...  Space is pretty big, and there's only a minimal form of go-fast mode (not time accelleration, but ""Power to Engines""), but that only speeds things up by maybe 2-5x, so that most of the time between pointless combat and pointless trading is spent in boring autopilot, flying between waypoints and watching fake looking asteroids and plasma outside your windscreen.  And if you happen to run into an actual asteroid... no big deal, you bounce off.  Literally 2-7 minutes of uneventful flight between each encounter.  As a side note, the campaign voice acting (including the player) is some of the worst I've heard in years.  Accents change randomly mid-sentence, and the pacing and stresses are often strange.			"

												Too complicated to learn and it seems like all you do is spend your time flying from one point to the other.    There are better games out there that are easier to play and offer the same thrill of battle.			"

												After playing through the first few missions you'd be forgiven for thinking this was a pre-release indi title, with awful voice acting of poorly written dialogue giving it a horribly unpolished feel, and a tutorial given in the form of a series of short descriptions you need to click through for each UI element but lacking in any practical examples of how they're used leaving you bewildered as to how you're meant to control your ship.I got my first achievement purely by accident just by following the first waypoint . . . which turned out to be in the core of the planet I was trying to land on rather than, as I'd assumed, at some kind of space elevator docking station.  When I finally figured out how to land, visually it was much the same as crashing into it - I still flew to about the same range but instead of warning me to stop and then exploding, the ship stopped and I got the planet menu.While the game claims to support joystick control it's very much designed for mouse and keyboard, with the mouse leaving the targeting reticle wherever you last clicked something.  I ended up awkwardly using the joystick in my left hand and trying to target with the mouse before giving up in disgust and returning the controls to their default joystickless configuration.The starting spaceship flies like it's on rails regardless of the control method you choose and looking through the keybindings gives me no hope of more maneuverable craft later on - you can move forward, turn and roll.  No backward or lateral movement.  Your best bet in a firefight seems to be to leave the turrets on autofire and do your best to fly out of the way of your target's firing lanes.  High speed dodging just doesn't seem to be in the cards, contrary to what was shown in the trailer.			"

												I didn't enjoy the game. I played it till I got the controls down. But between a tutorial that dumps a bunch of dialog boxes on me. To a rather clunky space game control setting, I couldn't get myself enwraptured as much as I wanted to. I wanted something that would send me back to the days of Freelancer.For those of you who like space games, it has some real meat, but it is a different veriety of meat, much like the difference between Beef and Chicken.There was a lot of flying around doing nothing, the system travel gates required money and just dropped you into loading screens. And while the scale of the star system is right and the customizability is there. It lacked a certain charm. A polish.Plus!-Customizable Ships-Huge in depth system-Lots of ways to burn timeMinus!-Boring Non-Customizable Campaign Protagonist (I wonder why the same guy gets used game to game, is it the same guy?!)-Clunky combat controls-Flat uninvolving ports and planets. (At least early game)-The Tutorial---Notes to the Devs.I honestly respect the work you put on this game, and I can give you a few pointers.On a thread I read you spoke about how your hands on tutorial didn't please, and how other people complained about this tutorial. There is a middle ground, hear me out.Rather than dump it all at once in a click through while the game is paused, simply in the opening acts give a small, non intrusive note that tells you how to do something, without pausing, or forcing you to do it.For example when you start get a quick side note saying how to fly the ship. When you encounter your first enemy get a little side note without pause saying the right mouse button fires.What you have currently is page after page of tutorial sheets, which, while not as long as EVE is thrown far more upfront. Sure EVE had a lot more tutorial text, but EVE didn't dump it on you the first ten seconds.Secondly, the Protagonist. For a space RPG many people regard who's in the Cockpit as optional or make a character. In this case we have the typical inexperianced yet cocky caucasian male. But my question is, what if you made the protagonist for the actual game slightly more customizable. Give him titles instead of a direct name. Like his father saying 'son' while others call him by other things. Next, why not increase a few lines of dialog by adding gender options, a female voice actor and the ability to choose as many options as Freeroam? Really honestly give the illusion of choice to the player by letting them make the person they play as. Kind of like Bioware did with Shepard, Hawke or the Inquisitor. Sure you don't have to be that in depth about it with 3d renders. But a few portraits and the options would have been amazing.On combat, a good thing that most space games do, is have a lead indicator and a smoother method of control. In this case I felt like I was trying to reign in a finicky second hand robot. And the lack of a lead indicator made dogfighting a pain. (Not impossible, but annoying. I still won, but it wasn't as pleasent.)I think there really isn't much that can be done about the planets, except maybe adding a more visual docking procedure such as an orbital station or docking ring, or some sort of 'Decending/Ascending' animation. Secondly on the Travel Lines, instead of making it a loading screen jump pointer, make it a long thread that you can ride that steadily consumes money as you travel it, and you'll be booted from the stream when you run out or hit abort. Maybe add lane contols and make it work like a highway.---All and All I think this game does a lot right and a lot wrong, and I love the passion I see from the developers and can't wait to hear what Starpoint 3 might hold on the someday. If you come into this expecting the next Freelancer, you're probably not going to enjoy it. And the asking price for the features which are missing are pretty major.			"

												I would not recommend this game for now.Yes it's a pretty game, but it doesn't have enought content, they need to add a lot more of it, so for now the ratio quality/price is not good enought for buying it.Beside after you'll try it for a couple of hours you will see that it's a game without a soul, there is not such strong end goal neither a purpose other than earn money (and you'll see here how much that is unbalanced).Let's make a simple list.Pro: - Graphically pretty.- Good control.- Easy to lean/play.Cons:- Not a lot of content.- No end-goal.- Very unbalanced.- Very poor game mechanics (like: the economic system here is so wrong).Make youself a favor and don't buy this game YET, if they re-work most of the internal mechanics maybe in the future it will be worth buying, but for now, no.TC			"

Early Access Review
								I like the fact that there is an open world, and many missions. I suspect this will eventually become a great game.I dislike:* I found no free camera look. You can use turrets or use chase look, but no simple free look.* You always need to select something to see what it is. A simple hover doesn't work to see simple info (I'm talking about other ships and stations, in the normal interface there's plenty of info)* I siply HATE the radiation thingy. It is the main reason of my many deaths. There is only a small indication (apart from your health going down) and only a warning when it's WAY to late to do anything about it.* The hull, engines, everything seems to go down at 50% hull damage. Do I seriously need the remaining 50% to see how it decreases further so I can die? (also with your radiation extremely frustrating)* The game hangs often when you want to open or close menus. (although it only hangs for a moment)* The joystick flying with joystick is very hard, throttle button doesn't work.I seriously recommend buying another game untill this one becomes a bit better			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 must be a good game. You can read rave review after rave review about it. I'm really excited to play it.Sadly despite configuring the game for maximum performance I'm barely pulling two frames per second. My computer exceeds the recommended system requirements in all areas except graphics. My graphics card merely meets the minimum requirement.Meeting the minimum system requirements should allow for an enjoyable experience. Poor graphics paired with 20 fps would be enjoyable. If that were the case with Starpoint Gemini 2 I have no doubt I would have had a wonderful time playing.If you decide to tune your graphics settings, one annoyance you'll face is having to restart the game for almost every change.

												Really wanted to like this game but it is very poorly designed. Mission levels not coordinated to your level but rather to some arbitrary zone level so a Level 1 mission in one zone is not the same as Level 1 in another. Game aide is beyond poor. Goes to window mode all the time. Spend 90% of your time flying between points. In my opinion better options in this space, try Rebel Galaxy. This may be deeper, but it is too boring for me personally.. Someone remake Privateer pls. And forget about Star Citizen, too damn ambitious. Props to the developer for responding, this is obviously based on my playstyle interests which may not align with yours.			"

												Not sure why this gets such great reviews... controlling the ship is ridiculous. It will go slow, and then suddenly move around like mad in any direction you choose. I don't know who reviewed this game, must be the developers. Absolutely terrible controls without a gamepad as well, forget flying the ship with a mouse and keyboard. Takes forever to hit something, it just doesn't make sense. The learning curve is really steep too, so be prepared to spend a lot of time just trying to figure out the overly complicated UI, makes no sense why it is so ridiculously complicated. Wait for a better game...			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is a game that I really want to like. The combat is fun, the graphics are good, and the open world is pretty...err... pretty, even though it is incredibly static with things like planetary rotation and many animations left completely out.Despite my attempts to like the game, there was one thing that haunted me as I played this game. I could not stop asking myself ""why?""Why did I want to tumble through space doing bounties and moving cargo? The story is flat out bland and totally uninteresting, with a typical ""avenge my father who the baddies killed"" revenge plot (and one of the most rigid and uninspiring protagonists I have ever seen in any game, and the supporting characters are worse by several great orders of magnitude), and the lack of true player enterprise in the sandbox give you no reason to want to progress in this game. Sure, you buy bigger ships and do bigger missions, but what then? Can I take political control of systems and build my own faction? No. Can I buy property and create a business empire and compete with other traders or corporations? No. All the player can really do is just fly missions and shoot stuff, and then get bigger ships to fly bigger missions and shoot bigger stuff.The developers are great, and really work hard (and continue to do so), and I really wish I could give this a positive review, but the fact of the matter is the game is just ""meh"" on most accounts. Without anything to really motivate me all I could do was let my mind drift to the impression that I was just in a giant empty MMO were I had to play by the AI factions' rules. But I saw no good reason for it to be that way with no player interaction of any sort.So I don't think its an entirely bad game, but as I have no desire to go play it anymore until there is something to motivate me to progress in the game, I don't feel I would be totally honest in recommending it.

The developers need to take a look at the great space flight sim games that game before (Wing Commander, Freespae 1&2 come to mind) as well as other recent games that got it right (Strike Suit Zero & Infinity) to get a clue as to how to set up a control scheme for space flight.  Turn with click and drag?  Pitching and Yawing with a keyboard instead of a control device?  Seriously?  The controls make this game unplayable - and no, things like Pitch and Yaw are not remappable to other devices.  "

The heavy weapons are redicoulusly, cause they sound ♥♥♥♥♥♥, look all the same and...just no. they are♥♥♥♥♥♥ The game it self became very boring after some hours, its just...the gameplay is always the same. story is just audio voice and is not really special. factionchoice.....which faction choice?  The fighing gameplay is also boring after a few minutes. its not complex enought. Map is 2d, all planets on the same high, and that grinding...yea thats the worst. the game sometimes feels like a mmorpg f2p. it takes a really loooooong time until you get a ship or such things. also there are only smal ships or they feel like small ships. weaponsounds are sometimes...just tooo oldsschool (lasersound of plasma canons) automatic fire is just...hell no. its like a retard sitting behind your turrets and thinks "" CHANGE TARGET AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE SO WE NEVER GET ENEMYS SHIELD DOWN""space looks nice, soundtrack si nice, artwork is nice, design is often nice (some ships look just...just bad)so all in all. the game brings up some nice ideas. speace feels very big map is also big and sometimes there is also smoething into the space but atmosphere in X3 for example was way better (spacestations(ONLY IN SPACE!), big and small ships, variation of all things...that was nice)			"

The mouse is sampled based on primary monitor (so moving this game onto second screen is a flat out no no), infact even trying to play windowed is flawed as if you have the game fit to screen + start menu then to select the bottom of the game's UI you have to move the mouse onto the start menu - click and you lose focus on the game.The gameplay is dull (okay it's a space sim but this doesn't come close to games like eve) customisation is petty, the minimum they could put in to claim the functionality is there, and the game is designed with the grind of an MMO. RPG aspects sounds cool, but after playing for 3 hours I was level 10 with one perk, and a whole lot of money not in my account to upgrade my ship passed one new gun.Frankly, if it were possible, I'd get the game refunded. NOT ready for release, NOT funtcional, NOT fun.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but I just can't.Let me start with some of the positives:- Great graphics- Ship models look cool- Ton of Factions- Free mode (option to just be a pilot and no story driven action)Cons:- Voice acting and character portriats are horrible. Like listening to a C grade movie actor and the pictures used to display pilots don't make any sense unless everyone is a retro cyber hippie or biker dude.- Horrible tutorial.. literally had no clue where the button was for help until I found it on accident.- Doesn't state why any of the factions like your or hate you. Do I just kill random people to make the enemy like me or what?- Trying to complete a side quest and ships with impossible to kill statues keeps showing up and killing me.. like a lot.. and even when I try to escape, they scramble my engines and kill me.- Stuck with a crappy ship for a long... long... time. Would have been cool to capture a ship a tad bit better than the one your piloting without having to pay Millions of dollars for a so so upgrade. But, the enemy ships that are better have a ton more troops than you do so troops are only usefull to make some quick cash for selling smaller ships.- Being a trader and selling high and buying low would be cool you could carry more than 40 items and the next upgrade that cost me a few million only had 30 slots.. so yea, being a trader would be a horrible way to make money.- Biggest complaint is when you target the enemy by clicking them, then you need to click them with the middle mouse button to pop up the action screen for things like grappling beam, boarding parties, target system or heavy weapon.. THEN the ship flies past you and your menu goes away since the menu is on the ship.. so I have to dog fight and swirl and slow down then speed up just to CLICK them again! Why not have a small display pop up on the side of the screen like EVE so I can base my menu skills off that than trying to follow the ship all over the place while trying to make a decision.Game has some good ideas, but to many cons that just make the game a burden rather than enjoyment. I will only play this game now to beat it just so I don't feel like I wasted my money for nothing.			"

												Been a fan of space game for a long time, can't say I'm impressed with SPG2...I'm sure I could have spend my money on better games.So far the game have been a big gigantic grind. It's too similar to most space sims with no real innovation.Oh well, back to waiting for Space Citizen.... "

												I am so disapointed in this game, despite having ""Very positive"" steam reviews and 8.1 on metacritic it is abysmal...The controls are awkward, the UI buggy, post processing forcibly disabled on launch? The mouse is sampled based on primary monitor (so moving this game onto second screen is a flat out no no), infact even trying to play windowed is flawed as if you have the game fit to screen + start menu then to select the bottom of the game's UI you have to move the mouse onto the start menu - click and you lose focus on the game.The gameplay is dull (okay it's a space sim but this doesn't come close to games like eve) customisation is petty, the minimum they could put in to claim the functionality is there, and the game is designed with the grind of an MMO. RPG aspects sounds cool, but after playing for 3 hours I was level 10 with one perk, and a whole lot of money not in my account to upgrade my ship passed one new gun.Frankly, if it were possible, I'd get the game refunded. NOT ready for release, NOT funtcional, NOT fun.			"

												Lacks polish.UI makes the user think. If the user isn't careful, he/shemay accidently waste credits, as default buy quantity is, for no real good reason, set higher than 1.User may 'magically' gain/lose credits from a transaction that doesn't seem like it should cost anything.That is to say, no cost is advertised in the UI. You find out after you click.In general, unintuitive and poorly designed UI. As is, would have been simpler to have two UI's: one for buying/selling,another for equipping/unequipping. For example, I have no idea what I currently have. Maybe there IS an inventory screen. Do I know about it after spending 3 hours playing? No, so even if there is, the game does not communicate this.All in all, a decent Freelancer like experience, but the UI needs to be redone to be more user friendly and dead simple. "

												Decent attempt to modernize the first game, unfortunately after short while with the game i can find nothing apart from the graphics that has notably improved. Many of the new changes seem to force the game to even more repetetive and constrained format when it comes to the character building and things you can actually do in the universe.Probably not a terrible pick if you liked the first game but all in all a huge disappointment to me personally.

												I would be more enthusiastic about this game if I could actually -read- it.At least for the 1024 x 768 and 1240x1024 resolutions, the text is blurry, blocky and headache inducing when you try to focus on reading it - this just seems to be an issue with 4x3 ratio monitors at those resolutions, but given that those resolutions are still very much in use, it is a problem that needs addressing before this game is playable for me.Space combat is okay, but anything involving text quickly becomes painful and frustrating.Maybe the Devs will patch these issues, but until they do, I cannot recommend it.

												its not what i expected. but thats not the reason for my ""NO"" the thing is, that the graphics arent really good(grapic is ok...but not good) and it still has hard performance problems and also a lot of crashes. tha game itself is not stabile. so sorry guys. even if we get a free dlc which is nice, the game makes no fun to play, if it has this performance problems. also a lot of canon shots dont really look good. but thats a matter of taste i think. whatever i dont really like it. so 32€ are way to much. even 20€. when it is under 15, you can think about it. from my position if i had the chance to decide again i would wait until its under 10€The weapons get very boring after a few while. The heavy weapons are redicoulusly, cause they sound ♥♥♥♥♥♥, look all the same and...just no. they are♥♥♥♥♥♥ The game it self became very boring after some hours, its just...the gameplay is always the same. story is just audio voice and is not really special. factionchoice.....which faction choice?  The fighing gameplay is also boring after a few minutes. its not complex enought. Map is 2d, all planets on the same high, and that grinding...yea thats the worst. the game sometimes feels like a mmorpg f2p. it takes a really loooooong time until you get a ship or such things. also there are only smal ships or they feel like small ships. weaponsounds are sometimes...just tooo oldsschool (lasersound of plasma canons) automatic fire is just...hell no. its like a retard sitting behind your turrets and thinks "" CHANGE TARGET AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE SO WE NEVER GET ENEMYS SHIELD DOWN""space looks nice, soundtrack si nice, artwork is nice, design is often nice (some ships look just...just bad)so all in all. the game brings up some nice ideas. speace feels very big map is also big and sometimes there is also smoething into the space but atmosphere in X3 for example was way better (spacestations(ONLY IN SPACE!), big and small ships, variation of all things...that was nice)			"

												trading boils down to ""buy green thing, dont buy red thing. sell green thing."" combat boils down to ""tell your ship to autofire and circle-strafe the enemy until they're dead."" your ship can go from full speed to dead stop instantly if you can scroll your mouse wheel fast enough. the universe feels small, it's too fast to get from one tile to the next. There's faction points, but only two factions.			"

												Lots of fun - until the first crash.  Crashes seem to happen about once an hour.  Sector switching gets laggier and laggier until at one point - it just dosn't.  Game freezes solid, and you have to bring up task manager to kill the process.  Appears to be a memory hole somewhere.Running a GTX970, i7, 8gb ram and Win 7 (64 bit).Checked the discussions for the group, others appear to be seeing the same error and as of right now there does not seem to be a fix.Pity - it's a lot of fun when it works, but it's just too frustrating to stick with. :(			"

												Do not buy this game if you want to use a joystick. The developers seem to have gone to the extreme to make this the most frustrating experience possible if you want to do so. I spent about an hour trying to find a good way to use one, but either mode you choose (you are offered the choice of using a joystick or mouse as a primary controller), you will be disappointed, as I was.

												Really wanted to like this game but it is very poorly designed. Mission levels not coordinated to your level but rather to some arbitrary zone level so a Level 1 mission in one zone is not the same as Level 1 in another. Game aide is beyond poor. Goes to window mode all the time. Spend 90% of your time flying between points. In my opinion better options in this space, try Rebel Galaxy. This may be deeper, but it is too boring for me personally.. Someone remake Privateer pls. And forget about Star Citizen, too damn ambitious. Props to the developer for responding, this is obviously based on my playstyle interests which may not align with yours.			"
