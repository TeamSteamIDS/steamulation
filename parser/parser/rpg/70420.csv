												This game was released in 2006 by EasyGameStation at the Comiket in Japan. The same group that made Recettear An Item Shop's Tale. It was translated and brought to Steam by Carpe Fulgur in 2011.In this game you play a little anime girl with her fairy sidekick sister. You adventure through dungeons, defeating enemies with sword and magic attacks. Of course this reminds you of Zelda and it plays a bit like one. It focuses much more on combat though, akin to a Ys-type of game. The game features a blend of 2D sprites in a 3D world, which works surprisingly well. I had some issues with aiming in the beginning, but that worked itself out after a while.The magic system is the central part of the gameplay. You use different colored gems to cast fire, water, wind and earth spells. These gems are used in the order you pick them up from the ground, but when you hold the cast button longer you use up to three gems at once. This way various different colored gems can be combined and produce different spells. This make for quite the deep system and keeps the combat interesting. ♥♥♥♥ earth though. Those gems are worthless.There are no levels, so you only improve through your items. This makes the game faster and removes the grind you have in typical JRPGs. Upon death a Game Over screen pops up, but you just respawn at the town, which makes dying forgiving. That is needed though, because you will die a lot.I actually had a lot of fun with the story, especially the characters. I don't know if it is thanks to the translation or source, but there are some really funny lines in there. I recommend this game, if you like some oldschool dungeoning.			"

												I kill monsters by throwing my older fairy cursed sister attached to my fishing pole using her as bait 10/10 would abuse my sister again.I've been playing it, the controls could be a lot better but it fortunately has a gamepad config and I think it's great so far! Characters are really enjoyable and cute, the gameplay is challenging, story is entertaining. Honestly I'm a big dope for cute things and rpg games, it reminds me of the orcarina of time but with 2d characters in a 3d environment. I hope I helped! DANK I have to say, I've been playing this and I keep coming back for more. A review below me says ""it's aged a little"" so what? Does that mean story and gameplay isnt fun anymore? Seriously I grow to love the characters, gameplay, and story more and more every min. I dub this an instant classic for me. The developers other games are also very fun and enjoyable as well. Please support this game. Like i said, the only flaw is the controls, but really get a gamepad its well worth it for other games as well. It's like what, 10 bucks out your pocket for something useful for many other games, don't over look this incredibly fun and enjoyable game, it is well worth 10 dollars.My control scheme is (xbox controller) a to jump, right trigger to attack, x to target, left trigger for magic and of course the joysticks are camera and movement. DOUBLE DDANKI got up to the final boss, I'm not sure what the producers were thinking... Seems I have to 'level' a bunch to beat it from what other people are saying, but I have a lot of hours down... Hmm.. I strike this as a problem since the only way to really level your character would be to buy things and hp, I believe there should have been a few different ways to upgrade the hitpoints. Getting money is a little slow also so eh, unless there is another way that I'm not seeing, but oh well I play my way. TRIPLE DDDANk cuz yeUpdate - my friend has 49 hours on the game and hasn't beaten it			"

												Reminds me a one of the Japanese action RPG from PS1. We don't see this often enough, and that's a shame.Now, indeed this game is bit hard to control if you are not use to it, but you can map it from game folder. Go to local game folder, open Steam\Steamapps\common\Chantelise and you can configure the control from there.I used this mapping- ←→↑↓for movement, A for attack, S for Jump, D for dash, F for lock-on, left Shift and space for camera angle. Trust me, this works like charm. Now on to the game. I loved it. I beat it, and I still play it from time to time. Stroyline isn't much deep and straight forward, but it's charming and easy to play. English translation is bit cheesy though- I played it on Japanese because... I am. It's almost like a mixture of Xenogears, Mario, and Zelda. Fun beat'em up, less puzzle. Only downside that I can think about is that the dungeon is very simple and only one-way direction. All you have to do is to defeat all enemies and unlock the gate, rinse and repeat. The boss battle is more fun. You have to figureout the pattern of the movement, and find the weakpoint. This part tends to be more like Zelda. You will also unlock few more things, like having magic on your sword. Charge attack will release the magic with several different ability, and I thought that was fun.Anyway, I would recommend this game, especially if you like doujin games. You won't be dissappointed.

												Chantelise is an overlooked game by EasyGameStation. It was released in Japan 2006 and was localized in 2011, with the more popular game, Recettear: An Item shop Tale, by the translation company, Crape Fulgur. In a nutshell: the game is an action RPG with some magic thrown into the mix. There are times where the game can be a little unforgiving. Stay calm, reflect on what happened, and try again.Controls: Simple. Attack, jump, dash(Attack + jump), lock-on, and magic. The longer you hold down the back button, the more gems you use. Everything is explained in the tutorial. I recommend using a controller. If you don't have one, don't worry, the game has full kayboard controls. Though you might have a slightly harder time getting use to the controls. The config allows you to map your own buttons. If you really want to, you can play with a steering wheel.Plot: It's a witch hunt. Everything is explained in the introduction.Review: It's a cute anime RPG with an enjoyable story. The artwork throughout the game is wonderful. If you've played Recettear, you'll recognise quite a number of textured used. The game may be a bit difficult to get the hang of. You've got a small health bar and the enemies hit hard. For some, the 2D sprites in a 3D environment may seem confusing to judge hitboxes. You'll spend quite some time getting use to the controls and enemy movements. The magic system works in reverse order; the last gem picked up will be the first gem consumed. Play around with magic; different magic combinations have varying  results. The first gem above Chante is the main gem, and the gems around Elise feet are the support gems. It's confusing at first.Treasure can be sold to purchase health boosts and equipment. However the prices double every purchase, directing players to get better at the game or farm for a ridiculously long time in order to farm enough pix(money) to afford the next item.As the story unfolds, you'll have access to more magic and equipment slots. You'll also encounter tougher enemies that have more health and hit harder. Learning to avoid damage early will help along your adventure. Every boss has a unique feel to them. Well... unless you count mutual hatred. When the game gets tough, and you feel like an area is far too difficult to handle currently, take a breather, and take it slow. Going in wth a clear mind helps with observing your opponents movements. There is one hidden treasure in each room / area of the dungeon. Something to reward explorers. Lets wrap this up: The game is challenging and you need to get good. If you're someone who gets easily frustrated at failure then this game may not be for you. Tips:   Save often.  Time Attack DOES NOT progress the stroy. It is a good way to practice. Observe your opponents. Avoiding damage is a good thing. Learn from your mistakes, and gear up accordingly.  Use magic to help clear areas or deal with tough enemies. Super Armour reduces damage and prevents damage knockback. Hidden Treasure may help along your travels. Try asking the monk in town.Try not to spoil the game by looking at a guide unless you really get stuck.As for why I have an absurdly high playtime on record: I have my reasons.			"

Quick SummaryLess forgiving than Dark Souls.Ten times more fun than Dark Souls.Purchase Verdict: YesPoints of Interest-Some people have complained about the difficult camera controls: I originally had an issue with this, but after rebinding the camera controls from A+S to A+D, I had no problems.-The game has a great story line (I'm currently on the final bosses.), beautiful art, and an amazing sound track-This game can be extremely hard, and it takes a lot of strategizing and understanding how each spell and equipment works. However, once you make progress, it is extremely satisfactory and rewarding.			"

												It's charming and I genuinely want to like this game, but it would be a great understatement to say that there are ""a few camera angle issues"".In fact, the camera angle issues provide a quite insightful perspective about how bad something has to be in order to make a game unplayable. It teaches you your limits of tolerance for certain flaws (e.g. bad graphics, questionable textures, odd monsters you may have seen recycled from/also featuring in Recettear) and scales these grievances nicely from 0 to Chantelise Camera Angles.It's the kind of game you install, play with the determined mindset that you *will* like it, find you simply can't after an hour, then uninstall. Save yourself the pain. Don't buy this game.			"

												Really fun game. I was recently gifted this and Recettear, and when I'm done crying because I never get further than the third week in Recettear I come play this. Similar art styles, similar fun.That and I pretend I'm an adventurer working for Recette.Give the demo a go, it's not for everyone, but being my first games of this type I would be lying to say I haven't had a lot of fun.

												Ok - first of all, I don't know WHAT Steam is smoking because I've put at least 80 hours into this game, I swear.  I played the hell out of it for like three weeks straight and then gave up on it cold turkey.  Then, I attempted to play it again and it's like Steam reset my hours.  Anyway, I finally beat Chantelise, so I can write my review for it.I'm going to cut through most of the rhetoric ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that I post in my other reviews and come out and drop any pretense of trying to contain myself:This ♥♥♥♥ is hard.  It's like, Dark Souls hard.  It's like the cartoony anime version of a sick hell.  To put it in perspective, when I reviewed Fortune Summoners, there were times where I wanted to throw my controller across the room because it was hard, and Chantelise makes that game look like Hello Kitty Island Adventures. The game starts off easy enough:  You control Elise, flowing through fields, dodging, slicing up slimes, collecting money.  Easy and fun.  Then you go to your first dungeon.  Not too bad, not too bad.  Then you go to the next room, and you die.  Then you try again, and die, and again, and die, and die, and die and die.  THEN, you finally get through the first dungeon and you're like ""Well that must not be too bad...""And then you die again and again until death becomes a hilarious release.  I found myself intentionally dying on PURPOSE sometimes because I just knew, ""Whelp, I don't have enough health to beat the next room, might as well die and start over.""  Yeah, it's that bad.In fact, there are no words that I can properly use to explain the difficulty of the final boss.  I remember spending about 5+ hours with the cat statue grinding so much money to buy as many of those stupid vitamin waters just to boost my HP by a fraction, just to make that fight easier and it STILL sucked beyond all comprehension...which thus lead me to ultimately put the game down and walk away from it for nearly a year.So, I went back and tried again - what the hell was I thinking?  I mean seriously?  Oh well, time to fire up the 1980's grind sound track and get to work.  About 100,000 PIX and several 'treasure hunting adventures' I was finally ready to beat the game.  Too bad the boss didn't agree.  I did it, but man..It'll give me nightmares.  You get the idea.That being said, I do want to caution anyone thinking of purchasing Chantelise, *especially* if you've already played Recettear:This is a *very* recycled game..  The enemies, some of the graphics, the sounds, it's the same as Recettear.  Actually, it seems like they probably made this game first, so Recettear is the one recycling, but that game is more fun and more successful, so I am going to try and think the other direction (even though I know it's probably incorrect).At the end of the day, if you like a challenge (no really, I mean A CHALLENGE) and you see Chantelise on sale, it's a pretty fun and interesting 3D action oriented JRPG.  Voices and art are cute.  Bring a stress ball though, you'll need it.			"

												Fun little hack 'n slash.  Lots of people call it an RPG, but that's simply because it's Japanese. It's a hack and slash through and through.  Maybe not worth the $10 price tag, but worth a playthrough if you can get the Fulgar collection on sale.+ Very challenging.  I'd like to say it's 70% good design, and 30% poor design.  The good design stems from the different ways you have to approach different enemies and how to handle them when they're attacking from all around.+ Graphics are charming, although lackluster.  It's a 3D game with 3D bosses and 2D items, characters, and enemies that always face the screen.  Graphics are reminiscent of Doom's 2.5D rendering, if that makes more sense.  The pixel art is nice, character illustrations are generic anime caricatures which don't insult the eye too much.+ A fishing minigame exists for those of you who want a Japanese game with lots of grind.  I never bothered with it.+ Lots of secrets in each level.- Maybe too challenging, and not in a good way.  As I said before, the challenge is 30% poor design; that stems from ♥♥♥♥♥♥ magic stone mechanics, poor hitboxes that stem from having 2D sprites represent 3D characters, and no immunity after getting stunned, meaning a boss can basically one-hit you if you get hit by some unavoidable attacks.- The magic stones aren't implemented very well.  It works like this:  There are 4 kinds of stones and 6 slots.  You can use one stone, two stones, three stones, or four stones at a time for obviously more powerful attacks if you use more stones.  However, you're locked out of the higher-tier powerups if you pick up a random permutation of stones - you can't use two blue stones and one green stone to heal, for example, you'll just end up firing the two-blue-stone attack while wasting a green stone.  This can be frustrating when battling an enemy since the button to pick up stones happens to be the same one you use to attack, meaning you can ♥♥♥♥ yourself over with stones when you need to heal.If you want to drop stones, you hold the cast magic button for five seconds.  It's a pain in the ♥♥♥ and not viable when you're in a tight spot.Also, stone drops are random every time you hit an enemy.  This means that you have to rely on the RNG to give you a good set of stones, especially when you're fighting a boss and you desperately need blue stones to heal.- The music is so ♥♥♥♥ing horrendous.  I played the kazoo version of Armstrong's boss theme from the MGR soundtrack during the final boss's final form and it was actually better than the in-game music.- The story sucks and the final boss is anticlimatic.  For ♥♥♥♥'s sake, you don't even SEE the witch, let alone fight her.Despite its flaws, it's a fun game if you're man enough to be the little girl.			"

												If you wanted Recettear, you would just play Recettear.This game seems to be a prototype for Recettear in a lot of ways. For instance, while the game utilizes a 3d perspective, it all feels very clunky and disorienting when the charcter model is 2d and moves in a 2d way. It has that sort of early PS1 feel to it which puts me off. Carpe Fulgur seemed to grasp that this would work better in a 2d top-down perspective like in Recettear and bam, they made a superior game.The combat is not as varied as in Recettear either. You control the same person throughout the story attacking with the same three-hit melee combo. There also is a magic function which depends on the crystal pickups you got from enemies, but it all feels very stiff since you have to cast it in the exact order you pick up, giving you little choice between what spells you would use.I wish I liked this game. I wish I did, but it has too many shortcomings in the combat system and tries to combat it with a 3d perspective that feels lacking in comparison to today's visuals.			"

												Chantelise is a very simplistic action-RPG with PS1-era graphics and bare-bones gameplay. So why am I recommending it?Well, beyond the charming art style for the characters and the low price of the game, there's something endearing to me about a game that knows its limitations and doesn't try to overstep them. Unfold an engrossing story across many chapters that is cute, amusing, and at times even upsetting. There are lots of thematic similarities to Recettear, and fans of that game will find a lot to enjoy here.The English localization by Carpe Fulgur is very well done and translates the original Japanese game faithfully and naturally, and the game runs fine even on the most pathetic hardware available today. Gamepad and mouse/keyboard are both acceptable, although I'd actually recommend skipping the gamepad for this game as it makes no use of analog input (it plays great on an SNES pad, for example.)The only warnings I'd give about this game are the grueling difficulty at first (don't give up!), the somewhat grindy nature of the progression, and the relatively short length. It's a good bit of fun for the duration, though, and makes a nice ""I don't feel like playing anything else right now"" game. Has a good bit of replay value too!			"

												Chantelise succeeds in telling a story in a way that you always want to see what happens next. So you end up playing ""just one more"" level. And to me, that is a sign of a good game. The story is catchy - and setting and characters aren't bad either. Art style is pretty. The music fits the game nicely, though otherwise the sounds are not that spectacular.In my opinion, the difficulty level was ok. It starts rather easy and keeps getting harder as you progress. As you advance further in the story you must adapt to different situations. Another thing I liked about this game is that there are different ways to ""build"" your character, using different equipment and skills in different levels.Only thing that really bugged me was the camera. Maybe I just didn't know how to control it properly, but the camera controls were awkward at times.The translation from Japanese to English seems pretty good. At least I didn't spot any situations where dialogues would have been weird or illogical. Although there is very little voice acting, those have been kept in Japanese, which is a good thing in my opinion.All in all, ""Chantelise - A Tale of Two Sisters"" is a fun game. Even after you finish the game there is still more stuff to do! Also, if you have played ""Recettear - An Item Shop's Tale"", there is a lot familiar stuff for you to encounter, although the game itself is quite different.			"

												Wonderful game that includes dungeon crawling, hack and slash, and interesting story line. The graphics are nice and use both 2d sprites and 3d models. If you've played Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale you will see some familiar items(under different names). I had no problem with the controls, although navigating the gap jumps in later levels took some time with a keyboard. To progress through the level stages you must defeat every monster in the area to unlock the exit. If you have beaten the stage and die it will still be unlocked up to that point you died when you rush back through a level. As for the plot- it was interesting and kept me playing when the grinding for gold got old. Did I mention you have to grind? A lot? When you kill enemies the power in their blood can crystalize from your sisters' fairy dust, dropping a gem you can use as a magic attack ( the amount you can combine increases with game progression to a total of 4). You can combine the effects of gems to deal massive damage to enemies with that inherent weakness (though doesn't really apply to anything but large creatures and bosses). Other things that can drop are your standard metal currencies (ranging from copper to gold) or an item of no use, but value for resale at a shop. There are, however, few shops in the game, but you are highly dependent on them if you would like to progress easily and faster. When you buy something from a shop the purchace price of that item goes up and stays that way regardless if you resell. Your character has item slots where you can equip specific items of various worth. If you want to do more magic damage with literally no defense no one is stopping you.. except the limited item slots. There are 4 item slots in total and the only way to unlock them is to progress through the story. As I said before you can equip anything equipable item you like in these or none at all, but there is a catch. If you go full magical power with no defense and decide ""Why spend all that money on health upgrades?"" you had better be a good dodger, because there is one thing in this game that is too horriffying to deal with... When you get somewhere below 50% health you'll start to hear a high pitch incessant beeping to indicate that you are in fact dying. It does not stop until you get above that 1% difference of dying and not dying. You will innevitably die though and may have to run through a level a couple times to figure what you're dealing with boss wise. That noise will become the reason you do not want to lose health and the motivation to strive to complete the level. If you like the mystical soundtrack you might be encouraged to keep the game unmuted and hope, to whatever the hell you may pray to, you don't get below that threshold.If you do get below you cannot easly heal yourself by the process of attacking things alone. You can gain health from food items randomly dropped by monsters and found in crates/barrels or through a specific gem combination that I won't mention(cruel right?). I have to say though I didn't figure out I could heal with a gem combination(though you cannot use the combination till later in the game hint hint) untill the last level and the face palms were plenty that day. All in all an interesting game and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys grinding with plot on the side. It feels amazing to plan things out and rush through the levels- dodging monsters that dot the map, and finally reach that boss room you've been trying to clear for the last half hour. Side strafe, and take down all that appose you.			"

												Alright I suppose I should give this game a review. First off: I loved it. Great game from beginning to end.Music: Great soundtrack. The opening theme and the credits music were probaly my favorites.Gameplay: The gameplay (in terms of combat) consists of three important parts: melee attacks, dodging, and the magic system. The melee attacks have one button with varying damage and the occasional critical hit. Dodging is done by pressing the jump button and attack button at the same time. It is crucial that you git good at this. And the magic is definitely where it shines. The magic works by collecting gems dropped by enemies and combining them to activate spells. The obvious spells the game tells you about all include using a certain amount of the same gem, but I found a few other combinations one if which was a lasting poison effect. I of course forgot how to do this really fast.Controls: The game begs to be played with a gamepad. Use one, or else. I didn't even touch the keyboard controls.Story/characters: A big part of why I loved the game. I enjoyed it throughly and loved the characters. It is well written and has some serious moments mixed in with a good sense of humor. The story is shared in the visual novel style with sections of dialougue and Japanese voice acting accompanied by character portraits and the occasional cut scene as well image. If you don't like reading then learn Japanese. Or just don't play it. I wouldn't suggest that though.Flaws: It suffers from the same issue that all RPGs do: The Grind. You WILL need to grind. Of course this is expected when it comes to RPGs, but a heads up those of you who can't stand it. Also you may lose the will to continue. This game has been compared to Dark Souls in terms of difficulty. In fact some say it's harder. I have never played Dark Souls, but I can tell you that if I didn't love the game so much I would have given up. There were many points when I just hit a wall, but my drive to win, win, WIN kept me grinding and improving. There is a luck component though because gem drops are completely random and you can't use the ones you pick in any order you want either. You have to use them in the order you picked them up.So all in all, if you love RPGs and have a playlist of motivational Shia Labeouf videos you'll find this game Gr8 m8 8/8.			"

												By far, the best part of this game is the story. This game has very endearing and hilarious characters,  and extremely well written dialogue. Most modern games with their GPU melting graphics and 9 figure budget are incapable of the basic entertaining story of Chantelise.  The game opens by explaining that Chante has been turned into a fairy against her will, and she needs her sister Elise to help find a way to remove the curse. You're always looking out for the next time the game will allow you to read the next few lines of dialogue.The problem here is that this is a video game, meaning you actually have to PLAY it. Ugh.Don't get me wrong - I'm the kind of person who expects an epic story in every game I play. I'm the one in a million who actually ENJOYS cut-scenes. For me, gameplay always takes a backseat to story and characters.But the gameplay in this title is sickeningly loathsome. It feels like an alpha version of Ocarina of time. It's meant to be an action game, but the controls feel so stiff, and it is very easy to get attacked by an enemy or fall off a ledge because you couldn't see it. Generation 5 camera at its finest. Going through dungeons is a chore - and there are no puzzles, mini-games, or anything else to break the monotony.  To progress to the next room in a dungeon, you must kill ALL the monsters. Miss one? Wander around the over-sized rooms looking for it, only to finally kill it so you can enter the next room AND DO THE SAME THING OVER AGAIN.As for actually fighting these monsters, you can walk up to them and whack them with your sword. When they die, they often drop money (which can be used in town to buy items) or gems. These gems are used for spells - ex: red for fire. But you'd think you could save up gems and plan to use the right spells on the right monsters. Nope, you cast spells based on which gem you picked up last.  The game is set up in such a way that some spells are VERY useful or useless against the right or wrong monster, but you have no way of saving a spell for the right monster. Many other reviewers seem to believe this game is hard. No, this game is easy if you pay attention. The problem is the combat is so freaking BORING that there is no way you CAN pay attention. I have played many games where the story is the main draw, and the gameplay is there only to serve as a medium for the plot and characters. But Chantelise is below even that - the battle system is an OBSTACLE, actively preventing you from getting to the next part of the plot (with yet another room filled with generic monsters).The awful gameplay of this title 'bottlenecks' the fantastic story.

												A short and difficult dungeon romper, with no inbuilt character progression. Rather, all character progression comes from finding and buying equipment in the world. This means if you're having trouble, you're grinding money instead of experience. I didn't have to grind much except at the beginning, before I got better at reading the bosses and their patterns. Once I got the game's skillset down, I had to grind very very little, and was beating the game simply with the things I found, while using the money I collected to buy HP boosts. Protip: Only buy HP boosts, that's the only thing you need to buy.The story is cute and whimsical, and actually pretty interesting. The gameplay is simplistic, and I would compare it to a very simple Legend of Zelda. A single attack combo, and various combos of magic spells that can be cast based on magic stones you pick up. While you can't choose the order in which you use stones directly, there's so many stones around that it's very easy to simply collect stones in the order of the spell you want to cast.The game is long enough to hold your interest and short enough to not wear out its welcome. The music is passable, the characters are expressive in txt and voice, and the overall presentation of the game is decent enough. Reccetear is better,  but Chantelise manages to hold its own.A soft recommendation for people who enjoy the art style and can handle a somewhat difficult (until you learn the controls and spell combos) game.

												I will start off with the cliche review of this game: this game is like dark souls with lolisYou will die in this game. A lot.The game is structured into different dungeons that must be completed to move on. Each dungeon has 4 or 5 different 'rooms' that must be completed in order. If you die in any of the rooms, including the boss room, you must start the dungeon over again. To complete a room, you must first defeat all the enemies, pretty simple eh? But then they pack up on you and itsnot so simple anymore. There is a mode that lets you play through rooms that you have found already, but it will not progress the story. To say the least, each dungeon will take you multiple tries to complete.Each room in the dungeon have secret items as well. This is an actual requirement actually: look online for a guide to get you all the secret items. If you miss even one, then you cant get the super secret item in the hidden level of each dungeon, which is vital to get your stats high enough to not get slaughtered in the next dungeon.Other than the level layout, there are certain mechanics present such as running (yes, you can run), jumping (as in a kangaroo), sprinting (similar to running, but faster and usually away from the enemy), and, oh yes, there is magic. You have six slots for gems that you pick up from defeated enemies. There are different coloured gems for different types of magic. Matching the same type in the order of pickup will allow you to use multiple at once and cast more powerful spells. Casting magic is one of the backbones of this game and you had better get good at it early on or the later levels will get extremely difficult.And here comes the part about the controls, I don't think I've talked about the controls yet. This is by far the aspect people struggle with the most. It's true that the controls are not at all standard in the West and initially seem very weird and frusturating. This is easily overcome with the use of a controller, but with myself as proof, this control system actually does work well. Fair warning though, it took me about an hour of randomly walking in circles to get to the mastery that I now posses. But now people see my mad skillz and look in awe as my fingers mash the keys in random order trying to kill a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bat.Overall, I really liked the game. I thought it had a nice story, it was challenging, and ultimately, it was fun to play. I always recomend this game to my friends (to their dismay once they look at the graphics), but they also seem to enjoy it as well.  I also recommend looking into Carpe Fulgar, the localisers of this game, their history is quite interesting. If you are still unsure about the game, try the demo and see if you like it or not, its free.			"

												Let me start off by saying if you DO NOT have a controller then I cannot recommend attempting to play this :P . It's a pretty fun game though with smooth combat and a very interest plot which is alot deeper than first glances may have you believe. One thing I really like about it is that each level has a secret chest and a time trial in each of them to give you more stuff! I love me some unlocks! It's not quite as adorable as Reccetear but then again not many games are :P			"

												The game had alright gameplay. The story was not bad. The only real struggle was getting all the hidden items from each map without using a guide. Either you cut your HP or you searched online. Besides that, the game itself was alright. It was worth the price during the sale. Not so sure about buying this full price.			"

												I could write a book about all the poor design choices in Chantelise.In short, the game is tedious and clunky with a reward in the form of an extremely rushed, though somewhat interesting, storyline.Combat operates in 3D with mostly 2D sprite enemies (bosses are the exception as they are 3D models).  This perspective the game has makes it extremely hard to determine distance and you do not want to get hit in Chantelise anymore than you have to since your health and resources to refill said health are pretty low.Progression is purely item based so no leveling here, but enjoy manually walking over those coins for the first half of the game or so until you unlock the item equip that makes money auto-pickup (but also weakens your character by way of sac'ing stats from other possible equips so you don't really want this equipped since the game is hard).  And since you need to be buying stuff to make your character stronger, money is essentially exp and therefore you can't skip out on it.Speaking of skipping out on things, Chantelise forces you to fight and kill every enemy in an area before moving on.  This means if you're at the top level of an area and the monster walks off the ledge stupidly you now have to jump down after it to kill it and then WALK ALL THE WAY BACK UP TO WHERE YOU WERE.  And enjoy the flying enemies and the ones that go invulnerable most of the time they fight you.I mentioned before that the game is hard.  Removing the terrible camera perspective, your combat options are just so limited and weak.  Your attack can get a charged version if you equip an item for it (sac'ing stats in the process of course) but otherwise you just have your 1-2-3 and jump attack.  Otherwise you'll be using magic and dodging.  The magic in this game is actually solid.  I like it.  But what ends up happening is since your dodge is complete ♥♥♥♥ and has no invicibility to make up for its ♥♥♥♥♥♥ distance, boss fights end up being you farming adds for gems, maintaining distance, and pelting the boss with magic.  Super tedious.tl;dr  If you like simple anime storylines just YT this game or find a way to cheat because this game is a waste of your time to actually play.  And the story's like 20 minutes long anyway.			"

												So a lot of people are saying this is Dark Souls: Waifu edition, I'm here to say, IT IS! Dodging is essential in some parts and the game is kind of difficult (don't let the first boss discourage you). Magic is also necessary for the game so you have to learn to not just depend on brute strength. you have to save tons of money to get new items and one wrong move can end it so fast. If I can be honest, don't buy the game full price, I don't think it's worth that price, and it does go on sale from time to time so just keep an eye out.I'm just waiting to meet the little girl from Recettear and just lose my sh!t like I did in Recettear (which I also HIGHLY recommend).BTW can someone tell me if Recettear came before or after this game...I'm just not sure.

												While rather charming, it's immense lack of any sort of depth or actually good controls makes this forgettable.I'd love if the dodge button could be mapped on a different key, its use is extremely unintuitive and clunky.Magic would've been a lot better if it wasn't completely random and you had no way of planning what you'll use since it always depends on enemy drops (which could've been stored somehow, for a better system)Camera is absurdly bad, locking on gives headaches and often you can't see flying enemies due to weird angles.Bees are far too annoying for their own good.There's a huge lack of sense of progress: you can equip some items to boost stats and that's it.

												I wanted to like this game so much because of it's fun style, cute characters, and classic JRPG feel, but the cons of the actual gameplay outweigh everything that's good about it. The camera is terrible, the controls are practically garbage, the character progerssion is basically non-existent, and the magic system is an RNG fest.There's also no healing until, supposedly, much later. So if you screwed up and got hit a few times getting to the boss and are at half health, good luck. Healing items might drop, but that's RNG. Even Monster Hunter lets you have healing potions because mistakes happen. There's always the ""git gud"" option, but with the camera, controls, and regular old RNG in your way it's really hard to not ragequit before that happens.Camera:It kind of wants to be Zelda: Ocarina of Time with a similar Z-Targeting system, but is terrible copy of that. The camera swing is too slow and cumbersome when you try to focus it behind you that it just feels clunky. If you've ever played WoW, it's basically turning your camera with your keyboard instead of the mouse. There are separate buttons to shift it left or right, but it's just as bad.Controls:Clearly meant to be played on a controller with some kind of joystick. Even after remapping the controls to something more comfortable it was a terrible experience. ""Takes some getting used to"" is an extreme understatement. It would've been a hundred times better if you were able to use the mouse, but you can't. Keyboard only. I suppose my review of this game would be wildly different if I could experience it with a controller, but as it stands, the keyboard alone doesn't cut it.Character Progression:There is none. There is no levelling whatsoever. There are ""tiers"" of gear you can grind money for and then purchase, but you can only unlock the next tier by progressing the story, so it's all gear dependant. If you like, you can grind to purchase HP upgrades, but that's about it.Magic:Completely RNG. I suppose you can consciously stack for the spells you want, but then you're at the mercy of RNG even more, if the charge type you want doesn't drop. And then some of the spells you have to properly aim, which isn't such a big deal, but can be easy to forget since some of them have a homing mechanism while others simply shoot in front of your face. In time you could probably memorize the different combos to be efficient at it, but it's a steep curve to get there.Overall, I really wanted to like this game in its entirety because the story is sweet and quirky, and something I could tolly get into—and got into. And I even gave the camera/controls second, third, fourth, eighth, twentieth chances because I wanted to advace the story. I typically adapt to controls after an hour or two, but at the end of the day I had enough with it and couldn't stand it anymore.			"

												Chantelise is an adventure game that starrs two sisters name Elise and Chante which how the game got its title by combining both names. Apparently the self proclaim sexiest woman in the universe, Chante was turned into a fairy and her sister, Elise whom you'll be playing as must find the witch that did this and make her reverse the curse.Gameplay wise, Chantelise is an RPG 3D scrolling type of game. However, there's no exp system. The only way to ""level up"" is buying and searching for items. I think the fun factor about this game is to look for the secret treasures. Not only they're fun to obtain, but they could increase your attribute and make the game eaiser.			"

												Cute style, and I want to like it, but I'm not here for style, I'm here for a game. The magic system is ... not good, but the camera dials it all the way up to unplayable.Maybe this is more familiar to console gamers, but as a PC gamer who rarely uses his gamepad holy oh my god, this camera is horrifically horribly terribly uselessly awful. When combined with the very short draw distance (enemies fade into sight when you're almost on top of them) it's rather obvious why they gave Recettear a fixed camera.Recettear can be difficult, and is very grindey and samey. But at least the camera isn't its worst enemy.For anyone who's unclear - all text in the game is in English, the spoken dialog is the original Japanese audio, with subtitles. I haven't played much of it, but I haven't hit any spots where any spoken dialog is not subtitled, as can often be seen in such games. Even the little bits of flavor speech (like Chante announcing the spell she's casting) have little subtitle bubbles for them.			"

												Good game, but the controls are a bit messed up.Examples: If you're using gamepad, then holding the ""confirm"" button will swipe through many of the conversations, which are gems and not meant to be skipped. Shoulder buttons are somehow allowed to be mapped to other functions (like attack, jump etc)- mapping a shoulder to one of these will break the in-game camera rotation.Otherwise, pretty good, but I feel like they could've spent a bit more time on preparing this for steam. Last time I played this was using keyboard and the non-steam version. I do remember the game having these same problems back then and I had hoped they would've been addressed in one way or another.If you can work past these problems, its a good game and reminiscent of Recettear (which was also translated by the same company who translated this game: Carpe Fulgur).

The lock-on system is infuriating, and works by line-of-sight rather than proximity.

												It was ok.The camera constantly fights against you for the first hour. It never gets better, but you adjust to the suck and don't notice it much after this. It's mostly caused by how difficult it usually is for developers to have 2D sprites move fluidly through a 3D environment. It is a very notable flaw though.The combat system is a bit limited, and most of it's depth is hidden behind mechanics the game never explains: such as equipping the special crystal items to change how your weapon interacts with the world, and the elemental affinity of enemies, which is sometimes difficult to discern at a glance. Enemy variety isn't the best, with there being perhaps 9 different enemies for the entire game, but you get just enough variety that it takes a bit to get bored. The lack of depth to combat makes the tedium of how quickly you die more of a cause for frustration than it otherwise would be.You will need to use a guide, as the Secret treasures of each level can be difficult to locate due to requiring very specific things, like trying to fish during a bossfight, or killing a very specific enemy before you kill anything else. These treasures are gamechanging: in one case giving you access to lifesteal, which is crucial for surviving the final boss without too much tedium.The magic system is very entertaining, but the inability to select which order you use your spells in ultimately reflects poorly on it in the end. I don't recommend purchasing this game unless it is bundled with Recettear, or on a very steep sale price.			"

												Definitely a sideways-thumb review.  Can't give it a full endorsement since it's rather poor in spots, but at the same time I liked it enough to finish and do some extra stuff in it.  Honestly, most of your enjoyment in this game will come down to how you like Carpe Fulgar's adaptation.  If you liked how Recettear and Fortune Summoners read, you're in for more of the same and will have more fun with Chantelise.The gameplay on the other hand is not so hot.  Chantelise is a 3D dungeon-diving game with bland graphics, repetitive enemies, and some truly annoying audio (ugh, that low health indicator).  As the game progresses, you can mix and match pick-ups for more diverse spells, but they're just kind of blah on the whole, both idea-wise and visually.  Melee is also just kind of there and is incredibly simplistic.One cool feature about the set-up of the game (go to dungeon, run through some floors and then fight boss) is that each floor has a hidden item that you can grab by completing some type of unique goal.  I'd suggest just looking up the in-game hint in a guide and then figuring it out yourself rather than deal with how the game gives out clues, as you lose some of your max hp to acquire them.  Some of the stuff you have to do to get the hidden treasure is pretty cool and shows a development team that cared about trying to make their game fun but just weren't up to snuff to do so.The dungeons themselves aren't anything special, either design or art-wise.  You do have to run a dungeon all the way from floor 1 to the boss floor to beat it, though after reaching a floor, you can choose to practice on it from the map, which is useful for getting ready for boss fights.Technically, far from a great game, or even a a particularly good one for that matter, but the adaptation and looking for some of the hidden treasures did enough for me to enjoy my time with this game.  I'd only fully recommend it to people that enjoyed the other adaptations Carpe Fulgur did or big-time fans of dungeon-running games.			"

												Chantelise is a 3D hack and slash that fails to deliver on all fronts of the JRPG genre. I’m putting this in the nicest way possible, the controls are full on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I have never played a game where I rage quit not from the difficulty, but from the super unwieldy camera controls. One moment I am locking on an enemy, the next thing I know I am spinning in circles. For a short game, I was expecting a short and sweet tale. Instead I was fed with so many side story that I completely lost track of what the main story was about. The magic system, while fascinating, is quite obviously a mediocre version of Magicka’s fantastic spell combos. This game may be from the creator of Recettear but it completely lacks the charm and addictiveness that made Recettear immensely fun. I only recommend this game to the most hardcore of JRPG fanatics. Everyone else, just go play YS or Recettear.			"

												**TL;DR below**Chantelise is an action adventure RPG that can be categorized with games such as Dark Souls and Bloodborne. I will start with what the game has to offer along with what I liked about it before I get to the issues of this game.Story:The game takes place around a tale of a witch who curses anyone that is outside on a night with the red moon. Shortly after you hear 2 sisters going outside on such a night, they then pass out only to find out that the older sister has become a fairy when they awaken. Thus they set out on a journey to find out if there is a way to reverse the curse. It’s a simple yet engaging story with a nice little twist later on that escalates their situation and that there was a reason behind the sisters getting cursed.Gameplay:As mentioned earlier this game feels very like the Dark Souls series, this means that each stage is going to be rather difficult and very unforgiving. Each stage has you exploring a certain dungeon that is split into serval different areas to make navigation easier. When you first enter an area you must defeat all enemies in there before you can proceed, enemies will drop magic gems that you can pick up and use to cast various spells as well as gold that is used to buy equipment. As you progress each area will have more relentless swarms of enemies to tackle, couple that with the fact that there are very few methods to recover your health along with each death forcing you to restart the stage from the beginning and you got a recipe for tough and unforgiving game. But it does not feel like it’s just out there to make you suffer. The concept of the game is very easy to grasp but is not a cakewalk making rather fun and having you feel more compelled to complete the stage after each death.Music:Music in this game is definitely above average. From the soothing tracks of the first few areas leading to the dungeon entrances to the creepy yet upbeat tunes when exploring the dungeon itself. They all sound refreshing and set you in the proper mood for the situation the character is facing. Of course that not to say it’s the best as it still can’t compare to music composed by Nobuo Uematsu or Michiru Yamane. Flaws of the game:Though this game has a great concept it certainly has its own issues. Firstly camera control in this game works against the player, you have your standard rotate left and right button but when trying to reset the camera it rotates slowly back to the default position which feel very clunky and brings you out of the fun combat as you will always walk to a corner to reset your camera to get a good angle. Grinding in this game is also a little vexing, as you will die a lot the only way to counter it is to grind to get better stats but there are no level up in this game instead it is replaced by gold which you will use to buy better equipment, now this would not be an issue if there weren’t so few equipment slots. This makes it so you can never be fully prepared for a dungeon as you will never have enough equipment slots to get your stats to the right number, high on armour and attack? Just let a fireball chunk you for 25% of your hp. Also since you will be grinding a lot the music will start to feel repetitive and you will eventually be like “this music is killing me” past a certain point. Lastly, though Chantelise has a good story it is rather predictable and a little anti climatic, if you watch anime or read manga the story of Chantelise will feel very familiar to you.  Overall Chantelise is a punishing yet fun action adventure game that fans of rogue-like games and Dark Souls would likely enjoy. Though it is difficult and has clunky camera controls, the game doesn’t feel very unfair and you will get past each stage with enough patience and perseverance. TL; DR: If you like challenging games with a good story Chantelise is just for you, just don’t be surprised if the bad camera controls messes you up.        "

												Chantelise is a HARD game that was not really meant to be played on PC. You basically take on the role of a girl who needs to clear out regions and fight a final boss in a region. The story progresses after you finish a region and its boss and it seems like it was a well designed game, for the time when it came out. The gameplay itself is actually pretty fun and is generally smooth for the most part and the game is fun. I will highlight some key points, both good and bad, below.My first point is with the keyboard optimization. Frankly, it is not too great. A and S are camera rotation, Up, Down, Left, Right are move, and Z,X,C,V are your abilities. It takes a while for you to get used to this scheme and there is not even an option to rebind the keys the way you want it to be. Furthremore,the bad part is how punishing the game is if you screw up your keys, especially if fighting a boss. That brings me to my second point.My second point is that the game is really hard. The first few places and the tutorial were relatively easy so I was like okay thats fine. Then I died. I thought I died because I was being a little uncareful and that I was. But then I died again. And again. And again. And then I finally got to the boss for the first region. Let's just say that I died at least 10 times to that boss alone. Although I am not against games being hard, with the poor keyboard optimization, the game becomes relatively annoying when you die cuz you mispressed a key or was pressing D when you should have been pressing S (because typically with camera controls on keyboard without mouse optimization it is WASD with A being left and D being right).My third point is that the game is simple to get into and understand. The controls and stuff, although not optimized well, are actually really simple to master and there are only a few combinations to be remembered with the spells. You have your basic attack, your jump and attack, your dodge, and your magic. Combine that all with lockdown and remove lockdown and you get a really simple control scheme which is actualyl really nice. The enemies are also self explanatory sometimes. To hit a flying enemy you have to jump attack. Each enemy has a health bar. Each enemy has an attack pattern. All your standard stuff but Chantelise does it pretty well.Overall, good game but a little on the older side with poor optimization for PC. If I could have played this game with a mouse controlling the camera, it would have been a lot easier and better. But the game itself is fun and I would reocmmend this.Rating: 7.3/10Recommend: Under $3			"

												It was one of the most beautiful, story rich, deep, emotional AND HARD games I've ever played in all my life. Not debunking other games, but this IS one of the games that really made me get into THAT FEEL that you can't just explain through words; even though the story is not large like most JRPGS. That mix of nostalgia and challenge combined with a good plot and well developed characters make you feel like you're sincerely part of the scenario. I'm really thankful for playing such a masterpiece.Pros- Really challenging and fun game- The plot is so nice that will make you stuck to the game until the very last end- Interesting and unique spell system- The characters are well developed - Wide space for strategizing when going through stages- The artwork and the soundtracks are captivating- Elise is such a cutieCons- Really punishing game (not meant for casuals)- The plot can make you cry like a little sh*t- The bosses are unkillable and Archdevil is such a fata** motherfu**er that will make you throw your monitor in the toilet (GOD I HATE THAT GUY SO MUCH)And the only real problem about the game:- No sequelOverall the game is extremely good but it will make you addict to it and then you'll realize that it doesn't have a sequel and you'll cry the fuc* outta it.11/10 would play it again. Thank you so much for it, EasyGameStation			"

												This game man, this game. This here is the successor to Reccettear. It has the same art style and similar combat, but that's about where the similarities end. There is no shop management anymore. Now you control two sisters who are out to turn one back to human after being turned into a fairy. It is a 3D RPG where you wander the land looking for the cure. A few things stand out when I played this game. The first are the awful, graphics. They are a step back in time to the days of the land from Everquest.  Flat and bumpy with only replaced textures to show you that these two things are different. The entities that occupy the land are 2D sprites that rotate like Doom sprites to face you. Remember when I said it was an RPG? Well, imagine that, but without any customization options whatsoever. You can buy armor and whatnot, but but don't expect the avatar to show it.The game CAN be fun, sure. I died to the first boss 50 times. However, you may want to check out other games first.			"

												Chantelise - A Tale of Two Sisters is an action JRPG with old fashioned graphics which take You back straight to the first PlayStation!You play mainly as a young sister called Chante with the older sister, Elise, following You around - hence the name Chantelise. Chante is a swordswoman while Elise is a fairy who can use magic. Therefore, You play as both a knight and a mage!In my opinion, this game is quite hard to beat at first try. i had lot of difficulties mainly with the bosses. The only boss i beat at first try was the first boss, and i barely survived with 1 hit away from death. This game favors defensive gameplay, as in survival mode. You will not beat a boss first meeting by trading hits since the boss is far more tankier than You.Another challenge rises from the bosses having special abilities and weaknesses. You must find a boss' weakness or You will not defeat that boss at all. This is also why i generally always lost first try against a boss because i had to find out their weakness first.The story is also good and there are some bonuses to keep You at the game after finishing the storyline such as fishing, new items on the store to purchase, new survival dungeon to explore, and treasures to hunt if You have not yet found them all!All in all, for 8€, this game is pretty much worth to buy. A demo is also available if You have doubts! And if You wait enough You could get 75% discount, making it a mere 2€ for at least 20 hours of gameplay!			"

												As I type this with my thumbs asking for sweet release I can't help but wonder what kind of sadist comes up with such a difficulty brick wall in what is otherwise a seemingly friendly action game. Set in the same setting as its predecessor, Chantelise continues in the same humorous tone but different approach to gameplay by doing away with the shopkeeping and focusing on dungeon crawling exclusively. Much to my surprise, not everything is cheerful under the hood of this story and an otherwise easy game is regularly [refreshingly] broke up by challenging boss battles, of which the LAST boss takes the cake and serves as the absolute challenge in every way. To make things better it's a multiphase boss and you better do it all in one go or hoodlums will steal your cuteness.  I didn't even do everything there is in the game, but I can heartily give it a recommendation.			"

												During the Summer, I had played the demo of Chantelise. Now I've had a go with the entire game, start to finish, 100% items, all that fun stuff (all I have yet to finish is the fishing side-game, but.. I don't think that'll ever happen ^^""). I rest my previous case of ""totally worth it for ten dollars"". It gave me a good week or so playtime. It's a run-and-slash style RPG, but you don't gain levels like in traditional games. Instead, you find/buy equippment to boost your stats, which you can switch around at any given time ('cept in time attack). The only stat you can permanently increase is your HP, through items call ""Ferromin"". It's fairly simple, and quite difficult at times, but the soundtrack, compelling story, and hilarious dialouge make it quite worth the buy in my opinion. There's always the demo if you're unsure :3 . Anime fans who care about the gameplay, music and story over other trivial crap, give it a go I say~			"

												If you don't want to read something that so long skip it to next indentation.First, the game is a type of ""Doujin game"" Doujin is a general Japanese term for a group of people or friends who share an interest, activity, hobbies, or achievement. The word is sometimes translated into English as clique, coterie, society, or circle In Japan, the term is used to refer to amateur self-published works, including but not limited to manga, novels, fan guides, art collections, music and video games.then, Doujin Game = Steam greenlight>>>>>>>>>>A game is an action role-playing game developed by EasyGameStation. as i said a game is a type of doujin game but quallity equal to some expensive RPG. Graphic is Player characters interact in a 3D environment but are represented by 2D character sprites for front, back, side and diagonal facings. A game contain with pretty challenge waiting for you. So much challenge... hard.. You gonna rage for some stage, Boss fight, Die and die again but still worth to keep playing and finish the challenge. The storyline is very interesting and I recommend you to follow it. Characters design look attractive and adorable in Japanese anime style plus a cute voice of character when they attack, jump or attacked by a monster.So, I recommend to you. A game is pretty fun and challenge. Totally worth it considering the overall gameplay.+ Nice storyline+ Attractive characters+ Pretty challenge- Character Control- Boring combat7.3/10			"

												**TL;DR below**Chantelise is an action adventure RPG that can be categorized with games such as Dark Souls and Bloodborne. I will start with what the game has to offer along with what I liked about it before I get to the issues of this game.Story:The game takes place around a tale of a witch who curses anyone that is outside on a night with the red moon. Shortly after you hear 2 sisters going outside on such a night, they then pass out only to find out that the older sister has become a fairy when they awaken. Thus they set out on a journey to find out if there is a way to reverse the curse. It’s a simple yet engaging story with a nice little twist later on that escalates their situation and that there was a reason behind the sisters getting cursed.Gameplay:As mentioned earlier this game feels very like the Dark Souls series, this means that each stage is going to be rather difficult and very unforgiving. Each stage has you exploring a certain dungeon that is split into serval different areas to make navigation easier. When you first enter an area you must defeat all enemies in there before you can proceed, enemies will drop magic gems that you can pick up and use to cast various spells as well as gold that is used to buy equipment. As you progress each area will have more relentless swarms of enemies to tackle, couple that with the fact that there are very few methods to recover your health along with each death forcing you to restart the stage from the beginning and you got a recipe for tough and unforgiving game. But it does not feel like it’s just out there to make you suffer. The concept of the game is very easy to grasp but is not a cakewalk making rather fun and having you feel more compelled to complete the stage after each death.Music:Music in this game is definitely above average. From the soothing tracks of the first few areas leading to the dungeon entrances to the creepy yet upbeat tunes when exploring the dungeon itself. They all sound refreshing and set you in the proper mood for the situation the character is facing. Of course that not to say it’s the best as it still can’t compare to music composed by Nobuo Uematsu or Michiru Yamane. Flaws of the game:Though this game has a great concept it certainly has its own issues. Firstly camera control in this game works against the player, you have your standard rotate left and right button but when trying to reset the camera it rotates slowly back to the default position which feel very clunky and brings you out of the fun combat as you will always walk to a corner to reset your camera to get a good angle. Grinding in this game is also a little vexing, as you will die a lot the only way to counter it is to grind to get better stats but there are no level up in this game instead it is replaced by gold which you will use to buy better equipment, now this would not be an issue if there weren’t so few equipment slots. This makes it so you can never be fully prepared for a dungeon as you will never have enough equipment slots to get your stats to the right number, high on armour and attack? Just let a fireball chunk you for 25% of your hp. Also since you will be grinding a lot the music will start to feel repetitive and you will eventually be like “this music is killing me” past a certain point. Lastly, though Chantelise has a good story it is rather predictable and a little anti climatic, if you watch anime or read manga the story of Chantelise will feel very familiar to you.  Overall Chantelise is a punishing yet fun action adventure game that fans of rogue-like games and Dark Souls would likely enjoy. Though it is difficult and has clunky camera controls, the game doesn’t feel very unfair and you will get past each stage with enough patience and perseverance. TL; DR: If you like challenging games with a good story Chantelise is just for you, just don’t be surprised if the bad camera controls messes you up.        "

And again. And again. And then I finally got to the boss for the first region. Let's just say that I died at least 10 times to that boss alone. Although I am not against games being hard, with the poor keyboard optimization, the game becomes relatively annoying when you die cuz you mispressed a key or was pressing D when you should have been pressing S (because typically with camera controls on keyboard without mouse optimization it is WASD with A being left and D being right).My third point is that the game is simple to get into and understand. The controls and stuff, although not optimized well, are actually really simple to master and there are only a few combinations to be remembered with the spells. You have your basic attack, your jump and attack, your dodge, and your magic. Combine that all with lockdown and remove lockdown and you get a really simple control scheme which is actualyl really nice. The enemies are also self explanatory sometimes. To hit a flying enemy you have to jump attack. Each enemy has a health bar. Each enemy has an attack pattern. All your standard stuff but Chantelise does it pretty well.Overall, good game but a little on the older side with poor optimization for PC. If I could have played this game with a mouse controlling the camera, it would have been a lot easier and better. But the game itself is fun and I would reocmmend this.Rating: 7.3/10Recommend: Under $3			"

												It was one of the most beautiful, story rich, deep, emotional AND HARD games I've ever played in all my life. Not debunking other games, but this IS one of the games that really made me get into THAT FEEL that you can't just explain through words; even though the story is not large like most JRPGS. That mix of nostalgia and challenge combined with a good plot and well developed characters make you feel like you're sincerely part of the scenario. I'm really thankful for playing such a masterpiece.Pros- Really challenging and fun game- The plot is so nice that will make you stuck to the game until the very last end- Interesting and unique spell system- The characters are well developed - Wide space for strategizing when going through stages- The artwork and the soundtracks are captivating- Elise is such a cutieCons- Really punishing game (not meant for casuals)- The plot can make you cry like a little sh*t- The bosses are unkillable and Archdevil is such a fata** motherfu**er that will make you throw your monitor in the toilet (GOD I HATE THAT GUY SO MUCH)And the only real problem about the game:- No sequelOverall the game is extremely good but it will make you addict to it and then you'll realize that it doesn't have a sequel and you'll cry the fuc* outta it.11/10 would play it again. Thank you so much for it, EasyGameStation			"

												I accidentally clicked on this intending to write a review for Trine, which I didn't like at all. This game was pretty enjoyable, but it's been a while, so I'm not gonna write a review. I'm just gonna post the lyrics to Supertramp's ""The Logical Song.""When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful,a miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical.And all the birds in the trees, well they'd be singing so happily,joyfully, playfully watching me.But then they send me away to teach me how to be sensible,logical, responsible, practical.And they showed me a world where I could be so dependable,clinical, intellectual, cynical.There are times when all the world's asleep,the questions run too deepfor such a simple man.Won't you please, please tell me what we've learnedI know it sounds absurdbut please tell me who I am.Now watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical,liberal, fanatical, criminal.Won't you sign up your name, we'd like to feel you'reacceptable, respecable, presentable, a vegtable!At night, when all the world's asleep,the questions run so deepfor such a simple man.Won't you please, please tell me what we've learnedI know it sounds absurdbut please tell me who I am.

												Chantelise is one of those 6-to-7-ish games that I find remarkably enchanting - a bit unpolished, a few questionable mechanics, a less-than-stellar budget...yet surprisingly endearing and unswervingly enjoyable. An indie offering? Yep. A hack'n'slash? Indeed. A simple 3D action game? Perhaps. An unsurprising tale? Basically. Nonetheless, it's a title that took this Tek to task several times with its challenging difficulty and captivated my ears with its impressive synth-orchestrated soundtrack. The demo's worth a small investment of time by those who do not oppose the game's aesthetics, I'd venture. Try it out if you wish. Expectations of AAA presentation will surely be unmet, but a little leniency might yield something neat. ^^ I do not promise that Chantelise will enchant you as it did me - but I most certainly enjoyed my time with it. Thanks, Carpe Fulgur and EGS. <3			"

												I have over 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #33 - ChanteliseNormally I have a soft spot for JRPGs, but in the case of Chantelise, I could not get into this game at all.  I didn't even finish my hour of play before I put it down.I'll start with the presentation.  It's this weird hybrid of a world presented in 3D, but all of the characters are flat 2D sprites.  It's not so bad with your character since the camera stays behind you as you move.  But NPCs look really weird as you circle around them.  Each character has 4 different sprites that get displayed based on which side of the character you are facing.  I have nothing at all against the 'retro' look in games, but this combination of 3D and 2D I found jarring.The biggest part of the game is the combat.  Combat in Chantelise is not turn based, but rather plays more like a hack-n-slash game.  There's really only 2 basic elements to combat.  One is mashing the melee attack button, and the other is your magic button.  Magic works rather strangely in this game, as you pick up gems from the ground.  Rather than selecting a spell you cast, you use these gems in the order they are picked up.  You can hold down the magic button to charge your attack and use multiple gems.  It sounds nice in the sense that different colored gems can be combined for different attacks, but it's entirely dependent on the order you pick the gems up.  So your strategy is more about trying to pick up gems in the right order, while trying not to get killed, which you'll fail at miserably because the game becomes punishingly difficult as soon as you enter the first dungeon.The story, what little I saw of it, I did like.  The characters were my favorite part of the game, but unfortunately the game just kind of doles out the story in little pieces, like a visual novel, in between clearing out areas of monsters.  Which brings up another annoyance I had.  When you enter a new area, you will be blocked from progressing by some magical barrier or whatever it is that the game doesn't explain.  The barrier just magically goes away when you kill the last monster in the area.  No explanation, that's just how things roll.One other note, there is no level progression in the game, which means the only way that you can become more effective in combat is to buy better items.  When you die, you get sent back to town.  So it sets up this grind of collect gold, get killed, then upgrade to better items.  Having some grinding in a game isn't a bad thing, but it has to be fun, and I wasn't having any.  This game just isn't for me.			"

												This game is difficult, but not for the reasons that make difficulty fun. The controls are annoyingly loose and the camera controls can only be described as garbage. There is no reward in slogging through enemies so most of your time is spent rushing through rooms to get to bosses after losing. The bosses can be fun to fight when you are not struggling with the camera, but that's rare. The graphical style is interesting but also adds to the annoyance of not being sure when you are actually going to land hits. The music is just dull droning bacground music. There's not much to like here overall.			"

												It's a fun, cute game. Some of the bosses are down right frusturating, and you will want to throw something at times. Just push through it. That said, it is still worth it.Just make sure you have a netbook on hand to throw at a wall; spare your gaming rig.One of the game's replay factors comes in the form of the dungeon, which has about 60 floors. It's very difficult and takes a while to go through...it's super fun though... :D Hint: abuse health. Get as much of it as you can. I mean it.  "

												Camera controls are MANUAL, with a (completely useless and unweildly) 'lock on' mode that requires button taps to toggle in and out of at real time.  Both ""modes"" are hot garbage with a keyboard.With the steam controller they are STILL completely terrible as you are forced to manually fix the camera with the top buttons rather than just having a naturally flowing camera as is the case in well designed games (take your pick, there are many examples).There is no level up system.  Cash is everything and you can't buy stats in an unlimited fashion; what little you can buy is limited by a geometric cost progression (e.g. Max HP +10 item costs 1,000-2,000-4,000-8,000 etc).  Selling is also on a geometric degradation.  If you seel a 5,000 gp item will net you 5000-4500-4050 etc.Enemy placements and types are 100% deterministic leading to a grindy experience. "

												Controls and camera are terrible. Semi 3D nonsense going on for it doesn't help in anyway. It's difficult to see enemies attacking you, it is difficult to attack enemies, it is difficult to dodge...I, like 90% of all people who played this game, gave up on the first boss since it is a giant golem with ridiculous ammounts of HP whereas you are a little girl and exactly what would happen in real life happens if you try to take him on.Just watch BrutalMoose's video on it, he was pretty much accurate.

												While this game has a cutesy anime style and generally the same likeable ""sisters"" as Recettear does, that's pretty much all the fun there is in it. The gameplay is trite, the controls are, as one of my favorite game reviewers would say, Absolute ♥♥♥♥ On Cheesy Biscuits™, the camera controls even more so, from what I've experienced so far the upgrade market is very limited and pretty linear and the four-way sprite graphics are not made for 360° view. I've played this for an hour now, and I haven't even made it past the area after the first town. This is mostly because enemies, like Elise, only really attack in the cardinal directions, so when an enemy casts something hurty behind you, odds are already 1:2 it'll hit you, regardless of where you move. This wouldn't be a big issue if you were actually able to sense the attack (OR the enemy, since I'm not watching the damn map when I'm whacking my kunai-sword-thingy at a group of enemies) or the magic would work properly. Magic attacks a single monster even if it is a raging fireball. The defensive spell is horribly unbalanced compared to the offensive spells as it hardly does damage and disappears after 5 or so hits, which happens fairly quickly as neither the hammer balls need to actually *HIT* the enemy, and a group of 5 monsters counts as 5 hits. It is also not entirely clear when you can get 2 hammer balls. Most of the time the one would replace the other, and sometimes I'd get lucky and there were suddenly two. Luckily this blessing was resolved quickly when I neared another enemy because of the aforementioned AOE on the kinetic items.Long story short: I want my €2 and the 60 minutes of my life I wasted on this game back. The only good it did was show me the developers took some lessons to heart well when they released Recettear.			"

The combat is way too simple, I dont know if there is more variety later, but at the beginning, there is one attack button and one jump attack, as well as a few magic attacks. The worst part is the technical side, I dont mind the 2D models and I can dig the artstyle, but having groups of enemies popping in only when I'm almost face to face is not acceptable in this day and age of gaming.

												The character you control moves like she is on ice, the rest of the controls feel clunky. Audio is forgetful at best. The game is cute and is semi-pretty, but that is about all I can say that is positive. Also being able to knock enemies through invisible walls, ON A FLAT FIELD, and then you not being able to get to them is incredibly sloppy. If you do not want the character going past a point put an actual wall, or if you must put an invisible one make sure the enemies can't pass through it freely.			"

												A terribble waste of time.This game imidiately becomes an unfair grind.You fight trough a series of, lets call them missions. Every mission has several stages. Every stage is a more or less short level in wich the goal is to kill all enemys to progress. Fail in one of these stages and you have to do them all over again.Even dying to the Missions boss doesn't spawn you before the boss but forces you to do all stages of that level again. A few hits and you are dead especially at the beginning where you don't know all movement- and attackpatters. This is Horse c ock.You can't equip or buy healing items and must hope to stumble upon them by killing enemys. Upon picking up these healing items they are imidiately consumed even if you did actually needed them or not.There is no finesse and barely any creativity to the fights or missions. Avoid.A waste of charme on this game.			"

												It's a rough game, and the camera/lock-on controls make it harder, which just makes it frustrating. Like throw-your-controller frustrating. You'll accumulate money over failures to buy some stuff that can carry you, as well as be able to rush through zones you have cleared previously, so there is a way out even if you are having difficulty. I, however, do not appreciate having to rely on deaths I feel should have been avoidable if not for the weird camera/lock-on controls.			"

												This is that game by the same people as Recetear... It's 3d dungeon crawly action stuff.  I just played through some of it, and it's a bit on the hard side, especially before I started buying up those max health +10 items in bulk. Enemies can rip through your HP in seconds without it if you slip up, and the game plays fast and loose.  Magic is limited but OP, so I just beat the first boss by scrambling around for magic gems while desperately trying to stay out of its heroine-smashing reach.Oh, and it's got a free demo, so you can make sure it runs on your comp first.

												It's has some rather charming characters and art, as well as some enjoyable (and ****ing hard) Ys-like combat, and can be played on a low-end PC!But its marred by many, many problems that make it hard to recommend.The mix of 2D sprites and 3D environments work for an overhead view (such as Ragnarok Online) or a first person shooter (say Doom or Duke Nukem 3D), but Chantelise is behind the character's back, making it hard to judge distance. Since Chantelise has platforming, you'll often over shoot or under shoot where you're trying to land on.Not to mention, this game is an utter grindfest. You don't level with experience points, you increase your abilities with items bought in a shop (and rarely found in chests), and the items cost more every time you buy them. Killing enemies rewards you with very little money, and there's no healing items to speak of, unless you kill an enemy and it LUCKILY drops an instant recovery item, or you can use your healing spell that's hard to make sometimes.Sadly, you NEED to grind. Bosses can kill you in only a couple of hits, and you'll often need to grind in the same area or hours at a time. I only played ten hours, but I'm not even close to being done.Also, you'll have to look up online where to find the secret chests because they help a ton, too.Spells aren't cast with MP, either, but with gems dropped by enemies. You pick them up in order, then it changes the spell. You can't change the order, and can only hold a limited number of gems. You also need magic, and being limited to one spell at a time makes the game hardly fair.It's so difficult, it's plain silly.Ys is hard, but even that series has its limits.In the original Ys, you could just stand still, and your health autoheals, or you could the ONE healing potion on you. Made the game at least somewhat fair.But in Chantelise, the game tells you to **** off or grind in the same area for hours and hours before the next.After grinding in three levels and realizing I'm not nearly strong enough to kill the next boss,I ****ed off.Maybe its sequel, Reccettear is a better game. I'll buy that, eventually (if it ever goes on sale), and see how it is.But, it's prequel, Chantelise, is a difficult recommendation.			"

												This game hurts my hands. I have to use A or S to change the camera angles, Z to pick up and attack but X to jump. The more horrible thing is arrow+Z+X is the dash. You could only die once in one dungeon with story mode. However IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FINISH A BOSS AT THE FIRST TIME! That means you have to run all the map until you find the boss, then beat it or go back home to try again. But to be honest, there is a boss rush mode which I think is helpful to practice. And the camera angle... I think it's the real nightmare.I played Monster Hunter more than 1200 hours before and I think MH is much easier than this game. I won't play this one anymore.			"

												While over all I felt that this was a good game, it wasn't perfect, in fact there were many flaws that could have been fixed.PositivesThe magic system and the spells were very well done, easy to pick up on and given certain enemies weaknesses actually helped a lot.Music was lively and worked well for the areas.Combat was well defined, hit detection was spot onItems could be arranged depending on combat style/challenges. I actually really liked how you were limited to only 4 items at once since it kept the game challenging but allowed freedom depending on gaming style.The characters were funny, sort of. It's an odd sense of humor, but I appreciated it at times.Challenges and additional treasures as well as fishing and special items added some nice distractions without going overboard.Controller support also worked mostly well. (PS3 Controller)NegativesAesthetically this game wasn't all that pleasant to look at, the graphics were rather dated, even for an indie game. The prerendered sprites also didn't mesh well in by opinion, you get over it rather quickly though.Camera angles almost ruined this game for me, not being able to unlock targets was a major pain.Slippery controls at times, causing me to fall off ledges.Very linear without much to distinguish it from other RPGs. Overall it was a good game, but it wasn't great. Yor the price it wasn't bad though.Overall I'm glad I played this game, it was fun while it lasted, unfortunately I don't see all that much replay value though.			"

												At the first look, I did not quite know what to expect from Chantelise. I saw it was from the makers of An Item shop's tale, which I recently played a demo from, and I liked it a lot. Chantelise is a fun game, and fairly easy once you get a hang of the controls, which was a pain in the ♥♥♥ to get used to. The bad things about this game, I think, are the controls (and no option to change them), the annoying sound you hear when you slash enemies, and that you have to turn the camera yourself (again, with annoying controls), which takes ages to get right, you can't move around really quickly that way. I give this game a 6/10 for now (I haven't finished it), It's fun to play but only when I'm bored.			"

												Boring. Revolves around tedious and clunky combat. It's worth repeating: boring as a barrel of stale bread. The characters appear to be as flat and interesting as cardboard, and the story -- though the intro makes it seem intriguing! -- soon reveals itself to be just as flimsy. Or so it would seem. The combat is way too boring to slog through, so I'm not bothering to find out if the story or its characters get any better later on. The entire game is clunky, and a lot of the art and design choices are laughable or cringe-worthy. I was expecting the immediate wit and charm of other Carpe Fulgur titles, but I didn't find it here. There were some cute caterpillars that tried to kill me, but that's the only good thing I can say about this game.So obviously it's not my sort of game, buuuut you might like it if you are interested in replicating the (admittedly sometimes magical and bizarrely entertaining) experience of playing a bargain bin PS1 title, and/or you really really REALLY like hack-and-slashers so much that it doesn't matter how tedious or one-dimensional that hack-and-slashing might be.""there were some cute caterpillars"" 1/10			"

												Definitely not worth $10.00The areas are very dull, among other things.  BUT the MAJOR problem is in the design of the game mechanics. 1. To kill some monsters you HAVE to use spells.2. To cast spells you have to pick up crystals from the ground.3. Crystals are dropped by other monsters.4. You can only hold so many crystals at a time.You're probably wondering what happens when you run out of crystals and you have to kill one of such monsters.  That's precisely the frustration you will run into over and over.  And this is the reason I only played it for 2 hours and gave up.			"

												Heyyo,A decent indie JRPG. 3D world with 2D character sprites. The storyline's decent and the combat is ok... but I dunno... I never could really get into it since there's better action-RPG games out there. I'll still give it a recommendation since others might enjoy it more than me who are more into JRPG's of this style, but be warned, it's not a very captivating game for everyone.			"

												This game encourages a lot of backtracking.  I did read reviews that complained about the camera, and it really gets bad when you are surrounded by enemies and have to lock onto one, but get the one that is behind you or even one through a wall instead. This becomes nightmarish if the enemy can fly and you lock onto someone else or need to wait for it to get behind you.The game may immerse with its nice graphical 2D anime characters on a 3d graphic style, but that is the only good part.  The magic is an interesting system, to combine 2 spells, though you don't get much unless they are the same color; super armor was fun to use, but given I cannot reorder the gems I get to combine spells, it makes it feel random.  Physical attacks are pretty basic: a 3 hit combo, a sliding dodge move, and a jumping slash.  The slow motion for criticals looks nice, but sadly, I can only compliment the graphics of this game.Here is the worst part of the game; when you save and quit/die in a dungeon, you have to redo the entire dungeon, though at least you won't have to kill all the enemies to go to the next area.  This gets really old quickly. I don't want to have to play a game where I must kill every individual enemy (and possibly backtrack again) to be allowed to progress to the next level.Chantelise's dialogue starts off slow but the characters warm up a bit to you (the game's title is a portmanteau of the two sisters, Chante and Elise, and Chante's mid-battle tips/spellcasting make you feel like a team).  However, there are far better games to play that won't taunt you by having a time attack mode for any area you've been to but will not take you to the next area.  In other words, I can die, do time attack to complete that area I died in, and then have to revisit every other level in story mode and kill all the enemies in that same level again to get to the next level.  This is completely pointless and an easy fix would have been for time attack to let you go to the next area after you finish.			"

												I do not recommend this game, because it is quite difficult and repetitive.  The price of failure is too high.It's a 3D action role-playing game, so make sure your dexterity is up.  That is fine, and I like that.  It plays somewhat like Dark Cloud for PlayStation 2.  I highly recommend a controller, but watch out for Tic-Tac-'Doh:  select (which I mapped to A/X) is attack, and cancel (for me, B/circle) is jump.  My fingers are either confused during combat or during shopping.  This seems to be common in Japanese role-playing games, though, so I may as well get used to it.Here is a quick summary of the pros and cons.+ If Elise (the younger, human sister) dies, you respawn at the (nearest?) town.  All of your items are intact.+ You start with some guidance on combat tactics and maneuvers.- My main complaint is that my character's abilities rarely change as the game goes on.  I advance the story and better items appear in the store.- If Elise dies, however, you must run through all of the areas you previously cleared in order to advance the story.- It is easy to fall from ledges.  Some slopes (of a fallen tree trunk, for example) seem passable, but are not.- It took me a while to figure out that in order to leave an area, I had to defeat all monsters therein.- Enemies sometimes drop treasure, but each time you sell a piece of treasure, the resale value of all future items of that type keeps decreasing.  This makes grinding (repeatedly fighting enemies for cash) less and less fruitful.- Concordantly, every time you purchase a piece of equipment, the price of all future items of that type continuously and sharply increases.  The first glove may cost 2000, but the second one of the same type may then cost 5000.If you want an action JRPG, I highly recommend Fortune Summoners instead.  It may be 2D, but the character development is much better paced with the story.			"

An amazingly developed RPG game wow!

I didn't know what to expect, listening to the intro reminded me of Sword Art Online because anything narrated in Japanese just reminds me of Anime.
But when the game kicked in, I was not expecting a Legend of Zelda OoT/Super Mario 64 look!

This game has the RPG elements of Final Fantasy but gameplay like N64's Legend of Zelda.

Would highly recommend!

												We rented this game from the video store to try it out, and we liked it well enough to buy one. I thoroughly enjoy this game in spite of some flaws in the animation. Maybe that's because my criterion for a good game is that it should challenge my reasoning skills. This game definitely does that!Although ""Chantelise"" is rated ""6 years and older"" in terms of content (from the G-rated movie), it's a difficult game that might frustrate some children, and will definitely challenge adults. It has five ""worlds"" with 3 levels each (that's 15 levels in all). So far, I've only gotten to Level 4 (where the Bird gobbles me up every time!) Each time I play, however, I discover new tricks and features that I missed before.The real trick in this game is not bashing badongo's at breakneck speed, it's figuring out the best order to collect the various items. True, Elise's Red Berries are very hard to aim and you need several throws to do much good. They're meant to be that way, because they're his least powerful weapon. But find that green Homing Berry, and your aiming problems are solved, because it follows the target like a smart bomb! Also, I didn't find Chante's harvester on Level 1 until I had played for several hours -- but once I did, my whole strategy changed the next time around. And I'm sure it will change again, once I find whatever it is I need to get past that darned Bird!I give this game a 0/10 though, because its gaaaay af.			"

Your team is composed of Elise, which do the melee damage with her sword, and Chante, which helps with the magic. The soundtrack is amazing and the boss battles are really creative and strategic!

												This game is a very vibrant and colorful 3rd person Hack n' Slash adventure, but the dialogue scenes last forever and the story is too convoluted to understand or care about.  It has fast paced fluent action, but the difficulty curve is way too steep because you don't get a healing spell until the second area of the game and health drops are rare.  The music and environments are good at setting the tempo and mood of the levels, but if you die there are no checkpoints to resume from.  There are just a couple of simple things the creators could have done to make it more player-friendly.  1st on the list would be save points that heal like the Save Spheres in FFX.  For what it's worth though, the week I spent playing it I was completely wrapped up in it crunching numbers for hours to maxamize my character.I reccomend it but highly suggest using a walk-through to find all of the hidden items along the way.  It's almost the only way to keep up with the difficulty.			"

												so i don't like doing reviews most of the time, due to my poor grammer and even worse spelling, but i really felt a need to support this game cause it is really fun, it give off the phatsy star vibe (later ones not the nes ones) with an almost adventure style upgread system, like zelda or metroid. in which items are your only boosters and there are no actuall lvls. meaning if you get the mostions down you could most likely beat this game with little to know items (if people can in KH and Dark Souls they can here) and dont let people say it the anime verson of dark souls scare you its not that hard, i got pass the first boss and havent died yet, you should just take your time grind some, get some good items and spam buy the health upgrades, and get use to the jump dash. oh and almost every room has a hidden treasure in it obtianed in different ways so dont forget to look and take your time in each room. all in all if your looking for a good beat 'em up with an adventure, RPG, and explorer asspect, this is a good game to try.

												Flawed but fun, short but sweet, ""Chantelise - A Tale of Two Sisters"" has an inescapable fun factor. It shines in some ways, but also has some serious flaws that made the game frustrating in spots.The parts of Chantelise I enjoyed the most were the music and the level design. The music blended well in the background, and actually stood out to me a few times as quite fitting for the story/stage. The levels are a large blend of typical fantasy settings. Floating island, ship, cave, temple, volcano, etc. The way subsequent levels change themes so drastically is disconcerting sometimes, but the variety works in the game's favor.Chantelise deserves credit for trying to be unique with its magic combat, but the system really could have used more tuning. You're supposed to power up same-colored gems in a row for spells, but the game gives you those gems in random quantities and colors, and you can only hold six. This makes collecting multiples of the same gem tedious, but single-gem spells are not very powerful. The magic system is adequate in the end, but it could have been much better. The story is moderately interesting, and the humor was entertaining enough. It didn't make me laugh, but it did make me smile.Though it's shy of greatness, I found ""Chantelise - A Tale of Two Sisters"" to be greater than the sum of its parts, and definitely worth a try.

												I bought this game because Steam said I would like it...Steam was wrong. It's an open world action RPG that vaguely reminded me of Secret of Mana. However it lacked the great music, unique combat system and interesting story. In full disclosure I haven't enjoyed a JRPG since Final Fantasy 8, so I doubt this game was made for me. It was cheap and on sale, but not worth my time.			"

												Two cute girls running around in dungeons killing stuff, what's not to like?This has PS1 a feel that is gauranteed to charm the hearts of those coming from the earlier generation of gamers. There are a ton of items to unlock and secrets to be found. The magic system is intuitive, mixing different elements together to create different effects and attacks. Storyline isn't overly complex but it's cute and endearing. The art form is great, 2D sprites in 3D backgrounds, great fluid animation. Good game, definitely worth the money.			"

												Flawed but fun, short but sweet, ""Chantelise - A Tale of Two Sisters"" has an inescapable fun factor. It shines in some ways, but also has some serious flaws that made the game frustrating in spots.The parts of Chantelise I enjoyed the most were the music and the level design. The music blended well in the background, and actually stood out to me a few times as quite fitting for the story/stage. The levels are a large blend of typical fantasy settings. Floating island, ship, cave, temple, volcano, etc. The way subsequent levels change themes so drastically is disconcerting sometimes, but the variety works in the game's favor.Chantelise deserves credit for trying to be unique with its magic combat, but the system really could have used more tuning. You're supposed to power up same-colored gems in a row for spells, but the game gives you those gems in random quantities and colors, and you can only hold six. This makes collecting multiples of the same gem tedious, but single-gem spells are not very powerful. The magic system is adequate in the end, but it could have been much better. The story is moderately interesting, and the humor was entertaining enough. It didn't make me laugh, but it did make me smile.Though it's shy of greatness, I found ""Chantelise - A Tale of Two Sisters"" to be greater than the sum of its parts, and definitely worth a try.

												Loved Recettear, sad that I don't like this.Good translation, nice spritey graphics, pretty decent music.Bad combat system with highly questionable hitboxes for everything involved. Limited camera angles and 3rd person perspective make it hard to tell what's going on sometimes.  The whole thing culiminated in uninstalling the game after fighting the first boss, where you're supposed to use a dodge move to avoid its jumps, but sometimes it just... doesn't work, and the boss' other attacks hit you when you're visually well out of their range. Also I couldn't tell if I was doing anything to the boss as it took damage from attacks yet its health meter didn't go down. Then I died when it landed on me because I did the same dodge move in the same way and that time it whiffed, for reasons.			"

												Personally, I really like Recettear, because its unique and fun gameplay, but for Chantelise, I can't like this game. Because it's too damn freakin' hard, especially there's no guard button. It would be better if you can keep a healing item and use in dangerous situation or having your own magic instead of picking up from the ground or at least when lose it could restart from the current room instead of throwing back to town and have to walk back into the dungeon AGAIN.So if you like difficult game, it might fun for you, but if not, stay away.

												Chantelise is a fun hack and slash game with a simple but enjoyable plot. There isn't really much I can go into detail though as the game's main downside is how incredibly short it is. I managed to clock in about 15 hours and beat the entire game and going as far as collecting every secret item.So sadly, for the most part, since you can't mod it it's a tad expensive imo, best wait for a sale to be going on. Now I still enjoyed the game mind you, it just has a very short lifespan with little replay value.			"

												so i don't like doing reviews most of the time, due to my poor grammer and even worse spelling, but i really felt a need to support this game cause it is really fun, it give off the phatsy star vibe (later ones not the nes ones) with an almost adventure style upgread system, like zelda or metroid. in which items are your only boosters and there are no actuall lvls. meaning if you get the mostions down you could most likely beat this game with little to know items (if people can in KH and Dark Souls they can here) and dont let people say it the anime verson of dark souls scare you its not that hard, i got pass the first boss and havent died yet, you should just take your time grind some, get some good items and spam buy the health upgrades, and get use to the jump dash. oh and almost every room has a hidden treasure in it obtianed in different ways so dont forget to look and take your time in each room. all in all if your looking for a good beat 'em up with an adventure, RPG, and explorer asspect, this is a good game to try.

												what can I say this game truly is THE kawaii desu desu dark souls. The game has you going through a 3d world with various dungeon while you control a 2d protagonist with a really cool sword and her fairy sister who uses magic. both magic and sword attacks are equally used here due to some enemies being literally impossible to kill with sword strikes. Also similar to souls is the fact that money is experience, you will be buying upgrades from defense upgrade to health upgrade, etc.. and each becomes more expensive as you buy them. EasyGameStation has yet again gone above expectation and created another gem in my collection and I can only hope that more people will come to appreciate them and the work they do.			"

												I saw this game on sale for only 3$, and I've never heard of this game before now. I pulled it up, started playing, and by the first level I was immediately enthralled. The combat is simple but not TOO simple, there's enough thought put into it that you can't just mindlessly slash your way through this game, and you have to strategise your pickups. This game is very difficult - don't let the adorable characters and music drop your guard, it took me 7 tries to finally beat the 2nd boss, and 2 to beat the first! I have died several times on the levels leading up to the boss just due to the amount of stuff going on - this game feels like a PERFECT blend of shoot 'em up and brawler, because not only are you brawling and shooting, but you're always on your toes and dodging a constant barrage of spells being thrown by the enemies, meanwhile melee monsters like skeletons and... catapillars are giving it their all, this game is RELENTLESS.and I love it. If you see this game on sale for 5$, it's (in my opinion) and instant buy, and for 10 - there should only be a few moments of consideration.as for flaws, I don't see any. it plays decently enough on the keyboard, and I guess my mind just clicked with the camera controls (a common complaint) because I've had few problems with the camera after the first few minutes, but overall it works.

												A quite unique 3D action RPG with cute anime girls.This game's graphic engine is really unique and interesting, as most of the japanese doujin game engines. It uses a rendering style similar to what you would see in the old DOOM games: 3D environment with 2D enemies and characters. I find this old-school look unique and pleasant.The combat system is hack n slash, fast paced and pretty challenging.An overall very enjoyable JRPG with cute chara design and original japanese dubs.

												This game is a very vibrant and colorful 3rd person Hack n' Slash adventure, but the dialogue scenes last forever and the story is too convoluted to understand or care about.  It has fast paced fluent action, but the difficulty curve is way too steep because you don't get a healing spell until the second area of the game and health drops are rare.  The music and environments are good at setting the tempo and mood of the levels, but if you die there are no checkpoints to resume from.  There are just a couple of simple things the creators could have done to make it more player-friendly.  1st on the list would be save points that heal like the Save Spheres in FFX.  For what it's worth though, the week I spent playing it I was completely wrapped up in it crunching numbers for hours to maxamize my character.I reccomend it but highly suggest using a walk-through to find all of the hidden items along the way.  It's almost the only way to keep up with the difficulty.			"

												I have to a love/hate relationship with this game.The controls are a tad annoying and take time to get used to (same with those camera angles), but there is a sense of accomplishment when you actually do complete an area. I will agree with another person's review that this game is like 'Dark Souls: Lolis' as the bosses are *PAINFULLY* hard, even for the first dungeon. It took me a long, long, long time to finish the first real dungeon boss. If you love a game with a challenge, this may be your cup of tea, if you don't mind the clunky mechanics.			"

												It's your typical JRPG with a sad story. I love the concept that there are no ""levels"". I rarely needed to farm money for better equip, because it seems you always get the right amount needed for the next equipment. It does have a lot of glitches, but come on! That game was made back in 2006 (translated 2011), so don't expect super graphics and stuff. The bosses are not so easy if you don't know the strategy, but you'll figure it out soon enough. Oh and that hp bar sound... All in all, it was a great game and I definitely recommend it to anyone who liked Recettear.			"

												Charming and simple are the two words I'd use to describe Chantelise.This game has a straightforward narrative with likeable characters and entertaining dialouge. Rather than focusing on being particularly deep, or weighty, like most of the games in it's genre would, Chantalise chooses to have a simple narrative beffiting such a small, and technically basic game. Which makes for easy criticisms of it's story. Did I like Chantelise's characters? Yes. Did I find myself engaged in it's story? As much as I'd need to. While the game can't go above in beyond in this regard because of the restrictions it puts on itself, it also keeps itself from feeling more grandiose or complex than a game like this needs to. It's a humble choice that works well.Mechanically Chantalise works similalrly. The game opts for a simple graphical style, and uses a handful of simple mechanics. It's very easy to grasp and get used to, the controls feel a little obtuse at first, but they're surprisingly intutative. You should use a controller though, the game is designed for a controller and I can't see most of the basic camera functions working well without it. The game provides just enough to never feel overcomplex or convoluted, but still have a fair amount of varience in gameplay styles through the main quest. The game is clearly designed for the player to experiment with and learn the enviorments and enemy types, and learn the methods of fighting them. I'm reminded almost of Hotline Miami in a few ways, the focus on level design, the neccessity of experimentation and memorization. The game might have you dying a lot, but it's easy to jump right back in and keep trying. The game is a lot more about becoming proficient with it's controls, camera, movement, and combat, than about leveling stats or learning it's mechanics deeply. The brilliant level design, and satisfying combat system make this game extremely gratifying to play.These may sound like bad things, and for some of you they may be -- but I found Chantalise really really refreshing. It was a nice and simple game to stop and play in my free time, It was an extremely gratifying experience, and while it may be a little difficult getting into due to it's more classic Action RPG style, it's well worth it.8/10			"

												Since this is an older japanese doujin game and came before Recettear, Chantelise does have its issues. But those can easily be overlooked over its good and charming story, easy to understand controls (the camera control kinda sucks though), and sheer overall difficulty to complete this game. If you want a nice simple but very challenging action adventure game, then I highly recommend this.

												Personally, I really like Recettear, because its unique and fun gameplay, but for Chantelise, I can't like this game. Because it's too damn freakin' hard, especially there's no guard button. It would be better if you can keep a healing item and use in dangerous situation or having your own magic instead of picking up from the ground or at least when lose it could restart from the current room instead of throwing back to town and have to walk back into the dungeon AGAIN.So if you like difficult game, it might fun for you, but if not, stay away.

												I try my best to be a fair reviewer, but I'm probably going to sound like I'm not being fair with this game. It is going to sound bad because it really is just that sad of a game, and I really wanted to like this game because there aren't many good anime-themed games on Steam as of this moment, and I'm a big fan of the anime art style. That said, here goes:The graphics are low quality. The one and only town feels extremely small and unpopulated. The levels are also pretty confined, not to mention this game is super linear for an RPG. It feels like an old N64 game, but it's like the game was designed to run off of something with half the power of an N64, so it ends up having less content than most N64 games, and it looks worse than most N64 games. The game is super simple/small in almost every way. Also, the story kinda sucks, being pretty uninteresting, having very little depth. While there are a few good humorous moments, they are smothered by epic amounts of lame dialogue. The fighting is sort of fun, but it doesn't feel like it is polished and the magic use is somehow really lacking in feeling ""magical"". It's really not fun to fight enemies with your sword or magic. All of that said, I did find that the bosses were pretty enjoyable to fight.There are 2 other games from Carpe Fulgar here on Steam as well, and they are loads better.I give this game a 4/10Worth less than $5, and only worth buying if you are very bored and have nothing better to do.

												What Do I thin about Chantelise - The Tale of two sisters ...In general, It's pretty okay to tell you the truth and it's not a must buy but play it when you can.*Gameplay*It's in a beat'em up style with small aspects of an RPG elements like armor and other equipments. You'll be confused at first when you use magic thinking you'll have a meter if you just skip the tutorial (like I did lol).Though, there is a problem for controller users since the game has a bug where the camera just runs around in circles (runs around in circles, run around circles). This bug needs to be fixed! If you're using a ps4 controller then go to your DS4 tool and 'hide' it. Keyboard users you're fine so don't worry about that ....Gameplay rate - 8/10 (without bug - with it is a 7) (not too much is going on but feels like you're in control)*Story* SPOILERS!!!!!!!!Let's see, The story could of have been better but nothing is wrong with it since it focus on the gameplay aspect mostly. The voice acting is in Japanese but english sub. It's just a simplified version of Full Metal alchemist except you're sister Chante is a fairy and you need to turn her back. Though the other sister Elise is fine just .... she's proper and dull only reason being the shopkepper acts the same way (for the most part - like the cooking). I usually like her but find myself liking Chante more because she had more personality and was more appealing.Story Rate - 6.5/10 (why so low? the ending, it's a small plot twist but it doesn't catch my attention as much except Chante)*Difficulty*F*** THIS GAME! in a good way ... YOU WILL GRIND MONEY! NO IF's, AND's, OR BUTT's ABOUT IT! Remember that rpg element? HP! You will get money for HP since you don't level up.  You will start at 30hp and you will cry because it's just you, a fairy who can only use magic from stones that monsters drop, and a short sword. Oh prepare to run around enemies like you're some ninja. Seriously, that sword looks like a cool kunai Knife that I want to own. HEY DEV! PUT IT ON EBAYTo put it lightly, The difficulty is high but not too high but you won't expect it to be so darn high. All I have to say is F*** the bats, F*** the exploding monsters when you don't have magic, and F*** the HP! xDDifficulty Rate - 10/10 PERFECT! Everything will be you're fault since the controls are solid just need a bit more features (like blocking)*Errors*Besides the Controller bug this game has not glitching i ran into, no audio outs, nothing ... Game has love put into it and I love it. Polish rate - 8.5/10 (without bug - 10/10)*Sound*The sound track is okay but forgettable, and I find myself stabbing my ears from the constant beeping from the stupid Low HP warning sound. BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP! Health please ....Sound rate - 5/10 (Option to turn of Low hp warning would bump it up to 6/10)*OVERALL*You will not play this because of the story but play this for the difficulty and charm this game have and it does have charm. You will love most of the characters and some of the comedy aspects of the story to the hateful Bees.If they improve not only the story but other chracters somewhat like Aira's Cooking habit (Which is funny), to Elise's Personality. Chante is great along with Elma right behind and only reason I'm not giving this it's half a point is because of so much digging I had to get rid of the bug for controller usersGame Rating - 8.0/10 - This game is worth every penny and I can see this being some sort of show.

												Like all Carpe fulgur games, this is a game that uses a very simple and straightfoward story to fantastic effect thanks to great writing, characters and gameplay. While it's gameplay isn't quite up to Reccetears standards, this is really only because it's more conventional. It's hard to find major fault, since it has a very challenging main game that keeps the player interested and means you'll spend makes the relatively small scale seem bigger. There are even hidden treasures, a in-depth fishing mechanic, and challenge modes for each map that gives the average completionist a sense of accomplishment.

												Chantelise: The Tale of Two Sisters is a game created by EasyGameStation and released in 2006.It's a hack-and-slash, RPG game, about two sisters, Chante and Elise, or the fairy and the swordmaiden.It combines and adorable style, with a horrible way to play the game. I especially love its story, as it follows the trials and events the two main protagonists need to face. It gives such an RPG-Anime-esque feeling that it makes me want it to become an anime. It's story rich, and has many amazing points.Although some cons are present as well. The game's controls are pretty hard to use, considering, that my controller broke a while back, and playing this with a keyboard doesn't seem to bring back that much enjoyment, at least for me.I have to mention, this game is RIDICULOSLY HARD. There's no possible way of changing the difficulty, or modify it in any way. The game has a pretty annyoying bug as well at the start og the game, making it impossible to progress. It took me 4 new saves to actually get started in the first chapter.If you want to play Dark Souls, but you're like me, and you're a really low budget student, and you like cute thigns more, I recommend this game for you. 8 Euros for this game is actually not enough, but I'm glad, that I got it at a low price anyway.I need to mention, that I'm a sucker for these kind of games. I mean anime girls and swords combined make an amazing game, for me. (I'm a weeaboo, I know, damn it).Never did I feel so weak in my life. Especially after the first damn chapter.			"

												Let me give it straight. This game isn't by any means amazing, but it is charming and fun. The gameplay is very repetetive, you have to kill all enemies in an area to advance during each level which can get boring, but where this game shines are its boss battles and story. Every boss has a unique way of fighting and they are very challenging fights so you feel very accomplished when beating them. The story is interesting enough and the dialouge might make you grin a little at times. Overall 7/10. If it is on sale, I highly recommend getting it.			"

												Well you and your sister set out to find the witch who cursed your sister and made her a fairy. The game is a simple hack and slash from zone to zone. The members of the town will ask you to go look for something in a cave or temple and you go running in. On the way you will battle multiple monsters that are not too difficult but can sometimes become overwhelming. Once you get into the dungeon you traverse to the lower or upper level and take on a large boss. Once completed you trudge back through the same enemies (respawn upon entering each area) over and over.The game is simple with decent graphics. The thing that will suck is the constant back and forth with creatures respawning each time you go through the area.Other than that, it is a decent game with no real downfalls and no groundbreaking gameplay.

The combat is simple but not TOO simple, there's enough thought put into it that you can't just mindlessly slash your way through this game, and you have to strategise your pickups. This game is very difficult - don't let the adorable characters and music drop your guard, it took me 7 tries to finally beat the 2nd boss, and 2 to beat the first! I have died several times on the levels leading up to the boss just due to the amount of stuff going on - this game feels like a PERFECT blend of shoot 'em up and brawler, because not only are you brawling and shooting, but you're always on your toes and dodging a constant barrage of spells being thrown by the enemies, meanwhile melee monsters like skeletons and... catapillars are giving it their all, this game is RELENTLESS.and I love it. If you see this game on sale for 5$, it's (in my opinion) and instant buy, and for 10 - there should only be a few moments of consideration.as for flaws, I don't see any. it plays decently enough on the keyboard, and I guess my mind just clicked with the camera controls (a common complaint) because I've had few problems with the camera after the first few minutes, but overall it works.

												For an Anime Style Single Player RPG, this game's fun. Works with controllers and the keyboard but the keyboard controls are kind of confusing.			"

												I am only recommending this game because of the price. This game is entertaining enough to be worth under 3 dollars, but dont expect too much. The combat feels pretty good, but just like everything else once the polish starts wearing off you are going to find this game is very repetitive. Anyways, I have enjoyed it so far			"

												This game doesn't seem like much at first but once you start playing, it's hard to stop. RPGs are my favorite genre and I keep coming back to this game because it's both challenging and fun.			"

												Chantelise is nice if you want to play a game with relatively simple combat but one that isn't easy. The hard part comes from the fact that your healing is very limited at the start, and even later on it's still pretty limited. But it's fun, the dialogue is funny at times, and it's very relaxing to play. Great for just wasting some time. Especially if you want to do the 60 floor dungeon. I think it was 60 floors, and it took like 3 hours to complete. You die, you start over from the begining. However when you do story mode then you only need to complete every area once, then the doors will open and if you die you can just run straight through to there room you were at. The bosses have some different mechanics, so it's not just ""punch it until it dies"". Also it has cute anime girls. What more could one need from a game?			"

												Bad camera angles.  The fact when you buy an item it doubles in price next time you buy it despite being the same item.  Have to grind in ways to get through it.  I wish I could give it a good review I LOVE recettear . . . but this one falls flat.  I'm uncertain I will even beat it for the story . . . which I kind of wanted to do and see if the two were connected more.  The fighting just is too annoying at times.			"

												It's not the best game in the Carpe Fulger (is that how it's spelled?) Collection but I really enjoyed the game play using different gems to cast different spells. It's a tough game with a hard to follow story and a handful of ""Really!?"" moments but keep an open mind and I'm sure you'll find it to be worth your time.			"

												This game is fun. When I was told it was like Darksouls, it peaked my interest. Not nearly as hard but it is quite difficult. One thing to remeber is SAVE SAVE SAVE. Got a full hour in with out saveing then died my first play through... UGGGGI reccomend useing a controler or rebinding the keyboard controls, cause the default ones make it feel almost as irritateing as the darksouls pc port controls.GET IT!!!			"

												Very enjoyable action RPG that had me reminiscing about the SEGA Saturn, Playstation, and PSP. Short enough to be enjoyable, long enough to not over stay its welcome Chantelise is a wonderful game to play over the course of a week.			"

												Chantelise takes you back to old school gaming and graphic wise too. You start your journey in a big open field and weak enemies. But the farther you go the harder it gets. The game is not EXP based but buying Items to get stronger. To this day I haven't beat this game no matter how hard I try or upgrade my HP. I only recoomend this game to old school gamers or Anime gamers. This game can run on a Windows 7 and below depending on your graphics card.			"

												It's your typical JRPG with a sad story. I love the concept that there are no ""levels"". I rarely needed to farm money for better equip, because it seems you always get the right amount needed for the next equipment. It does have a lot of glitches, but come on! That game was made back in 2006 (translated 2011), so don't expect super graphics and stuff. The bosses are not so easy if you don't know the strategy, but you'll figure it out soon enough. Oh and that hp bar sound... All in all, it was a great game and I definitely recommend it to anyone who liked Recettear.			"

												Luckily they left the original (Japanese) voice acting in place, which adds some extra info beyond the translations (which naturally do skip some sentences).			"
