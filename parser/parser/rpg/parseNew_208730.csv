												10 mins into the game = This sucks, still feel like I need to give it a chance.30 mins into the game = This combat- and movement system sucks, but the story is getting interesting.2 hours into the game = I don't care about the movement or the combat, the story is amazing.10 hours into the game = Where did the time go?21 hours and finished the game and you sit there with a feeling that this game was way better than you first expected, and if you really did finish it, you can't understand why it got below 70-75/100 metascore.Try to get passed the horrible movement system, and the lesser good combat system and you have a true gem of a game here. 7.5/10 in my opinion.

												I can recommend this game mostly for the plot and characters. THe writing is excelent, but everything else goes from anywhere between decent and weak. The graphics are sub-par, the music is forgettable and the voice acting goes from excelent (a couple of the actors in the series worked on this and deliver good performances) to mostly plain and laughable... Shame, since excelent acting would have helped the already excelent plot.Now the combat... the combat is like most tactical RPGs (think Dragon Age: Origins for example), but it gets pretty plain and repetitive quickly due to lack of characters to form different parties.Bottom line is... if you're looking for a good story, sure, get it for a decent price. Otherwise, there's other RPGs out there that do it better, be it graphics, gameplay, voice acting (and also have excelent stories to boot).			"

												I'm being completely honest when I say this. This would be an amazing game if it weren't for the absolutely garbage combat. Like it's really damn sad. There's this amazing world, all this lore that already exists, interesting story and characters. But the combat is just pathetic. I have no idea what the hell I'm even playing. It's like real time combat where you have to use action points like in the older Fallout games or Wasteland 2. EVERYTHING, but the combat, is amazing. But since the combat is such a vital part of the game I can't recommend Game of Thrones. I watched the entire show and read some of the books but story can only get you so far.It's a damn shame.			"

												This game was largely panned and I'm sure if you want to hear about what's wrong with it it won't be hard to find negative reviews, but this is all about why I loved this game.I heard going into this game that it had terrible gameplay but I actually found the combat system very engaging. For the most part it revolves around using special abilities to interrupt enemy attacks, keep them stun locked or provide power combos with status effects. Fighting one enemy at a time is quite a simple task but the game really shines in crowd control: Facing off against a room full of enemies you must be constantly mindful of all of them. One successful special attack against you can turn the tide of the battle drastically.There are two main characters and they can be spec'd very differently. Making one a tank and one a glass cannon results in some varied gameplay between chapters early on and once the two heroes join forces later in the game synergy between them can make clearing out rooms of soldiers both efficient and satisfying.I think the dialogue system is worth mentioning. Instead of simply stating what your character is going to say many dialogue options are presented as part of your characters inner thoughts and, giving you a slice of something familiar from reading the books. Some options are even just two parts of the same thought. ""I don't trust him..."" ""...but I have no choice"" are just so much more interesting as choices than ""refuse"" and ""accept"" and after a while I found myself reading them in the characters' voices. It's a very elegant implementation of an old fashioned system that shows that actual care and thought went into this game.Story is were the game really shines though. It's not on the same level as the A Song of Ice and Fire series proper (it suffers from some awkward and sometimes over-expositionary dialogue and poor to atrocious delivery by the actors) but it's a solid addition to the franchise and as video games go it's terrific.As already mentioned there are two main characters: Mors Westford is a sworn brother of the Night's Watch and a secret skinchanger. Alester Sarwyc is the heir of noble house who left Westeros to become a Red Priest. Their stories start off seemingly entirely separate but as the game progresses their stories begin to converge both as you learn the connections between their current situations and their past history together.Despite being old friends Alester and Mors are quite different from each other with motivations and world views that are very much at odds. Alester is quite pragmatic and willing to stoop as low as he needs to to reach his goals. Mors is more driven by a sense of justice but also a rage that is always bubbling under the surface. When the tensions between them come to a head it's one of the best moments in the game and the voice actors (particularly Mors's) actually manage to summon up some real emotion to their performances.The intrigue itself is complex and slowly revealed with many twists. These are twists of the good sort; they take you off guard when they happen, but once out in the air you'll slap yourself for not having seen it coming (though admittedly some are a bit obvious or otherwise cliche).There is some conflict with the source material (some of which can chalked up to gameplay necessities and some not) and there are a few moments where the story falls flat. But these are rare enough and stand out because they contrast the largely good writing. If this were a tie-in novella rather than a video game I would have been as glad to read it as I was happy to play this game (though I'd expect some the dialogue to be brushed up a bit and the body count drastically reduced).The game is a diamond in the rough but I would recommend that anyone who is a fan of the franchise and a fan of WRPGs should at least try it out. I'm sure many of you have it sitting in your library unplayed after the game's inclusion in a Humble Bundle.			"

												A great mature RPG. + Very good, tight, quite lengthy and powerful story (with a fair amount of twists and multiple endings)+ Interesting main and side characters+ Good (sometimes perhaps a little too strict) to very good voice acting (and plenty at that)+ Nicely written, believable dialogues (there are light dialogue trees too)+ Thick character and world lore (accessible to people new to GOT by codex/encyclopedia pages ingame)+ Nice music (composed by the TV show composer, it seems)+ For fans: Familiar places (King's Landing, The Wall, ...) and cameos (Joer Mormont and Varys have their looks and voices from the TV show)~ Combat can feel easy/underwhelming for perhaps 1/3 of the game. For some time I was wondering why I should care about what abilities to use even if it's always been fun to do so. Your character automatically attacks a random target or one you choose, with you moving him around if you will or by using active skills that use stamina or have a fixed cooldown. Sometimes my foes stood no chance even if I let my characters just do basic attacks. A few parts aren't winnable for story-reasons. I don't know anymore if you select a difficulty and which one I might have chosen. It got more interesting halfway through when I was able to utilize different skill sets and characters (usually two at a time) at a regular rate (it changes for many parts for story-reasons, which I am welcoming, it shouldn't subjugate to the gameplay mechanics, this game should be mainly about it's characters and the story and it is). ~ Character development/gear usage seems a little strict. Depending on your very first choices in the game your character is set on a rather narrow path regarding the weapons and armor he should use. This can be important later on because there is a ""rock, paper, scissors"" system in place that encourages you to use specific armor to counter specific enemies and, on the other hand, use specific gear to fight specific enemies. Upon leveling up you can put skill points in other, ""unusal"" weapon/armor areas but that's not very wise since it requires more points to get those up and you cannot use any skills for weapon sets unfamiliar to your class. So, for example if you choose a class using two-handed weapons and heavy armor in the beginning you will want to stick with just two-handed weapons and heavy armor for many parts even if you should loot or want to buy one-handed and lightly armored gear, and even if you should encounter enemies that use equipment that literally works like scissors to your paper-based gear. You can use everything at any time - but you won't be very effective. Around halfway through you can select a secondary class where things get truly interestings and where you can actually mix things up without feeling like being on a disadvantage.~ Should you get ideas to fight random mobs to level up unusual/inexperienced areas to redeem for the lacking bonuses/skills: That won't work. Because enemies aren't randomized. Cleared areas won't have enemies spawn unless the story wants to. Not even random brigands or wildlife or something. This can add to the immersion in some ways, for the very least makes post-combat exploration easier (the two main characters have special skills to find hidden objects) and there are plenty of enemies to fight and good numbers of quests to do before you reach the end of the game, and if you stick to the class and thus weapon/armor selections you made early on you'll probably have no serious problems getting through this game. But straying off from these pre-defined leveling paths may leave you very vulnerable later on with no other way to deal with it but bite yourself through it.~ Combat can be a little mess at times, particularily indoors with the camera not getting a good look on things. Not too dramatic since you have a pause button that almost freezes time when issuing commands, but still. The straightforward/head-on mechanics don't work well if you for example try to shoot someone with a bow from an elevated position as I tried in King's Landing. It would trigger a mass rush of all allied and hostile characters to clash into each other around several corners with my bowman having struggles to follow after. - Some more face models and clothing may not have hurt. The main and some special side characters aside most other characters can look a little generic, even if they are never really unfitting by looks or voice. It's not too dramatic but more often than not you'll see the pretty much same gown or rags on female characters, at times same faces even, and would have hard times to differ between some side characters if not for their varying names and voice actors. + That being said, those characters for which the devs had more love/time for really look nice and impressive, with scars and veins and freckles and such. Overall the game is nicely-looking and very immersive even if it won't sate the high-res texture junkies. And it has a clear and nice interface and runs very stable (thanks to the Unreal Engine, I guess) even if I had some odd mini-freezing when turning the camera around some places but that might be my relatively old system and not the game.

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Game of Thrones (The Role Playing Game) Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: RPG; Fantasy; Adventure; Third-Person; Story Rich My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 20-32 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Fans of the intellectual property; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseursREVIEWTake away the fact this game is tied into the intellectual property of A Song of Ice and Fire, and you will be left with a pretty damn good RPG.  If you like good RPGs, you will want to consider playing this, regardless of if you care about the Game of Thrones franchise or not.  That said, this game does a pretty good job of tying into the first book/season; so if you are a fan, it certainly adds to the experience and helps you appreciate the rich story in the game.There are several mechanics that contribute to the high quality of the game as an RPG.  You play as two characters, back and forth, each with separate stories that inevitably collide later in the game.  The game is very heavy on cutscenes and plot development, but it is done well and is generally pretty enjoyable.  There are dialogue trees you will explore during the many conversations in the game, being thorough and inquisitive will often reward you with items or little permanent trait boosts.  There are decisions to be made, which will have minor consequences (like extra rewards for quests from NPCs); there is also a major decision late-game and a few different endings.   There are active abilities you can use while exploring out of combat to discover secrets in the world.  The combat is active, but has a tactical-pause which can be utilized to issue specific commands and tactics to your character(s).  There are a handful of fighting styles you can pick from for each character, and you also get other party members that will have various styles which will spice up combat here and there.  There is definitely a good amount of substance, and it makes for a very enjoyable RPG experience.The story is enjoyable.  And for a game so story-driven it better be.  The plot of the game is a “sidequel” to the first book/season— that is to say: it takes place during the same time and in the same place, but follows a different set of characters/events.  I think the writers did a good job of creating an atmosphere pretty true to Game of Thrones.  If you are a fan of the books/show you will probably be intrigued by the story in this game.The game does have some flaws.  The graphics are not as great as they could have been.  The voice acting is mostly solid, but at times feels forced.  There is limited variety to gear/weapons, and the combat does get repetitive even though the fights are distanced with cutscenes.In summary, Game of Thrones is a very enjoyable RPG.  It does have some flaws, and may drag at times, but seems to be well made (no bugs/crashing) and tells a good story.   It has plenty to offer for fans of RPGs, and if you are a fan of the books/shows you will enjoy that added bonus.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Do you like games with great dark stories, memorable characters and awesome quests. If yes, then it is a no-brainer that you will like this game big time. It is also heavily underrated, so this one is a hidden gem. While it has some cheap mistakes, this game still deserves your attention. The STORY[10/10] is one of the best I've ever known and I red a lot, seen a lot of movies, so yeah it's quite something. There are two protagonists: Mors Westford, who is an honorable man in the Night Watch and a mounstruos beast in combat. He has a dark past, lives in a cold place; you could say he's iron made. Also, he's a skinchanger, being able to control his hound. The other one, Alester Sarwyck, a Red Priest who can manipulate fire, who comes back to claim his title and land as a lord, now being ready to face the world he fled from. The villian is the evil-cunning-great fighter type, whom you'll want to kill the moment you see. Every key character ends being involved in the Game of Thrones, so things get brutal and the happy ending... up for debate.There are many sidequests that enhance the story and reward you with cool items(and experience). The GRAPHICS[6.8/10] look outdated, but maxed out looks nice, and the artstyle is attractive. The real problem is reusing models, which means sometimes you'll have triplets in a cutscene. The main characters and all the places are unique, though, so work and clever thinking was used in the design as well. Such a shame it doesn't use better technologies, would have been a lot better for a lot more people.COMBAT[8.9/10] is made as tactical, but as you'll progress in unlocking stronger abilities, you'll synergize with the battlefied, emerging victorious, without much thinking. Finishers depend on the class and weapons used, and both differ greatly from what you have at your disposal. I enjoyed combat and class exclusive abilities that I have a reason to replay the game. The downer here is the difficulty, if you play on Lord you might be stressed a lot, and that can happen on Knight too. Best you choose the Squire, since there is no achievment affected by the difficulty. All in all, it's a great RPG with high replayability value. Don't listen to the bad reviews, because those reviewers didn't even finish the game. It gets better and better as you play, so giving up on it is a bad decision. If you've watched the show you should check it out; if you've red the books, you should own it; if you're new to the series but like RPG's, the same for the book readers(if it's on sale, after all it's your risk).GAME SCORE[8.5/10]			"

												I tried hard to enjoy the game, to me this felt more like a $5 game not a $20 game.  The game has some good ideas and potential but if felt like once everything started to come together it just ended.  Now I have never watched the game of thrones so my review is going to be purely based off of the game play.  I got over small things like the camera angle being horrible and your actions not really effecting the outcome of anything.  The game is very restrictive and you will follow a  certain path no matter how you choose to play your character.   Combat:The combat is a turn based/real time format.  It was very fun and I would recommend watching a youtube video to get an idea of what I mean.Skills:The game does a good job of explaining these but you will learn that if you spend your skill points on certain skills you have wasted them.  The biggest of these being the one that effects your buying/selling skill. I invested most of my skill points on this skill and then a few hours in I realized there was no way I would ever be able to buy any of the gear so I would never use this skill. (at least not until the end of the game, and at that point you'll start to get so much money you could buy everything twice)    Economy/Gear:Do not plan on doing anything with buying/selling.  You will never have enough money to buy better gear until the very end of the game.  At that point it becomes completely rediculas and money is basically being thrown at you.  Just plan on looting and wearing that gear.  Why I'm NOT recommending:The biggest things that made me decide to not recommend the game is that you put all this time into developing your characters skills, finally get enough money to buy some decent equipment, and then the game just ends.  I was left going why did I waste all that time planning and training up?  I should have just sprinted through the game play and listened to the story.  Also once the story ends your done, there is no going back and replaying things your just finished.      Conclusion:If you just want a story this might be your game.  Do not spend to much time planning out your skill tree's or traits or anything else about your character because in the end you will never get to use your thought out plan.  Play this game to just hear the story and nothing more.  I personally didn't find the story all that amazing but that does not mean you wont.  If you buy this game set the difficulty to easy and just sit back and enjoy the story.  Thank you for reading my post, I hope this helps you to decide if this game is worth it for you.  Either way enjoy your gaming.   "

												Without viewing any sort significant gameplay or information before starting the Game of Thrones it became quite an unexpected surprise. If you have a soft spot for these sort of games then I believe this one deserve a humble chance. You will play as two very different characters in different time frames until you reach a point where they will meet in the story. The game offers you a lot of content to read and if you are a fan of the Books or the TV show this will be something you will simply should keep on your radar. There is a vast amount of Lore regarding the cities and the people who live in them, the religion or their beliefs as well, the characters and the different house banners and so on. There is a lot of talk so I found this game to be very relaxing to play in a nice session after a long, tiresome day. You answer the questions by choosing one of the possible outcomes and they are written in first person. From the main quests to the secondary ones you will be faced with some choices to be made. Some will decide the faith of people, others will let you seek revenge or prove that you are merciful and fair. Expect to be a lot of political games where even when trust is earned you should always suspect everyone, after all, everyone wants their share of wealth. I did some of the secondary quests but not all them. They are mostly focused in side stories and are not boring at all as opposed to those fetch quests where you need to gather ingredients or something similar. Usually, it’s about someone needing help, recruiting members to the Wall, see why someone did something or seek more information that can be useful for you in the future.The main story is divided in Chapters which offers a great time frame if you just want to play bit here and there. You can start a chapter and be done with it, get some rest and on the next day advance a bit more. I admit that as I was advancing in the game I got surprised more than once for the outcomes I was facing. This is Game of Thrones so you should always expecting deaths from those you love or care while playing the game. Trust no one and remember to not follow only your heart as you might be betrayed for being too gentle. The combat is slower than any other similar RPG but it can be tactic as well during combat you can open your Abilities wheel and select what moves or skills you want to do. The game won’t fully stop but you will enter in a very slow motion giving you time to make the best strategy for your enemies. Different weapons are good or bad depending on what sort of armor your enemy is wearing. A heavy armor is resistant to swords since it can’t be pierced but are weaker to blunt weapons so pay attention to this in order to end the combat quicker. The way healing works is also very creative in my opinion. You can get some flasks but they will be empty. Then, you will have to go to a store who sell potions in order to fill them with what you desire. You can fill them with poison, oil in order to burn your enemies and other healing herbs and medicine like the famous milk of the poppy. You can replace already filled bottles with other things if you desire. This is crucial for some harder fights and will help you in the long run.The voice acting however is very poor, especially in the sad or dramatic scenes. During certain critical events I really tried to let myself get immersed by the things that were happening but the poor voice acting broke the immersion I was trying to achieve. That often used moment of “Noooooo!” is rather embarrassing and anger, sadness or fury moments are not strong enough to make some scenes more believable. It’s a shame because a game with such emphasis on story elements you really want to feel the tension you witness when watching the TV series or when reading the books but I’m afraid that sometimes this simply won’t do. You will notice some voices from the show like Varys the Spider but even with familiar voices, as soon other characters start to talk in a more emotional sense it won’t feel immersive. As for the normal and non-emotional conversations I believe it’s more than doable. The visuals are also nothing to be amazed but this did not bother me at all. I played the game at 1080p and while it’s nothing to be stunned about I noticed some really nice details like when you are carrying a shield in your back and you see the scratches in it or the reflections of the sun in that golden lion shield from the Lannisters. While this is not a game to be played for the visuals I also saw my fair share of people trespassing doors, my dog getting his head between the iron of gates and other small glitches. Nothing game breaking, you just see that it’s something that could have been more polished. Because it’s in the deep of the lore that you will find the bigger satisfaction I ended up ignoring these small technical issues and I focused on my decisions, the stories and most of all, the outcomes based on what I said or done.If you are a fan of the theme then I believe this game deservers a fair chance. It took me around 20 hours to finish (one of) the endings and I know there’s some replay value if you wish to see a different ending in the last couple of chapters.   "

												This game was tragically under estimated from the moment it was released. Once you get through the introduction and preface scenes in the beginning of the game you are no longer playing as a character in some game but you feel as if you are transformed into the main characters and you forget that you are playing a video game. Someone obviously ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the cornflakes of all of the major game reviewers right before they gave their opinions of this game. It was blantantly obvious they did not play more than 30 minutes of the actual game and the rest of the drivel they wrote came from the pamphlet that was inserted into the box. The little bit of the game they did play, it was quite clear that they were not paying attention to the story being unfolded or the characters they were playing because all they could do was complain about the graphics art not being up to their ""standards"" and how the combat system took actual strategy and forethought in order to win a battle.The story line itself was captivating and full of constant twists and turns. Nothing was as it appeared to be throughout the entire gaming experience and by the time you reach the end you are blown away because NO ONE saw that ending coming. Unlike many rpgs out there that try to create the illusion that you are making the decisions for your character that matter in the world around you, this game actually does make all of your choices have consequences. Sometimes they are immediately revealed and other decisions that you thought were trivial end up drastically changing major plot lines throughout the game. While it is a colossal cliche it applies to this game whole-heartedly, ""I laughed, I cried, it became a part of me.""I highly recommend this game to anyone that deeply enjoys real rpgs and is starving for orginality and complete immersion into the rpgs they play. While this game was not on the same financial budget as say Skyrim, it is a testament to the developers of this game that they spent all of their energy and money into making a quality game that surpasses any of the blockbuster games that have been released in the last couple of years.

												3rd person, action, adventure, RPG that follows closely to the storyline of George R. R. Martin's - ""Game of Thrones"" books. If you read the books or watched the TV series of ""Game of Thrones"", then you might enjoy it more than those who will go into it blindly, because you will miss the whole story surrounding this fantasy world. Story takes place in the timeline of 1st ""Game of Thrones"" book.To not spoil the story, I will only state that characters you play as are not in the books, nor TV show and are made up, but game itself follows the books. You will also hear about and meet many well known characters that appear in the books / TV show.Moving forward on to the actual game, story is strong, with A LOT of dialogues and choices that will reward or punish you, depending on what you chose. Voice acting is great and includes some voices from the TV show, but not many. You can chose character stats, skills and preferred fighting style, be it shield and 1 hand, two 1 hand, 2 hand or ranged weapons, basically your generic yet somewhat limited RPG.Gameplay is tactical and static, you often just stay in one spot swinging weapon and using skills, then after you kill someone, you automatically run to next enemy, etc.. Combat reminds me the Dragon Age series. Visually game is nothing impressive and has a lot of low resolution / blurry textures, basic level design and good share of loading screens inside one location.Personally for me, the story was the strong point here and if you do side quests and explore you are looking somewhere around 20-30 hours of gameplay, depending on your difficulty level and dedication.

												Honestly, some might call this game outdated, clunky, riding off the success of the books and shows...but I for one was extremely satisfied. Whatever flaws the game may possess was completely made up for by the compelling and gritty as ♥♥♥♥ story. You cannot help but really feel for the two protaganists...and cringe at the consequences of their actions. This is definitely worth a play through and I reccomend this title to anyone who enjoys a captivating story.			"

												This game was surprising fun to play. Admittedly the first few hours of the game were boring, and i was close to quitting a few times (the only reason i didn't was because i was being stubborn), but after getting about half way in, i found myself actually having fun. That isn't to say that this is a good game, it is more of a enjoyable bad game. I know how odd that sounds, and i don't fully understand it myself, but for some reason i eventually got invested in the characters and wanted to know what was going to happen next to them. The gameplay itself is average, but the story is nice. Mainly since the game does let you make choices that affect the story(which am a sucker for). Now with all this being said, I can't honestly recommend this game to anyone else. I just felt it should be noted that the game isn't horrible, but it isn't good either.			"

Pros* An expertly crafted story with lots of twists and turns.* All choices have consequences in typical Game of Thrones fashion.* Familiar places visited such as Castle Black, The Red Keep, & King's Landing.* Solid voice acting.* Excellent lore, and background story. It is Game of Thrones after all.* Outstanding musical performance.* A story that draws you in very quickly, and keeps you invested from around maybe an hour in to the very end.Cons* The combat. There's no getting around it being poorly designed.* The camera is too zoomed in.* Graphics didn't age particularly well.* The stats and (perhaps especially) skill system aren't well explained, making it easy to make mistakes with the selections.What you should knowYou can turn the combat difficulty down to easy if you find it too horrible (and let's face it, it is). That makes it bearable enough so that you can just focus on the story.ReviewThe game starts out quite bland, and I was quickly turned off by the quirky gameplay, and the truly bad combat. It wasn't more than 15 minutes before I had my first urge to quit and just write it off as a mistake. However, I stuck with it for a while, and after an hour had come and gone, the annoyance had lessened as the story drew me in a bit more, and so I decided to play on for a while longer before making any final decisions on whether to continue or quit altogether. After 2 hours the story had drawn me in to such a degree that the combat no longer annoyed or even irritated me enough for it to matter. 26½ game hours later, and I'm done with what was an outstanding experience with a downright fantastic story.Speaking of the story, it's split between 2 people. It starts with you playing as Mors - a former noble knight who took the black and is now a 15 year veteran of the Night's Watch - who receives a letter from the Hand of the King asking him to track down a woman hiding in a nearby town, and hand her over to a knight who accompanies you on this mission for further safekeeping. There is no more information than that, but you soon find out that all is not as it seems, and you're left fighting for your very life while trying to protect this mysterious woman. When we aren't busy fighting for our survival as Mors, we follow the story of Alester. A nobleman of a lesser house, who upon returning to Westeros after his 14 years self-imposed exile find that things haven't exactly turned out well for the house since he left. On top of that his family has not yet forgiven him for leaving all those years ago, and in fact, they all blame him for the death of his father, as he was never the same after he left. It is not made easier by the fact that Alester also turned away from the common Westeros religion known as the Faith of the Seven, and is  now a devoted Red Priest (like Lady Melisandre from the books/series) worshipping R'hllor, the Lord of Light.You soon discover your house is in dire straits, and it's up to you to save it from ruin, and so in typical Game of Thrones fashion you become a pawn of the greater powers while you scramble to reclaim your house, and save your sister from having to marry your psychopatic half-brother in order to retain the family name and land.The game does a very nice job of splitting off the story into segments where half the time you'll be dealing with problems seen from the perspective of a lowly soldier, and the other half you'll be trying to survive the political maneuvering of the noble houses, which is just as deadly.The two stories inevitably collide, and we end up following our pair of heroes as they try to survive and protect those they hold dear. Along the way you'll meet a few familiar people, should you have read the books, or seen the series, such as Cersei Lannister (The Queen), Lord Varys (The Spymaster), and Joer Mormont (The Lord Commander) who you'll recognize as the faces are skinned after the actors playing them in the series, and they've lent their talented voices to the game as well. However, you won't be lost at any time should you not have seen the show or read the books, as the story takes place starting around half a year prior to the start of the books/series, so the story is quite original but does tie in quite beautifully with the story we know.When you're not fighting for your life, you're left to explore locations as they open up, and during this exploration part of the game, Alester has you utilizing his special priestly powers to find hidden objects, doors, and loot, while Mors, being a  skinchanger, can slip into the mind of your dog and track smells, explore hidden areas, and even sneak up on enemies and kill them by ripping open their throats to avoid combat. The dog is also very useful in combat, where it can do everything from disarming an opponent to scaring them, and giving you extra stamina regeneration. Both characters have unique fighting styles, with Mors being more of a traditional type of fighter, and Alester potentially being a formidible water dancer (like Syrio Forel from the books/series) who doesn't need heavy armor to stay alive, but instead relies on his ability to dodge while augmenting his offensive capabilities by calling on his priestly powers of fire to wreak some real havoc and set enemies ablaze. Personal NotesThis game ended up being such a pleasant surprise for me. It has an incredibly well crafted story, and yet some of the weakest gameplay to support it, with combat being just plain bad. Yet none of that matters, because the story all makes up for it. I bought this game almost exactly a year ago from this review, and it is just one of those games that I always found excuses not to play it, and so it just sat there for a year. However, I gave it a shot a few days ago, and it was one of the most engrossing games I've played in recent times, and now that it's over I find myself a little sad that there's no sequel. I thoroughly recommend this game if you want to play something with a strong story, and you're willing to ""suffer"" through not so great gameplay for a while. You won't regret it.			"

												After reading a couple of reviews of this game, I didn't have high hopes. But I don't agree with most of them so it seems!The story is amazing, especially if you're a big fan of the books and tv-serie. You'll recognize a couple of people in-game (Jeor Mormont, Varys the Spider, Cersei Lannister) and people (NPCs) are talking about other characters of the books around you when you walk through the world.You play with two characters at once, you'll switch between the two characters every chapter, like in the books. Mors Westford is a knight of the Night's Watch and Alester Sarwyck is a Red Priest of R'hllor who is returning home (Riverspring). The two stories come together in one of the chapters and you'll play with them at the same time (you can switch between characters in the gameplay).You can upgrade skills (different types of swords and armor), special powers (Light of R'hllor and Skinchanger), attributes (like intelligence, strength, agility) and choose different perks.The gameplay took some time to get used to. The thing that bothered me the most is that you use the right mousebutton constantly throughout the whole game; to press it all the time to move the camera was kinda weird.Also the combat system needs some time to get used to. It's kinda turn based. You choose some actions/perks in a row of actionslots (three) and hope to counteract the things your enemy does. It gets pretty hectic sometimes when you got 5 or 6 enemies against you and two characters to command with actions for both to think of. But after a while it gets pretty easy if you get the hang of it, big fights become easy if you know which enemies to take out first and which action counteracts their actions (Interrupt, area damage) and which weapon is best against their armor.You have an huge endless inventory, where you can choose the right armor and right weapons and right potions/poisons for you, or sell and buy new ones at the different merchants found in the major cities.Lots of sidequests, lots of places to look for loot, just a couple of bugs which are easily resolved by restarting the game.In my opinion a 7.5 out of 10. Maybe not worth the full amount, but great to get on Sale.Took me about 28 hours to finish (with a lot of just standing around and listening to people around me and looking for loot). If you love games with a good story, get it!			"

												I'm a huge fan of the Song of Ice and Fire series. I've watched the TV Show, and I'm currently reading the books; and I find this game completely amazing. Despite of the inadequate graphical designing, the game is still decent and worth playing. The extremely rich story is what's keeping me into it. I highly recommend this to every Song of Ice and Fire's fan, as it's really delightful and amazing to be able to walk around Castle Black and/or Westeros freely.			"

												Game Of Thrones uses the same combat mechanic and presentation of pretty much all of the recent Cyanide Games games. So there's the slowdown ability for you to take strategic decisions in combat, and you (usually) have two characters that you control. One is focused on crowd control and healing, one is focused on one-on-one fights and stealth. And all of this is set in the Game Of Thrones universe, which I like very, very much. There are (side)quests to finish, secrets to find, people to fight, all the while following two interesting stories that come together near the end of the game, which should take you 15-20 hours if you play normally. If you rush it's a few hours less, about 12-15 hours.The graphics are good, faces are a bit messed up and out of date though, and same of the environments lack finer detail and variety. However, the atmosphere is accurate.The voice acting is mostly solid. I heard a few sentences here and there that were spoken without any passion. Nothing major, but it did detract from the experience a bit. The music, on the other hand, is excellent.Game Of Thrones is a good game, that could've been much, much better with a little extra work and polish. If you don't know Game Of Thrones then I suggest you skip the game (but you will miss out on the better stories, mind you), otherwise give it a try. You probably won't be disappointed, but let's see what Telltale Games will come up with first. I have high hopes for their game.[Rating: 75/100]			"

												I bought this by accident trying to buy the telltale game of thrones game - I would never have bought it otherwise because it looks like a piece of generic rpg merchandise crap - HOWEVER I am very happy I made this mistake and, after buying the telltale one, I think I actually enjoyed this more... which is saying a lot. The story is as good if not better than the telltale version and they got the feel of game of thrones perfectly. The characters are worthy of the show and the voice acting, especially for Mors (one of the two characters you play as) is fantastic. There are one or two inspiringly bad voice actors who play multiple generic poor people or just have terrible northern accents which can be very annoying- but you can skip through that dialogue just reading the subtitles and sometimes it's funny. The combat is very dated and basically bad, but the fighting styles and powers you can get are very cool - things like poisoning your blade before battle, the fact you can be a water dancer like syrio forel and take out like six people using a rapier and Mors' being able to set his dog on people all make up for it I think. The story is fantastic and very unpredictable, as well as being tied in very nicely with plot of season 1 game of thrones without relying too much on it.It looks really bad but it really isn't at all.

												The gameplay leaves much to be desired. The combat is weak, items sometimes unequip themselves (though, this might just be for me), and other mechanics seem rushed or juvenile in application.All this being said, the story is worth playing for. I found myself really engaged in the characters and the story. As well, I really enjoyed finding the Codex entries (lore and background information from Westeros). I recommend it for those who enjoyed the books. If you haven't read them, don't waste your time with this game and check those out. At least in reading the book you don't have to deal with the poor design of game mechanics.			"

												This is one of the best story driven RPGs I played in the last few years.  The story is just tremendous, and you play different character roles with different stories until later in the game when both stories mesh and things become hectic and shocking just like the HBO series.There are still those who complain about the combat or camera, and I found the combat to be fun and somewhat challenging, although based on what you'd see in a console action RPG.I was very pleased with this game.  The only story driven game(s) I feel are greater than this game is The Witcher series and possibly Dragon Age, but it is extremely close.			"

												This game has one of the best stories I've ever played and enjoyed. Admittedly, the combat system is clunky and the RPG mechanics seem tacked-on and shallow. But I hardly noticed it as I followed the story. A story of two different people, two different perspectives, and a merging point that would hit you right in the gut.The last final minutes with the two main protagonists were the most epic. Finishing this game is like finishing a good book. A book that you, the gamer, helped write. And when you close it, you just shake your head and smile. Wow. Just wow.			"

												I'm not gonna lie to you, this isn't a very good game. The combat system by itself is good, but it gets very repetitive, the graphics aren't that great, the voice acting is mostly rubbish(except for the cast from the show, having Varys as the narrator is awesome), the music is entirely lifted from the show (which you would think would be a good thing, but it seems like they picked the dullest and least epic tracks out of the soundtrack) and the lack of production values REALLY shows over the course of the entire game. So, why am I reccomending it? Because while the game is indeed flawed, the narrative itself is actually quite interesting. It follows the stories of two different characters with their own set of abilities and personalities, and you slowly unveil a conspiracy. There's betrayal, backstabbing, lies, all the good stuff. However, let me tell you, this game starts out slow. Only about half-way through does it get good, and even then it's mostly because of the narrative and not because of the gameplay itself, which really gets repetitive at this point. Despite all this, this game is a bit of a cult favourite of mine, as the things the game does well are done really well. However, you need to be quite forgiving to be able to enjoy this game, so buy at your own risk.			"

												You’ve got to hand it to Cyanide, the French developers certainly know how to secure a popular license. First they wrangled the rights to make a series of Blood Bowl titles, even after the notoriously protective Games Workshop launched a lawsuit over Chaos League; and then they somehow wound up with Game of Thrones.Placing such a huge property in the hands of a relatively small developer comes with its attendant problems. A lack of budget afflicts this third-person RPG like a creeping malady, working its way into almost every aspect of presentation  and eating away at the positive work being done elsewhere. But while a larger developer with big-money backing might have ramped up the spectacle, their natural inclination towards more conservative storytelling may have resulted in a more straightforward tale than the one presented here.Game of Thrones has several problems as a game, but its major strength is a story that largely succeeds in interweaving with George RR Martin’s established narrative while not overstepping its boundaries or drifting into awkward fan-fiction territory. Its plot runs parallel to the events in the first book of the series and HBO’s opening TV season, so it’s fairly important that you’ve read or watched at least one of those. If not, the endless scheming and counter-scheming of powerful medieval-fantasy Houses could be a touch on the confusing side.Cyanide’s Game of Thrones introduces two new characters who pursue goals that are ‘off camera’ for the books and series (though a few established faces; Queen Cersei, Lord Varys and Jeor Mormont do show up). Both of these newcomers fought for the Lannisters in Robert’s Rebellion against King Aerys II and both now find themselves in circumstances quite different from feudal military service. Mors Westford is a grizzled old crow of the Night’s Watch, while Alester Sarywck is returning to his birthplace in Riverspring as a Red Priest.These two are an unusual pair for a videogame; older, morally compromised men with a rigid honour code (Mors) and a new-found religious enthusiasm bordering on the fanatical (Alester). For a little over half the game you alternate between playing as Mors or Alester, before the pair meet up for the concluding chapters of the tale. This interchange is handled well and works as a structural device in-keeping with Martin’s ‘point of view’ chapters in his books.In another unusual step for the videogame narrative, these two ‘heroes’ have very different aims and ambitions. As do the two main antagonists, whose mendacious plotting and back-stabbing is for contrasting ends. Again, this is just as it should be for a series which prides itself on ethical grey areas and the pragmatic demands of power.Unfortunately, this robust story rope is frayed to near breaking point by some abysmal voice acting and uninspired level design.Our two protagonists are not really to blame, nor are the HBO guest voices; but the supporting cast bring a collection of performances ranging from flat to borderline unlistenable. That includes an ill-advised, in-jokey appearance by George RR Martin himself.Weak deliveries, misplaced emphasis and terrible, wandering accents are just some of the delights the cast of Game of Thrones has in store for you. If it weren’t for the halfway decent talents of the main pair and Varys’ splendid cameo appearances, I’d have recommended simply muting the voices altogether. It doesn’t help any of the actors that the lines appear bereft of any kind of post-production Foley treatment. These are the sounds which add convincing background effects when a character is, say, stood in a snowstorm versus inside an echoing castle hall. Here, no matter what the circumstances, everyone sounds like they’re inside a cozy sound studio.This poor voice acting undersells some reasonable dialogue and gives the story a cheap, unconvincing feel that it doesn’t really deserve.The cramped level design works for areas like Castle Black or the Sarywck seat of Riverspring, but fans of the series will probably have a hard time believing that the city of Kings Landing outside the Red Keep consists of about five merchants and roughly the same number of streets. None of these iconic places are really done justice by the developer’s less than impressive use of the Unreal Engine 3. For a series with so many worthy sights to offer, far too much time is spent in boring, dank underground tunnels.When not wandering around narrow streets, playing voice-acting Russian roulette, or warging into Mors’ dog for some scent-chasing pseudo stealth sections, your time will be spent in combat with the various Wildlings, sell-swords and Knights who populate the realm.The combat system owes a fair bit to older PC-centric RPGs where pausing the action and issuing orders was the norm. Here, time just slows to a crawl rather than pausing outright, but the process of assessing your situation and queuing up relevant skills remains just the same. Mors’ and Alester’s skills are class-dependant (you choose one of three classes for each character at the start) but every path can deal out useful debuffs along the lines of ‘immobilised’, ‘stunned’ and, best of all, ‘on fire’. Each armour type also has a weakness to a certain type of weapon, so it’s worth paying attention to that when fashioning your tactical plan. Finally, a limited number of flasks can be filled with various concoctions to aid your characters or hinder your foes.It’s a sturdy system, offering just enough tactical fluidity and challenge to force you into thinking your way through each encounter. The actual animations which play out with each skill are fairly wonky and awkward, but the intent is there and the combat succeeds in finding an interesting compromise between real-time and turn-based approaches. It’s not quite revolutionary or deep enough to remain interesting for all 25 hours of the campaign, as you hack through rank after rank of increasingly familiar men-at-arms, but new abilities (obtained through levelling up your characters) keep things fresh for longer than might be expected.There are no dramatic branches to the storyline (at least until the finale), but choices you make throughout the chapters do tend to be reflected in dialogue or little set-pieces later on. Help a chap out of jail, and his gang might lend their support to you. Imprison some rioters in your dungeons and they’ll still be there later on. My only gripe with the narrative pacing is that it all begins to go wrong slightly towards the end, when Mors and Alester can suddenly fast-travel between locations in the North and South. This feels especially silly when you’re presented with  a couple of side-quests many miles away from your supposedly urgent, time-sensitive mission and are able to complete them as if nothing is amiss.PC users should be warned that the game offers only the sparsest of graphics options, so delving into the config files to whip the Unreal Engine 3 into a shape of your liking is pretty much mandatory. Like everything else about this game, you have to put up with an unpalatable surface to get the best out of it.There’s no denying that Game of Thrones will test your tolerance. There are so many negative idiosyncrasies and cost-cutting measures in place that you’ll probably start to wonder when the game will just fall part entirely. But it never actually does. In fact, it stays on course to deliver a compelling parallel narrative to the opening book and HBO series, with characters as morally ambiguous and events just as horrific as any from Martin’s pages. Overall 7/10.			"

												Pros:+ It's a Game of Thrones game!+ ""Old school"" combat will appeal to some+ The few HBO contributors do well in regards to voice acting+ Story is solidCons:- Graphically looks like it's from 2003 (textures, lighting, animations, etc)- Control scheme doesn't feel right- Most of the voice-acting is terrible- So actively distanced from the canon it feels more fan fiction than it shouldThe Bottom LineWith HBO's brilliant television adaptation skyrocketing George Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire saga to the forefront of pop culture we were undoubtably going to see ventures into the realm of interactive media. Martin's world is incredibly ripe for all kinds of game genres but one of the most obvious is certainly the RPG - enter ""Game of Thrones: The Role Playing Game"". Unfortunately GoT is lacking in quite a few places. While the storyline is fairly on par with what you'd expect from the novels Cyanide Studios chose to create a game that looks and feels like it should've belonged in 2003. The combat is more or less the same model found in KOTOR, the graphics and visual design are severely lacking polish and modern standards, and the voice acting (aside from the contributors from the HBO series) is laughable at best. Overall the game has an interesting story to tell if you can stomach through it's many shortcomings. I'd only advise a purchase if you're waist deep in the GoT craze.5 dragons out of 10			"

Recommended for fans (if it's on sale)""Expectations are a dangerous thing. They cloud our minds with bias and wishful thinking, reality mostly struggles to fulfill."" - A chev. mediumForeword: I didn't read the books yet, because it mostly wouldn't be healthy to do so and watch the show the same time. First you'd of course spoiler yourself, second you'd be unsatisfied with script author's decisions, as usual. But no matter if you're a fan of the show or of the books, it's just happening in Westeros with the famous characters near you. Yet, there's a bitter truth about this game: Not everything that shines is gold.As there were rumors about this in reviews lately, I decided to clean up some misinterpretations... Let's see what's truly going on with this title:___________________________________________- About: ""There seem to be no promised show characters!""There are definitely characters from the show and you come them as close as you do in Telltale's GoT, while here you have the comfort, that it's not just english language support, plus synchronization from the show.Example without big spoiler: Lord Varys, who also speaks the intro sequence you get to see when launching a new game. And that's just one of them.___________________________________________- About: ""Really bad fighting""Controls and Gameplay are nearly the same like in Dragon Age then. If you didn't like that one's combat system you will hate this, because it's kinda unhandy and I struggeled myself to get used to it. But as soon as you know, it's no ""Mount & Blade""-, ""Devil May Cry""- or Hack'n'slay-gameplay style, there's no Yes it's old, or ""outdated"" by now, (remember, it's from 2010 meanwhile) but Gothic also is and both are still great RPGs. I also found myself being unable to replay Elder Scrolls: Morrowind, because nowadays we're so flashed by few really great RPG's (Witcher, Fallout, TES:Skyrim, ...) entertainment span, that some old classics has became too uncomfortable for us to play anymore.___________________________________________- About: ""Story bad, gameplay bad, overall bad""Depends on someone's taste. Some ppl like tea with cherry cake, but is it a bad mix, because more ppl love coffee with strawberry cake?/Story (Staying vague intentionally to avoid twists and spoilers.)The story is definitely not ""bad"", it's kinda how you would expect it from the show. You don't play any superhero or a famous character from the show. It's like the Foresters are in Telltale's GoT Adventure. A small Family(house) that serves the greater houses like Lannisters or the Starks. Two stories about two men, who have some things in common, like the Lannisters as their liege lords and things to regret in their past. A thing players more and more seem to forget, while getting fed with ""better games"" where you are mostly in a superior position or have advantages against the AI: Modesty.Why? Well, for a game, set in the GoT world for me it's important to keep our feet firmly on the ground, because even it's a low fantasy setting, it must maintain a balance of power, else it becomes implausible to the show's logic./GameplayUnhandy, but you can get used to it.Let's have a little comparison: Did you play Dark Souls? Well, I'm a convinced keyboard player, (because I wouldn't have bought a good PC if I still wanna play with any gamepad) and thus playing this 3rd person game without a gamepad is one ugly hell of character control, which is bound to a poorly/boring programmed combat system & therefore a no-go-game for me. It was a ""Prepare to die""-Edition because of a control setup rage attack ;) But ppl loved it, so it seems not too painful to get used to a lesser impossible control setup, I would assume.Of course that claim: ""Spectacular and tactical challenging combats"" (re-translated from description) would be more true, if you cross out the ""spectacular"", but that's artist's freedom in advertising, isn't it.../OverallThere has been a lot of potential to make this game really epic, there's nothing to say against this charge, but it could've also been much worse, like GoT Genesis, which is hardly hitting the world's edge, while it doesn't really feel like being involved in Westeros. It feels like a mod for a strategy game which has Dragons and a world map, just painted in GoT colors. So it's no endless game, but if you can accept its weaknesses once and for all you might actually start to enjoy the story. You won't be flashed, since this game is not even near the scale ""perfect"", but you could get entertained.___________________________________________- About: ""Voice acting is awful""I don't know how entirely how it is in english, because I take the chance to change the language to my native, as there's the rare spread option for it. For me it's like: ""You'll never experience things the same intense level, as you would in the language you're usually dreaming in.""But after I played the DLC(untranslated) it seems like the voice acting problems are in both languages quite similar, so I think, it's been treated a bit shabby, but at least they managed it to have voice acting in more than one language and that's a plus for non-native english ppl.Other examples for poor (translated) voice acting performance: ""Mass Effect 1""___________________________________________- About: ""The game is linear""If you read ""linear"" and think of a timeline that progresses, then =true.Else: If you think ""linear"" means that decisions doesn't have consequences than it's simply false.Nowhere this game is listed as ""open world"" so I don't know where expectations here turned wrong... If you don't have an open world, you always have a red line. The entire Mass Effect- and partially Dragon Age-Saga(DA:Inquisition excluded) use that progress principles. The only difference in that critic point is, that both Bioware franchises offer the option to make sidequests in an individual order.Conclusion/Advice:Buy it when it's on sale, open your mind and you'll experience an semi-retro, tactical RPG you won't regret.I played it, as it has been released then and not a long time ago I re-installed it again to take one of the rare story driven, RPG journeys in Westeros. So there's a way to play it longer than 30 minutes, if you can overcome your nowaday's expectations and enjoy the way instead of racing for the finish line ;)			"

Game of Thrones - The Role-playing GameGame of Thrones is story driven role playing game set into action of the first season of a highly praised television series of the same name (or the novel by George R.R. Martin) If you are not familiar with neither the book nor the series, despair not. The game still offers an immersive story and enjoyable gameplay for you. Maybe it even sparks interest of yours to discover why it is so popular and give a chance to either the book or the series or even both.PrologThe game starts on the northern part of the Seven kingdoms located on the continent called Westeros. On this very place the continent is divided by the 700 feet high wall built 8000 years ago and guarded by an antient order called Night's Watch. The first hero is Ser Mors Westford sworn brother of this order, a ranger able to track almost anyone with a help of his dog. One day a letter arrives with a special request for Mors about protecting a woman sent north. No reason just this, the letter was sent by an old friend of his and arrived with a bunch of soldiers dedicated to find her. Something is not right here and Mors was allowed to go for that girl and find out what is that all about.The another character is a former southern nobleman Alester Sarwick who just arrived home for his father's funeral. After 15 years in exile in Essos, where he became a red priest of the Lord of Light, he came back to find his home in depression and poverty. This used to be a prosperious center, what could have happened. After finding out that his brother Gawen was disinherited and his sister Elyana has been betrothed to their half-brother Valarr, Alester makes an underlying decision to stay and help the things sort out. ++ StoryAs you've seen the story is divided in two parts, following acts of two characters which at the first look are separated by far distance and have nothing in common. However their past and future are bound together. How? I guess you will have to find out for yourself if you want to know more.The story is the best part of the game. It has action, twists, heartbreaking moments, shortly everything you desire. In addition it is very detailed and can offer you closer look into this universe, its history, society, places or significant characters. It's achieved mainly through archives of Westeros which you can collect during gameplay and afterwards read in the Codex in the menu of the game. - ChoicesEven though the dialogs offer you many options your choice doesn't really matter. Only once you have a choice which influences the end of the game. I've tried reaching both endings and the difference is only in the ending cutscene and last 2 minutes of the game. Exept this its the same, so I don't see any point in playing this game twice and trying different playstyles.- Combat, Abilities and SkillsSince you can play for two characters in one fight you are able to control both and it's reached genuinely through quick switching between them and using their abilities during ""slowed time"". Being able to slow time in order to time attacks and maximize the efficiency is a gentle solution and enables finishing the game even on the hardest difficulty (as I did). It is entertaining, but as the game develops it's all the same again and again. When we are talking about choosing capabilities, which you take in the abilities tree, choice doesn't really matter. You will be using only a few and most of them are useless to you. As usually you will get through with stun and damage ones. Skills improve your proficiency with particular weapons or effeciency of an armor you use, so easily you know what to pick. Another thing is that during gameplay you can obtain some traits improving your character, increasing hit chance or deflection for example, but only with a minor impact.  The last thing to mention here is the level cap. It can be reached only at the end of the game after you have finished everything possible in the game. So in conclusion only usefulness of reaching it is gaining a steam achievement.- Semi-open World and Side quests The game plays out on a few locations of different sizes. As a whole this world is tiny and you can't miss much in it because you come back to every location so many times it is almost impossible unless some exceptions which are sealed after finishing a chapter. During gameplay you can meet only few side quests in the advanced phase of the game. These will bring you again on the locations you have been before and most of these tasks are solved by tedious dialogues with different types of people or fighting which is then more tiresome than entertaining.6.5 /10I would recommend this game only to those interested primarily in the story. This is a nice completion for fans of Game of Thrones, but as I have said before even others may find this game interesting and enjoyable.			"

												Ten hours in.  Was almost turned away by negative reviews but decided I enjoyed the books and show too much to not try it.  Good decision.  The story is great and the combat is very similar to Knights of the Old Republic. I don't see myself regretting being tired at work from playing this game after the kids go to bed anytime soon.			"

												What a mixed bag and yet a profoundly enjoyable game, although generally flawed, this Game of Thrones turned out to be in the end. Game's story is unpredictably interesting and doesn't stoop to merely rehashing the familiar tunes from the books, but it carries their tone and atmosphere perfectly into an interactive medium while its two protagonists are some of the most layered characters I have ever played as in any game and as a result it's incredibly satisfying to watch their grim tales unfold over the course of the game, all the while bringing the story's peculiar framing into foreground and delivering one of the more compelling experiences in recent years. Sadly, this is where the other side of the coin comes into play - game's technical and mechanical aspects are questionable at best and a mess at their worst. One glance at these graphics will tell you they weren't where the budget went and the sound department didn't fare much better, VA suffering in particular with not even the main characters managing to avoid the brunt of the damage, for the most part. It's clear the voice talent wasn't given much direction to work with while they were delivering their lines and this vague design philosophy carries over into other things like somewhat archaic combat and arguable direction when it comes to gear design, secret finding and other systems.I should point out, bold and underline that I still enjoyed Game of Thrones immensely when all the good and bad is tallied at the end because, in my opinion at least, game's strong story and narrative manage to FAR outweigh it's technical shortcomings. If you enjoy a story with an edge that doesn't hold back any punches and without the proverbial knights in shining armor, this just might be the game for you.			"

												I was extremely skeptical about this game, being a huge GoTs fan I was periodically checking up on this game when it released and the reviews were pretty heartbreaking. Finishing up the most recent season of GoT I was desperately needing my fix, so I picked up this in hopes that it would sustain me, and my god am I happy I did. The game is not perfect but its really no where near as bad as the majority of critics made it out to be. The story takes place right before the books/show start and it follows two characters of little known houses within the Lannisters  Westerlands. Don't expect to see alot of characters popular in the shows (more from the books) Varys, Cersei, Half Hand, and Jeor Mormont are pretty much the only big names you'll run into. (Whether this is canonical or not no idea, but it could easily be put into the accepted lore) The gameplay is not perfect (reminds me of Kotor) but still enjoyable, you select a sequence of attacks and the said character will then play them out. The one thing that bummed me out is you only have two permanent party members (though they are played separately) and all the others are temporary drop-in characters. All-in-all if you like GoT and want to experiance a little bit more of Westeros, and dont mind a less than perfect (it really isnt that bad, I had a fun time) combat system then definitly check it out. Even if you don't know the series pick the game up, the game is filled with codex's that help explain alot of the elements you see within the game.+Also if youre debating whether to get this or the Telltale game, get this hands down, the story and game as a whole is much more satisfying.

												This is an EXTREMELY situational recommendation.  The gameplay takes a lot of time and patience to get used to and accustomed to.  Once you get the hang of the combat system and the stats it becomes much more playable and you'll actually start to enjoy it.  The story itself is worth fighting the opening segments of the game to finish though.			"

That really substanties what RPGs have become - people appreciate shiny graphics over a plot.The graphics in the game are mediocre. The combat system is average. The voice acting.. less than average. None of this matters, though. The story will take such a grasp of you that you'll find yourself trying to keep your eyes open at 8am to play just a little bit more. The story saves it all. It's one of the best experiences I've had in singleplayer games this millennia. Buy it. Show those critics they're wrong.94/100			"

												I wouldn't say it's underrated, no not quite. But it is indeed an interesting game with a very well-written plot. There are a lot of references to places and characters only mentioned in the books, which I like a lot. But due to poor design-choices, this game lacks the essence of a fully fleshed out RPG. It feels as if it was dumbed down for consoles, which it clearly was, there should be no doubt about that beyond this point.Pros:    Great voice-actors, some even the originals from the show (Mormont, Varys etc.) Soundtrack the same as in the show Authentic imagery of G.R.R Martins worldCons:    Clunky movement and camera controls I don't like the graphics of this game: Textures seem old and uninspired Magic - in my opinion it's just over-the-top and a hit in the face of the loreDespite all that, I'm having a good time with it.

												Truly an underrated gem.. Dont be fooled by all those rewiewers which quitted after 10 mins if you like mature story-driven RPGs and/or are a fan of the books you'll love this.The best story i've ever seen in a videogame, (and i'm quite into storydriven) if you read the books you'll surely notice Martin's touch :), the dialogues and the main charaters are also excellent, the choice system is one of the best i've seen and the choiches are truly meaningful...  what more can i say? Yeah it also last quite longer than other modern rpgs it took almost 30 hours to me to finish my first playthrough and i also skipped a few secondary missions. The combat was criticized as one of the weak point of this title but is actually quite good, a bit repetitive and boring at the start while you unlock new techniques and moves it truly start to shine.. a few hours into the game it's already very satisfying, it also require you to play it tactically and on knight (medium) difficulty it's already truly challenging and unforgiving in later stages.The graphics are good enough when maxed, expecially the lights effects, for some reasons some of the most common (medium) armor in the games seems low texSadly there a few aspects where clearly emerge that the devs were short of money like repeating models and bad voice actors for common npcs (the voice actors for the protagonist and others main characters are very good though) and some other unpolished aspects but these are really minor drawbacks in an overall memorable experience.. also with all the choices and the class sistem there surely enough material for second or third playthrough.In the end i still consider this one of the best RPGs i've had the pleasure to play, if you are a fan of the books and/or mature story driven games this is truly a must buy.

												When I bought this game, I was fresh off the heels of playing the first chapter of Telltale Games' GOT game (very good so far), and I was hungry for more stories from Westeros. Having already watched every episode at least 10 times, and with the new season months away, I found myself desperate enough to buy this game, one which I had passed over many times because it looked like your typical crappy tv/movie-based game. And that is exactly what it turned out to be, but against my better judgement, I heeded the mostly positive reviews here and bought it. What a mistake.Everything about this game feels like a complete afterthought. Everything from the combat, to the leveling system, to the gear just feels poorly designed. And no, this isn't me just complaining about how the game LOOKS bad...graphical quality is not particularly high on my list of priorities, even if this game does look like its from the early 2000's. It is difficult for me to pinpoint in this review exactly what is so poor about the gameplay because my answer is simply: everything.According to many of these reviews, the story is the best aspect of the game and it is what makes the ""meh"" gameplay worth it. While I am inclined to agree that it is the strongest part of the game, that isn't really saying much. The story is fair, but certainly not good enough to warrant the cost unless it falls to $5. My suggestion would be that if you really want to check out the story, save your money and just watch the story via youtube videos. Each time somebody buys this, it further justifies to game developers that they can continue to get away with churning out these steaming piles of garbage. "

												When I played this game I had not seen or read any of the Game of Thrones mediums.The game stands on it's own and I enjoyed it without knowing any of the background lore, in fact it armed me with some knowledge for when I watched the TV series.You have preset characters but can choose to specialise them in different ways. The game is fairly linear, but some times there are choices that lead to different consequences (such as the endings).Combat is real-time with pause and aside from using multiple skills is a pretty straightforward affair.Overall a decent game whether you are familiar with the source material or not.

												Yet another game given too hard a time by reviewers due to overhyping. This game really is great. Sure there are some glitches and the graphics arent the greatest, but this game does not deserve the low scores it received. In my opinion its a mixture between the original witcher and dragon age. The combat is similar to the witcher, the party system is similar to dragon age, and the world design is similar to both. The strongest point in this game is its story. It almost feels like im part of a game of thrones miniseries spin off. It is definitely worth a play through when you can grab it on sale, especially if you are a game of thrones fan.			"

												If you've ever taken the time to read a novel for the sure enjoyment of emersing yourself into another time, dimension or universe, then this game is for you.  In fact, the most enjoyable part of this game is being a part of the character cast that shapes the future of the game.  The story is mesmerizing, to say the least.  The ""Holy Crap!, I can't believe that just happened!"" moments are never ending.  The twists and turns of fate are what keep you hooked and wanting more.  The animation, graphics engine and ability to move smoothly are somewhat disappointing, however, as I said before, the surprises in the game will keep you coming back.  I found that by turning on the VSync in the system files will provide for better graphics on screen.  Remember to SAVE often (not quicksave) just in case you want to go back and change a bad decision.Don't let this gem slip through your fingers.  Get it and enjoy a great story!			"

												I recommend this game, but only for those who like to watch Game of Thrones. The reason is that this game makes you watch a lot: Cutscenes are numerous and long and make GoT feel like an animated interactive spin-off feature film. Also, in this combat system (that reminded me of Dragon Age: Origins), the player is mostly a passive observer of the auto-attacks, throwing in special moves and potions occasionally. For my play sessions, I took a bar of chocolate in order to keep busy when the ""movie"" continued between the interactive parts.The world consists of a number of locations only connected by a fast travel map. They are not all corridors with only one way to move forward, especially King's Landing is relatively elaborate; coming from Skyrim and Fallout though, I felt it to be very limited. That said, the graphics and sound background of the winter scenery at the Wall and the different quarters of the capital are nice and atmospheric. The character and the NPCs look good as well. The only problem here  is the use of a limited number of NPC models that are randomly distributed in the populated areas, and it is quite common that the same model appears several time at the same spot - it breaks the immersion a little if you visit a market and see the exact same person twice talking with himself on a regular basis. The quality of the voice acting varies between mediocre and very good; fortunately the main characters are cast appropriately. The loot and equipment system, the classes and skill progression are not great, but functional. An innovative gameplay aspect is Mors' Warg ability to control his dog who can then follow traces, very similar to Geralt's hightened sense of smell in the Witcher 3. The best thing about this game are the plot twists, when you discover that characters (including one of the two protagonists) are not who he seemed at first.My general verdict is that this is a decent game implemented in an interesting movie in the Game of Thrones universe and will mostly please fans of the series.

												Game of Thrones is a real time RPG set before the events of the show but will eventually go up to Season 1 of the show. It has you controlling two protagonists, one a Ranger of The Wall called Mors Westford  and the other a self exiled heir to a powerful lord of the south called Alester Sarwyck. Each have their own inventory, money and skills which you will have to constantly manage. The game is mostly linear but has a few side quests here and there but will expire once that chapter is over. It does feature a few characters from the show that play vital roles like Queen Cersei and Varrus along with some well known locations like Kings Landing and Castle Black. Neither area are impressive though and Kings Landing feels like a tiny town instead of the capital of Westeros. If you are unfamiliar with Game of Thrones the game does feature a lot of codex entries to help fill you in.Let me start off with talking about gameplay. It is pretty simple, you auto-attack an enemy when spotting them but pressing the attack button is much more effective as it cause more damage and its a lot more likely to connect the blow. Then  you can select an ability and a menu opens up causing the action to go into slow motion to give you more time to select them. Which sounds alright but the fact that you usually fight by yourself against multiple enemies will cause you to quickly get bored since you have a limited set of moves and will be relying heavily on the same few moves with little chance to vary it up. The targeting system is very clunky and will flat out refuse to work at times causing you to take unnecessary damage as you are unable to target the archers that are quickly draining your health and to further annoy you enemies strikes can hit you even if you are a couple feet away from them and they strike air. I feel combat would be a lot more enjoyable if you had a party like most games of this genre but as it stands it feels very tedious.Once you reach level 7 you can choose another fighting style which has it's own set of moves which is very welcome so you can experiment with a few more ablities. The game also features light stealth  sections in where you take control of Mor's dog and enter a first person mode to pick up on peoples scents and hunt them down. You can take out enemies by sneaking up behind them and pouncing on them to rip out their throats which is fun at first but for some reason they found it necessary to make you mash a button when doing that which gets annoying fast. Alester on the other hand has an ability to spot hidden items but the animation of it takes quite awhile to finish which makes it annoying to use too. At one time you are required to go on a scavenger hunt searching for seven keys around Alester's castle which just felt like lazy padding but luckily after that you can solve the games only puzzles which were pretty enjoyable.Graphics are very outdated and the major areas you explore are tiny and unimpressive. On top of that the amount of times they reuse the same models is absurd. Every piece of armor looks different and it is pretty fun mixing and matching the armor sets to your liking. Enemies all look very similar minus the sigils of their lords on the armor and shields which isn't really a problem since the fantasy stuff is near non existent in this game. The user interface for the inventory is pretty bad since it is difficult to compare equipment and weapons, armor,potions, etc are separated into different tabs which make it even more of a hassle. Also when selling at vendors the items you have equipped are in random positions with only a tiny icon that has your face on it which may cause you to accidentally sell your best equipment. Another issue I would like to address is that the mini-map is very confusing to understand and you have to be practically on top of an item or location so that you know where it is, though there is a map in the start menu which is much more useful.Sound is a mixed bag. The music features the main theme to GoT and some other fitting music which I find enjoyable but loops a bit too often. Sound effects are just average, they do the job. Now this is the worst flaw of the game, the voice acting. Holy cow, with the amount of dialogue in this game you'd think they would atleast try to make it decent but nope. The only characters with decent voices are the ones from the show, the rest are terrible. They all sound half asleep and sound so monotone that it really damages the story in this game. It makes the world and adventure seem so boring hearing how everyone talks like the world's most underpaid documentary narrator. None are capable of of showing emotion, they yell “No!” the same way I would from arguing with Siri on my phone while high on meds from a blow to the head.Story starts off with the most evil looking protagonist called Mor's as he does a few missions for the Night Watch and eventually switches to Alester who has returned to Westeros for his fathers funeral. Both are really interesting characters (with bad voice acting) and the events that happen to the game will eventually effect both of them. The story in this is surprisingly important and is capable of changing all of Westeros to keep it vague and spoiler free.  It is pretty cool playing as a character with a looked down upon religion and wish they would have done more with it other than a few characters hating your guts because of your beliefs. They do an excellent job at getting you to despise the villain in this game and became my main motivation for wanting to beat the game considering the main story was rather uninteresting until later on. About 3/4th into  the campaign the story suddenly becomes very good and will have you hooked until the awesome end. It was a rather surprising and welcome change, it's like if the writer's boss found out he spends most of his workdays playing Minecraft or something and replaced his computer with a typewriter.This is one game I spent a lot of time wondering if I should recommend or not. It isn't broken and runs fine enough it's just so boring until much later on. It doesn't do anything well other than build up the main characters but even that is negatively effected by awful voice acting. And it is rather tame until the 3/4th mark which is strange considering how gritty and violent the GoT universe is. I'd have to say that if you are a huge Game of Thrones fan wanting to explore parts of Westeros and wanting to see a story not involving the Starks and Lannisters then feel free to give this one a shot.

 Game of Thrones  This is a good game that definitely makes up for the plot and the main characters. This title is based on the fantasy of George R. R. Martin ""A Song of Ice and Fire"". The story is presented from the perspective of two characters. The first of them is a member of the Night's Watch, Mors Westford. In contrast, the second character is Alester Sarwyck that after 15 years of exile as a priest R'hllora return to Westeros for the funeral of his father. Heroes have a rich biography and discovering their history constitutes the most part of the game. The game takes place on land of Westeros where we visit places such as Riverspring, Kings Landing, Riverrun, Mole's Town and Castle Black. At the beginning of the game we choose the class of our characters and for each character a set of three profession. The game is divided into chapters and while playing we will gain experience by killing enemies and completing missions so that we could be able to improve our statistics. In addition, during the game we will make choices that it will add additional statistics. The fight will not be relied on pressing the buttons to defeat our enemy. Instead, the fight will be based on tactics and the appropriate action preforming attack or defense action, so that your character is not killed in combat. Also, we will have access to the companions who will accompany us during the fight. This is definitely a good game that has a great story. Sound system is very good too. The biggest problem with this production is that various things have been converted like type of armor, places in Kings Landing and Castle Black does not resemble anything and nothing from the show. While ending this review I would like to say that the game is worth the price and I had a lot of fun after finished this game. "

												As a devoted fan of the books and the TV series, I'm trying very hard to view this game in a positive light, but the blemishes just won't go away, no matter how hard I squint. It does have many positive aspects. Just being in Westeros is a big deal and it's nice to meet characters that you already know. The story has the right feel. The graphics, while not spectacular by current standards, are enough to convey the required look and mood.Unfortunately, the game play is abysmal. The combat mechanics, in particular, are downright painful and completely break the immersion in the battle as you have to fight more with the UI to do anything meaningful than you do with your opponent. I do like the ""active pause"" mechanism, where action (and even speech) continues in slow motion rather than stopping completely, but that's part of what breaks the immersion. If you want any chance to win your fight, you can't do it in adrenaline-pumping real time. As an option, ""active pause"" would be phenomenal. As an obligation, it sucks. And once you're in combat, you're locked in place with your opponent. You can't back down, move sideways, or go to a tactically better location. The only thing you can do is to change target. This  is even worse as an archer. Once you start shooting, the game decides where you stand. You can't seek cover, even partial cover. You just stand there in the middle of the combat field like a big idiot while enemies either shoot at you or charge you, at which point you can switch to a melee weapon.And then, there are cut scenes. Billions and billions and billions of cut scenes! While the cut scenes are interesting, they're too long and too frequent. If they wanted to make a movie, I would have gladly bought the DVD, but what I wanted here was a game.Interaction with the world is also painful. You can't interact with most things and the only way to know that you can interact with something is when you're nearly on top of it and an obnoxious glowing icon suddenly appears over it. You can't talk to most NPCs, either. Unless they're a merchant or a quest giver, they're basically just mindless decorations. Even the ones you can talk to have no variety. They will repeat the exact same phrases over and over and over. You can't get into most buildings. You can't pick up objects that are on the ground. That beautiful sword on the ground? Forget it. It's just part of the backdrop. It might as well be a painting.Basic movement is also incredibly primitive. We're talking Doom grade primitive. You can't jump and every drop is protected by a forcefield that prevents you from falling, even if it's only a couple of feet. You can't crouch or change speed either.This final point bothers me personally, but some people might like it, though I can't begin to understand why they would. If you chose to play with the controller, the controller becomes the only thing you can use. The keyboard and mouse seem to be completely deactivated, except for the arrow keys when navigating a menu. Maybe they just wanted it to really feel like a console port.So, if you're a Game of Thrones fan, you're kind of in a bind because you will want to play this, if only for the story and the chance to meet some of your favorite characters or to visit some of the locations. But if you're not a GoT fan and are just looking for a good RPG, walk past this one.			"

												Whew, jesus this game. I came in thinking it was going to be like Two Worlds kind of, yet more story driven and less. . . crap. What I got was a cookie cutter rpg that is anything but a cookie cutter RPG. Extremely brutal like actual Game of Thrones with a decent story. What kind of lacks is the combat. It's different, it's intuitive, but it's boring. You are in real time fighting a not real time battle. It's like a mixture of Divinity Original Sin and Fable. The walking is kind of clunk but bearable, the voice acting is pretty alright, you have dialogue options although they really don't affect anything. All in all I give this a solid Meh outta 10 get it cheap like I did 5 bucks for the whole game and DLC			"

												As a great fan of the ""A Song of Ice and Fire""-books as well as the TV Series ""Game of Thrones"", I was enthusiastic, yet a bit sceptic of this game adaption.Story plays kind of parallely to the Events surrounding the First Books, but I dont want to spoil the story itself for anyone (Its interesting though!).As for gameplay, it reminded me a lot of the first ""The Witcher"" game in terms of how it felt. Its not realy open world, but there are a few Side Quests though. Fighting System is solid, takes a bit getting used to, though. The major focus lies on the strong story. I´d say the source material is good adapted, and as such I am positively surprised by this license adaption.I would definitely recommend this game for fans of the books and/or series.			"

												tl;dr- One of the best stories and dialogues of any computer game I've ever played (10/10)- Game is at most 'meh' (4/10)- Starts very weak, the first 4 chapters are boring and feel way too slow, however the game exponentially gets better, chapters 11+ are amazing.If you are one of those people that skip cutscenes and dialogues, don't bother buying this. The gameplay feels very clunky, map layout is absolutely horrible, quests are stupid and completely get in the way of fun. The skill and combat system is okay-ish, but starting from the mid-game it is not difficult to use a unbeatable tactic; with the right build you can simply stun-lock most enemies.However, the characters, story, immersion and pace of the story is brilliant. The final chapter is one of the most emotional and dramatic endings I've ever seen in a game. Please, please do not read spoilers or walkthroughs before playing this. If you enjoyed the books or the TV series, I would recommend checking this game out. If you come for the gameplay, go somewhere else.			"

												Great game. A must if you are into the Song of Ice and Fire lore. Everyone says the control are horrible, but it is literally WASD movement with a resident evil over the shoulder camera. Switch party members by pushing tab. In combat, its like an mmo, where you auto attack and have a hotbar full of skills to use. You can push space bar and the game goes into slow motion, allowing you to be very strategic with combat and use your party members to their full extent. Honestly if you had issues with the controls in this game you will have issues with the controls in a lot of games, because they are very simple and intuitive. I would imagine everyone complaining is using a controller, and then it might be more difficult, but its a joy on keyboard/mouse. The story runs parallel with the books/show, so you are playing alongside important events in the world. It really is a lot of fun seeing the world from other points of view if you have read the books or seen the show. The character creation and leveling up has depth, it is a lot like an old school rpg. It has a smattering of dungeons and dragons, in that you get to pick your stats and skills. All in all, great game, great rpg. Not the best, and a bit dated graphics wise, but that barely puts a dent in it. Would recommend.			"

												Finally got my hands on this game as I'm a big fan of the TV Show.So, here's my review for it so far (reaching 6 hours into it)Final Score - 7 out of 10Storyline ; ( 6/10 )The storyline doesn't follow Game Of Thrones stories but it has some parts that will remind you of the TV Show.So you play as 2 different characters, one is a survivor and leader of the Night's Watch. The other one is an old priest that returns to his city and tries to bring justice into it.So as for the story goes you will get yourself into the character's head, it's pretty fun.Dialogs are general I skip the conversations sometimes but I like the variety of ways you can play this game.Gameplay ; (7/10)1) Quests -After you create your character and give him his attributes,stats and class you follow the story that the game has given to you and move along the maps to complete the quests.You can do some side quests that will not take long and kill extra enemies.Nothing to explore really besides finding more quests/enemy and items.As for the equipment you have you can trade it (sell/buy) in merchants in each map.So, there's nothing much to do in this game.2) Combat -As for the combat goes, if you played Of Orcs and Men and enjoy it you will enjoy the combat in this game as well.You have pause menu where you can choose which abilities to do with each character and then execute it on the enemy.The enemy A.I have different types of weapons/armor so it is challenging.RPG Elements ; (8.5/10)1) Skills - Skill Trees with upgrades for each character, and also to the character A.I assistant.2) Items - variety of weapons to use, and in differnet types as well. Ranged/Closed , Blunt/Cutting , Short blades etc.3) Equipment - You have 2 weapon sets in this game so you can switch from 1 set to another anytime.Example: [Set One] can be crossbow or heavy axe and [Set Two] can be 2 weapons in hand or sword+shield.You also have body armor (helmet etc) flasks (potions etc) and rings.4) Character Build - in 4 phases.[Phase 1] Class [Phase 2] Stats [Phase 3] Skill Tree [Phase 4] Strength and Weakness attributesSo combine all of this in this game and you will enjoy your time playing as a badass ruthless warrior with strong weapons and heavy damage, or as the protector of the city with health and dodging abilities, or as a scouting rouge that has stealth moves. (yes, stealth is also a mechanic in this game).A.I ; ( 6/10 )1) Enemy A.I - They are challenging because each has different type of armor and weapon.The come in groups so you will have to combine strategy and tactics to defeat them.2) Character A.I - You control your A.I (ofcourse because it's a rpg fantasy game) just like in Of Orcs And Men.Each character has different abilities and different tasks. (control the dog of Mors or the soldier of The Priest).Overall ;If you enjoyed games like Of Orcs and Men and Divinity you will find common combat system like in Orcs and Men and similiar rpg elements like in Divinity.You will enjoy the gameplay, cuz it's also repetetive as you can play in different classes, different builds/skills and making your character be a ruthless heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or a good ""governor"" for the people of Riverspring.But if you've watched the show and expect the characters from the show and storylines from the show, you are to be mistaken.You should give this game a try cuz it's unique and good as it is.Thanks for watching this review.

												The game is quite stiff, the code seems bad, lags a lot and look like a game of 10 years ago.As a RPG, is similar to The Witcher, regarding the mechanics, but it's not as good thought as the first one; some things are very frustrating (like achievements that can't be done if you don't play exactly as the game want, which shouldn't be a thing, in a RPG).BUTThe story is well made and quite interesting (George Martin's supervision is clearly felt in some key-point), and in the end they have been 30 pleasent hours.And then there's him: Mors Westford, the Punisher of Westeros, who alone make the game worth of being played.

												Today I finished downloading Game of Thrones the RPG from Steam and despite what others have said about it, it's actually a beautifully made and fun to play game! The fighting mechanic is unique and while it has a bit of a learning curve, it's actually really fun and easy to use (once you get the hang of it). Intense battles with the option to quickly switch between anyone on the battlefield for a better advantage, the great music you would come to expect from the series, and the full open world of Westeros await those with the skill (as well as the coin) to join the deadliest game of all, the Game of Thrones!

												At first I must say, that I played this game mostly on my second account.I bought this game when it was on sale (or by humble bundle, I don't remember now, forigive me).Now just talk about the ""+"" and ""-"" of this game.+ Not the best, but still good plot.+ You can finally visit King's Landing (sorry if I spell it wrong, my English isn't so good).+ Two characters with different personalities, goals and skills.+ Five different endings. I had fun when I tried to unlock them all, but it wasn't too difficult.+ Secrets. It was funnier to find things with R'hllor's power, but hound's part was amazing too.+ ""Gret dog assassin"". I don't like dogs, but Mors' hound was nice!- It's too ♥♥♥♥ing expensive. If I had to pay this for almost 20 euros, I would not do that.- Music. Was it too difficult to find some tracks? After some hours I had enough.-Alester's endings. Really? I played to defend Riverspring, not to hang myself or get killed by Ceresei's guards' hand. Omg.- Jeyne's story. I think it was possible to save her and her child.- Fights. It was just like simple spamming and waiting for energy.- Too few characters from the show. Cersei, Mormont and Varys? Where are the Starks? Or Dany? Disappointing.I'm a little bit mixed about this game. I could recommend it just when it's on sale.			"

												A diamond that is not polished, but still shines Game of thrones delivers in almost every way any AAA developer could only hope to succeed. Developed prior to the GOT phenomenon Cyanide stuidos should be given a LOT of credit for the first real game entry into the GOT world. I would comapre GOT to Dragon Age 2 in a lot of its negative ways(Linear, lack of locations) but equal in RPG elements, strong characters, fun gameplay but far superior in story and structure. I am no GOT expert. I have not watched the series, or read the books but this now has me more interested than ever before. The real game is now behind the scenes for the GOT license. Does Cyanide secure, or does Bethesda, Bioware or Paradox who has been coming on strong get into the game? Warning: To fully enjoy you have to be willing to immerse yourself into this world like reading a book. If only here for the combat, look elsewhere.Positives:One of the best RPG stories from start to finsih in the last  10 yearsGreat RPG elements and level up systemMain character voice actingDark, mature storyOne of the absolute worst villans in recent memorySatisfying and fair combat(keeping everyone alive)I actually read a lot of codex. I never read codex. Finishing moves cringe worthyDidnt see that, or that comingNegatives:A common trait with deep RPGs a lot of systems that are not fully realized, or useableMinor balancing issues void the use of potions and poisonsA very slow start-10 hours before the action starts Side charcter voice acting on some occasion is laughableMap on the main screen frustratingIts just plain ugly at first but actually after a while doesnt matter.Late side missions are out of place and unneccesaryLack of weapon variety			"

Pieces of backgroundinformation are found throughout the game, but you need to find it first. Apart from that the gameplay is not very original and the cameracontrols are not the greatest.In short: Game of thrones fan? Play this! No clue what Game of Thrones is?

												This is the review I thought longest and hardest about writing because I really want to be fair to both the game devs and potential purchasers of this game.This is a diamond-in-the-rough, game. Personally? I enjoyed it. Immensely in fact. Let me caveat that, first.It was crashy during the first few hours. I nearly quit several times. The combat system is annoying, mainly because every time the player gains a new skill, when using a controller, the old skills shifts slots on the dial thus meaning that combat can never be played with muscle memory. That may be less of a problem when using k/m. The combat was no great shakes due to that time-slowing mechanism [geez if yer gonna have pause-based, have pause-based, going half-azzed is just silly] but this game, like Torment, isn't so much about combat as it is about what that combat reveals about the story.A common complaint was the graphics. Okay, I get that...this game is not $60 however and I really have no problem with dated graphics so if you are expecting Skyrim you will hate it. If you like older games played for their plots and characters the graphics probably won't bother you.I don't understand the complaints about the voice acting. I thought the two main protagonists fit the story very well. Other than the odd unimportant NPC--it was adequet to decent voice acting all the way through. I've played games with far worse vocals, for sure.While the villains of the tale are rather generic, the main characters [you, as the player, play two of them] were deep, inspired characters with flaws, vulnerabilities and strengths.It has replayablity from the perspective not so much of outcome but of revealing more story. If that's what you're into--then it provides that experience. It also provides the choices of changing the skill sets of the main characters if desired.The Writing:That's where this game shines all the way. It's deep, complex, dark and compelling. I was driven to finish it because that story drove me on from start to finish. It opens up questions on the nature of responsibility and making difficult choices, honor, family, committment, etc.I am going to recommend it because at this price point--it IS an enjoyable game to play for a couple of days and while many of the complaints about it are valid--it is far more interesting than many AAA titles with better graphics and bigger budgets. Remember, when this was made, nobody was quite sure that GoT was going to be the huge hit that it became so this was farmed out to a smaller, less expensive developer. It feels to me as if the devs were cut off what they really wanted to do with this game due to budgetary constraints and as such, did the best they could under the circumstances.And for all that--it IS worth playing and I would recommend it.

												Quick Summary: Game of Thrones is a RPG taking place during the same time frame as the television show’s first season. The game’s story does not really intersect with the show but some recognizable characters appear. Honestly if you haven’t seen the show you might not understand what’s going on in the game very well. You play 2 different characters on different quests, alternating who you control between chapters.  Mors Westford is a grizzled old veteran of the Night’s Watch, an ancient order of soldiers dedicated to defending the north from invaders. If you watch the Game of Thrones television show, you know that the Night’s Watch is mostly made up of a bunch of criminals who were given the choice: execution, or joining the Watch.  Because of this unsavory makeup, there are some ♥♥♥♥♥sons that get into all sorts of trouble, requiring badasses like Mors to keep them in line (usually means killing them). Mors’ main quest involves helping a mysterious young woman on the run from assassins with powerful friends.Alester Sarwyck is a red priest of R'hllor (AKA the “Lord of Light”), returning to his ancestral home after 15 years self-imposed exile. His family’s lands are in disarray and his people are in nearly open rebellion without a strong leader. Alester’s main quest is to regain his title as lord of the Sarwyck house, and oust his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ half-brother who has risen to power while Alester was away (a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in every sense of the word). Accomplishing this will require the blessing of Queen Cersei Lannister, drawing Alester into the political intrigues of the “Game of Thrones.”The game is played in third person perspective, similar to Dragon Age 2, with a simplified combat/skill system and a mostly generic loot system. This is one of those games where all of the gear is predefined and similar (no random magical properties). You’re not going to find any ‘godly plate of the whale’ or ‘Windforce’ type items. There are a few items with special names, but the bonuses aren’t game breaking (+2% chance to dodge). Combat in the game usually involves pressing Space to “pause” and issuing commands, including drinking potions or using attack skills. There are a few starting classes to choose from, but Alester will always have his flame skills from being a red priest. Mors will have his dog to back him up (with its own set of skills).Pros:+The game’s story meshes with the television series. If you’ve watched the first season of the show you can get a little more background from the game, including insight on just how conniving some of the characters are.+The game does take into account a lot of your “choices” both in conversation and decisions (like sparing people or executing them). Cons:-The combat system is very simple. There is some variation to the gameplay, such as controlling Mors’ dog, going around chomping people, but mostly you just take turns swinging swords at your enemies.-As you progress through the game you will gather money (copper, silver, gold) but you will find that there’s really not much to spend your money on. Every city has merchants, but the things you can buy are so expensive that you’re better off just using the gear you look off of fallen enemies. The only thing you really need to buy are the various potions. -The game has very little replayability. The character building doesn’t customize your character all that much, and combat has more luck than skill involved. I started a second playthrough after over 2 years and I just stopped playing after mopping up the Steam achievements I missed the first time.Overall the game has a lot of room for improvement, but if you enjoy the television show or book series, you might find the game’s story interesting.  If you read all the various letters and history scrolls that you find in the game, it will take you well over 20 hours to finish.  Despite being an RPG with a pseudo ‘Open World,’ the game is very linear and you won’t be doing much overall exploring (except when you’re in an area for the first time looking for loot). Enemies do not respawn and you cannot grind for money or experience.  "

Mostly interactive storytelling , with some character customizations and some fighting, and you get to play different characters with their own storiesand abilities.

												A surprisingly strong RPG for a game based on a franchise. Even your early choices matter later in the game. Gameplay could use a bit more polish and the game as a whole could have benefited from larger budget, but its OK since the most interesting part of it is the story, cruel and unforgiving just like the books it is based on. Definitely recommended for those who like the original books or TV series.			"

												This is actually a bit like Dragon Age as far as having a good story with twists and turns in the style you might be familiar with if you've read the books or watched the GoT show.and spanning several years. The combat is real time with pause and issue commands, with things still happening in slow-mo so you can't take all day to decide what to do. Mors Westford is a total badass to end all badasses. I enjoyed playing him the most. The dlc is focused on his past and has a great twist or 2. The best part is the Conan-esque final scene.			"

												This is a *must* if you are both a fan of RPGs and Game of Thrones alike. You play as two completely independant characters - Alester and Mors. Alester is royalty, while Mors has ""taken the black"", living a life alongside an army defending all mankind from any and all threats that may lie beyond an enormous ice structure known as ""the wall"". The motives of these two characters differ on many important points, and this game is a journey to discover how their paths affect one another. Knowledge of the TV series or books is not a prerequisite to enjoying this game, but it certainly is a perk.Now, I seriously discourage anyone from buying this that has a habit of skipping cutscenes and dialog. Cutscenes and role-playing dialog are more than 50% of this game’s true content. It’s essentially an interactive 25+ hour movie, written by George RR Martin himself. The story is deep, the acting ranges from passable to superb, and it all absolutely ties in to the lore of the TV show.  You make dialog decisions that can and will affect the outcome of the game, and in many cases, affect the outcome of your present mission.  Almost every fight can be talked out of, if you care to figure out how to calm the person you’re speaking to.  Adversely, you could tell the angry person to shut their mouth and prepare for a beating, if you wish.Combat is cool-down style, and fights can be slowed down to bullet-time to make tactical decisions, which you will be doing A LOT.  Auto-attacking will get you killed, period.  You must use buffs and special attacks which are unlocked with XP, which is gained by completing missions, discovering new areas, and defeating enemies.Standard RPG fanfare such as inventory, loot, bartering, side-quests, open-world exploration, hidden items, character leveling, upgrades, stats, potions, and armor & weapon slots are all present as well.  Enjoy!			"

												Game of Thrones: the RPG is overall a well-done game that I recommend.The universe is - of course - extremely well-done. All those now famous locations or characters, the plots, the lands...The RPG part is there, and while the game isn't the most stunning visually speaking, it's not bad.But for me, there was one problem: right from the beginning, I found the combat system absolutely awful. I would personally have loved a more dynamic system, maybe less strategy-focusing and more graphical, even with comobos or stuff like that... But that's the devs choice.Anyway, despite the fighting system, I recommend it to anyone in love with the Game of Trones serie or the ASOIAF universe in general, or to all RPG fans who wouldn't mind the change of pace when fighting. The devs focused really hard on the story, giving us a believable plot, with no ""right"" choices but instead ""less-worse"" choices that do have consequences on the future, and I simply loved the main characters. I particularly loved Chapter 11 and the Finale. Plot-twists, brutality, and shades of evil. Loved it.1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must play			"

												If u can endure outdated graphic, bad animation, terrible voice acting and somewhat boring first halfpart of the game, you will discover a very interesting and intriguing plot with powerful twists and multiple endings in best traditions of GoT. Well worth the money if purchased during sale, albeit a time used for the first halfpart of the game feels somewhat wasted if not for the epic second half.			"

												No es tan malo como los medios lo han hecho parecer ni como te parecerá la primera hora y media que lo juegues. Conforme vas jugando y echando horas te va enganchando, sobretodo porque hace un trabajo genial a nivel de trama. Tecnicamente petardea pero es pasable. El tearing que tiene es brutal, eso sí que lo vas a notar toda la partida.Jugablemente frustra bastante y es bien jodido de asimilar el modus operandi a priori porque básicamente tienes que haberlo jugado antes para entender la mecanica de juego. Si te matan sin mucha opción simplemente cambia la dificultad y sigue jugando porque el juego lo disfrutarás más por la historia que por el desafío jugable.En resumen:  genial historia, potencial inmenso, claramente apresurado. Grandes virtudes, terribles defectos (personalmente creo que las virtudes superan los defectos) y los mismos problemas que plagan a los rpgs modernos desde que dejamos la vista isometrica (economia rota, mundo pseudo-abierto, quest fallables por avanzar, etc)			"

												I went into this game with low expectations. It's a cash-grab tie-in product to squeeze a few coin out of GoT fans, right? The gameplay is uninspired, nothing innovative here. It's very similar to a decade old game called Vampire: The Masquerade Redemption, if you've played that you'll see what I mean. *It's not bad though*, which ain't nothin'. Definitely do not take that for granted.The voice acting ranged from bearable to subpar save for Mors, Varys, and Mormont. The latter two were voiced by their characters' actors from the series. Colin Solman, the voice of Mors, fit his character perfectly. That character/voice combination could fit right in to a Warhammer 40K video game.Despite all this, I ended up enjoying it. If you can pick this up cheap, like bundle-cheap, it's worth at least one playthrough.			"

												Clearly this game didn't get a fair shake. Yes, the systems are nothing new, and some are fairly lackluster. There were also some astoundingly bad design decisions from a user experience perspective (most notably one where my character Mors had the very expensive gloves I had just bought him stripped off his body for a quest that rewarded me with nothing in return), and there are definitley several bugs.All that aside, the story is so firmly situated in the world of Westeros that it could easily have been several chapters in the books themselves. There are surprises and twists I won't get into, but if you're a fan of GoT and would like a storyline that can fit between the lines of the main one, give this game a try.			"

 Below average.  4/10+  On the positive side, it has a wonderful, immersive story that fits nicely in canon with season one of the TV show.  Some of the characters are even from the show, complete with their actual voices.  That really lent authenticity to the experience.  The music is good.-  It's hard to recommend this game.  It took me three tries to finally get into it because the clunky combat is so bad.  You are unable to move out of combat with your weapon drawn, and you must be in an enemy's little circle in order to draw and engage.  As someone who plays a ranged character, this obviously poses a problem.  The graphics are also subpar, complete with no anti-aliasing.  The faces and armors render well, but all contrast is just off because of lack of shading.  Sound effects are poor.			"

I just can't discribe it with simple words. I know that Game of Thrones is 50% gore and 50% p*rn, but the developers shouldn't have hired p*rn actors for the game. The lack of any feelings and tonations makes the dialogs boring and you just want to skip them... Still would recommend it to all GoT fans.			"

Recommended: Game of Thrones: The Role-Playing game is hardly going to set the world on fire, but it's a good if rough-around-the-edges game with a quite excellent story to tell.  If you can get past uneven production values and shallow mechanics, there's quite an interesting tale to be woven here, and the cinematography of shots and angles in the scenes is a standout.  Some interesting combat mechanics and an atmospheric soundtrack help elevate it from merely mediocre in my opinion, but if you wanted to self-insert you own characters into the universe of Game of Thrones as I did, this one will disappoint.  If that and some rough edges don't turn you off, I'd say it's definitely worth a look.Read the full review on Highland Arrow here[www.highlandarrow.com] "

												That is a rather tricky one. I can't really recommend this game. A dealbreaker to was that game did not feel game-of-thornes-y to me. That might sound odd but showing you a westeros map (or part of it anyways) and waving around names like ""cersei"" or ""castle black"" is just not enough to create a proper atmosphere. The combatsystem felt odd to me. If you are drawn into a fight you technically use a uninnovative battlesystem which appeared unbalanced to me and was unrealistic to the core. If your HP reach zero - no problem you only get knocked down. As long as one member of your group is fine, everyone is fine. You just get picked up again without even the help of items like in other games. once you end a combat sequence all allies are fully healed and all, no healing required. And then a story-wise halfdead character cuts himself through dozens of trained and well equipped soldiers like no ones buisness. You don't have much option on what to do so the game is rather linear. The trading system is somewhat useless, because you either have better stuff yourself anyways from loot or it is just way expensive, so much, that you won't be able to afford it. (at least to the point I reached before I eventually decided to quit the game.) tl;dr: -Combatsystem is way off, outdated, unbalanced and feels just unrealistic-Trade isn't any good-you don't have much choices -atmosphere is just not like game-of-thrones (makes it all the more feel like they didn't even try to make a good GoT-game but rather just wanted to squeeze some money out of the franchise.) I'm just glad that I at least didn't pay the full price.			"

												I seldom bother to write reviews for games, but felt that this one warranted one because of its conflicting nature of pros and cons.Pros:+ Best thing about this game is the storyline. It has one of the more detailed, involved and believable stories among games of its level. It starts off slowly, but gets really gripping towards the end. The way they took the stories of two different characters and meshed them together really works. The game's story runs concurrent to events in the main GoT storyline, which is also great if you're a fan.+ They didn't bill this game as one that provides many decision choices, yet there are a surprisingly decent amount of dialogue and character choices. It doesn't change the main story outcome very much, but definitely changes some side quests etc, as well as the feel of the story.+ Lots of GoT lore throughout the game (optional for you to read), and I love that they include weapons and armor of famous characters from the main GoT story.Cons:- Biggest flaw is a graphic bug that I could not find a fix to. All suggestions I came across did not solve the bug. Very often (in 'walled' surroundings) when panning the camera, it skips madly, making it impossible to face / run in the right direction, and causing a huge amount of nausea. Its the main reason why it took me so long to finish the game. Granted, this bug does not occur for everyone, so it's just a risk you have to take if you decide to get the game.- Voice acting could have been better. Most of the time the characters (aside from Mors) sound either flat or fake. Better voice acting would really have helped make the story so much better, given the already good storyline. Alester also sounds a bit flat at points, which a main character really shouldn't.- Combat is also very cumbersome. You have to 'pause' the game to use abilities, which makes combat rather slow, and constant toggling between characters to use their skills is a bit of a pain.Overall, I'd definitely recommend the game, unless you're the kind that absolutely hates graphic bugs and will trash the com in a rage. Given the price, and how good the story is, I'd say go for it if you like detailed stories, or if you're a GoT fan. If you're not so much of a fan of GoT / RPGs, or are hesitant to risk getting the bug, then wait for it to go on sale and then get it. Because it'll certainly be worth it on sale.			"

It takes some time to pick up the pace, but once you hit chapter 4 you simply can't stop playing. I'm not going to spoil anything here: But be prepared for a lot of intrigues and plot twists! The story is definitely worthy the title Game of Thrones.Fans of the books / show will meet several known characters and get certain references. However this game doesn't require you to know them in order to enjoy it.Buy it!			"

There are many of the actors from GoT in it too, which is great if you love the series like I do.  Weird with the 2 chars though, just get into playing one and it switches to the next chapter with the other, who seems to be working for the other side, and i just get used to playing him and it switches back.  But it is fun to play the 2 different chars.  Definitely recommend this game if you like GoT, and even if you just like rpg's.			"

												Game of Thrones is an underappreciated RPG, set in the famous universe of the same name. I'd never read the books, but thanks to some good writing and the in-game codex, I never felt lost. I enjoyed the combat, too, with its tense, tactical feel and focus on small groups of enemies. Many RPGs lose some of that sense of danger when the heroes can slaughter dozens of foes with ease.Above all, I really appreciated the writing. As Alester, I had an interesting realization after I reflected upon some of the things I had done in his quest to restore his throne. I realized that many of those actions-which felt right at the time-were not so different from what a certain 'villain' had done as well. This was made more profound because of the ending that I chose. The game nailed the ending. Really, just nailed it. Each ending was different, but equally powerful and uncompromising. I felt that it earned the conflicts and twists at the end. Many RPGs flub their endings, or claim to have multiple endings that turn out to be mostly the same. I feel like the lackluster graphics will throw some people off, as will the slowish start, but it truly does build to something meaningful at the end.  Companies like Bioware would be wise to take note.			"

												If you are a big Game of Thrones fan, you should enjoy the experience, but if you are just a random player - this game will disappoint.The best thing here is the story. It occurs in the same time frame as GoT season 1. You will experience 2 different stories of 2 different men. Playing through 14 chapters you will learn all the background stories abound them. The characters are well fleshed out. The main story is well injected into a GoT world and you will even meet some familiar faces from the GoT tv series. Although not all of them will have a voice-over of the actors.The action is very much the same as old-school RPG games, where you will command your character to attack, or to use a skill and they will do them in the order you've selected. I think this type of gameplay was a good choice for this kind of game. It's very similar to Dragon Age: Origins.The skills are fun and all, but at the end of the game you will learn 95% of them, so no replayability value in this department.The currency in this game is quite scarce, so don't waste all the hard earned money for an item you will eventually out level. Choose wisely.And now - graphics. It actually sucks. The animations are mediocre. There are so many graphical bugs in the scripted scenes that's it's just mind blowing. You will see some random people walking through the walls, windows, wooden doors, fireplaces. You can get stuck in the corners if all your followers surround you and bam - you can do nothing about it. Some characters have such strange voice acting. It's so funny in a not funny way.Oh and the camera controls are the worst. If you want to look around, you have to hold the right mouse button. Even 15 year old games don't have this.----So, if you like Game of Thrones, try to forgive this game all of its flaws and enjoy the story. You will need about ~25-30h to complete this game, especially if you like to do side-quests.			"

												This game is pretty good.It starts as a kinda boring story but in next 20 min there will be more plot twists and murders then in whole season 1 of series.Story is great and 20h long.Game is not worth its current price but on sale it sure does.Too bad it has bad reputation			"

												~40 hours to beat with all the side quests completed on default difficulty.Amazing story line. I'm a fan of the TV series, and this story line fits quite well. The game takes place during season 1 of the TV series, but you'll have to watch half of season 3 for absolutely no spoilers. I recommend this game anybody who likes Game of Thrones style storytelling. It feels like an indie developer trying to make a AAA title, so you'd have to forgive a few quirky things here and there.

												At first playing this, I said ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tie-in game."" But I stuck with it. I was glad I did.  The story is very well done and very Game-of-Thrones-ey (for lack of a better term). Don't expect a happy ending from this one. Combat is lackluster and boring at times, but the story drives. It's also super cool to just explore spots like Castle Black and eavesdrop on people. Definitely worth picking this one up on sale if you're a fan of Game of Thrones. The DLC is BS, though.			"

												I don't know how I'll rate this, but I'll just break it down and see how it goes:Pros- Compelling storyline (recommended for RPG fans/ a must for GoT followers)- Meet a few characters from GoT (yay)- Sufficiently large areas to exploreAfter 15mins of stewing on this, those are the only pros I could think of.Cons- IT LAGS! - Poor voice-acting (mostly)- Long-winded scripts (and recited very slowly; I initially pressed spacebar to skip a few slow-talking characters and ended up missing a cutscene so I stopped)- Unattractive characters (perhaps due to poor graphics, but it's hard to truly enjoy RPG game when you cannot customise a character)Okay- Combat system was uninspiring and unchallenging, but it was okay.- Music was okay too.OverallI stopped at Chapter 7 because of the lag. I can handle poor graphics, but I just cannot play a game that lags. Perhaps it's my system, but it's able to play higher-end games so I'm not sure really. But I'm going to recommend this game anyway as a fellow GoT fan. I just wished I could fix the lag. In any case, my journey with this game ends here. For now.			"

												For a game released in 2012 this game comes across as rather unpolished in a few respected - the voice acting is a bit rough, the graphics could use some work, and sometimes the combat is frustrating. But for all it's faults, it gives you come interesting and complex characters and a monster of a story befitting the intrigues of Westeros. I give this game a hearty recommendation to any fan, because it's an extremely worthwhile story in it's own right and a great contribution to the series.			"

												Hello everybody. Finally,today i have a free time to write a review about this game. First of all i tell you that i'm a biggest fan of Game of Thrones . I have all 6 books and i read them all already. I read them in 3 months or a bit more . I have seen TV series . And everytime when i'm reading,watching i have sort of fire inside.I mean that i imagine that i'm in book ,in this story ,and i feel of sorry for heroes of this. I don't know why ,but I always feel sorry for them. So , about this game. I need to tell you a few words. We will start from pluses: +good story + kinda of open world ,looks sort of. +new heroes,story + voices + you can feel sense for heroes more than in film or in book . +good nature around you +sounds +you can take equipment,what you want to see on your hero + a lot of swords,armors,etc . When i was playing ,i couldn't stop for a while. I had to know more,i had to play more, I forgot about time. And now about minuses of this game: - awful gameplay ,i mean it hard to play the first time. - difficult control of the game - combat looks very strange and when i had the first battle ,i wanted to  unistall this game . But how you can see,i played it a little and i really enjoyed that. For instance,i had a life with heroes in this fantastic world. Can i recommend this game?- hm,i don't know. If you have a good nervous system for this game,and you recognized about all minuses and you want to play,just do it. From my point of view i can give this score for game : 7/10. Thank you for your time.			"

												This RPG isn't the best in the world but it is decent, especially in terms of story. That's where the game shines, if anything. The story is meant to be somewhat canon from what I have gathered and it's well written, it is grim and intriguing. If you are a fan of the books and the TV show, this game will probably be something for you. It's somewhat of a prequel. The main characters are new but you will meet some familiar faces while you are strutting around in Westeros. It's quite a linear game with a few side quests and a DLC quest, it took me 24 hours to finish the game and that's not counting the DLC. Some of your choices throughout the game might have consequences, which is always a plus.The combat in this game is where the game suffers. It felt a bit clunky sadly. The game tries to approach a tactical system that we've seen in Mass Effect and Dragon Age, but it falls a bit flat. I constantly found myself waiting impatiently for the energy bar to fill up so I could use abilities. There are different classes and a lot of abilities to chose from, different talent trees and skill points. However, to me it didn't mean much in the end, I simply lacked the interest in what to skill because of the combat system. What I found great with the game is that when you meet familiar faces you will also hear familiar voices, this is because the actors and actresses from the TV show voice acted in the game. This is a plus because a lot of the other voice acting wasn't up to par most of the time. The visuals aren't great but they're not horrible either. The characters look stale and the lip syncing doesn't make sense most of the time. The game can feel pretty sometimes and it's wonderful to explore known and unknown parts of Westeros, but don't expect the graphics to be as stunning as the TV show - they are quite outdated.I recommend this game if you are a fan of the books and/or the TV show, especially if you have the patience to endure a below average combat system, simply to enjoy the story.

												After more than 25 hours I can say it's been the most dramatic and exhilarating CRPG I've played in a long time. I won't spoil anything but the strength of the game lies in the story and more importantly in the characters who could definitely star in a novel or even a series. For once we're not playing kids but world weary and mature men who have been through a lot and have had some eventful lives. The game focuses on two characters, a veteran of the Night's Watch and a Red Priest. Throughout the game we come to learn more about their respective stories and what drove them to take the black or embrace the faith of the Red God. The game somehow imitates the narrative of the books (and TV show) by switching back and forth between these two characters thus creating some sense of expectation which can sometimes lead to some tantalizing cliffhangers. I won't comment much on the story for obvious reasons but all I can say is that it's a credit to the setting and received the approval of George R.R. Martin (yes, it's that good). At times it may seem linear but the game always provides the player with meaningful choices and opportunities to shift the direction of the story. You won't radically modify the outcome of events but you will have a say on how your character deals with these. It does a pretty good job at fleshing out these characters and the two main heroes (or antiheroes) are very memorable. The game also makes the most of the setting. It was in production before the show was on the air so it looks slightly different at times (I really like the realistic look the game goes for when it comes to armours and some of the clutter) but the game does feature some well known elements (like for instance the Iron Throne from the show) and faces from the TV show and voice acting from the actors (only a few of them so you won't get to see Tyrion but you will recognize some of the big names). There is an emphasis on the Game of Thrones (the story takes place at the time of the first book/season) so later events in A Song of Ice and Fire are not spoiled by the game (I'm still catching up). The story is gritty, brutal and at times even grim. You can expect twists, backstabbing and violence reminiscent of the Red Wedding. Honour is a rare commodity in a world where everyone is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.From a technical point of view the game is not a AAA title and it shows (don't expect this game to look as good as The Witcher). Some models look really good but on the whole it's serviceable. You may have to enable Vsync in the ini file because of the screen tearing. The FOV is a bit too close but that's something I've learned to accept after failing to edit that setting. There is some clipping if you mix different outfits or if you watch some finishing moves too closely (but that's true of Skyrim and most people don't hold that against it). The music and soundtrack are competent and aptly support the action on screen. The voice acting is ok with some characters that really stand out (especially the first character) but some minor characters can be a bit off and forced (once again the same can be said about Skyrim).When it comes to combat the game plays a lot like Dragon Age Origins (or KotoR). The real problem is the difficulty especially in the early game because at that point you simply don't have unlocked the most useful abilities yet and it all feels a bit like rock, paper, scissors... Once you get some area attack and some stun effect and attack things start looking up but until you do the game can turn into an exercise in frustration unless you turn down the difficulty setting. Combat doesn't involve you as much as in other games because you can only give orders, you're not the one doing the attacking, the dodging and the parrying. That wasn't so bad with Dragon Age Origins but I can see how dated this can feel now after playing games like the Witcher or Kingdoms of Amalur (by the way that's not saying that the combat in a game like Skyrim is better or even particularly good). It does work and it doesn't require much dexterity on the player's part but it also leads to some form of boredom as you sit back and watch your guy hacking away at some foes on auto-attack (unless things take a turn for the worse) which is pretty much how you could play Dragon Age Origins when facing regular mobs on average difficulty. Perhaps I was just being lazy but after a while facing another group of foes was more some sort of hindrance, some annoyance to be done with in order to progress through the story instead of a fun diversion. In other words I kept playing despite all the combat and not because of it. Like I said it works but in the end it can be very repetitive because most of the time you use your best area attack when facing mob or simply try and stun lock your foe in a duel. Character creation offers many different options and you can invest in different stats and unlock many things as you level up but the most interesting thing is getting some perks that reflect the way you've played and the choices you've made (which is something that reminded me of Alpha Protocol). All in all I can recommend this game to fans of A Song of Ice and Fire and fans of the Game of Thrones TV show. It's not your usual fantasy CRPG so that could be seen as a plus for a CRPG fan. The depth of the world is used to provide a colourful backdrop without alienating the player who may not be an expert. What I'm trying to say is that I haven't read all the books (yet) but I never felt like I was lost which is more than I can say of the beginning of the Witcher 2 which is rather confusing even for people who did play the first game (and probably a bad design choice because it becomes much harder to relate to what is happening if you have absolutely no clue regarding the action). I can appreciate an in medias res start because it makes for a strong first impression but you have to provide enough background so the player can relate to what is happening on the screen. The Game of Thrones RPG does a great job of involving the player in the story and if you can stick through some of the most repetitive sections you will be rewarded with one of the most satisfying ending to any story even more so because that particular ending will be a direct reflection of some of the decisions you've made in the game. The story may force your hands at some points but you end up making the story your own as you can choose what role you want to play and more importantly actually play that role within the frame of the story.

												Game of Thrones really surprised me, I did not expect to get such an overall pleasant playthrough.Having only heard bad things about the game it took me awhile to finally install it and give it a chance, and I regret not doing it sooner.The game offers a really nice story where to get to play as Mors, a member of the Nights Watch and Alester, a red priest and each with their own interesting backgrounds. What really impressed me was how the story progressed and really chocked me sometimes, there's always going to happen something that you did not expect.One thing that really bugged me however was that the choices you make (and you'll be making alot) didn't have that much of an impact in the story, it felt like they added choices just to have more dialogue.Another thing is the voice acting, Some are good, Some are bad, Most of the time when characters talk to eachother it feels more like they're just saying their line instead of actually talking.The combat is also something that could have used some more work, I found it hard to effectively switch targets in realtime and some abilities are just overpowered. However they did make it alot about interupting attacks and combining attacks between characters which I really enjoyed.Overall I would say that the game was definatly worth the money and time and I would gladly recommend it to anyone that is a fan of Game of Thrones or RPG.

Everything is ""slightly above average"", including number of glitches, and game can be quite boring at times. Story keeps the pace going; while knowing only basics of the GoT universe, I was able to fully understand and enjoy it. 10-20h of gameplay and about 30% is about killing small fries that get into your way.

												I loved this game. At the start I had some trouble with the controlls, but after like 5 mins I had pretty much mastered them. I mean using primarily Alester I beat every fight down with little trouble. I then mastered Mors and butchered a second playthough using him mostly. When you figure out the ebb and flow of the combat system it works out perfectly. I feel that most of the people that rag on this game are either garbage at most action rpgs, or they are very SIMPLE..... But that aside I recomend this game to the fullest. If you love Game of Thrones then its a must have!			"

												5/10 While it has a very good plot, it has a hard time making up for the poor gameplay. Fighting consists of staring at the screen and occasionally hitting a skill, no challenge and it gets boring really quickly. Beyond that the dialogue is good and it had an interesting story, worth sitting through if you get the game cheap and set the difficulty to the lowest. Also graphically the game looks like it came out in 2000.			"

												The story and writing are the highlight. It nailed the ASOIAF aesthetic really well, and is beautifully grimdark. It also starts slightly before a Game of Thrones and so sheds an interesting perspective on the first novel, Jon Arryn's troops get a look in for example. Cyanide/Spider make the same sort of game (Of Orcs and Men, GoT, Mars War Logs and now Bound in Flame which I haven't played). They all have very original, adult(a 15 year old boy view of adult anyway) worlds with a dash of humour and underlying grimness. If you like one you'll like them all, and vice versa if you don't. The downsides are twofold: they are very unpolished, not buggy which they get called, but not the bioware level of sheen that people seem to expect. They also have a similar, although evolving combat style. In Orcs this was very uninteractive and quite hard, it slowly has become slightly easier and requires more player involvement. It got quite fun in Mars with a dodge roll but in GoT it is a bit slow and mainly comes down to maxing out knockdown/cc skills and then unloading damage on stunned enemies. They are quite oldskool RPGs in feel, with talking and world development and slightly arcane fighting. GoT was advertised as being an rpg for GoT fans when really it was a GoT game for RPG fans if that makes any sense. Basically if you like 'proper' rpgs and you like ASOIAF you should give it a try, the beyond the wall dlc prequel is particularly good.And the special edition with all the dlc is cheaper than the base game so buy that, the beyond the wall dlc is brutal, and well worth a play.

												Wow very surprisingly this is actually not a bad game at all. It's a fun game with pretty decent production value. It has one of the smoothest game engines I've ever seen. Graphics aren't great and character models suck and animations could be much better but the medieval setting is captured nicely. Voice acting is done well, however a bit too monotone. The part that made me like this game so much was the combat. It is like combat in a mmo: there are no attack buttons to mash, just auto attack and use some skills. You press the left button on the gamepad (I'm using a wired xbox 360 pad) and it brings up an ability wheel and you select actions and it puts them in a que, then you hit it again and you go back to combat and perform the abilities. I appreciate the combat so much because I hate straight up hand destroying button mashers. There is a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of talking so either be ready to skip a lot of dialogue or listen to people talk/read dialogue for a long while, in which the storyline is actually pretty interesting imo.Thumbs up good game, 7.5/10			"

												One of the best story line games Ive played in awhile. Not only because the show and book itself are great also, but I actually expected this game to be a bad representation of the show/book. To my surprise, its got a great storyline with long    dialouge speeches with characters and touching moments. Not only that, it was quite long for a game. I kept thinking to myself, this has got to be the end, and to my surprise, another chapter unfolded.The combat is very simplefied, you mainly need to keep track of your characters health and to target enemies. Not very hard at all. If you like the show/books or like deep involved storylines with a lot of character dialouge (and there is alot of talking in the game) You will love this game.			"

												We seriously need a neutral rating when reviewing Steam games. Because right now I have to give this a thumbs down. It's not that I don't like it. I actually like it fine. I've played more than ten hours at the time of writing this. But I don't know if I'll make it much further.First the good. The story is intriguing, and I really do want to get to the end of it to see what happens, especially since there are supposed to be multiple endings. The two leads are also likeable, relateable, and interesting. This is surprising because their personalities are left up to the player a lot  of the time. If you want them to be cranky, then they're cranky. You want them to be bleeding hearts, then that's how they'll be.But the combat is boring me to tears. Imagine something similar to Dragon Age: Origins or KOTOR, then take away the nuance, strategy, awesome abilities, and everything else that made the combat in those games fun, and you'll have an idea of what I mean. It's just a such a slog. And every chapter you'll explore a new (but oddly familiar) dungeon with hordes of enemies that gang rush your two person party. It's just not fun. We needed more story and less combat.Anyways, I don't think it's a bad game. I like it. But I wouldn't recommend it when there's way better things to play.			"

												The controller support is hard to manage and you have to utilize the mouse to change camera views.  The combat system is based upon pre-planning attacks with automated sequence.  It's not an open world like Skyrim but very linear in approach.  The story is the best aspect of the game, wherein occassionally you get to make choices.  The character is somewhat customizable as far as skills are concerned, but you still have a chosen storyline to follow rather than your own and the character persona is limited.  On sale, might provide some amusement, but you have to be a hard core fan to truly appreciate it.			"

Honor, Comrady and Treachery all blend into an epic which keeps you hooked until the end. Fits perfectly into the world of Game of Thrones. 9/10 for me.			"

												Overall experience was great after the first 2 chapters.   7/10NOTE: The game spoils both the book and tv series.  It runs on the same timeline as the tv series.The beginning of the game just doesn't get ya into it until the real action starts.The story has Goerge Martin himself involved in ensuring its as intriguing as usual.The graphics were ok...they kind of have this wierd ""grow on ya"" effect where the initial poor graphics at the start (Including the glitches) seem to fade away.All in all, the environment was done very well and hey.......they gots brothels!!The combat was terrible in my opinion, you'd have to spend half of it paused to get anything done, AI was minimum.I ended up giving up on hard mode and switching to easy mode, just running through the game in beginner armor for style points. (I actually consider this awesome, because their starting gear was the best looking stuff in the game)I made it pretty far without having trouble, with a few difficulty spikes as the exception.It ruins the experience to run through it with hodgepodge armor pieces or varying types.A lot of the classes don't seem balanced properly, judging by the complaints.I recommend playing or watching it for a great story (Even has voices from the tv series) and a decent amount of moral choices to make. I didn't feel they were overall game impacting, but it was fun non the less, on a dragon age genre level.If you are a big fan of the series looking for more story and lore, I recommend it. If you are looking for an awesome in-depth RPG, this probably isn't for you.I'd happily pay $30 bucks for it to help get a sequel out on the market (Non fan biased view probably has ~15 as a proper price)			"

												Well, this is one of the most deep and rewarding stories I've ever seen in a game. The graphics are a bit dated, combat is good, but nothing remarkable, but the world and the story are awe-inspiring. Much better than any of AAA titles I've ever seen, BioWare games including. The game lists GRRM as a consultant and probably it is no brag as it meticulously recreates every detail of Westeros and mentiones and involves as minors many reconizable caracters, some even having the looks and being voiced over by the actors from the series.  9,5/10 --- Perfect			"

												It a game with many, many and many technical problems: wild cameras, bad objects hitbox, bad ui, bad AI, graphical gliches...I suppose that the QA test guys were all blind to undetect all these issues, or maybe they did but someone decided to ignore them.After all these annoying things, there is a heavy metal story, full of intrigue, hate, fury, sorrow and pain.  I find it well built around the first book of the saga.  Both characters are good, but Mors (the Nightwatch) is really awesome (a medieval terminator).The fights are quite difficult by both the enemy skills and UI issues... but never impossible.  It reminds me Dragonage mechanics.The character growth, graphics, and sound are quite good but certainly not impressive.If you seek the pure fantasy action, stay away from this game. (3/10)If you seek an intense novel, and if you are ready to start your journey into the valley of the tech. issues, and to save game many, many and many times, the story should repay you for all your efforts.

												First let me start by saying how I cannot believe this game has gotten all these bad reviews. It's not a bad game at all. Does it have it's flaws? Yes. Does it deserve all of the horrid reviews it's received? No. It's a very story and lore focused game, and if you allow yourself to immerse into the story, I believe you will enjoy it. The game itself takes place during the first book, A Game of Thrones. You will hear events from the book play out as you progress through the game. I don't think it ever goes as far as A Clash of Kings, but don't quote me on that. During the game you will switch between the two protagonists, Mor and Alester. They are very flawed characters each with a past that still haunts them 15 years later. Typically with games that have multiple protagonists, I usually like one character more than the other. But with the way they were written, I really enjoyed playing as both characters and seeing each of their stories play out. Throughout the game you will come across various characters, some are more ""meh"" than others. The antagonist of the story was well done imo. You will love to hate him. That being said... This game will at times will feel like it fits into more of a 'interactive film' sub-genre RPG game. I say that because the cutscenes can be very long winded at times, and they will happen quite often. In my opinion the game's story is extremely well done. The voice acting was actually pretty decent for the most part, even though there are a few NPC's that have laughable voice acting and animations. The leveling system tries to be complex but it is rudimentary and the gameplay will have a feeling of ""been there, done that"" if you played Dragon Age: Origin's before. The combat and dialogue systems are very similar but it's execution is mediocre at best compared to Bioware's. It feels like a generic copy. The sound track is pretty good, as it complements the setting. But some of the background music can get repetitive at times. Very repetitive. Some of the complaints I've read / heard talked about the horrid controls and graphics. I've been using the Xbox 360 controller for Windows and didn't have any control issues, and the graphics are a tad bit dated. As you play you will be able to tell where the game was quite possibly rushed in some areas. Character models and animations being one area. But as time went on I didn't mind the weak points of the game as much. Now believe it or not, this is a game where your choices do matter. The decisions you make will have an effect on the rest of the game as the story unravels. Still, I am surprised and dismayed the game does not get rated higher for it's ability to draw you into such a great story and setting. The morality of this game seems to match up with the books - there is no clear hero. Some good deeds will be scolded rather than rewarded. The villains of the world sometimes win, and innocent's can and will suffer. I would definitely recommend it for fans of George R. R. Martin's work.			"

												In spite of the poor graphics, animation and hit and miss voice acting, along with the rather basic and constrained level design, this is actually a pretty decent RPG. That's mostly down to the setting, but whoever wrote this has done a good job of capturing the Thrones world. It's certainly cheesey in places, but has a lot of atmosphere to make up for it, and I found it quite compelling for much of the game. If you have no interest in GoT, you probably shouldn't go near it, but if you like the idea of a 20ish hour RPG set in Westeros, then you should give this a whirl. Don't expect Skyrim.			"

												One of the best videogame storyline ever. There are two heroes for whom you play in turn, one having a dog. As dog, you can commit silent kills and seek out the enemy on the trail. There are a lot of twists, a few detective stories, and amazing side quests. Battle system looks like DAO or some MMO games. One of my favorite fantasy RPG on par with Witcher and DAO. I take my hat off to Cyanide Studios. Great job!			"

												I don't remember when I bought it but I remember I copped it on sale because I saw an influx of people stating it wasn't that bad. I saw it in my library and figured I'd just give it a go. The combat is in the same KOTOR style as Of Orcs and Men but not as cumbersome. It works well enough for me. I wouldn't say it's enjoyable but it works fine. Well enough for me to experience the story.Low FOV easily changeable although I would have preferred to play the game top down.The main reason I'm not recommending the game is that it has insane stutter when I turn the camera either with controller or mouse. I spent about an hour trying various fixes that didn't work until I came across a thread on their forums where they basically said ""We're unable to replicate the issues so we're not fixing it."" "

												This game could have been--and should have been--great. The story was written by George R.R. Martin himself, and it fits into the the overall story of A Song of Ice and Fire well. That said, the game clearly had a low budget. The graphics and animations are bad, the combat is boring and repetive, the environments are bland, and most of the voice acting is grating. It's almost funny how some of the characters are endearing despite looking and sounding like crap. The one saving grace is the traits system, which actually rewards (or punishes) you via stat buffs/debuffs depending on what choices you make throughout the story.This game is almost worth playing thru for the story, but you would probably be better off reading a synopsis or watching a Let's Play video. As it stands, it's a 4/10 pass for this one.			"

												Game of ThronesRatings--------Engine:         6/10Gameplay:    6/10Narrative:      5/10Emersion:     5/10Overall:     5.5/10TL;DR ReviewHalf-Pretty Linear Box world, with interesting RPG elements, and fresh combat system. Original characters, good parallel story to first season/book, although the story drags with false endings.ReviewGame of Thrones is a Third Person Perspective Role Playing Game that attempts to immerse the player in the world of HBO's adaptation of George R R Martin's, ""A Game of Thrones."" The story follows two original characters, Mors Westford and Alester Sarwyck. Both characters are sanctioned, and yet lack a lot of the flare of the characters from the book series. That said, those who like watching the show will find they are fine. The unreal engine isn't utilised to its maximum capacity, however, it is more than adequate for those looking for an interesting story to parallel the characters they enjoy from the main series. The graphics are fine, but nothing to write home about. There are a few graphical issues here and there, with objects/bodies clipping through walls, sconces, etc. The world design is a little linear, and fairly ""closed off,"" however, there are some neat features like hidden doors and alternative paths that will be discussed later. That said the weapons, armour and body/face art is not too bad, not the best, but still, the graphics utilisation for the characters allows for a deeper emersion.As with all RPGs the RPG elements are going to be important. There are plenty of good items, that seem impossible to buy, and some even stay that way, so this makes the game's item dependency fairly well balanced. The character building is pretty good, and probably one of the better features in the game. Both Mors and Alester have 5 sections to do with the character building side of things: Characteristics, Stance Skills, Ability Skills, Stats and Traits.Both characters having to choose one of three stances, and getting to specialize in a second or ""doubling down"" on their original stance at level 7. At the beginning of the game you have to place your Characteristic points much like most RPGs, these should be stacked with your stance, especially if playing on a harder difficulty. The Stance skills give your characters their combat abilities based around their weapons, whereas the Ability Skills give them abilities based on their unique abilities, that is, Mors is a Warg and has a dog (aptly named ""The Dog"" GG for creativity...) and Alester is a Red Priest of R'hllor. The character's stats affect the armour and weapon proficiencies, however, the stance they choose doubles the points placed one weapon type from each of the three weapon sections, and one armour type, obviously allowing for a more rapid spec, and increasing the gameplays dependence on items. The traits are interesting, as the name suggests, they are traits which have little bonuses. However, the starting traits require a balance between positive and negative effects. That said, as the game progresses, many other positive traits can be unlocked. Gameplay revolves around three central sections: Combat, Narrative and Exploration. Firstly, combat is not what most might expect from a 3PP RPG, there is no hacking and slashing, no button mashing... Both Mors and Alester (and the odd companion you meet throughout the story) have three orders you can place from amongst various abilities you have, these are placed in a somewhat bullet-time initiated by pressing the space bar. This is pretty cool as it allows the player to assess the situation and look at armour types, etc. Ahhhh, something I haven't mentioned yet, Armour types. There are 4 Armour Classes in Game of Thrones, unarmoured, leather, mail and plate. These correspond to three weapon types, cutting, perforating and bashing. There is a bonus 15% damage increase when using the matching weapon type, so it is important to try and match them. This is also a bit of a flaw, as you are only allowed two weapon sets at a time to switch between and changing items in the inventory is not allowed in combat, this isn’t really an issue, and most combat is fairly straight forward and victory is nearly always achievable without the need for this, but it would have been nice to have the third slot, just to even things out (as clearly it is the intention from the start to have a proficiency in one weapon type from each section, cutting perforating and bashing, yet you will assuredly find yourself sticking with, most likely, only cutting and perforating throughout the entire game). I digress... The abilities you cast/order/whatever, use a mana like resource called energy, this regens at certain rates and can be near fully regened using a restore ability once every 20 seconds.  Combat difficulty scaling is a bit unbalanced, Squire is winnable without any effort auto-attacking will win most fights. Knight will take a minor amount of effort, auto attacking will be your majority of damage which does help with energy maintenance. Lord, however, will melt your face and have you retrying most fights half a dozen times. Secondly, the Narrative sections are pretty cool, giving some depth to the story and allowing for some player choice responses, much like mass effect or knights of the old republic. These can change the course of the game and unlock traits. This is the main story telling vehicle and allows for some time to sit back and be immersed... unfortunately, towards the end of the game, I found myself fighting to stay my patience at the false endings. My housemate, Paddy, was having a good old time listening to me become enraged at how the game was being dragged out. As for the story itself, it isn't bad. I think that those who are more interested in the TV series would find this more appealing. Initially I thought the other way around, that the book fans might be more interested, however, I realise that the character depth which looked to be developing, fell off the face of a cliff and died as the two character's paths crossed over... making the title more appealing to the TV show fans, as the characters are far less complex. That said, the title IS based off the TV Canon and not the book canon. Thirdly the exploration section has some unique features, but does leave a lot to be desired. Frankly, the world map is tiny... especially for Westeros... Kings landing is smaller than my inner-city apartment, and other areas are equally small... I was expecting far more in this area. There is one saving grace though, MAGIC!! Both Alester and Mors have unique abilities, as a Red Priest of R'hllor and a Warg respectively, that they can use to interact with the environment. Mors can skinchange and use the dog to scout around, find hidden items, track scents and rip enemies’ throats out, which is neat. Alester can use his powers of R'hllor to find hidden items and door switches (usually hidden as sconces on the wall), which is less neat, but you know, we can’t all have overpowered dogs. There are some interesting sections where you have to solve puzzles and find your way around mazes, sometimes being allowed to think outside the box and avoid combat, or at least take on fewer opponents, which gives you the false illusion of free will, in an otherwise very linear, boxed off world. This game, whilst not horrible, has some woeful issues. These include world design and extreme item dependency, however, if you play on the easier difficulties, you should be able to carve through the game with little worry. Taking care to remember that this is a semi-cannon game, you won't be playing as Jon Snow, or some other ♥♥♥♥♥♥y character you heart from GRRM's♥♥♥♥♥♥fest, but you will be given a somewhat interesting storyline that parallels nicely with the first season and first book of the series (thanks to GRRM having input in the script so he didn’t have to retcon the ♥♥♥♥ out of it later).GG.

												The game itself isn't that great, the gameplay is awkward at best, trying to imitate Dragon Ages battle system, awfully. The rpg element of the game doesnt really do that much except unlock attacks, most of which you ignore as you found a pretty effective system at level 10. The Warg parts of the game happen a good part of 3 times, and each one is fairly easy to do, once you unlock the takedown skill with the dog you tend to clear out the entire map with the dog before actually doing anything.The only thing it's really good for is being a GoT game, in which case you get to see about 3 characters from the book/show. Wouldn't recommend unless you're a hardcore GoT fan and want as much story as possible.			"

												It can't be denied that this game has many flaws... The graphics are dated (they still set the mood very well and succeed in bringing the world to live, though), the camera is a complete disaster, the gameplay is VERY generic and the combat not very varied (partly due to, dictated by the setting, the fact that you almost exclusively fight humans that use no magic...) And still, of all the games that I played around the time I got it (and those include Mass Effect 3 and Diablo 3) this one, despite the worst reviews, I enjoyed the most. By far. Because, simply put, this one didn't care a a bit about the bells and whistles, but it cared about telling a fantastic story. It really cared about the setting, the mood and the lore of the world. It made you immerse into the tale and get to enjoy playing as Alaster and Mors, despite all their vices and failures. And in the end, that's what really counts. No multiplayer, no auction house, but a great story that I can't wait to see unfold. In that, GOT succeeds. Still could live with a better camera, less clunky interface or shinier graphics, though :-)			"

												I must say, I really enjoyed this game after realising I had it in my Library for around 6 Months. Previously, When i bought it, I played it and got bored after Chapter Four or around there and I completely forgot this even existed. This time when i played the story, I could not stop.Pros.-Amazing Story which is a main driving factor for the game.-Well-Done Characters, for example Alester and Mors.-Good Voice Acting.-Well-Thought out Lore and Background.-Good Locations, for example Castle Black and Kings Landing.Cons.-Not the best of Combat Systems, could do with tweaks in certain areas.-The Graphics are personally not Important to me but I feel as if the Graphics are not that good.-Some Glitches with talking where the characters would just stare at eachother, saying nothing.Overall, I think this game deserves a solid 8.5/10, Its story is absolute amazing but Its Combat does pull that down. Then, the ending was what really got me (I won't spoil) but It was well-crafted.EDIT: You will need to Scavenge and take all the loot you can get so that you can actually have the Good Equipment.

												This criminally underrated game provided about 30 hours of good and memorable fun. The main strength of this game is definitely the story. It is extremely well-written (for a video game), and provides several unexpected twists and plenty of drama and suspense.As for gameplay, its combat system is very similar to that of Dragon Age, which I personally really like. You control one or two characters at a time, and have several skills and attacks to use. Each attack consumes energy (which is the equivalent to mana), so there's quite a bit of strategy involved in finding the most efficient way to kill your enemies. Overall I found the combat very satisfying, and it grew on me as I progressed in the game.Now this is a fairly limited-budget game, so don't expect high production values. The graphics are a little dated and the cities sometimes look empty or uninhabited. The voice acting varies quite a bit, and can range from top-notch to rather poor. There are also some annoying issues with the user interface .For example, when I press ""m"" for a map, I would like to easily go back to the game by pressing ""m"" a second time, but no - the game forces you to use your mouse and click on ""resume"", which is both unnecessary and irritating . Finally, I found movement a little bit of a chore as well - as you have to hold the right mouse button in order to control where your character is looking/walking.Should you buy the game? Well here are some points to help you decide:1. This game is very focused on the story and there is a lot of dialogue. If you find that boring, you will hate this game. Avoid it.2. This game is realistic, in the sense that there's no magic, no special abilities, nothing like this.3. Combat is like in Dragon Age or Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. It is point and click, or in other words, you order an attack, and you wait for the character to execute it. It requires more strategy than skill4. This is not an open-world game. There are some side quests, but there's not much exploration to be done. The different cities and locations on the map are not connected. Once again, this is similar to Dragon Age's world, but it's smaller.Other than that, if you like RPGs and the above four points don't bother you, you will probably enjoy this game.			"

												I liked this game! A nice story with some good RPG elements with choices and skilltrees. I also enjoyed the DLC with Mors story on how he became known as ""The Butcher""! You get to see some of the characters from the GoT-series, but this is a standalone story and I like it that way!A nice game worth your time and effort!			"

												If you've ever watched the Game of Thrones series, you've most likely wanted to get right into the lands of Westeros. Well, here is your chance. Before anything else, if you prefer combat and graphics over story, this is not the game for you. Trust me, you'll only get dissapointed. However, if you like a good story, you have to try it out. You won't regret it. The principle of the game is simple. You play the game as two characters, one of them is more of an tank and the other is mainly a DPS (it does also depend on how you build them). The story will lead you trough multiple locations, including the Wall and King's Landing. I won't say anything more because I don't want to spoil anything. The character progression is quite simple, you can level up different skills that tailor the way your character is played. By the end both become quite overpowered (at least for me) and are butchering everybody around them. While the combat system is nothing special and is a bit clunky, it is decent and gets the job done. One more thing to mention is that if you like to explore and gather ""epic loot"" you will get to do that in this game too (however some of the items the merchants are offering are to expensive to ever be bought). If you're a Game of Thrones fan and/or like a game with good story, I highly recommend for you to get this game, you won't regret it.8/10			"

												This is a typical wester RPG. The strongest point of the game is the story, although I didn't watch a single episode of GoT I found myself really into the characters and their world, I also find myself being attached to some characters just to suddently see them die :(. The gameplay is quite simple compared to other RPGs, which may satisfy more action-oriented players like me, do not expect the character developing to be complex, it's pretty straight-forward. on the technical size the game those well in general.Now to the cons: first, the camera angel is frustrating, you'll often find yourself confused about what's going on, especially in tight places; the some of the game mechanics are not explained so  well by the tutorials, so you'll maybe a bit confused sometimes; animations and cutscenes are quite poor and far from interesting; the choises you make through the game don't affect the ending so much.Overall it's a very simple RPG with a very good story and decent gameplay. 7.5			"

												Never watched the show or read the books but after finishing this, I feel like I probably should. Picked it up in a bundle a long time ago. Tried it out for a short while but couldn't get in to it. Didn't have a clue what was going on, the game felt slow & clunky, the graphics subpar with poor FOV and overused blurry Depth Of Field that made me feel like I had cataracts. Eventually gave up less than one hour in.Fast forward a few months and I decided to try again. Read on the forums that it's a good idea to play the 'Beyond The Wall' DLC before the main game, so that's what I did. At last I was getting somewhere, the main game intro now had some context and made more sense after finishing the DLC. Followed some tweak guides and was able to disable DoF, increase the Field of View and get the graphics more to my liking. Long story short - a couple of hours in and I was hooked. The story is everything here and renders the games shortcomings an irrelevance. Dark, grim and definitely not full of sunshine and kittens, if you value story over gameplay then you really need to give this a shot.8/10. An underrated rough gem of a game.			"

												This game was tragically under estimated from the moment it was released. Once you get through the introduction and preface scenes in the beginning of the game you are no longer playing as a character in some game but you feel as if you are transformed into the main characters and you forget that you are playing a video game. Someone obviously♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in the cornflakes of all of the major game reviewers right before they gave their opinions of this game. It was blantantly obvious they did not play more than 30 minutes of the actual game and the rest of the drivel they wrote came from the pamphlet that was inserted into the box. The little bit of the game they did play, it was quite clear that they were not paying attention to the story being unfolded or the characters they were playing because all they could do was complain about the graphics art not being up to their ""standards"" and how the combat system took actual strategy and forethought in order to win a battle.The story line itself was captivating and full of constant twists and turns. Nothing was as it appeared to be throughout the entire gaming experience and by the time you reach the end you are blown away because NO ONE saw that ending coming. Unlike many rpgs out there that try to create the illusion that you are making the decisions for your character that matter in the world around you, this game actually does make all of your choices have consequences. Sometimes they are immediately revealed and other decisions that you thought were trivial end up drastically changing major plot lines throughout the game. While it is a colossal cliche it applies to this game whole-heartedly, ""I laughed, I cried, it became a part of me.""I highly recommend this game to anyone that deeply enjoys real rpgs and is starving for orginality and complete immersion into the rpgs they play. While this game was not on the same financial budget as say Skyrim, it is a testament to the developers of this game that they spent all of their energy and money into making a quality game that surpasses any of the blockbuster games that have been released in the last couple of years.

												It's not actually a bad game. Yes, the combat is simple and dull and some of the mechanics almost seem unfinished, but the story is great and there is TONS of lore, dialogue and codex entries for fans of the series to enjoy. If you are not familiar with Game of Thrones, don't bother buying this. On the other hand, if you love the series, It's worth a few euros. 29,99€ is definetly too much, but for example Humble Bundle offered this game for any price you want to pay.			"

												This is not just a cash-in for a popular tv series. I've played awful games based on popular shows before (The Sopranos, Lost, The Shield) and those all reaked of a rush job. Game of Thrones RPG is different. It's clear that lots of time, effort, and talented ability went into this game. There are plenty of details and fan service without it feeling obnoxious.This is a linear RPG, so it does lack the content that open world RPGs will have (for instance, maps are fairly small and there aren't many side quests). It also has a combat system that feels optimized for consoles. However, the game's story unfolds with a good, quick pace. The writing frequently cribs from the show, but while some passages are bad, the moments of great writing more than make up for it. Highly recommend to fans of GoT - moderately recommend to fans of RPGs.			"

												I bought this game during a summer Steam sale. Played it for an hour and hated it. The combat was clunky, the controls unseemly.  Then I started reading the reviews here that said it was a good game. So I gave it another chance. Wow, was I wrong. Once you figure out the battle tactics (switching between your party, choosing attacks three steps in advance, etc.) you discover this is a pretty good game. Especially if you are a GoT fan. All of a sudden I was jumping between my character at the Wall and the one in the Red Keep with eager anticipation. A great story, with great dialogue, and great characters (including Varys, Cercei, and others.)  Yes the combat is still a little clunky (heaven forbid I face 5 degrees to the left on my intended target!) but overall this is a wonderful experience. If you are a fan of the novels and/or TV show I strongly recommend this story-driven, dialogue-rich, RPG. It's like a whole new episode of GoT that takes place right before Season 1, Episode 1.			"

												While the game itself overall is not horrible, calling it ""the game of the decade"" would require a lot of brain damage to the point of not knowing how to breathe.Combat and the game mechanics in general is an extremely cheap Witcher 1/MMO ripoff based sorely on chance hits. It feels like a chore going from point A to B and back while every other step, there's a combat sequence. Every other step, there's some scripted bad guys you have to meet that initiates a combat sequence where you're quite literally thrown into the foray of big armored baddies which gets annoying after a while, especially when you have no health potions or companions. Alternate mechanics include a lot of talking yourself out of trouble and walking down very linear paths to encounter more baddies or an overly long conversation.The graphics quality of the game is a tad dated, in which I have no high standards over, however it will upset some, considereing it's a game that had been released in 2012. But the worst part is the loading time to get the god damn textures in. I swear that they load textures and NPCs only within a 20 meter radius of the player character.I have a Windows 7 64-bit Operating System AMD Athlon(tm) II X2 250 with a 3.00 GHz Processor.My personal system you see, is no spring flower in full bloom, but ♥♥♥♥ me if I can get this game to not lag horrendously when there's more than 8 NPCs about. I have a far easier time loading high-res textures in Skyrim than I do even trying to load a save file. Hell, it takes a good 5-7 minutes just to get the damn game to launch, just enough time for me to make a filling platter of sandwhiches, chips, and a drinks and come back to find the game still trying to launch. It's quite annoying considering once again, a dated design and simplistic mechanics.The very redeeming quality of the game which barely lifts it up from being♥♥♥♥♥♥ is the plot. I'm unfamiliar with the Game of Thrones franchise and I hear the story itself is really interesting, and fortunately, I wasn't dissapointed, in fact quite intrigued. Considering the game's namesake, it is of course, feudal politics, feuding, and intrigue, which all makes a great plot. This was pretty much the only reason why you see that I've played the game for so long, sometimes late into the night. But of course, it's dragged around a lot in between all the running from point A to B and all the combat sessons. It's very, very, VERY long, which in a way considering all the other boring♥♥♥♥♥♥you have to put up with in-game. I guess the real flaw in the story is that it constantly pulls you back and forth between two characters, one character who's timeline is happening in ""the present day"" and the other whose timeline of events occured a couple of months earlier. Obviously, you'll see that the events that these two men go through eventually collide at some point, but that hasn't occured quite yet at my point of the story (which is about 17 hours in), just more evidence on how incruciatingly long the game is. In some way or another, directly or indirectly, choices made by the player influence the future chain of events either immediately or in the long run, which is a very great story mechanic. So in all fairness, the story is the saving grace of this game, but the very annoying combat mechanics, linearity of the story, and an escorting mission finally pushed me over the edge from being annoyed to plain rage inducing fury.Regular retail price is 20 dollars, and I pity any soul who's actually willing to pay that much. Hell, I spent 5 dollars on this game during the 2014 summer sale and I'm still very much questioning if I actually got my money's worth out of it. It makes me a tad depressed how some games that were actually good, both new and old, were on sale for the same price, much less being the same retail price or lower.Overall: 3/10I really do want to give the game writer a hug right now, cause it's obvious s/he's the one who lifted this game from being a flat out 0/10. But that just wasn't enough compared to the ♥♥♥♥♥iness of the gameplay and weirdly rendered graphics overall.In my humble opinion, stick to the books or the television show and hope the plot of this game isn't considered cannon.

												This game got lots of negative critique which I just can't understand. The graphics may be a bit outdated and there is no open world to explore, but it stays very true to the concept of GRRM book series and GoT. The story is amazing and I wasn't invested in a game that much for a long time since every chapter (it is made like the books in a POV style where you skip between characters) ends pretty much with a cliffhanger. The voice acting may not be over the top (especially NPCs except for Varys and Jeor Mormont who are voiced by the actors), but not that bad.The numerous references not only to the HBO show but also the ASoIaF books make it very delightful for fans. However, the story is the main reason why one should play it. It's not the typical RPG story like ""Rescue the World from certain doom"" but rather about personal motivations.The gameplay is a two-edged sword, hate it or love it. I found the slow-motion attack selection very refreshing, the abilities of skin-changing and manipulating fire was also extremly creative.			"

												The visuals may not be stunning, and the combat system is a bit simplistic, but the game is still worth a play for the story. The characters are well built and the plot is filled with the backstabbing and muder you would expect from Game of Thrones. It is a story that runs parallel to the HBO series with a different set of main characters, but some characters from the original series do make appearences with voice actors from the TV series.The game plays a lot like Dragon Age. You can select a class, progress along a skill tree, and obtain better equipment. The combat animations are simplistic as one would expect from the Game of Thrones universe as it is not as fantasy heavy as Dragon Age. This leaves the combat feeling a bit stale. Fortunately, there is enough variation in the skills effects that in the harder difficulty levels you will have to plan your attack pattern if you want to win.In pretty much every aspect this game falls short of Dragon age origins and the ending of Dragon Age 2 since that was the only good part of that game. It is still worth purchasing on sale if you enjoy interactive stories. This one you can even direct a bit, and your character will even gain new traits according to your decisions.			"

However, the combat, controls, and visuals are all pretty much just adequate.  There are a good number of small bugs mainly dealing with the camera and walking controls.  The voice acting is also pretty hit and miss with people mispronouncing names and speaking as if they don't understand the context of what they're saying.			"

If you are not familiar with the series or the books you might be disappointed with how the story turns out.It is a solid story telling game, so if you are interested in a good (and dark) story you should give it a try.Cons:From the technical aspect the game is far from up to date. Also the intput and GUI is ""consolish"" and needs some time. Over all I would NOT recommend the game for somebody who looks for a RPG without interest or knowlege about ""The game of thrones "" series/books.  "

												I don't understand all the hate this game is generating. Game mechanics are sub-par as I'm sure you'll know if you read some other reviews, but it's not nearly as horrible as they make it sound; besides, if you don't care for the gameplay, you should be able to cruise through most fights with ease anyway. The story is pretty solid and often presents you with interesting choices. Voice acting is somewhat poor, but I'm one of those impatient people that always read the subtitles faster than the voice-over and then skip to the next line, so that doesn't matter a lot to me. Graphics are ok, they might not stand out but they never get in the way either to spoil the atmosphere. As of this review I spent 11 hours in game and the end is still not in sight, so for the price I paid (humble bundle) it was definitely worth it. If you're a GoT fan and see this game on sale, make sure to grab it.			"

												I honestly thought this game was going to be a bust. But it turned out to be the complete opposite. Unlike the HBO series, it follows the tales of two strong men (no peepee shows either) on their journeys. To even out the experience of playing the two, they switch between both main characters every chapter. It get's more exciting as you go along the story, it has PLENTY of epic challenges to offer, and the story and voice acting is just amazing. Even with low graphics, I played a total of 8 hours in my first play. Still not finished, but it got me so wriled up and excited that it exhausted me to sleep. Definately give this tile a look at if you're at least in to the book series by George R.R. Martin. I give tis title a 9 out of 10!			"

												This game has an amazing story and soundtrack (same as the TV series), the 2 main characters are really good and I loved they way you got to play them (It reminded me of the books). The game has a TON of combat and the combat system felt weird at first, but I ended up enjoying it.I didn't like the camera at all nor the lack of detail of some of the environments but this is not enough to make it a bad experience.

												If you like Game of Thrones, you'd enjoy this game. The story and plot are well done. The actual gameplay is average, but I don't think it deserves the low scores it received. It can be frustrating in the beginning, but about halfway through you can just plow through everything. If you play this, it's because you'd enjoy more back story to season 1 of Game of Thrones.			"

												This is an excelllent game. If you enjoyed the witcher series, you defenitely need to pick this up. I am appalled by the negative reviews. This is a story and an experience. One of the strongest stories I have ever experienced in a game, It truly kept me coming back for more. I didnt know anything about the game of thrones before this game, and ended up buying all the seasons after. The texture quality is high, the voice acting is superb, the gameplay is decent(identical to dragon age). It is truly an injustice this game has a 58. I would suggest the negative reviewers are not avid readers, or have the patience to engage in thoughtful RPG's. Not a game for impatient people who skip cutscenes. "

												Adds another tale to the GoT universe, and fits in well with the series. The game has quite a bit of story telling and isn't all action.

												In my opinion this was a good game, i will admit at first it is a bit strange with the combat system and how the game changes from each story line.  However all i can say is stick with the story line and it will all make sense and in the end was a great campaign story. I picked it up for £3.74 on the summer sale and for that price and if you like game of thrones its a no brainer.			"

												This is a low budget game, take note of that before buying it.But despite that, it still managed to entertain me and the story itself is a dark one, wherein your choices will shape how the game world will react to you and it will affect how the game plays and how the game will end.The combat in this game isn't as refined but it isn't half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I found myself enjoying the many skill combinations that allowed me to mete out death to my many opponents. The graphics aren't as good as other games released in 2012 but they are good in their own right, i personally loved how the heavy armors looked. Very imposing, very powerful and lord-like.I dislike the fact that you cannot replay the chapters or any of the missions at all without starting a new game and the fact that there is no new game+ option. Such a shame, i would have loved to explore other decisions in specific chapters in game without having to replay the whole thing again. The idle animations default to that one pose where the hand is on the hip for some reason, it looks awkward as the player character and many of the npc ones shift from a talking animation to the hand+hip idle every 2 seconds.All in all, i recommend this game for the story and the enjoyment i got out of it and i think you will enjoy the game as well despite the flaws it has. Get it in a bundle or on sale, doesn't matter. Just get it.Hell, George R.R. Martin is in the game.8/10			"

Still I recommend it to all Game of Thrones fans and RPG fans simply because of amazing storyline.I've completed the game outside Steam and bought it again on Steam just for the DLC (which sadly is much worse than the base game) - that's why it shows that I played for just two hours.

												I know I have not played much of this game, 2.4 hours as I'm writing this, but I still must say that it is one of the best third person rpg games I've ever played. I say this because there is extensive amounts of dialogue, which I happen to enjoy, as it conveys story, as well as it's strategic combat system and it's lore. When I say lore, I mean that  it's a game about game of thrones, which is my second favorite show of all time. It's combat system is hard to get the hang of at first, unless you've played Of Orcs and Men, because it's quite a lot like that.It's also nice to know that If you don't like one storyline that you're playing in the game, there's always the other to look forward to. One storyline is about a Night's Watch Veteran, Mors, and the other is about the eldest son of the Lord of a town he deserted 15 years prior, and his name is Alester. I personally prefer Alester, because he's a more interesting character in a more interesting plot line, wereas Mors is fairly interesting in a storyline that is difficult and honestly somewhat boring. But any reader of this review should still recognize that I've not played much of the game, so I can't truthfully describe each of the storylines and what they are like.Alester's storyline, so far, is that he left his town 15 years ago because he didn't want to keep being reminded by the past, but leaving emotionally destroyed his father and sister, throwing the town into turmoil. He returns after his fathers death and that's where the player starts, so i won't reveal any more about it.Mors storyline is that he is part of the night's watch, and has been for about 15 years, when his friend he's been with for those fifteen years attempts to desert the Watch, resulting in the consequences that any fan of the show or books will already know. Mors is then put in command of 4 new recruits, who he must take to track down a Watchmen who has broken one of his vows. That's where the player must continue from.So far my pros and cons are:Pros:+lots of dialogue with mass effect like choices+varying storylines+interesting strategic combat+fairly good visuals+moral choices that affect the future+cutscenes are skippableCons:-Cutscenes around every corner-High prices at merchants-Dialogue is a bit wordy-Camera mostly restrictedMisc:*Doesn't remind you to check character screen when you level up*Rarely autosaves- remember to manually save periodicallyOverall score:8.5/10 - greatly recommended for GoT/ aSoLaF fans			"

												Realistically, you’ll more likely stop after the fifteenth loading screen appears only to trigger another dryly executed piece of this mess than carry on. I do not have the wherewithal to endure the 20 or so hours of bad game to get to the really juicy story moments. On the story; it’s surrounded by lazy voice acting, and poorly textured environments. This Game runs like a dog on a high end machine (runs skyrim maxed) while having pretty poor graphics. The controls are nonsensical. You spend more time listening to dialog which has no point than actually doing anything. The stats system is awkward. Combat is weird and hard to control. I think I spent more time looking at loading screens then actually doing anything. When I wasn't looking at a loading screen, I was listening to a character preach on about things that have no bearing on the story.			"

Angry? Sad? Happy? Whatever emotion you want to convey, that hand on hip pose totally does the trick.

												Game of Thrones The Role Playing GameREVIEW FROM LIGHT RPG PLAYERStoryThe story is of 2 main characters that are both playable. Mors Westford a sworn brother of the night's watch who has been a member for 15 years and at the beginning is hunting down deserters of the night's watch. Alester Sarwyck a red priest who dissapeared 15 years ago and has returned to his home town of Riverspring to find it in its worst state poverty, riots and his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ brother Valaar is set to marry his sister and become lord of Riverspring. About half way through the game these 2 characters meet up and together thwart the plot that threatens the kingdom and exact vengeance apon those who have made them suffer.GameplayThe combat is a tactical RPG (like dragon age) that has energy involved when you run out of energy you have to wait for it to recharge or use a potion so you can use your special attacks again. It is a very simple combat system to learn but hours to master it is fun and a different take on combat like The Witcher series for example. However towards the end of the game the combat becomes both frustrating and difficult to pull through a fight I played this on the easiest difficulty and I found it difficult till the very end.GraphicsYou normally won't see a graphics section on my reviews but I have to mention it for this game the graphics are awful if you have bought a really good computer to run a really graphically enhanced game like Battlefield 4 don't get this game the graphics really are awful and there should be no excuse for a 7 year project which is what this game was. An example of how bad they are is that most characters will fold their arms this completely ruins the immersion as one arm is inside of the other it looks terrible so again if graphics are your thing don't get this game.Open WorldNow technically this game has an open world however it is in sections like in Assassins Creed however if you are a huge fan of the show like myself then you will love the locations in this game they look almost exactly like they do on the show. An example of this is The Throne Room when you enter you can see all the pillars that are in the show and of course The Iron Throne it really is the best we can get in a video game until we play the telltale version of this world.Voice ActingIn this game the voice acting is not AAA it is ok the majority of characters you meet have average voice acting but with it being a Game of Thrones game the voice talents of Lena Headey, James Cosmo and Conleth Hill are used with the charcters Cersei Lannister, Joer Mormont and Lord Varys these actors and Lena Headey had an interest in the game and they provided their voice work which is really good it's great to see how devoted they are to the show and the fan base. But now onto Mors and Alester's voices at the beginning Mors sound like a british Batman which is quite hilarious however as you play more you get used to it. Alester is at best above average voice acting which is fine for a main character.Final VerdictI will be honest if this RPG was not called Game of Thrones I never would have played it however this game has one of the best stories in gaming and should be played for that, the combat is good, the graphics are awful, the locations are great and the voice acting is ok.Game of Thrones The Role Playing Game8/10Would spend £3.74 again!

												I've heard many bad tales about this game... horror stories how bad it is. How you had to avoid it.I didn't care; and played it anyway... and I am so glad that I did. This is a GREAT RPG. Great!The story is intense, adult and interesting. There are some weavements in to the show (and books?) that you probably understand better than me if you watched/read them. Even if you didn't you can still easily follow this game's plotline and enjoy it. It truly is one of the best story-lines I have experienced in a game.So good infact that yes, it allows one to overlook the weaker points of this game. It starts rather slow, but name me one RPG that doesn't. It's very conversation-heavy, which would scare off some, but is like the perfect thing for me and many RPG-fans. There can be very large stints without combat or ""action""Which is good, since the combat isn't exactly amazing. While complex enough, with various armor and damage types, many skills and abilities it's just... jarring. It's usually not much fun, which makes it fortunate it usually doesn't last that long. Mostly it consists of finding good combo's (x knocks out, y does bonus damage on knocked down foes) and hope for the best. I've lost fights heavily, and then won them using the exact same tactics without loosing any health at all on reload, so the combat results can be highly random.Back on the good side; this game features *many* great additions many RPG's could profit from having. The 2 storylines that start appart and closely come together and merge and then allows you to make the end-choice is great. It really helps avoiding story-fatigue if you don't get all of it in a large mesh-up. Downside is that you have to pay attention, it can be confusing if you don't. This is not a game just to relax and not think. You need to pay attention. Another great action is the dog, allowing you to sniff out clues, hidden rewards and take down lone guards (very advised since aforementioned combat). The counter-part fire view is sorely lacking in comparrison.Other great additions you will notice throughout, and might be spoilerish so I wont go into details expect that you really should loose the boss-fight once. That's just pure genious that other games lack, you'll know what I talk about when you see it.Another downside is the extremely unoptimalised graphics. You'll often notice stuttering, and FPS might drop to it's knees looking at a wall, while a giant city-overview runs fine. This stuttering behavior can make it hard to navigate about and is overall extremely annoying, and probably the single most giant downside of this game sadly enough. It looks good enough, but it's performance is terrible. Some areas of the city I tried avoiding just because I knew they would drop my framerate to it's knees.However, I really suggest to get yourself through the horrors of the optimalisation and (infrequent) combat to experience  what this game's plotline and conversations have to offer you. You'll not regret it playing to the end and experience it all. Definitely one of the biggest surprises to me these last few years. No RPG fan should miss this one out...			"

												Amazing story! If the Game of Thrones universe interest you the least, you should definitaly play this! I haven't been playing games for a long time, but this one right here glued me the the screen again! Gameplay mechanics are so-so, but playing on easy mode gives one plenty of time to enjoy the story! Really good story, so many twists like the series			"

												This game sometimes seem unfinished. Camera tend to be stuck behind doors or walls, mostly when you are in places such as a narrow room or a corridor. When you pause the fight, camera often shakes.  And above all, on certain cases, you will command your character to attack someone, then switch to your ally only to result in your character attacking anyone else but the one you told him to kill.BUT.The story gets really addictive as you play. You won't see Jon Snow, Robb Stark or any main character of the story, as the plot resides in two original characters. But you will be glad to hear of them now and then. Even a true GoT fan can be surprised to find someone unexpected as a NCP ( no spoiler, of course, but this appearance was awesome ).I started the game last week, and finished it after 32hours on it. Definitely worth the money.			"

												I own more than three hundred games, almost a third of which are on steam. This game provided me more problems than all of them combined save one. The only game to provide me more technical problems than this one is Game of Thrones: Genesis. The game has a long, long line of technical problems that have not been fixed in a good long while.Yet.. Eventually one may manage to get past all of the problems. And when you do...The game is sorely lacking as far as an RPG goes. Now it is reasonably faithful to the flavor set forth by the HBO series I shall quite well agree. But lacks for the fandom in a great many ways. Forget joining and playing with your favorite house. Forget hoping in and making a character of your own design that you can be proud of. Forget being able to experience the world at your own pace. You can however expect to be ping ponged back and forth between two very static storylines that you almost can't control at all in many places.There were some times when I deliberately tried to play the character in a way to try to deliberately fail as hard as I could. I got a few rude remarks yet the scene and story played out the same as if I played with white-knight syndrome. Losing a fight is fairly difficult and they pretty much fight themselves without much player input required.While I am sure any game of thrones fan will want this no matter what I say, in the end it felt more like an ""almost"" interactive movie and less like an RPG.Only a couple hours in and the game is already half done. At this rate the total gameplay till completion will be 10-12 hours.			"

												I'll preface this by saying that I really like the Game of Thrones series, so it's not about disliking the content or anything (what little of it I saw in this game). I bought the other game made by Telltale, and liked it well enough. And so, encouraged by the positive reviews I read, I thought maybe this one would be interesting.I really, REALLY wanted to like this title, but sadly I couldn't play it long enough to draw conclusions about the game content itself; due to all the issues that started popping up. Of course I wish I could have played further into the game before posting a review, but no sale. It's terrible. My computer isn't exactly perfect but it isn't the worst either. I can play Skyrim and Bioshock Infinite on it without a problem. Yet somehow the cinematics on this game had characters that looked like floating sets of clothing with teeth, eyeballs, and discolored blotches like a toddler got loose with the crayons and doodled all over a world map. And whenever it wasn't bugging out, the graphics were shoddy at best, with a handful of textures that looked moderately adequate.The battle system glitched out to high hell also. I was left sittin' there like a lemon, unable to move, with no status ailments that I was aware of, with full energy, then I noticed...I AM moving, but... at a pace that makes glaciers look like Turbo. Oh, joy.Good thing I bought it on sale. I'm going to give it another try sometime for the sake of saying I gave it a fair shake, but I'm not holding my breath. What a let-down.			"

												Not really a fan of this one. I got this game in some big 20-ish game or so package and had never played it until one of my friends who was a huge fan of Game Of Thrones wanted to see if it was good or not. Here is our opinion of the game after only playing about an hour: (I understand some people may not think that 1 hour is enough to have a good representation of the game, but I can confidently say it was an hour that let me know I didn't want to play the game.) -For an RPG game the character seemed bland regardless of options-Dialouge options lead to the same outcome and were irrelevant-Combat was unoriginal as I've seen them somewhere else, but I can't remember where. Needless to say I'm not that big of a fan regarding combat like this. -Not sure who all voice-acted the game, but at times it seemed like multiple people had the same voice actor.-Story did look like it might go somewhere, which is good. -My friend said he didn't feel like he was playing a Game Of Thrones game and expected more from it. -Camera movement makes the game annoyingWhile I have listed bad things about the game, I don't mean to say it's a bad game, just not a good one. There's nothing special about the game, nothing that excites me. If you're looking for a run of the mill game to pass the time with and aren't looking for quality, this could be the game for you. I just personally know I won't be returning to play the game.			"

												Game Of Thrones: The Role-Playing Game (GoT: RPG) feels like a game from yesterday and yesteryear, while also certainly delivering its own spin on the RPG genre. The story is Chapter-based and switches b/t two characters: Mors Westford (of the Night's Watch) and Alester Sarwyck (a Red Priest) - old friends who have not seen each other in numerous years. They are both trying to find a certain girl that some groups and those on or near The Iron Throne are looking for, in this excellent story loaded with a web of secrets, lies, twists, turns, and (of course) conspiracies.Combat feels somewhere b/t the combat of the original campaign for Neverwinter Nights [NWN] (have control on two party members at once) & Dragon Age: Origins [DA:O] (real-time combat with a pause allowed for strategy). Though, parties you control never get as big as DA:O (even if there are other NPC's who help you and you have no control over) and the pause isn't a full-blown pause - here, the ""pause"" only slows time here, which makes the game feel more action-like. Once you have more skills behind you, the gameplay certainly gets better and a bit more strategic. The combat here though lacks the flashy & showy nature that made games like Dragon Age 2 just look awesome. The graphics technically often come off as dated & looks like they should've been released back when DA:O came out. While some character models & and areas look fine, others who aren't as important often come off as bland and/or are just there. The voice-acting is all over the place, ranging from poor to really good - where most of the best acting comes from either the main characters in the story & also those actors and characters who are also on the GoT HBO TV show (like Varys). Interesting enough, there is an option in the game menu to even mute/turn-off the voice-acting completely. Also worth noting - sometimes, the dialogue might come off a bit stilted, unfortunately. If there is anything that this game nails and other companies should take notes on, it's the actual storytelling, characters, lore & GoT universe. GoT: RPG delivers a fantastic story & plot. B/c the game is done in a Chapter-based format & will often hit you with a cliffhanger just like the TV show does, you'll want more - though since this game is complete here, you'll have the feeling of wanting to just keep on playing to see what happens next; or maybe continue even further than that to see maybe even what happens a bit later; or maybe even be compelled to continue even more! Throw on top of this that there are constant jaw-dropping plot twists & even moral decisions for players to make in the main story and even on side quests, this game will certainly keep the player engaged and immersed into the story and actual game-world itself.Even despite its dated nature in some regards and a bunch of minor issues, that can't stop GoT: RPG from sitting on its very own throne. It's the game's characters, lore, GoT universe, the actual adventure itself, & its lengthy story (which took me somewhere around 42 hours, BTW) that are excellent and certainly do make GoT:RPG as memorable as it is.Final Grade: B-			"

												The combat system is neither real-time nor turn-based: you slow down the game (semi-pause) to issue commands to your fighters. Special abilities can be synergic, and that synergy also applies to abilities of another fighter (i.e. your first character's ability can enhance your second character's ability, apart from his own). The decisions you make alter the outcomes (and the endings) of the game, and each of the two characters can play three different classes each, so there is replayability value.If you like Dragon Age: Origins and A Song of Ice and Fire / Game of Thrones, you will like this game.

I thought i could get past the poor gameplay if the story was good but it is impossible to be immersed in either as the combat has you pausing constantly and just mashing your abilities with very little consequence of doing anything wrong and the story is let down by awful voice acting characters that show no emotion or movement during emotional scenes. To top it all off the writting is really bad, coming into this after reading the books the dialogue is cringe worthy expostition. I really wouldn't bother even if you are a fan :\			"

But anyway , there aren't many interactions during a fight, i mean, the fighters look like they were slashing the air when they hit, like in The Witcher.I'm a fan of the TV series and RPGs, but i can't recommend this game. i think i got it on HB or IG, so my wallet didn't hurt.. so, if you want to try it:-Buy it if it is in a sale.-Watch some gameplay videos to get your own ideas.ps: I haven't played a good videogame ripped from a movie or series, so i didn't have many expectations anyway.SPA:Cuando empecé a jugar a este juego, estaba muy emocionado, especialmente con la introducción épica, los buenos pero no increíbles gráficos, y los escenarios, pero a medida que la historia continúa me cansé de tantas escenas.El modo de combate es interesante, pero me esperaba algo más tipo hack n' slash.

Either go for a FF system with turn based style game or go for a Diablo system and make us able to bind attacks to single buttons. This is pc, not xbox or playstation.

												Game of Thrones: The Role Playing Game, is, by far, the WORST game I have ever had the misfortune of playing. The story was bland and predictable, there were no big plot twists that fans have come to expect from the Game of Thrones series of books and the combat was complicated, frustrating, and quickly became repetitive. I will give the game credit for being bold enough to try a new type of gameplay, however, it was perhapse to0 bold. The game becomes unplayable when its graphics are turned up past the default; while it doesn't cause lag, it causes characters and objects to look like swiss cheese, with polygons missing from the model, allowing you to see through it. In finalaty, I would give this game a 1/10. I only give it a 1 because it was actually able to run.			"

												The Storytelling in this game is the best I´ve experienced in a long time! Definitely so much better and thought out than  even almost every AAA title. The progression feels right, theres enough items to customise your character, the battles are challenging and secrets as well as sidequests enrich the whole storyline. It's like that first Mass Effect, the perfect story with just the right amount of suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. I want more of this!			"

												Mechanically, yes the game has issues, from last generation map structure, some seemingly broken quests and a bit of a cackhanded targetting system, but bloody hell the story.This could fit right into the main novel and be considered intrecal. With plenty of intregue and ""Holy sh*t did that just happen"" moments anyone who is a fan of the novels should obtain this at their earliest convenience.			"

												Talking.  Talking.  Talking.  More talking.  Great for someone who wants a story.  I want an RPG where I play a game.  I don't want to listen to 10 minutes of conversation and then fight for 1 minute, then run around and listen to 10 more minutes of conversation.Lesson: never click on an NPC who might talk to you.  You'll be stuck for 10 MORE minutes.  All of the reviewers with 20+ hours in this game?  Clicked on an NPC.10/10 would listen to more talking again.			"

												No risks, plain jane, budget RPG. Very very linear, with maybe a few distractions/sidequests, but mostly you run in a straight line and hope that you built your character right because you can't go off and grind on things to get more powerful. The dialogue was unengaging, the story tried to really hook me but has failed to keep my attention by the repetitive and soul-less voice acting. Calling this a budget RPG, or an RPG, is using the term very loosely. The leveling system looks like it would be interesting, but the skills do little unless you put a lot of points in to them (a LOT). I chose one of the character's classes (a Water Dancer), just to have it so down the main storyline I have to wear medium armor. Sure, I can wear light armor still by just re-equipping it, but if I use light armor, everything kills me very quickly. I thought, ""Well, maybe I can just get some better lighter armor"". I have yet to find a merchant that even sells for cheap enough for me to afford. I can't go out and grind for XP and money, I'm stuck on these rails. Finally I ended up getting stuck in Chapter 4 because everything kills me very quickly (mostly, archers). I even tried turning down the difficulty, and I still get killed just as fast...This game took no risks, and it feels like a mix between The Witcher and Dragon Age: Origins, with all the good story, choices, and fun combat taken out. They put you on rails, failing to deliver a compelling storyline of any sort, failing to let you truly explore the world to your leisure. Every time I try to get in to the story, I just become disgusted with another thing this game does wrong. Don't buy the DLC, don't buy the game, unless you have a real obsession with the Game of Thrones universe. I'm glad I got this crap in a humble bundle, it's not even worth a fraction of the $2 I spent.EDIT: Some things I forgot to add: There is no character creation. The most customization you will get is your choice of equipment and most of the other weapons don't even show in the cutscenes. The choices you do get to make during dialogue honestly don't matter that much. Let me put it this way, if you played Dragon Age Origins, loved the choices, then played Dragon Age 2 and went ""Euuugh, smh"", that's about what I felt with this game's dialogue and choices.			"

												I'm really struggling with this game. On a side we have one of the best storyline written in the last years of videogames, and the other side an atrocious hollow, boring and laughable gameplay mechanics.If this was delivered more like a telltale game (the walking dead, wolf among us and so on) this would have been a spectacular 9/10.But since this game is depicted as an rpg it fails BIG TIME.The combat system it's absolutely b.u.l.l.s.h.i.t. You cannot prearrange any sort of tactic to take care of your companion I.A. so everytime you want to use a special ability you have to switch to your companion character and make him use the ability you want to.The enemies are divided in 3 types: cloth armor, leather, mail and plate. Each of these are weak against a certain type of weapon (cutting, smashing, perforating) providing a 15% bonus damage when the proper weakness gets spoiled fighting the right enemy with the right type of weapon. All good right? Nope. Because infact you can equip only  2 type of weapon at time. Ok, you can equip 4, but there's no point in doing it, because the 15% bonus wouldn't make up for the fact that you're not skilled enough to use that weapon, so you will end up missing more than hitting your opponent. So you'd end up picking two type of weapons to specialize in and stick to them, making them level up once every level (you will be able to rise the skills to a max of 100, for example you want to get good using two hands swords, you'd rise the swords skill under the cutting tree of the weapons)If you manage to get through this (especially in the first few hours of the game, i'd say atleast six) you'll be rewarded with a fantastic storyline, and at times yes, it will make up making you almost forget all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t this game brings to the table. Ah, and i wished (except done in some cases) they'd use much better voice actors, some of them are coming through seriously flat, which is a bugger since this game has such an elaborate and fine storyline to tell. Atleast some of the were good.This could have been so much better if instead of trying to ""milk the games of throne cow"" it would have been properly give its time to develop gameplay wise.I'm hoping in the telltale game coming later in 2015. If that game will have on par storyline with this, i'd consider it as a The Walking Dead (season 1) contender. Fingers crossed.			"

												Combat is ok, and you are able to do some basic character customization.  However the story is designed to be very linear.  I personally could not make the decisions that I wanted to make.  Again, the game is all about telling an existing story with just a little variation.  If you are ok with that you could very well enjoy this game. I did not have any issues with the rest of the game play.  It was fun, and they throw a few nice game mechanics like being able to control the dog.  You are able to turn off the blood, but the foul language is a little harsh.  Too bad they don't let you turn that off.			"

												Game of Thrones is a slightly convoluted (and rather generic, truth be told) RPG.

Enthralling storyline written by George R.R. Martin, multiple endings, superb voice acting, excellent difficulty level, sufficient graphics, decent music, and here’s the big one: dog stealth action – these aspects make Game of Thrones a top five RPG of all time in my book.  It leaves a little to be desired in graphics and music but makes up for it with arguably the best storyline this side of Fallout with gripping characters, fantastic gameplay, multiple ways to play, and just overall a solid experience.  Play with an Xbox gamepad to get the most of out of the game but it really is an underrated gem.			"

												Just re-installed this game again.. I barely gave it a chance the first time cuz I was too into Skyrim (which you should get if you don't have it already). this game's actually pretty great. The graphics are more than decent for 2012, the story is pretty hooking and the game mechanics are fun and unique. The only problems I have is that only the main characters have decent voice actors, the combat animation doesn't seem to flow very well, and I can't manage to get the controller working with it despite it having ""full controller support."" But every character has their own name and life, whether they're a main character or not, which is pretty cool.			"

But anyway , there aren't many interactions during a fight, i mean, the fighters look like they were slashing the air when they hit, like in The Witcher.I'm a fan of the TV series and RPGs, but i can't recommend this game. i think i got it on HB or IG, so my wallet didn't hurt.. so, if you want to try it:-Buy it if it is in a sale.-Watch some gameplay videos to get your own ideas.ps: I haven't played a good videogame ripped from a movie or series, so i didn't have many expectations anyway.SPA:Cuando empecé a jugar a este juego, estaba muy emocionado, especialmente con la introducción épica, los buenos pero no increíbles gráficos, y los escenarios, pero a medida que la historia continúa me cansé de tantas escenas.El modo de combate es interesante, pero me esperaba algo más tipo hack n' slash.

Either go for a FF system with turn based style game or go for a Diablo system and make us able to bind attacks to single buttons. This is pc, not xbox or playstation. We have alot of buttons and we like to use it.			"

												Game of Thrones: The Role Playing Game, is, by far, the WORST game I have ever had the misfortune of playing. The story was bland and predictable, there were no big plot twists that fans have come to expect from the Game of Thrones series of books and the combat was complicated, frustrating, and quickly became repetitive. I will give the game credit for being bold enough to try a new type of gameplay, however, it was perhapse to0 bold. The game becomes unplayable when its graphics are turned up past the default; while it doesn't cause lag, it causes characters and objects to look like swiss cheese, with polygons missing from the model, allowing you to see through it. In finalaty, I would give this game a 1/10. I only give it a 1 because it was actually able to run.			"

												I am going to try to get back into this game later, but for now the combat controls killed it for me and I have many other games to play that do not feel so tedious. Story is good so far, but the combat is painful.			"

												Game of ThronesConcept:An RPG taking place in George R.R. Martin’s rich fantasy world. The story takes place just before the events that happen in the First Book and HBO’s T.V. Show Season 1. Graphics: ★★★☆☆The graphics are pretty good as are the recreations of the scenes from the T.V. show. The games camera or FOV are too close and feel very cramped and claustrophobic however with a few simple tweaks the game improves immensely.(See Below for instructions on how to tweak your game)Sound: ★★★★☆The epic musical soundtrack from the T.V. show is great throughout the entire game. The voice acting is also done nicely.Playability: ★★☆☆☆The gameplay combat is clunky, you set up actions in a three-slot queue, then watch your commands get carried out in sequence. Apart from your basic attack, no abilities are mapped to any face buttons, so you frequently need to pause (though the action doesn’t stop entirely) and pull up an ability wheel to issue new orders..Entertainment: ★★★★☆George R.R. Martin collaborated with Cyanide to create the story and I got say it is as good as the books and will keep you coming back to see what is going to happen next?.Replay Value: ★★★☆☆I feel the game has a good replay value with all the choices you make throughout the entire game which effect how people react to you and of course the end game. Also replaying with different classes adds to a new experience. There are five different endings based on what you do in the last chapter, but the bigger changes occur throughout the adventure as characters are either present or absent based on how you treated them earlier.Overall Rating: ★★★☆☆MY PERSONAL REVIEWGame of Thrones is split into chapters, and control alternates between two protagonists. Alester is a red priest returned from a 15-year exile in the east, and Mors is a skinchanger in the Night’s Watch. Though the two plotlines are initially unconnected, each story arc is full of interesting developments and surprising twists, making their eventual convergence quite satisfying. Mor’s is a skinchanger so he can inhabit the body of his lovable dog and scare attackers with his mighty bark, or lunge at their throats with its chopping teeth. You can control your dog outside of combat as well, to track the scent of a fleeing coward or squeeze through a hole in the wall, and this adds some diversity to the exploration. The dog also has a skill tree to level up with Mors. Certain animations for  the kill scenes are quite entertaining. In many RPGs, good loot can make some long fought battles worth the wait but that doesn’t happen in Game of Thrones. Nearly all of the good items from shops are unattainably expensive until the game is practically over, leaving you to scavenge for gear suited to your particular armor and weapon specialties. Overall  I feel Game of Thrones is purely story fleshed out through  its two characters as you delve deeper into all its lore. If you enjoy great story telling with a lack of good game mechanics than you cant go wrong with Game of Thrones.2 Tweaks I found that greatly improved the game for me are:**Turn on Vsync**Edit configuration file Go to %USERPROFILE%\My Documents\Game of Thrones\UnrealEngine3\AGOTGame\ConfigOpen AGOTEngine.ini with a text editor. Find a line: UseVsync=False. And change it to: UseVsync=True to enable Vsync.**Adjust the Field of View**Edit input configuration fileGo to %USERPROFILE%\My Documents\Game of Thrones\UnrealEngine3\AGOTGame\ConfigOpen AGOTInput.ini with a text editor.Find the section [Engine.PlayerInput]At the end of it, add the following lines: Bindings=(Name=""F1"",Command=""FOV 75"",Control=False,Shift=False,Alt=False)Bindings=(Name=""F2"",Command=""FOV 90"",Control=False,Shift=False,Alt=False)Bindings=(Name=""F3"",Command=""FOV 120"",Control=False,Shift=False,Alt=False)Modifiy FOV values to your preference if needed and save.Launch a game. While in game, press F1, F2 or F3 to change FOV.Hope this helps as I found both work and make the game alot better. Here's a link to a video showing the effects!

												So years ago, and by that I mean decades I loved a book series caled ""Wild Cards"" ... CRAP that was almost 30 years ago.Ithaqua leaves roomIthaqua comes back with a walker (zimmerframe)... and I loved those books. Recently friends have been yammering on about this TV show with dragons & boobs. Well OK, that may be worth my time.  And then I found out who wrote the books. /happy modeAfter binge watching 4 seasons over a weekend ... yes sleep is for the weak ... I could see why people liked the show.  Not my favorite, I'm not going to buy the DVD sets but OK I'll watch it if it's on.Then I got this game in a bundle ... so WTH I'll give it a try.Pro:Story richAchievesReasonable priced DLCsIn bundles now and thenLow system specsCon:Not on sale / bundle it's a little expensive at $22No cardsMeh combat - may just be a control issue but something's just not rightMeh character developmentMoney issuesSo not much on the farming to get more coin for equipment ... OK that is a valid design optionOverall:5/10 +2 story +1 specs -1 price -1 combat -1 design issues (best way to describe it) = 5/10 an OK game but nowhere near as good as it should be.You know what this feels like?  It feels like they had a OK story arc and they forced a game around it.  They just made it fit to get the product out the door and skipped on the 6 months of design / tweak / alpha testing to make an ok game a good game.If you can get it free in a bundle try it.  If it's 90% off on a sale, grab it.  If it's 75% off and you like the books / show grab it. Otherwise just wait, go reread the books or watch the show, your not missing much with this game.  Or at least not $22 CDN worth.Thumbs sideways ... Hmmm can't do that. For now, thumbs down (unless on massive sale)			"

												I'm not sure why this game gets such a low score (58). Just for the epic story alone I'd give it at least a 70. Yeah, the fighting is a little weak, the controls aren't very intuitive, but the game is still worth playing because like I mentioned above.... the story is awesome. I finished it in just over 20hrs.			"

												Surprisingly it's not as bad as people make it out to be but I do understand what people mean when they mock certain features of this game. I also do agree the price is a bit high but it does include DLC so at least when it goes on sale I highly recommend grabbing it (as I did).There are some generally fine features in the game such as the actual RPG elements (you even get the feel your choices matter), the story is interesting and gives that whole Game of Thrones vibe many seek from this game (also I think even people who have not read any books or watch the series can play and enjoy this) and voice acting is overall very good but some characters do seem to suffer from the monotone book reader syndrome. What comes to graphics they're pretty decent but just like any good features mentioned above they do lose to many other games if you start to compare. I also do think some of the features are quite unique such as your characters special skills (hard to explain but you can use a dog for tracking for example). I haven't completed the game and I'm writing this review after 3 hours (2 chapters) so I'm not sure what to say to the claims on the game being too short but I personally like how you switch between main characters every now and then.Now like said, I also do understand why some people don't like the game much: it's whole battle system is quite flawed and very tedious especially for the veteran players who can compared it to better systems. It's mediocre and typical skill system (minus the mentioned special skills) doesn't seem to help the situation much either. You do get a lot of choice in weapon types but it can be more confusing than fun as many weapons are not labeled as they should be (this is merely my personal opinion). I also think how you select your attacks in battle feel very much like if you're playing a online flash game of sorts and that cheapens it a lot. I can tell they did try think out of the box but instead of getting out of the box they just jumped into anothert one.But like mentioned above, I do recommend this game (especially for GoT fans and others who love a good story) if you can grab it from a sale because while many including myself enjoy the game... it IS very mediocre in this sea of modern RPG games you can pick from and the chance you can't overcome it's tedious system is quite high.

Posted: December 19, 2014
												The video game industry has received a great deal of attention from the Game of Thrones fans recently with the release of the Telltale's Game of Thrones game. It was the opportunity for me to test another video game based on the tv series/books. This one, developed by Cyanide, was released in 2012. Here's my review:(See rating at the end of the review)____________________________GAMEPLAY: Game of Thrones is a very classic RPG in terms of gameplay. It's a third person action game, which reminded me the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic series. The offensive and defensive options are divided between melee attacks, magic powers and potions. Magic skills and sword attacks must be combined to be efficient, which forces the player to stay active during the fighting parts. In addition, it is important to use your companions as often as you can. In order to make this easier, it is possible to use an ""active pause system"", which on the one hand makes fights more tactical but on the other hand slows them down. So nothing new in terms of gameplay, but it works.VISUALS, MUSIC & ATMOSPHERE: On this aspect, this could be way better. Cheap graphics and poor voice acting (except for some of the main characters) kinda ruin it. In a way, the game is close to the world of the books but it doesn't really recreate all its beauty. And it becomes quite annoying because the game is not focused on fighting but on the story of Westeros and its background. The soundtrack and some of the artwork are from the tv series.STORY: This is the good aspect of the game. The story, which happens just before the death of Robert Baratheon, is fictional but totally fitting with the books. It is full of choking deaths, revelations and secrets, but also clear of manichaeism - in others terms, the good characteristics of the books. There are many twists until the ending scene, which serves as a narrative climax. The story is really the key point of the game, and while it is well written, the huge amount of dialogs could be disappointing for some players. LENGTH: Quite good. It probably takes between 14/16 hours to finish the game without hurrying youself, which is neiter too short nor too long. You can probably add 5 hours if you want to complete all the extra quests.____________________________  Gameplay 3/6   Visuals, music and atmosphere 2/6   Story 5/6   Length 2/2   - -   Global Rating 12/20 Even if the game stays true to the books, it is limited by low production means and a lack of originality. The game is still entertaining but doesn't match the books's quality.			"

												This game is good for one, maybe two play throughs. That having been said it's a solid RPG that will appeal much more to fans of A Song and Ice & Fire than anyone else, and that's fine. The gameplay is decent, but the story is what will keep you hooked right up until the very end. Oh, and you get to see GRR make a cameo in-game as a maester. That alone was worth the price.			"

												A gritty double-edged storytelling, worthy of the Game of Thrones name. Do not be deceived by the gameplay and graphics, ice and darkness! they are horrible and dated. But if you can go through the first 10 hours of the game, you will want to finish the game. because YES this is a fantastic narrative and you will reap your rewards in the end. You will need a dose of patience, this game filters off casual players, it has terrible gameplay mechanics and expensive high end weapons, the levelling does not help either. The lighting in the game is too dark for my taste and and if you use a controller like me the minimap disappear!! The interface can be frustrating with its dial-select options. But you will forget about all that as you progress in the game. It has some moments, dark humour, tragedies and satisfactory voice-acted dialogues (I must warn you, there are a lots of cutscenes).The game bears similarities to the moral choices pioneered by Starwars KOTOR as well as the pauseable combats. I enjoyed the story immensely, you will appreciate this more if you watched at least the first season of the HBO TV series. my final verdict, give this game a chance, you might like it as I did.			"

												It's difficult to say anything positive about the gameplay; the combat is too automated and sluggish, the movement isn't very responsive and the fact your character is slightly off-center and to the left of your screen I found to be disorientating and at times even nauseating.The only redeeming factor about this game is the storyline, which admittedly at first I felt was a bit weak but after forcing myself to continue playing I found I was more and more engaged in the plot to a point where I couldn't turn the game off.Gameplay: 4/10Storyline: 10/10			"

												Wow, after a tough hour wondering if I should really expect something from this game... I decided to keep playing. First, there are few bad things that you encounter :-problem of camera angle,-a random difficulty (I was playing in hard and some chapters are really easy, some are simply impossible)-linear story lineEventualy, Game of Thrones is a GREAT game:-...the linear story line has great choices and repercutions. It is following the spirit of the saga. So be prepare for ""sex, wars, treasons, and many death"". And for once, the charisma of all characters and the staging is just astonishing.-the fighting system is not perfect but has many great ideas. You'll enjoy creating your customized build depending of your style (offensive, ranged, defensive, etc...). Play in ""hard"" and you'll see how strategic is this game.I've loved to play this great RPG. If you would like an amazing story in the atmosphere of GOT : Go for it !17/20Oh... and you'll probably need xbox-controler, it isn't made for keyboard+mouse			"

The storyline deserves to become a plot of a separate movie with Hollywood actors. it's impossible to predict the final, when it's finally up-you should be really startled by that. Game correctly uses the book intrigue line - do not trust anyone. Even yourself. I am gonna post neither cons nor pros of gameplay, list of bugs or any other stuff. Senseless. Plot beats everything. Tragedy of human life can't be shown more obviously.11/10. Still thinkin' to start it again.			"

 Cyanide Studios’ Game of Thrones is an enjoyable RPG. I had heard mixed things about the game and was afraid it was just a cash grab but was pleasantly surprised that it shared much with RPG favorites of mine like Dragon Age and The Witcher. The biggest strength of Game of Thrones is the story. I thought it was actually really good. The characters were well written with interesting backstories. Like the source material, there were no “good guys” – the protagonists had as many flaws and as much blood on their hands as their antagonists. The story overlaps with the first book, A Game of Thrones. Fortunately, even though you run into characters from the book (modeled after the actors from the HBO series) and events from the book, there are plenty of original characters and locations too. You decisions do impact the story and the gameplay. Certain decisions give your character permanent perks that are bonuses in gameplay (+x to attach, or +% to item drops). There are dialogue trees as well when talking to NPC’s. However, for the most part, your choices never feel as consequential as the Bioware games until the very end of the campaign. Visually, the game is modest. It has decent backgrounds and character models but it looks dated for a 2012 release. I heard it runs the Unreal Engine 3 and there are definitely better looking games on this engine out there. The art design is faithful to the HBO series and looks as expected. Gameplay-wise it plays like many other modern RPG’s. It is very similar to Dragon Age as you can control one party member (and you can switch between party members) and queue up various actions in combat. Unfortunately, Cyanide doesn’t allow you to completely pause during combat to issue orders instead it slows combat down. Some people might not find that a problem but I thought it was inconvenient when trying to manage multiple characters in combat. Sometimes the camera would get in the way during combat as well with insufficient zoom and angle to see what you were attacking. I played with an Xbox controller which was fully supported and very enjoyable. As this game was also released on consoles, the controller seems the ideal method to play it. I never had any performance issues and the game never crashed on me. If you enjoy modern RPG’s or the Game of Thrones franchise, I would recommend playing this game as long as you have realistic expectations that this isn’t a AAA title and that you purchase it on-sale if possible.

												I recommend this game for Game of Thrones fans mostly since a lot of names are thrown around assuming that you are watching the show or read the books.It's a RPG where you control two protoganist, Mors and Alyster. You get to chose their fighting style at the beginning of the game, such as specializing with 1-handed or 2-handed weapons.All I have to say about this game is if you like Game of Thrones and RPGs and a interesting story then you won't regret playing this game.HBO should turn this game into a maybe 2 season show.""Death Before Dishonor""			"

												Rushed B- grade RPG with AMAZING plot!Game has rather bad combat system, some minor bugs with more of them in last few chapters (showing how rushed it was)What this game is worth mentioning for is its plot -storyline is among the best ones out there in RPG genre.Definitely worth picking up on sale!

												There are two things you should know about me: 1) I'm a big fan of story driven RPGs 2) I am not a particular fan of Game of Thrones books/series. I have to say that this game is definitely one of the best RPGs I have played, and I have them a lot played under my belt (including Witcher and Dragon Age series). I will try to review this game by separately discussing 3 major values of any game. Note that I've finished this game on a higher difficulty (Lord)TL:DR : Highly recommend this game due to it's with complex characters, intriguing story with lots of twists and plots, dialogue filled with tough moral choices that have actual impact, and an overall enjoyable combat system, that admittedly has some frustrating moments. 1) Story: The story is most likely the strongest point in this game. With numerous plot twists and a moderate-to-strong influence on the story through decisions I have found repeatable joy starting each new chapter not knowing how will the story unfold next. The fact that it's is told through the perspective of two characters which you mostly control alternately through chapters makes the storytelling even a greater experence. Speaking of characters, rarely you will see so much effort placed into complex character creation such as this one - each individual, especially the main characters, is well though of, has clearly outlined psychological traits, way of thinking, unique history and temperament. After a while, it is not difficult to bond and side with some characters more than others. 2) Video/Audio: Combat animation can seem a bit quirky as the you deal damage after you finish your attack, not on the actual point of impact. Similarly, skills that interrupt do that as soon as you start casting them, and, yet again, not on the point of impact. The graphics in the games are quite decent though, unlike the voice acting which is superb. I thoroughly enjoyed listening each line in a HUGE dialogue tree, most likely because the voice of the character well matches their unique character traits and current emotions. 3) Gameplay:   Combat  To be honest I wasn't quite sure how I feel about it at times. On one hand the battles were fun and so were the skills even though there are not unique. On the other, I found losing a few battles for it's hard to reposition yourself (from arrow fire) if you have a companion. While you move your character to safety your companion, in the meantime bravely rushes to his own premature end, but if you try to reposition your companion, same thing happens to your main character. Also, if you don't stack yourself with potions, you might find yourself not being able to survive a fight, which would mean going back to a not so recent save in a different chapter only to restock. This, however, may be due to the higher difficulty I played on. Dialogue/Choice system  This game has done a great job on this. Decisions you make can have a major impact on what happens next. Sometimes the decisions you make show you instant results, but more times than not you will feel their consequences much later in the game. Dialogue is filled with difficult moral choices that could make you think hard for a few minutes before committing - expect a lot of gray area. "

												I'll be honest. When i bought this game i didn't really expect much to it but OH MY GOD did it deliver. Sure there are some graphic errors, eg. when you open a door you go straight through it as it opens, but we're not perfect are we? ;) the combat is really nice too, and slightly strategy based rather than hack and slash as in most action games. And of course the story is the best thing in the entire game, it captures you from the beginning until the end and even then wants to make you play more. Fantastic game, it won't disappoint.			"

												I had to go back and check what year this game was released, the graphics reminded me so much of vanilla World of Warcraft, but with more of an attempt at realism. The voice acting was pretty bad, particularly the main characters which is unfortunate because there is a lot of dialogue. The characters do this very odd shifting stance while they talk where they put one hand on their hip, it's very distracting to see these big burly characters with one hand on their hip while they talk to each other.It took what felt like a long time to get to the first combat in the game, the combat uses an action queue system. It is not hack and slash at all, your combat actions are on a timer to complete, you have to manually select enemies to attack and switch between controlled characters during combat to queue up actions or let your allies auto attack. I found the combat to be the most disappointing, it just felt very boring to queue up attacks and sit back waiting for them to countdown.I definitely made a mistake buying this game, I thought the graphics looked fine in the screenshots but I found them very outdated when I started playing. From the little research I did it looked so much like a hack and slash combat system and found that the queued combat system drained the last of my resolve to play through this game. Only made it to the third chapter I believe, just wanted to warn other people from making my mistakes. At least I got it on a sale.			"

												This game was absolutely incredible.  Literally awe inspiring.Cons:-Hitboxes/Checks for opening doors/activating locks isn't large enough to trigger easily.  This will often require positioning your character and the camera in a specific way just to move through basic obstacles.  It's a fundamental issue, but once solved, the rest of the game absolutely opens up in the most wonderful way.-Autosaves are very far apart.-You can't save/load during combat, forcing you to have to quit the game in order to load an earlier save (feels like a contrivance, especially on PC). Pros: +My goodness.  This is the best envisionment of a book series into a video game ever done.  The characters and tsettings and consequences are all true to the Game of Thrones (strictly the HBO show) universe, from the money system to the locals  to the religions and character cameos.  This is the truests form of appeciating the show as an experience.+My word the story!  A tale that twists based on your input and offers genuine consequences for choices you made previously.  This is narrative interaction on par with Bioware titles with both immediate conseqences and long term punishments/rewards.  I've never felt more empowered playing a game.+The fight system is really unique.  I can compare this games combat system as a mix between Dragon Age's character menu  special move list and Mass Effect's pause/radial menu system.  All enemies are dynamically placed, and there's no turn-based segways, which result in a world where enemy encounters feel entirely natural and organic.  +Man, this game was such a gem!  I loved walking past people having complete conversations with on another in the streets, or suddenly and randomly decideding to walk through a forrest or a town only to be surprisingly accosted by a group of bandits who specifically state that I've been wandering in their territory suspiciously for too long.  I loved solving dugeon puzzles and finding secret passage ways using intuition instead of abstract puzzle solving minigames.  Everything pertained to the universe at hand and every surprise was really enjoyable.+Man that story is a punch in the gut sometimes.  Just fantastic.  This is how drama is meant to be done--I love how the narrative was crafted between two different protagonists and how each story effect each other.  Everything and everyone was so well realized... man.  Bravo!  Just one of the best games I've played.  Period.			"

												Me being a big Game of Thrones and A song of ice and fire fan, I picked up this game on the humble bundle. Seeing a bunch of reviews giving this game a bad score, I prepared myself for the worst. Wow, I was blown away. This game is really good. I got to admit, I didn't excpect it, but it is a good game. The gameplay of the game isn't amazing, but coming into this game you shouldn't excpect amazing gameplay. What is given to you to replace the lousy combat resembling in small ways a turn based combat, is an amazing story. The story reminds you so much to that in the books and the show. Not because of the characters, but because of the complex story, great characters, choice, unexpected events, negative view at things. Every bit of the game feels like it should: An interactive game of thrones. Even though the choices you make in the game might not affect the world much, it still makes you feel special and like you achived something.Definetly a great game. 8.5/10For more news and reviews head over to www.tuniworld.com "

												Overall, it's a good game which could have been a lot better.On the good sides, it's a great universe very well adapted from the TV series & books from which it got the whole spirit. The story, completely original, manages to fit the story told in the books without inconsistency I could notice, and involves new characters I found quite attaching. The story telling is also very well built, with the complete plot discovering step by steps.BUT... gameplay is cheap. Really. The huge environments are disguised empty corridors, making the level design kind of boring. The fight system is also ""has-been"" and reminds me of KOTOR, which was fine at its time, 10 years ago. In addition, on my computer, the UT engine seem to be used in a pretty much buggy way.At the end, it looks to me as an unfinished game. All the basis are here, and are tremendously good, but lacks some serious finish. If you are fond of the books or the TV-series, get it without hesitation !If you are just fond of good RPG's without particular interest for GoT, you may find something better elsewhere.			"

												Story and characters (except for queen Cersei) are good. Everything else is very bad. Game mechanics, charecter development, economy, interfaces --  bad.Graphics are very bad. Unreal Engine has far greater potential. I realize it is an old game, yet I've played a lot of older games that look way better. And for example, The Witcher 1 features technically outdated graphics, but everything (in the enhanced cut) is drawn so well that it will never become substandard. Meanwhile, GoT offers lame locations and poorly customized secondary characters. There are only two textures for girls - a high-born woman and woman of modest origin.You do not feel your choices matter. Again, I'm not comparing it with the best RPGs ever released. They just affect nothing.Because of the good story (which is the primary aspect, of course), I was still going to give this game a thumb-up.However, I won't: firstly, because of the camera, secondly, because this app gave my PC a blue screen, something I have experienced just a few times in my life.5/10If you can't miss it, buy only with a great discount.

												So many bloody cutscenes!!! Its meant to be a video game not just click he and recieve 10 minutes of some random life story haha, the first 8ish chapters are super boring but I actually enjoyed the ending to the game when the story and gamplay actually became a little bit interesting/exciting.Side quests are more boring then the main quest and they take freaking ages to complete most of the time unless you want to skip all the cut scenes and have no idea why you just murdered a whole lot of people.If they got rid of the slow game pace and the X-Com styled gameplay then this game would be a lot better.

												I have spent hours trying to get this game to work but it doesn't, therefore I cannot recommend it. The mouse look (hold down right mouse button to look around) makes the view stutter and jerk around - usually flipping you around 90 degrees. This makes it impossible to navigate the game world. I've read countless forum solutions about setting V Synch to application controlled and so forth in the Nvidia control panel - but none of this fixes the problem. I suffered through this issue when the game first came out - and now - years later I returned to it to see if a patch/update had fixed it but as of the writing of this - the game breaking problem is still there. Many people don't seem to have to this glitch so it's hard to figure out how to fix it when so few people care. Nothing I've tried works.			"

												I wish I could review the more of the game, but unfortunately I can't review anything past the first few missions as the Red Priest (or whatever they're called, I forget). I have owned this game for several years but everytime I have tried to play it I've either had terrible audio or graphical bugs that made the game basically unplayable. I've done everything from unisnstall to verify chache, and where most games on Steam work after a period of being broken, this one has always eitehr persisted with its bugs or got new ones that broke the game equally or more. This game is literally unplayable due to bugs YEARS after its release, whether it be the UI completely disappears, the character disappears, or someother essential part of the game disappears, and if not that then its the absolutely massive drops in FPS that cause the game to freeze or crash.

												The story is good, maybe even great at times. I can't, however, give this a positive review based solely on that. The story builds well and doesn't really pick up until the second half. Most of the plot twists early on are pretty predictable, especially if you're a fan of the show or books. It remained compelling enough for me to play it straight through. Every other aspect of this game is horrendus: the graphics, gameplay, combat system, weird class/ability system, loot system, side quests, and voice acting all feel very shoddy and at times barely playable. The fighting especially since it's a big part of the game. You don't just go around talking to people. You have to clear mobs and fight bosses in battles where your weapons never actually touch the NPC, you hit abilities from a pause screen, you can't move at all, and if you kill them in a cut scene the character will sometimes have a different weapon than the one equipped. The combat system feels like bad late-90s, early 2000s RPG, with graphics that would've been cutting edge on a PS2 but now are just blah. If you have lots of patience for these kinds of things, love plot-driven titles, and can't get enough GOT, then this may well be up your alley. Probably not worth the $20, but if you can get it on sale. I wouldn't say I regret purchasing it, but I definitely paid too much for a product that's largely deserved the negative reviews it's recieved from most venues.			"

												Sadly this game was released before FOCUS realized its combat system was garbage and was repelling 40% of the people who would otherwise buy their games. While a step up from Of Orcs and Men, it still falls very short of enjoyable.If you aren't aware of the combat system, its a mix of strategy turn-based and hack-n-slash. You plug in attacks x,y,x and then your character does attacks x,y,x in sequence - not as you press it. This means youre basically standing still creating sequences of attacks before you even know what the oppenent is going to do - almost like rock, paper, scissors. (the slow reaction time / animations mean that you can't do it in real time, even if you wanted too).It's disgusting and doesn't feel right to play. Doesn't feel like youre actually controlling the character, its strange.If you can bear the clunky, semi-realtime combat - I'm sure this game would be great. "

Product received for free
												Game of Thrones is developed by Cyanide Studios as an action RPG following the adventures of a Night Watch’s brother and a priest of R’hllor. As a huge Game of Thrones fan, I love content related to the seven kingdoms as well as the anything below the narrow sea, and yet somehow I could not get into Game of Thrones game.At first glance, it seems like an amazing experience. You see the prologue which is pretty amazing narrated by Varys, you can customize your character and pick one of the three classes in the game each with different abilities, customize your attributes, skills and traits. As a big bonus you also get a unique tree for each of the characters, in the case of the Night watch it is your very own hound and a skin changer tree while the R’hllor priest gets a new set of skills devoted to the holy fire, such as setting your opponents on fire. You can also pick your preferred weapons, such as maces, swords, axes, bows or crossbows. The game also has other positive points such as amazing sound, a decent storyline and the ability to make a game based on game of thrones while completely avoiding any spoilers from the books and the tv show. The game essentially has its own story. On the other hand, the game suffers from quite some big issues. For instance, the combat feels sluggish and boring, the graphics are quite low quality and the worst of all, the voice acting in some cases along with some plot areas are cringe-worthy. The voicing at some point felt as Christian Bale’s imitation of the Batman instead of the R’hllor priest or the brother of the Night Watch. It does not feel natural and it ruins a part of the game’s ambiance. Another point that can frustrate some players is DLC skins in the store. The game has weapon sets sold in the store as well as dog skins which can annoy some people considering it is a single-player game.Overall, I would give Game of Thrones a 5 out of 10. I do not personally recommend it as an avid Game of Thrones fan but if you can get past all the quirks, you will enjoy the game quite a bit.For our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over to http://www.steamified.com/To begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our Steam Group "

												I would recommend to play through the story at least once. It's a solid game, clunky at times, but yet entertaining. While playing it, please note that this game was developed before the HBO series. I think, knowing this makes the game much more appreciated.

												The game has quite a few voice talents, but the combat system I just can't get behind. It's all based on your armour and weapons for example, those in heavy armour are weak to bludgeoning weapons, those in medium armour are weak to cutting perferating weapons and those with light or no armour, weak to light armour and the difficulty spikes in this game for combat jump all over the place.It is cool to hear the voices from the characters from the series...despite many of them not looking anything like their actors and the story is engaging, but there are times that it is just far too hard to deal with.

												Okay I have started this game than gave up than started to follow the TV Series and started again because when you are into TV Series you begin to understand and get curipus about the lore of this game and it makes you play more,do more,finish more quests to see more and that kind of stuff,atleast that is what happened to me.Now starting the review this game is a RPG so it must have a good plot and good RPG stuff like classes skills and etc...To talk about that I must say that this game covers RPG elements pretty good and I really liked the story,characters,plot twists,judgement and all It really really needs a shot from any GoT fan or hell even someone looking to jump into another RPG world.IT DESERVES to be playedHowever there was some places I didn't like too:-Models should have been better (It has to fit in right?).-Maps are limited (by that I mean It was not like Witcher 2 IT BROKE THE ATMOSPHERE in Witcher 2 the map is still limited but it made sense but in this it just didn't).-Character animations (I didn't expected much but that was pretty pretty pretty pretty much baaaaaaddd!I mean this is an official GoT game!C'moooon!).-They had to put in more characters from the real story I.Don't get me wrong the characters in this game are good but they had to put some more in it.And about graphics:I didn't they were outdated or lame it fit the game very well It was just the game is a classic RPG and I think after Mount&Blade GoT modes I expected something like forming your warband and more fluid animations stuff but well after all this is a plot game.                       Anyway this is the best GoT game I've played and I give it this: 7/10 hope this helps!			"

												This game is the proof that reviewers for websites and magazines shouldn't be trusted at all. Do yourself a favor and never trust those paid shills by publishers ever again when it comes to game reviews.Game Of Thrones is in one word EPIC! The game's story is beyond amazing and it's clear George R.R. Martin had a hand in the story the game tells. I even go as far Game Of Throne's story is far better than the classic Planescape: Tornment which is a rare thing to accomplish by any game. Gameplay wise there is also nothing wrong with the game the combat is tactical just like in Dragon Age and everything works as you would expect. There are no quarks or bad camera like they claim in reviews. All in all if you like an amazing epic story and or Game Of Thrones this game is a must play no way around it. 9/10			"

												My god where do i start. This game is just awful. It just doesnt work in any way. The only reason i played it was because it had the Game of Thrones name on it. With the franchise attached to it i was quite biased in its favour before playing it but nothing could cover up the monstrosity that is this gameThe combat doesn't seem to make any sense. It's not like one of those games where you know the combat has a learning curve that you'll eventually get used to. The combat in this game just doesnt make any sense and i can't see anyone getting comfortable with it. The camera as well is just horrible. It doesnt go where you want it to and just ends up disorientating the player. Story-wise i cant really comment on because i didn't play for very long. It could be a good story but everything else just completely dwarfs that possibiltyPros:-Its called Game of ThronesCons:-The combat system doesn't work at all-The camera mirrors the combat systems perfectlyConclusion:While i recognise that the cons list isn't long and some people might be able to see past a couple of faults these are just too big to overlook in my opinion. I cannot recommend this game to anyone. It tries too hard to incorporate to many aspects of other successful titles ( Dragon Age, KOTOR ) but just fails miserably. Don't waste your money1/10 (1 is literally just because i love GoT)			"

												Pros: The game is beautifully designed, the cutscene atmosphere is very immersive, and the plot is intriguing. So, an overall great backdrop. Cons: Combat needs a lot of rennovation and work, as it's pretty darn awful. Rather than Mors and Allester, Cyanide should have used more story-related characters, like Illyn Payne and Thoros of Myr, who fit the desriptions of the other characters right there (but that's just me nerding out.)?: You can teabag Cersei's head (a much deserved ""honor"" after reading about her in the books and the series on HBO)			"

												I can't recommend this game. The story is great, the choices aren't bad, and I do enjoy the ability to explore the world a bit.However, the good ends there. You figured a game that put this much time into graphic and development could do a little better in combat, graphic, skill trees, and such. But they left that area sorely lacking.Combat is completely repetitive. If you think Dragon Age - enrich the storyline and dim down the combat/graphic/skill tree and you'll end up with this game. As for the map - it's extremely small and all straight forward movements. When I say ""explore a map"" I really mean filling in the grey area. You can't even get loss in this game! All the paths are set, maps are established, and all you can do it go forward.If you're a Skyrim, Morriwind, Dragon Age, and avid RPG Gamer - steer away from this one. With that said, if you're a Game of Thrones fan - this is definitely for you.			"

I only played 25 minutes, then stopped of boredom. 6/10 Can't recommend to people just coming into the world of Game of Thrones (Me...) NOW MAKE ME A BREAKING BAD GAME!

												I got this game from the Humble Bundle so maybe I shouldn't complain.  Basically we live in the world of MMOs and this game just isn't that great.  The character/ combat system is OK.  It is one of those games where the influence of MMOs is obvious, such as Final Fantasy XII.  Supposedly from what I have read the combat system degenerates into button mashing although I have not gotten that far I have only played it for like 10h or so.  Basically it is very dependent on using an interrupt mechanic.  It's OK I would say it is only for hardcore Game of Throne fans only.  Winter is coming!			"

												I got this game from the Humble Bundle so maybe I shouldn't complain.  Basically we live in the world of MMOs and this game just isn't that great.  The character/ combat system is OK.  It is one of those games where the influence of MMOs is obvious, such as Final Fantasy XII.  Supposedly from what I have read the combat system degenerates into button mashing although I have not gotten that far I have only played it for like 10h or so.  Basically it is very dependent on using an interrupt mechanic.  It's OK I would say it is only for hardcore Game of Throne fans only.  Winter is coming!			"

												While the game is fun it is spoiled by a very bad engine which is unable to execute any semblance of real time movements. Worse, the graphics cannot be modified in any way except resolution. This is unacceptable and for that reason alone the game cannot be recommended to play, it's implementation is too bad for anyone sane to want to play for any prolonged period of time. If the devs would actually implement customazation of ALL graphics options it may be playable. Until that is fixed, don't bother getting it unless it's below $3, beacues that is what is is really worth now.			"

												This game is engaging, though it lacks a certain level of polish. It claims that every decision matters, though it's unclear to what level that actually is. Pretty much every choice can give you a new perk to boost your character's capability, but not in any particularly meaningful way. Predictability and inconsistent difficulty plague this game, while neither are a huge issue given the quality of the story it's still worth mentioning.I haven't watched the show or read the books, so perhaps I'm missing something, but this game is good enough to pick up if it's cheap.

												I am a fan of RPGs and asoiaf and heartily recommend against playing this game.This game looks 10 years old. The controls are non standard in a horrible way and consequently are aggravating to control. The mouse only moves the camera if you hold a button and it is far too sensitive, also 'w' does not move you forward but about 30 degrees off forward, your hand is expected to be on the number pad and on wasd during combat. It's poor to play but I wasn't expecting anything brilliant in that department, I wanted to dive into westeros.You start (I only played the start) at the wall which was disappointing, later you play a red priest in the free cities but I could not stick with it for that long. Call me a fangirl but what I like about asoiaf was that it felt realistic given the rules it wrote for itself. The sworn brother you play can warg with his Bull Terrier (at the wall, this dog would freeze to death, as a ranger's companion he would die of exhaustion) but you are labelled as a skin changer rather than a warg despite never (so far as I can gather) going into other animals. But a warg? They're rare to the point of nonexistent south of the wall.One of your first missions is to find a brother who♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and killed a new recruit (mole's town has a brothel; there are boys there to the best of my recollection, no reason to♥♥♥♥♥♥a recruit). The player character called the brothers crows (taking back the word, I imagine) and they talk about white walkers and others as different beings on multiple occasions.After too many, ""you didn't read the books!"" moments I gave up.Avoid			"

												Meh. I like the GoT universe, and it was cool to sort of be ""in"" it, but...I'm not sure who the target audience of the game is. It seems like it might be people who know *of* GoT, but don't actually have any familiarity with it, other than ""hey, isn't that the theme music?"" I say that because characters spout exposition constantly (the voice acting is almost universally monotone), and someone like myself who's read the books will probably find it profoundly boring.Bottom line:- If you're intimately familiar with GoT, you'll probably find the story elements of the game incredibly dull. Unless you just absolutely-cannot-get-enough-of-Westeros...in which case, just find a Skyrim mod or something.- If you've played an RPG before, you will find the game mechanics boring and unoriginal. Especially if you've played a PC RPG before (again, Elder Scrolls, I'm lookin' at you)- The UI seems like it was designed for the lowest common denominator, I.E. - consoles, which means that on PC there are several aspects that are really unintuitive if you have, say, a keyboard and mouse attached. Like PC users tend to have. (Of course, it's possible that this was released PC-only--I haven't checked--in which case, shame on the developers for a UI that's atrocious for no good reason)Okay, so...my bottom line is longer than the rest of the review, but my point is this: do NOT waste your money on this game, even it's on sale...unless you know nothing of Game of Thrones--other than that it's ""a thing""--AND have never played an RPG videogame before.

												I can't understand the positive reviews for the game. Normally I don't recommend or criticize a game until I've played several hours at least, but in this case I had to make an exception. I've only played half an hour and I can honestly say this was one of the worst games I've ever touched. As a huge Game of Thrones fan I thought that no matter how bad the game itself was, the story would be worth playing it for. Unfortunately, the story might be good, but it's delivered atrociously. The voice acting is TERRIBLE and I mean comically bad. Definiely exacerbated by the awkward pacing, and the dismal dialogue itself. I can't believe any game would allow dialogue of this poor quality. It feels like it was written by a bad fanfic writer who read the Wikipedia summary of an ASOIAF book a couple of years ago. I know George RR Martin can tend to be a bit flowery in his dialogue, but this game has you going ""Who the hell has ever talked like that ever"" too many times. After enduring the first few cutscenes I was already on the verge of quitting (seriously it felt like the writers were trying really really hard to remind us this was a Game of Thrones game, shoving completely awkward, unnecessary references to lore). But when I actually tried the combat and gameplay I knew this game was unsalvagable trash. I felt like I've seen that same skills tree in a dozen other games, the camera itself is probably an enemy character given how much it hindered you, and ""combat"" conists of queing up three actions repeatedly. To be fair, here are some good points I can think of: The graphics are decent, and the two main characters are very different and play that way as well. The story is worth playing if you can bear bad lines and acting (I couldn't). Music is good, it's basically the show's. Overall: Poor gameplay and camera, some very bad voice acting and dialogue obscuring a great story. Definitely not worth more than 5$, this is a game where its better to just watch someone else play			"

												Do not buy and play this game if you're living in 2016 and is well-aware of recent RPG mechanics. Gameplay is so ancient I didnt stand playing it for 30 minutes. One big qualm i have with this game is the manual control of the camera. I did not further check out if there's a setting to make it go like a third-person view mode, but I'm betting there isn't. The game has so much potential from the GoT universe, but then the gameplay ruined it. It's pretty much like some sort of strategy and RPG rolled into one. I suppose this would be ""the♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; back in the day, but buying this at this time is just a waste of money. Just go get Skyrim and find a 'GoT Mod', if that exists. Or better yet, just go with the Telltale version if you want better voice acting and much more linear gameplay.			"

												Please note that this game is not to be confused with the Telltale Game of Thrones series. Telltale made an awesome GoT game. So it's important you don't associate them with this... thing. This game on the other hand was so ♥♥♥♥ing ugly looking and the mechanics were super poor. However, it had an interesting & enjoyable storyling written by George RR Martin himself. I think I could only recommend this to people who love Game of Thrones. Even though, it is kind of a slog getting through this thing.... So uh, good luck.Final Verdict (3 out of 5)The rating is based on my personal enjoyment of the storyline & the fact that the game WAS playable. But it was not a smooth experience in the slightest.

												The only good thing about this game is Mors' voice acting. It is epic and it makes Mors a bad♥♥♥♥♥ In fact Mors is a really cool character that I'd like to see in a game similar to Witcher 3 but that is where the good things end. The game is a poorly made and is very badly optimised. Combat is uninteresting and uninspired and is nothing like DA:O which is a great game. The story is a joke to Game of Thrones universe. It is as if it was written for a bad fairly tale with stupid plot twists that are seen from miles away. Varys looks like a fool in this game, they ruined him persona (other characters from the series/books look foolish too). Cersei isn't even voiced by Lena Headey. And most importantly, the game just feels awkward. I mean main characters are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Like badly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and completely cliche. Especially the Red Priest. The animation is completely out of place! I mean the hand gestures that are frequently used by 2 main brutal characters that look like they are waving their hand and showing the index finger and saying ""heeey Gurl"" (all they need to add here is the circular head movement with the neck being completely moitionless) are just outright immersion breaking.  I mean they do it all the time when they try to act tough. But instead of looking tough they look like they are homosexual and it just makes it all silly. Not to mention lots of other animations that are not supposed to happen!There is not much to say here except that it fails both as an RPG and a GoT story. I would avoid it at all costs even if you are a fan of either or both. And this is coming from a guy who plays old games on regular basis, who loves indie and RPGs like Morrowind and DA:O and a guy who loves GoT books and series.  "

												Game of Thrones title is fully earned here - evil will triumph and the innocent blood will grease the gears of political schemes.Writing is the main course here - the plot takes place shortly after Robert Baratheon's death, when the king's bast... errm... illegitimate children are being hunted. We have two main characters with separate storylines and motives, but they will be forced to take part in the political events. The atmosphere is very bleak, treachery lurks everywhere. The game features some of the most disturbing scenes in gaming - done so well, that the worst one isn't even graphic.There are a lot of smaller and bigger choices to make, the consequences are often non-direct or delayed - but they have impact on the plot.The game is off-putting at the beginning - the visuals are outdated (though some of the textures, armors etc. look weirdly good) and the combat feels slow and boring. But if only you'll stay a bit longer, hopefully you'll find yourself in the story's grip. The graphics will still be awful, but servicable. Combat will pick up a bit though once you'll learn more skills and get more stamina to use them - it will still be a bit boring as it's very tactical and focues on disabling and exploiting enemies (at higher difficulty levels it's very challenging).Get the Beyond of Wall DLC if you decide to play the game - it's a short prequel and it's great.

												far from the bad game everybody says it is, unless you don't care at all for story and ethics of choices.it reminded me strongly of mass effect, though that was better drawn and the playing was more fun and the world and quests bit more interesting, but game of thrones beats it in plot twists, and matches its moral/wthical dillema presentation, though i think there's always an inherent goof/bad ending, but the choices are truly open and change the path of the game.the voice acting was also sub par. not being able to follow with the many names also takes away from the game, if you know the GOT universe this would be 10 times more enjoyable i guess.it's also longer than my liking, other people i'm sure like their games longer.

												Its a great roleplaying game, plain and simple.  If you are a fan of the Game of Thrones series like I am, and like roleplaying games, its just plain neat.I really am enjoying being in the nights watch and seeing the ominous, thrilling wall that goes on forever.The combat is tactical not action.  The game does say that in the description, but I thought it would be somewhat twitch based, it is not.  You choose the actions of the character and they carry them out in real time, but you can pause any time and change and/or que up orders.Its a role playing game, which means you do get to build up your character, choose attributes and skills, buy, find, and equip different weapons and armor.  I love it.  Exploration pays off in finding new items, etc.The graphics are fantastic at the highest settings and at 1600 by 900 resolution.  I know that people criticized the graphics for the Xbox, but the computer version to me at least, captures the world perfectly.The dialogue and story is game of thrones, that simple.  Horrible actions, rough words, and intigue everywhere.  Do not let your children play this game.  The first quest is caused by some horrible, R rated actions.A few things could be better.You have to almost be on top of an item before you see it.  For example, you may see a bunch of crates across the room, but you have to walk over there and almost be touching them before you get an icon that there is something to grab.The game appears to be fairly linear.  I'm very early in the game, but its not a wide open world to explore, its more of a tight knit story to follow.  There are sidequests, and several neat choices in the dialogue, but this is a more linear game.Needs more actors from the series.  The only voices that I believe are in it from the series are Varas and the commander of the Night's watch, thats it.  Since this takes place parallel to season 1, there are so many others we could have met.  I don't know what other characters may be around, but even if we get to meet them, they won't be the same voices.Anyways, I don't what was up with the Xbox version, but the pc special edition version is a great game if you would like to enjoy Westeros for a little bit while waiting for season 5.  Right now its on sale for 5 bucks.  Its a steal!			"

												I picked this up on the summer sale and it was easily the best purchase of the whole sale.  It is a really fun game with a solid storyline.  If you're a fan of the books or hbo series and like RPGs you should pick it up.  It is about the storyline and things happen that are outside of your control that people might feel is railroading but I feel it is very true to the song of ice and fire setting.  You won't spend hours managing your inventory or tweaking your followers.  Just play and enjoy the story.The DLC is bad... very bad.  Avoid wasting money on it.

												This game's gotten some good and bad reviews, and I'm not 100% sure why the bad reviews except for maybe a bad port to PC. There is a solution for that: it's called a controller. It took me all of about two seconds to realize I needed to pull mine out of the drawer and connect it in order to have a better experience with this game. Do that and remember you're playing an RPG (because fighting is a pause-and-plan affair), and it's a good and immersive game in the style of the books or the show. You'll start as one character, a member of the Night's Watch, play a chapter, then switch to a noble--with a twist (the screenshot should clue you in to what the twist is)--and by about the fourth or fifth chapter, you start to see how they're tying it together. Story-wise, it's done in Game of Thrones style, combat-wise, it's a standard RPG, pause-and-plan with a means of controlling various members of your party and a means of regenerating energy for attacks without requiring potions (though they are available if you want them).I highly, HIGHLY recommend a controller if you have one because without one, it's a bit of a hassle to deal with clunky controls. With a controller, though, it's a decent game with a decent story...though a bit too 'on rails' with a lot of invisible walls preventing players from really getting to explore some areas. As small as some maps are, the invisible walls aren't really necessary. It is worth noting, however, that some of the main characters, such as Mormont and Varys are voiced by the actors who portray those characters on the show, though Cersei is not voiced in the game by Lena Headey--which is a bit of a disappointment after hearing James Cosmo as Mormont and Conleth Hill as Varys.  Clunky PC controls requiring a controller and invisible walls make me only rate it about a 7 overall.			"

												I personally went in looking for an average or poor game, after reading the reviews, but after playing it for 30 mins it dawned on me that it's actually a pretty great RPG with a superb story. From really the start of the game it will pull you in and get you invested in the two main heroes and their cause. And will give you the ""game of thrones"" treatment story wise until the very end. The game does have it's flaws - and i would suggest you watch at least a minor youtube clip to see that you can handle the a bit strange 3rd person view. Also the AI is pretty dumb in most situations, but the combat, once you get used to it, feels solid and challenging enough to not get boring, and the AI being predicatble can be considered a good thing, as it allows youto build up your own strategy of how to deal with different groups of enemies. Plays well with KB/Mouse, no problems at all. And the graphics options and toggles that you would expect a PC game to have are all there.Final thoughts:Great game, with a great story, that looks a bit dated, but doesn't have any major glaring bugs and accomplishes what it sets out to do, which is tell you a story while giving you enough gameplay in between to make you feel apart of the story and that what you do matters.

												A surprisingly fun RPG; though the engine and mechanics feel a bit dated, it is true to the subject matter and for anyone looking for their ""Game of Thrones"" fix, this has a taste of the series for you.  As far as RPG's go, it is middle of the pack, nothing spectacular, so there are better pure RPG choices out there, but it is a faithfully written bit of GoT lore and worth it for any fan.			"

												Surprisingy good, especialy for how bad it was trashed in the reviews. Ok, the graphic sucks and the first couple hours move slowly.... but the combat system is deep and rewarding, while the storyline is great. With the current lack of great RPGs released on pc  in the last months, this could be a great filler. Beside, its really cheap to buy at the moment.			"

												Well, as I've never seen the show... And I hadnt' seen reviews for this game prior to purchase... I mostly went off the description... Thus far I'm really enjoying it, the two characters are interestingly different and the dialogue system is quiet interesting, there's pretty interesting story going on... Enough that i'm not just hacking through the game and ignoring it as i do in duller games... The combat is pretty nice, choosing when and how to order abilities and such is really flexible... theres a pretty good bit of look, not on the level of fallout or elder scrolls... but who needs to pick up and sell every plate they see... There's a bit of moral choices, Early in the game you decide the fate of some prisoners  based on talking to them and guards... Over all i really do like this game and it may tempt me to watch the show by the end, i'm already convinced i'll need to get the dlc and see how mors got his nickname...			"

												I heard this game sucked, and because of every other GoT game I had played, I believed it. This game isn't perfect by any means, but if you enjoy the show you will probably enjoy the game. If you have read the books and you aren't playing this game you are stupid. The graphics are not top notch, the camera is sometimes a bit wonky (yet much better than any of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ force unleashed games), and smaller ancillary characters are not voiced by the best actors. Those are my only complaints. I haven't beaten the game yet, but I'm enjoying the hell out of it.Both of the main characters are interesting and simply fun to play. Who hasn't wanted to warg into a nasty beast of a dog and rip throats out? Or setting your weapon on fire with the power of R'hllor before cutting down your enemies and converting the smallfolk to the Lord of Light?The game switches back and forth between these two characters, much like GRRM does in his novels. And as it is in the novels I'm upset every time I switch until I remember about the cool♥♥♥♥♥♥about to go down with the other character.

												The Critic-Reviews on this game do such an injustice based on a 5 min play session. This game has a very intriguing Story that kept me invested in the game. NOTHING was phoned in about the plot, it was well thought out from start to finish based on the books and using some special character faces from Season 1 of the TV series. The videos are short and keep you in suspense for the anticipating blood bath to come. The combat in the game is nothing revolutionary but it is fun and makes sense. A major complaint is that this game is clunky and glitch but I have only had 2 glitches in 40 hours of play and both were resolved easily without reloading… in fact I get more glitches with Call of Duty then I do with this game. This game isn’t state-of-the-art GOLD by any means but if you can get past the fact that not all games have the budget of Halo Reach and CoD Ghost then this is a solid game that looks great for what it is. Character Development is very well balanced… I never found myself dominating over groups of men and I did hit a few points were I had to try a few times to beat a special bad guy so the challenge part of the game is perfect. I am extremely satisfied with this game and the money I spent to have it.			"

												This game is all about story, dialogue and immersing yourself in the game of thrones. The RPG elements are a joke and the whole thing is pretty linear with very basic combat and gameplay that feels quite clunky. Yet I really enjoyed it because it had great dialogue with choices that felt like they mattered and a story that feels a lot like reading the books. Characters are not good or bad, but rather complicated individuals and there are plenty of hard choices. If you go in with low expectations, ignore the limits this game has and focus on immersing yourself in the characters and enjoying the story then this game can be quite entertaining.			"

Voice acting could have been better.Controls : The controls are just how older pc games used to handle, I think people that have a problem with it are just used to the refined console fighting controls, its not all that bad.Graphics : Yes the graphics are dated considering its a recent release, still playable but if you want stunning Crysis-like graphics this is not for you.If you can pick this game up in a sale as I did its a great buy, is it worth full price? not for me, but it would not have been the worst game I paid full price for.7 / 10			"

												Intruiging storyline following two men, both vassals of Tywin Lannister, who fled from their past after Robert Baratheon's rebellion. In each mainstory conversation you will get different options on what tosay, how to react or what to do, all which will effect the story and the the NPC:s opinion of you. The voice acting, on the other hand, is terrible. Everyone speak with monotone voices lacking of emotions as if the actors just read the script into the mic instead of acting it out. In an RPG containing more intruiging story than combat, the voice acting is important and Cyanide Studios should've tried getting better actors.The combat is inspired på the KotOR series. You have a skillset and you queue up your skills to execute combos and deal as much damage as possible. The combat part is well done and works fine. You upgrade your skill tree and choose yourself if you want a lot of different active skills, buff yourself with passives or use a combination of both.Some hitbox glitches can be found as well as a bad choice of camera angles during cutscenes, but apart from that the game was good. Not great or the best I've ever played, but certainly good and worth trying.7/10			"

												Oh where do I begin on a behemoth franchise such as Game of Thrones...Well first of all, I can probably say that you are not going to like this game, why you may ask, because considering this is a title released in 2012 you will be expecting it to maintain a certain quality about it which it sadly lacks. Allthough my complaints are few and mainly focused around the camera being centered to close to the protagonists back, I do not believe people who dislike this game are wrong.To break it down, the one point people seem to agree upon is that the story is what drives this game forward, it's a very interesting take on the events taking place during the first novell of the ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" saga, all be it not entirely canon unless we've been kept in the dark on some major nuggets of information both within the books and the HBO show.The errors I've heard about it is that the combat is way to repetative, and many people dislike the way it's done. For you who have played 'Of Orcs and Men', the combat is very similar to that, as is the gear system, only Game of Thrones seem to have a bit more indepth inventory. I personally enjoy this combat style, but as my favourite parts of the books are the priesthood of R'hllor, and my favourite part of the HBO show is Connleth Hill, it's hard for me to look down at this game too much. (Yes, Connleth does do a guest appearance as Varys).Another issue I care to mention that I personally struggled with was the portrayal of women, and whilst I am not a fan of the heated pro or cons of feminism debatte raging online, let me just tell you that even I who generally doesn't mind exploitation or characters not being described to their fullest was shocked with how there seems to be no noteworthy woman in this game at all, but hey, atleast the protagonists are allright. (Warning, one of the voiceactors for the protagonists sound like coarse stone).So to summarise, as much as I personally enjoyed this game, it probably isn't for you. I can live with the poor graphic, a handful of bugs and an uncomfortable camera angle as I am so interested in Westeros, but I wouldn't expect many others to put up with so much. But at the end of the day, I really enjoyed the game, it was fairly lengthy if you did the side missions and it never felt to easy or to difficult. But if you against all odds find it in you to deal with all of these things I've warned you about above here, I strongly recommend the game simply on the basis that I enjoyed the combat system, and the story is good.That and I got to play as a servant of R'hllor so it was basically 90% me roleplaying as Thoros of Myr.

												My expectations for the game were low, but it turned out to be one of the best RPGs I have ever played. And I've played quite a few.It's impossible to escape comparisons to the first Witcher game, in good and bad. The game features set protagonists -- two of them, which you'll alternate controlling for the first 10 chapters, after which they'll adventure together -- and the role of the player is not so much to decide WHAT they do, but HOW they do it. This is a fairly rewarding affair, as each and every choice you make in dialogue is likely to have consequences. Often not large ones, but the game nonetheless does a very good job in acknowledging the player's choices.The protagonists themselves stand out even in the fantasy world, Alester being an exiled noble turned Red Preist trying to reclaim his lands and Mors a skinchanger brother of the Night's Watch. Alester can use many abilities tied to fire, most notably revealing hidden passages and other secrets, while Mors is able to take control of his dog, who can then scout ahead or execute stealth kills. Both are well-written, and the player is given enough power over their behaviour for it not to feel as though the story is simply something one pokes along.The story is of epic proportions. It took me nearly 60 hours to clear the game, though at the hardest difficulty I had to replay many a battle. This brings up one of my grievances with the game: Much too often, difficult battles would be preceded by long dialogue sequences which you'd then have to navigate through again if you died. Inexplicably, it's not possible to load a game during battle, even if it's clear you're going to lose, but are forced to exit to the title screen first.The game isn't exactly small, but the few locations you can visit definitely start feeling cramped once you've ran through them a couple of times. Budget constraints are evident in virtually every aspect of the game, again very similarly to the first Witcher game. Another similarity is the very inconsistent quality of voice-acting. The protagonists are well-voiced, and the game even features some of the cast from the TV series, but most minor NPCs are Staruday morning cartoon quality.There is a LOT of dialogue in the game, and that's what ate up most of my time playing the game. Unfortunately, a lot of that time was spent REplaying through dialogue, and not only due to the save mechanic cited above. The game employs a dialogue wheel, and each choice usually entails quite a bit of back-and-forth between the characters after the initial line. This often makes it difficult to predict what exactly will each choice make your character say and do. As yet another poor design trope, dialogue choices often inexplicably become unselectable unless you pick them in just the right order, and often it's simply impossible to ask a character all the questions you could without reloading, for no apparent purpose whatsoever.There isn't a great deal of combat in the game, but what little there is is very clunky and unvaried. There is a definite tactical element, certainly, and at a high difficulty you're almost guaranteed to find yourself having to reload and try different strategies after the current one led to defeat. But every opponent is basically just a human of one of the six playable classes, with just their armour, weapon and health varying, so it quite quickly starts feeling like you're just going through the motions with each fight. By the time the game was over I was only too glad to be done with this aspect of the game.Despite these problems, it's still a very good game. A gem in the rough, certainly, but a gem nonetheless. Definitely recommended for any lovers of story-driven RPGs. Quality of writing is high, and the story is even canonical, so here's your opportunity to add to the Game of Thrones mythos. :P			"

												Highly underated. The voice acting is great. I wish more games especially RPGs had voice acting. The combat is simple to understand but has the strategies one comes to expect from an RPG. While the combat is nothing like Dragon Age: Origins, this game's combat is like a basic version of that game's combat. I'll update my review when I finish the game.			"

												This game is pretty solid RPG actually.The first few minutes will probably make you  like ""wow this combat system sucks, this graphics is bad and the story seems uninteresting"". I gave it a try and I wasn't disappointed because story got interesting and characters started to be likable. As you progress in story graphics also gets more likable and Mors Westford is hell of a Badass. He was my favourite character from the beginning and he kept that role until end of the game. Overall I think it's solid RPG experience with lot of skills and perks.8/10			"

												The UI in this game is too terrible to get past. And it takes 15 minutes of mediocre, slow dialogue to get to the part of the game where you can actually do something.Unless there are changes to the UI, I probably will not pick this game back up, and I can't recommend that anyone else pick it up either.

												It is somewhat difficult to get into, the story holds tight enough that you won't quit too soon. Originally the combat mechanics are clunky and annoying it gradually becomes more and more fun. Entering the third act of the game is when the plot becomes incredible, with the classic Game of Thrones intrigue, deceit, and twists sure to captivate any player. Though the game does feel unfinished RPG and Ice and Fire fans can surely look past all the flaws and see the truly engrossing gem that it is.			"

You can get so many information about the lore of SOIAF und meet Maester Martin (*cough*) himself. If you're common with the books, this story maybe reveals the past of one character, whom could get interesting soon ;)And if you're here for the achievements - yeah give it a try.

												SPOILER FREE REVIEWThe Game of Thrones RPG isn't the perfect game, but it does have a perfect story. George R.R Martin helped write it and you can tell, especially with all the intrigue and twists and turns. The game suffers from annoying combat mechanics and there isn't that much to do besides the main quest and one or two side quests, but it is a perfect game for any hardcore ASOIAF fans.The story is great and you play as two main characters, and you visit many places throughout the game. The iconic locations are in such as Castle Black and King's Landing, you can go to Mole's Town as well. But most of the NPC in the game just stand around and offer nothing to the story but to make the locations look full of life. You can also hear the authentic voices of Joer Mormont and Varys, and the voice acting of the two main characters is great also. The combat is a good system, but the annoyance is being ganged on upon by 5-6 enemies at a time. Even on the easiest difficulty the combat was annoying, not hard, just a pain. Many times I just wanted to skip the combat and advance throughout the story. Levelling up is cool, and there are alot of cool items in the game. My character for example was weilding Ser Duncan's sheid, and you can even use The Red Viper's spear. Those items are included with the Weapon Pack DLC though. Each ""Chapter"" in the game has the main quest and 1-2 side quests you can do. Side quests usually help you out later with the main quest if you accomplish them. But once you complete the quests there is nothing to do in the game but maybe fight in the arenas to get more cash. Making cash is easy, just sell all the stuff you don't have. No need to really fight for it. The game is great for all ASOIAF and GOT fans to enjoy. The story is great and you will feel for the characters, but just remember in GOT their is no such thing as a happy ending.			"

												Gameplay is reminiscent of of Knights of the Old Republic, except that you can't make time stop altogether during combat which makes controlling a group a touch more difficult.

												This is not a good game. And it's unfortunate because the land of Westeros is a great scenario for a game. The devs just simply did not put effort into making this game intuitive, enjoyable, and flowing. The controls are awful, the combat is uninspired, the only thing that redeems this game is the Mass Effect-like choices and the setting of the plot. I bought this for about the cost of a meal and I would have much rather gone out to dinner.3/10. Would not recommend unless you're willing to settle for subpar Western RPGs.Edit: I'm not sure what's more abhorrent...the fact that the gameplay and interface are so undercooked or the fact that the game's plot literally starts out with a young man getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to death. I know J.R.R. Martin is brutal about main character deaths, but I feel like the devs took some liberties with the ""I don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; factor.			"

												Don't bother.Even if you're like me, a huge ASOIAF and RPG fan who wanted more of Westeros, you'll probably hate this. Most of the positive reviews cite the game's plot as a positive, but it's hard to enjoy any plot with voice acting as bad as this. It's not particularly convincing when someone says 'the archers come from behind us' in a tone of mild domestic surprise.Plus, everything is so damn slow. Characters swing their weapons sluggishly. Loading takes too long. Even the UI is a chore, forcing you to click 'confirm' every time you click a different section in your inventory.There's too much at fault here to allow yourself to enjoy it.			"

												I heard this game sucked, and because of every other GoT game I had played, I believed it. This game isn't perfect by any means, but if you enjoy the show you will probably enjoy the game. If you have read the books and you aren't playing this game you are stupid. The graphics are not top notch, the camera is sometimes a bit wonky (yet much better than any of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ force unleashed games), and smaller ancillary characters are not voiced by the best actors. Those are my only complaints. I haven't beaten the game yet, but I'm enjoying the hell out of it.Both of the main characters are interesting and simply fun to play. Who hasn't wanted to warg into a nasty beast of a dog and rip throats out? Or setting your weapon on fire with the power of R'hllor before cutting down your enemies and converting the smallfolk to the Lord of Light?The game switches back and forth between these two characters, much like GRRM does in his novels. And as it is in the novels I'm upset every time I switch until I remember about the cool♥♥♥♥♥♥about to go down with the other character.

												Now, this is a hard game to talk about,Personally, I like the story, the idea is good, there were twists in it I didn't expect and it's just about good enough that I think it can fit into this world wellIt has however got it's flaws, such as magic working before the return of the dragons, that doesn't fit at all with the time of the story at which the game is based. Most of these isues however I will overlookThe more pressing issues are the gameplay and the graphics in this game. I would rather have a game where I could play one of the main characters 1st person and do the fighting myself instead of using this 3rd person mechanic the game hasThe game generally feels unfinished. It's all of the small things, such as being able to walk through some walls, ai not working, seemingly unbeatable foes at parts of the game, badly scaled difficulty and the mish-mash of high-res textures on armour and super low-res on weaponry.It just looks and feels poorAll in all, the story is good, well thought through and a decent length of 18 hours supprisingly, however the poorly designed gameplay and lack of attention to the graphics and AI in the game do ruin the feel of the playthrough.

Game of Thrones - The Roleplaying Game,...realy not that bad after allThis game is much better than its reputation. The characters are believably written and very memorable. Overall, the story is realy great. You don't have to have read the books, though it might help understanding the ovarching lore a bit better. Technically the game realy isn't that great. The animations are stiff, the voice acting isn't top notch and so are the graphics. But you have to remember that the budget wasn't very high. The game is perfectly playable, though the battle system takes a little time to get used to. The further I got the more I enjoyed it. Please don't stop after one or two chapters. I realy enjoyed the 29 hours it took me to complete the game(including the prequel DLC ""beyond the wall""). For some players it might be important to know, that the game is more heavily based on the books than the TV Series. There are two characters (Jeor Mormont and Varys) that resemble the actors of the HBO series and are voiced by them, but that's it. Most locations don't resemble the ones you might know from TV. King's Landing has more of an european Middle-Age-Vibe to it, for example. Of course there's the ingenious Theme.The game takes place during the first book/season, so you won't spoil yourself anything that takes place after that time. "

												GoT is a 3D-role playing game based on the tv-show. Its special feature is that you have to create two main characters. Most of the time you control a party up to 4 characters. In combat you can slow down time and pick different skills to fight enemies.pro-Setting up two characters feels fresh and interesting-You control the dog of Mors (one of your characters) to search stuff and to sneak behind enemies-Story matches the tone of GoTcontra-Combat is very boring due the abilities are very blend and generic.Overall GoT is a good RPG which really suffers of its boring battles. Most of the time you are fighting and it is clearly the weakest part of the game. "

												I have mixed feelings on this game. Story-wise, it remains loyal to the series and introduces new characters as well as characters from the show (with some of the actual cast providing voices!) Basically, the game is set in a similar style to the books. You play as two characters, Mors, a ranger of the Night's Watch, and Alester, a red priest who has returned from Braavos to reclaim his father's seat as Lord. You switch between both characters  every chapter. The RPG elements are great, allowing you to choose your style of play. Mors and Alester have different fighting styles, and you can pick which path you want them to go down. You can upgrade your skill tree, add points to weapons etc... all the typical RPG things. What ultimately kills it however is the combat system.  When you engage in battle you select an enemy and you can line up attacks. Using such an old combat model for this type of game is its downfall. I could look past some of the other aspects except this.Performance-wise, the game is stable and runs smoothly. The graphics are dated, but they're not bad so to say. Just don't expect super beautiful graphics. The enviroments are also a bit shallow. Riverspring, during the riots felt a bit bland to my taste. There was none of that true hateful spirit! You need to play the game to see for yourself. Apart from that the game hasn't aged well. It feels like it was made back in 2000. But what about the story? The thing that made me a big fan of GoT is the story, which in this case this game has remained loyal to. The game takes place before the events of the first book, in a simpler time when Robert Baratheon was still whoring away, Eddard Stark's head was still on his shoulders and the realm was finally in peace after the downfall of the Targaryens. Some of the cast members from the show lent their voices! I was absolutely surprised when I heard Varys' spidery voice narrating the intro and good ol' Jeor Mormont giving orders to the Night's Watch. It's those little things that make this game so special. It has it's flaws but if you are willing to overlook the outdated game mechanics, I recommend this. It's a must-get for any true GoT fan (It's better for readers of the book, but show-watchers are welcome to try it!) If you want a proper quality GoT experience, play Telltale's Game of Thrones game. There is far more polish and TV-esque story than this. EDIT: Oh and I forgot to mention the voice acting. Apart from the cast who lent their voices (which sound just like in the show!) some of the voices can sound uninspired, like when they're saying, ""OH MY GOD WE'RE GONNA DIE!"" They sound sort of bored. Not all the voices are like that, but some definetly are.			"

												(+) George R. R. Martin again wrote a great story, with great twists and many dead characters as usual. The storyline runs parallel to the main story of the first book and they almost touch sometimes. It's a tragedy as close to the book as possible without just telling the same story or object it.(-) The technical realisation is awful. The fighting system is interesting but gets pretty boring after a few fights. The skill tree is unbalanced, you got some really strong abilities on one hand, but many are pretty useless. The settings are often really small (Kings Landing is explored in 5-10 mins). The graphics aren't that good also, not totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but they don't fit a story so mighty. Also you get about 10 different weapons and armaments for every class, but except for a few legendarys they are all the same and you end up fighting Lannisters, while wearing a Lannister-breastplate, because thats the best you get for quite a while, but you hate it since you are a ranger from the Wall. But only in the very late game you have enough gold (and the chance to visit a trader) to buy some legendary stuff. All in all there are some heavy issues with how the epic story is implemented and it's really sad, because with a little more budget and a little more time this game could have been awesome.(->) Anyway: I liked the game because of it's great story which made up for all the pain I suffered while playing. I think I won't play it again even if i want to check out some different classes (haven't played the archer yet), but it's just too boring if you know whats going on.If you are a GoT fan or even read the books you should consider buying this piece (at least on sale!), because it tells a George R. R. Martin story in the universe of GoTl, that you can't buy as a book.			"

			Title: Game of Thrones Genre : Role-playing game Developed by : Cyanide Studios Published by : Atlus Date Of release : June 8, 2012		

The game-play of this game is not all that amazing, witch can be condemnation from the word go to some people, but it's not beyond quality. The combat wasn't repetitive,  enough, the game's world wasn't linier and small enough to make me want to quit.  Despite all it's flaws, the story is the best part of the game, i would say it's on par with the TV series, and it was more than enough to motivate me to invest about 20 hours or so it took me to finish it. I guess the question you have to ask yourself is, are the kind of person who can forgive not so great mechanics for a story ? If no, then don't bother. Otherwise if you ever see it on sale, and  don't mind a game that is overall only slightly above average, then go ahead.			"

												I have heard horable things about this game, but since I am a GoT fan, I bought it anyway. I actually enjoyed the gameplay and the combat for the game. The storyline was very into it, and had the GoT feeling to it. Soundtrack was amazing and so was the graphics.			"

												As a ""game"", it lacks substance, the combat feels empty and overall generic, compared to say Witcher, it is a means to an end. But that end is quite fine in it's own right. The storylines are enticing enough, and the voice acting is good. I still have quite a bit to go, but what I have played so far will bring me back. I'd give what I have played so far a 7/10.			"

												It's basically an interactive story on rails. There's not much choice involved. Kill some stuff, listen to a lot of story, kill more stuff, listen to story.The story is good and the voice acting is pretty admirable. The combat isn't particularly interesting though and the ""on rails"" bit means there isn't much choice in how you approach the game.Recommended if you love Game of Thrones back story. Not recommended otherwise.			"

												I was hesitant to buy this game at first, due to the overwhelming number of negative reviews it had, but I'm glad I did. It has an amazing plot, and was a very in-depth RPG overall. Choice definitely matters in the outcome of the story. Only thing negative was the graphics and movement/camera.			"

												Wow. This game kicks so much♥♥♥♥♥ One of the best stories I've encountered in a game. It's so good that it completely overshadows the terrible combat system. If you're a fan of the books or the show I definately recomend it. Mors Westford is my favorite Game of Thrones character, and he's only in the game!!			"

												As others have stated this is definitely a story driven game. On the story alone I would recommend GOT. At first I was not impressed with the combat but as the game progressed and the 2 heroes united I felt the game take on a different tone. More abilities became available and maybe sticking with the same 2 characters I learned how to use them effectively and had a more enjoyable time. Combat became more frequent which may also had something to do with my enjoyment.I am still not a complete fan of the combat system however it is used in several of the DEVs games. As is the same awful camera controls. Once I got over the fact I would experience at times not being able to see my characters fully while in combat and during some cut scenes having my character stuck in a door or looking through my companions head or at a wall(etc...) I didn't hate it as much.When I play I think of replayability. At first I thought NO. however during my game I rethought that and even though I would not immerse myself in the dialogue as I did It still may be fun trying the different combat stances and actually striving to finish all the side quests. I also think of bang for the buck(joy for the price) and since I bought GOT at a huge discount I definitely got my moneys worth for 1 play and if I do come back in a month or more than the bang will only increase.

												Don't bother.Even if you're like me, a huge ASOIAF and RPG fan who wanted more of Westeros, you'll probably hate this. Most of the positive reviews cite the game's plot as a positive, but it's hard to enjoy any plot with voice acting as bad as this. It's not particularly convincing when someone says 'the archers come from behind us' in a tone of mild domestic surprise.Plus, everything is so damn slow. Characters swing their weapons sluggishly. Loading takes too long. Even the UI is a chore, forcing you to click 'confirm' every time you click a different section in your inventory.There's too much at fault here to allow yourself to enjoy it.			"

												Lost interest with this game pretty quickly, Voice actors are sub-par (excluding those from the TV series), Game mechanics are severely lacking, UI is flawed, rendering is about the same a MS paint so you would be better off throwing rocks at cars than buying this POS. 0.5/10 Potatoes			"

												I am still not done with the game but record does not show many hours played offline. I am chapter 9 with Mors.This is an official Game of Throne that wants to entertain by keeping you in the GOT universe while not all main TV series character presence are in the game.The story is good if not very good, the dialogues are decent but the acting may be felt a bit over arching here and there and the voice timber a bit down low-too rough imo, yet it remains entertaining!The game mechanics are simple, the gameplay is simple.The game has several game difficulty modes which to me is the weakest point of that game whereas the difference between Easy and Normal mode past chapter 3 or 4 is really wide. (Mors in the forest trying to help the lady and must kill one of Vallar's best lieutenant).I would also say that money does not drop enough in my opinion and it is hard to suit up as a result.Over than that, this is a very entertaining game for the price. I recommend to anyone who are open minded, love well crafted stories and like GOT universe.This is a game for CASUAL GAMERS, if you feel like a hard core gamer to the throat then this is definitely not for you. this is a story and character developement oriented game. This is not a hack and slash nor a dungeon crawler!!!! you will be asked to fight... decently enough for casual gamers and THE PRICE IS ATTRACTIVE FOR THE GAME LENGTH!!!!!All  hail GOT, any and every official GOT ;_)			"

												A very casual RPG. It definitely doesn't comply with current standards when it comes to graphics and gameplay; despite being just a couple of years old it kind of feels like it was made a decade ago. But the story is very engaging, and it compels you to keep playing just to know how it unfolds. Much like the books (or TV series), not everything turns out the way you think. And the ending is so epic. The game is a bit slow at first but it gets better as you progress; and it's long enough for a casual RPG.It's not a bad attempt to translate the franchise to video game format. It's definitely worth a try.If you're a fan of the franchise, or if you're really into RPGs, you must play this game. Otherwise I recommend you to only buy it when it's on a sale.			"

												Like RPG'S? Enjoy a Song of Ice and Fire? Don't have a system that can run Dragon Age Inquisition on ultra just yet? Even if you answered no to the third this game is more than likely for you if you answered yes to the first two questions. I'm used to RPG's like Dragon Age and Knights of the Old Republic but having the chance to dive into the world George R.R Martin out lord and savior (may the old gods shine their light upon him) created without playing Mount and Blade Warband with it's clunky controlls and needless faction grinding is to say the least, and excuse my language, ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. 11/10 if you don't already have this game you're either broke or live under a rock, If so may the steam gods bless you with enough cash to burn for this stellar game.

												""If this were called Dragon Age people would like it and it would be 10/10! People are just jealous of how great Game of Thrones is.""No, they aren't. This is an awful PC port and a cheap cash-in sanctioned by Martin himself. The controls are atrocious (just play with a controller. You'll be better off), the voice acting is sub-par, and the story is so predictable they should call it Bioshock Infinite. 3/10.			"

												I actually find this game very enjoyable. The characters are quite unique, the story isn't half-bad, the cinematic feel of it all... It makes you feel like it's a movie or a tv-show, but you're playing it, and the equipment looks great most of the time. I would really have preferred some of the things in this game to what they did in the HBO-series, like the gold-cloaks armor and the lannister-helmets.Very fun, very exciting, and it captures the feel of Westeros quite well. And honestly, who doesn't like to play a religious fanatic from time to time, eh?			"

												The best word i can use to describe this game is TEDIOUS. My main body of complaint about this game would be the really bad fighting system. It is awful and completely unnecessary... its so bad that i cant bring myself to play it past the first quest, which is a pity because the story is pretty interesting despite the gamplay. When i bought this i didnt get a Game of Thrones... I purchased a Game of Regret.			"

												This game has horrible reviews from the critics and I'm not sure why.  Perhaps at realease it was more buggy, but it seems ok to me.  It's a decent RPG with a great storyline.  Voice acting and graphics are bad, but i've played worse.  For GoT and RPG fans i'd say this is a good buy at regular price, and a great buy if on sale (i got it for 8 bucks).  3rd Person interface with wasd and and mouse controls.  I'd say a solid 7/10.  (8/10 if your a Game of Thrones nerd like me! :)			"

												I usually dont right reviews but after 15hrs of gameplay and probably halfway through.My gameplay exp also includes ALL the DLC - i disadvice anybody below 18 buying the game.ok CONS: Graphics 8/10:for me i don't really care for it but i know alot do. Impressive but not enough to make you feel like your playing CoD or BF but is good enough to play. (This is on max graphics)Combat 6/10i'll sum this up quickly, feels robotic & not very realistic. Its more of a select your options and wait for the cooldown to use again. Sometimes i feel there's too many oponents thrown in just for the hell of it.Story 10/10: 2 very small gltichs not even worth mentioning Some bugs and glitches , found only 2 so far... 1 i actually screenshoted it i found it so funny. The other was a conversation glitch where i saw the wall instead of the person.I feel there's just that tiny bit to much running around and gathering coins and extras things to help you in your game.(this is for if you want to get 100%)if you just want to plough through and dont care about the trinkets in the game then you wont notice.=======PRO'sGraphics 8/10:for me i don't really care for it but i know alot do. Impressive but not enough to make you feel like Playing CoD or BF but is good enough to play. (This is on max graphics)Combat 6/10. I love that you can slow down time to make your decisions because the combat is very fast paced and you can run multiple characters at the same time.Story 10/10: Very rich story, LOVE IT ! ! i would rate it a full 10==========DLC Is it worth getting , Yes. All of the DLC Defeientely add to the game ==========If the price is right?mmmm, if its £15+DLC and below Yes !=========I hope this review helps			"

												A very solid RPG similar to Dragon Age, with some rough edges, but solid systems and a very rewarding experiance overall. The game fits in perfectly with the Song of Ice and Fire universe, without wasting too much time on needless fan-service. You will see some familiar faces, but the story is completely it's own creature and you will grow to care about Mors and Alester as much as any of the characters from the novels. Troughout the game, branching options with real cconsequences pull you into the story as you continually try to choose the lesser of two evils, in true Game of Thrones fashion. The game also gives fans something the books may never provide... an honestly great ending, and a true sense of closure. If you enjoy RPGs and liked the books or the show, you owe it to yourself to pick this up.			"

												Well, as I've never seen the show... And I hadnt' seen reviews for this game prior to purchase... I mostly went off the description... Thus far I'm really enjoying it, the two characters are interestingly different and the dialogue system is quiet interesting, there's pretty interesting story going on... Enough that i'm not just hacking through the game and ignoring it as i do in duller games... The combat is pretty nice, choosing when and how to order abilities and such is really flexible... theres a pretty good bit of look, not on the level of fallout or elder scrolls... but who needs to pick up and sell every plate they see... There's a bit of moral choices, Early in the game you decide the fate of some prisoners  based on talking to them and guards... Over all i really do like this game and it may tempt me to watch the show by the end, i'm already convinced i'll need to get the dlc and see how mors got his nickname...			"

												Surprisingly good RPG, had they put in just a little more effort and polish to the game, it would have definitely rivaled with Witcher 1 and DA:O for my favorit spot. Still, if you aren´t one to nag over small issues and enjoy linear RPGs, you may find GOT game to be quite the hidden gem.			"

												quality game thats only spoilt a little by a few strange / amatuer choices by the devs. They should re-do the voice acting again  as this game has the best story of any game or game of thrones season so far, its just some of the voices couldnt get any worse. Please play more than an hour as the first hour all you see are the small issues/ bad choices. after an hour all you want is to see what happens next. Gripped until the end. Multiple Endins aswell so I might have to re-play it			"

												This game is not as bad as some would have you think. If you enjoyed Game of Thones and like old school controls then its worth picking this game up.Story : In brief you get a decent storyline to follow and you also get to make decisions that change certain elements of the story. Voice acting could have been better.Controls : The controls are just how older pc games used to handle, I think people that have a problem with it are just used to the refined console fighting controls, its not all that bad.Graphics : Yes the graphics are dated considering its a recent release, still playable but if you want stunning Crysis-like graphics this is not for you.If you can pick this game up in a sale as I did its a great buy, is it worth full price? not for me, but it would not have been the worst game I paid full price for.7 / 10			"

												This game is all about story, dialogue and immersing yourself in the game of thrones. The RPG elements are a joke and the whole thing is pretty linear with very basic combat and gameplay that feels quite clunky. Yet I really enjoyed it because it had great dialogue with choices that felt like they mattered and a story that feels a lot like reading the books. Characters are not good or bad, but rather complicated individuals and there are plenty of hard choices. If you go in with low expectations, ignore the limits this game has and focus on immersing yourself in the characters and enjoying the story then this game can be quite entertaining.			"

												Very skeptical about buying this game at first, but as i enjoy watching the show it was a must buy (and should be for you if you enjoy the show) this game has a very immersive story that has multiple outcomes (which i am a sucker for) the storyline consists of 2 characters that you play as one is a member of the nights watch  Mors Westford who also has a dog companion and the other is Alester Sarwyck, a Red Priest and the rightful heir to the town riverwood which he trys to reclaim. Without giving away any more i throughly enjoy this game.  It gets better as you play, SO DO NOT QUIT EARLY :)Pros-Multiple choiceGood storyNot boring (switch between characters)Cons-Laggy whenever you move the camera (can be very frustrating, need to slowly move camera)didn't really enjoy combat, a lot like the witcher style would much rather have to go up to someone and stick a sword through them rather than being tactical :)7-8/10			"

												The game is a mix of GoT epic storyline and Kotor combat engine.You assume the role of 2 noble characters that fight against all the corruption of Westeros.The game is great if:-You like Kotor-You like GoT-You like totally unexpected plot twists(A song of Ice and Fire style)The only problem with the game( at least with my style) is the lack of balance between characters.Their skills were opposites and i found myself changing difficulty settings between chapters.The 2 men don't complement each other well and one was OP'ish while the other one was frustratingly weak.(the first char you play is the OP'ish one)The story is,like A song of Ice and Fire itself filled with 2-3 characters you love and a army of evil and corrupt idiots that you want to turn into your darts target.The plot twists were really unexpected(really,the last thing you could expect) and characters *spoiler*(read this reversed) daed yats ot tnaw t'nod *end spoiler*Really great way to immerse yourself in the world,as the game was canonised by RR Martin himself.The near-turn based style complements the scene,putting fast paced action and slow motion scenes into the ...decently... made scene.Lacking the great graphic efects of ,say,Skyrim,it immerses the player through Story.Warning,you may experience dreams of torturing characters from the game,if that happens,DON'T PANIC!Its normal for Game of Thrones stuff.9,75/10.(Really,the 0.25 is about the characters whoose eyes i poked out with a hot iron.)*Note:i am not a psycho.These are just jokes.Treat them accordingly.

												I picked this up on the summer sale and it was easily the best purchase of the whole sale.  It is a really fun game with a solid storyline.  If you're a fan of the books or hbo series and like RPGs you should pick it up.  It is about the storyline and things happen that are outside of your control that people might feel is railroading but I feel it is very true to the song of ice and fire setting.  You won't spend hours managing your inventory or tweaking your followers.  Just play and enjoy the story.The DLC is bad... very bad.  Avoid wasting money on it.  I wish you could buy additional point of views as DLC.  Martin's cameo is funny.			"

												Actually a quite beautiful game which seems very faithful to the lore of the books. The combat is the only real weak point of the game, though once you get into it you forget the initial clunkiness pretty quickly.A very solid and interesting storyline, though Mors is easily the better of the two characters the game continously shifts between. Hope they make a sequel, despite the bad reviews. A LOT more fun than any review lead me to believe.			"

												Pros:- The story & characters are very well put together- Pausable combat, which is always a + for me- Interesting approach to abilities tree, with skills u acquire due your decisions etc. (although  sadly they don't affect your game too much)- U get to control a dog and sniff around - pure genius :)- At first, i didn't like the combat system. But then i got a better hang of it, and it works just like a simplified DAO. Once you get what armour and weapon you should use, it is even fun at times.Cons:- A lot of small annoying bugs like corpses floating indefinetely in the air, NPCs just standing in the middle of the fight like nothing's happening etc. etc.- Graphics are kind of choppy for this age- The map is just awful, no other words to describe it - no pssibility of waypoints, the icons have no description (for instance, you have a door icon, but there is no telling where that leads) etc.All in all, probably the story is what keeps the game afloat. Probably a 6.5 out of 10.LE: After finishing it, and getting more familiar with the combat system, i think 7.0/10 is more fair.			"

												Story of the game is just incredible, lot of surprises (most of them unpleasant) - similar to books or TV series.But - camera is terrible and makes game-play more than painful, especially in narrow passages and inside of buildings.For fans of AGOT must have, others just ignore.			"

												This game has one of the better stories I've seen in an RPG in years. Very much worth the  price it regularly goes for at the time of this review and definitely worth getting on sale (I got my copy as part of a Humble Bundle so I definetly got my money's worth).			"

												The game is a mix of GoT epic storyline and Kotor combat engine.You assume the role of 2 noble characters that fight against all the corruption of Westeros.The game is great if:-You like Kotor-You like GoT-You like totally unexpected plot twists(A song of Ice and Fire style)The only problem with the game( at least with my style) is the lack of balance between characters.Their skills were opposites and i found myself changing difficulty settings between chapters.The 2 men don't complement each other well and one was OP'ish while the other one was frustratingly weak.(the first char you play is the OP'ish one)The story is,like A song of Ice and Fire itself filled with 2-3 characters you love and a army of evil and corrupt idiots that you want to turn into your darts target.The plot twists were really unexpected(really,the last thing you could expect) and characters *spoiler*(read this reversed) daed yats ot tnaw t'nod *end spoiler*Really great way to immerse yourself in the world,as the game was canonised by RR Martin himself.The near-turn based style complements the scene,putting fast paced action and slow motion scenes into the ...decently... made scene.Lacking the great graphic efects of ,say,Skyrim,it immerses the player through Story.Warning,you may experience dreams of torturing characters from the game,if that happens,DON'T PANIC!Its normal for Game of Thrones stuff.9,75/10.(Really,the 0.25 is about the characters whoose eyes i poked out with a hot iron.)*Note:i am not a psycho.These are just jokes.Treat them accordingly.

												Its a great roleplaying game, plain and simple.  If you are a fan of the Game of Thrones series like I am, and like roleplaying games, its just plain neat.I really am enjoying being in the nights watch and seeing the ominous, thrilling wall that goes on forever.The combat is tactical not action.  The game does say that in the description, but I thought it would be somewhat twitch based, it is not.  You choose the actions of the character and they carry them out in real time, but you can pause any time and change and/or que up orders.Its a role playing game, which means you do get to build up your character, choose attributes and skills, buy, find, and equip different weapons and armor.  I love it.  Exploration pays off in finding new items, etc.The graphics are fantastic at the highest settings and at 1600 by 900 resolution.  I know that people criticized the graphics for the Xbox, but the computer version to me at least, captures the world perfectly.The dialogue and story is game of thrones, that simple.  Horrible actions, rough words, and intigue everywhere.  Do not let your children play this game.  The first quest is caused by some horrible, R rated actions.A few things could be better.You have to almost be on top of an item before you see it.  For example, you may see a bunch of crates across the room, but you have to walk over there and almost be touching them before you get an icon that there is something to grab.The game appears to be fairly linear.  I'm very early in the game, but its not a wide open world to explore, its more of a tight knit story to follow.  There are sidequests, and several neat choices in the dialogue, but this is a more linear game.Needs more actors from the series.  The only voices that I believe are in it from the series are Varas and the commander of the Night's watch, thats it.  Since this takes place parallel to season 1, there are so many others we could have met.  I don't know what other characters may be around, but even if we get to meet them, they won't be the same voices.Anyways, I don't what was up with the Xbox version, but the pc special edition version is a great game if you would like to enjoy Westeros for a little bit while waiting for season 5.  Right now its on sale for 5 bucks.  Its a steal!			"

												Game of Thrones title is fully earned here - evil will triumph and the innocent blood will grease the gears of political schemes.Writing is the main course here - the plot takes place shortly after Robert Baratheon's death, when the king's bast... errm... illegitimate children are being hunted. We have two main characters with separate storylines and motives, but they will be forced to take part in the political events. The atmosphere is very bleak, treachery lurks everywhere. The game features some of the most disturbing scenes in gaming - done so well, that the worst one isn't even graphic.There are a lot of smaller and bigger choices to make, the consequences are often non-direct or delayed - but they have impact on the plot.The game is off-putting at the beginning - the visuals are outdated (though some of the textures, armors etc. look weirdly good) and the combat feels slow and boring. But if only you'll stay a bit longer, hopefully you'll find yourself in the story's grip. The graphics will still be awful, but servicable. Combat will pick up a bit though once you'll learn more skills and get more stamina to use them - it will still be a bit boring as it's very tactical and focues on disabling and exploiting enemies (at higher difficulty levels it's very challenging).Get the Beyond of Wall DLC if you decide to play the game - it's a short prequel and it's great.

												Actually a quite beautiful game which seems very faithful to the lore of the books. The combat is the only real weak point of the game, though once you get into it you forget the initial clunkiness pretty quickly.A very solid and interesting storyline, though Mors is easily the better of the two characters the game continously shifts between. Hope they make a sequel, despite the bad reviews. A LOT more fun than any review lead me to believe.			"

												I really Game of Thrones TV series, but after all those bad and mediocre reviews, I bought it at sale expecting a disaster from the GoT RPG. I was wrong, very wrong... Gameplay seems clunky and unintuitive at first, but with every new level and skill it becomes more tactical. The combat system resembles MMO games, player is not controling the battles personally, but he's putting abillities and attacks into queue and the character executes them in the given order.  You have to think about, what abillity you use and when, how to combine them to give the highest damage possible. Enemies use abilities too, but with the right skills there is a posibility to interupt them or avoid taking damage. You can deal serious damage by combinig the right skills of yours and of your companions, on the other hand, if you distribute your skill points badly and just click on the abillity icons, you won't get far... The most exiting part of the game however is the story. The story is mature, dark and full of twists. Choices matters, and some of them may bite your a** later in the storyline. It's not about saving the world, characters have beliavable motivations and their lines are well written. I really love, how Cyanide made the plot lines of both main characters merge into one and how they fit them into the world of GoT, with events from series happening on the background. Bioware should takes some notes from this, about how to write a story.Even though it does not have the neatest graphics, voice overs of secondary characters are quite bad and there are few clipping and pathfinding bugs, I enjoyed it from start to the end, sometimes the story left me with my jaw wide open, which I didn't experienced in a videogame for a very long time.

												Game of Thrones is really an overlooked and underrated game on the field of RPGs. It tells a great story of 2 knights in the world of George R.R. Martin's Game of Thrones and fits well with the Book/TV Show. The game's strength is storytelling, and this is probably the problem for some percent of players, because there is a lot of conversation and narration in the game. Most of the game you will be running around and talking to people solving the next puzzle of the story (i would say around 70/30% for Conversations/Fight). The Fighting system is good (reminds me of Dragon Age) and there is a decent amount of skills, loot and customization to play with. The game is fairly linear but there are some secondary/optional quests to do as well as some minor exploration. The graphics is outdated but it works for me as it gives a good overall feel for the game.As said the storytelling and the voice acting what makes this game great and worth checking. It will not spoil the show/book just minor part, but i would recommend watching Season One at least to understand some parts and ""easter eggs"".Game of Thrones may not be the best RPG on the world but it’s definitely a worthy one. It requires patience and I would mostly recommend for players who prefer the story instead of the action. Try It out and May the Seven watch over you!7/10			"

												Yes, this game feels outdated, rushed and unpolished. The combat system is mediocre at best, there are lots of lengthy cutscenes with bad picture composition and lame voice acting (there are exceptions to the rule of course) and this is nowhere near your random favorite top notch RPG in terms of production value. But still, I found this game to be really entertaining and rewarding since the story was very well executed. I really recommend this game to any fan of the A Song Of Ice and Fire / Game of Thrones franchise, but keep in mind that you are playing this one for the story alone and not some fancy eyecandy. And while you're at it, grab the Beyond the Wall DLC as well, it may be short but it makes an excellent addition to the background story of one of the main characters in the game.			"

												I am going to speak of this game as a game. I will not compare it to the books, or the show. All things that are similar to Game of Thrones (Show/Book) will be, by this review, be considered coincidence. This game is very good. It has an excellent plot, interesting and creative story and good voice acting. The gameplay, however, is quite lacking when compared to other games, the right click to turn being quite unwieldy and difficult for new players, and incredible overlooks on the part of the developers, such as how you can walk through the actual, physical part of a door if it is open. The mechanics with actual combat are better, allowing you to slow time and use ability, which is really cool. Again, however, this game succeeds much more with story. If you like great story and characters, this is a good game, and I reccomend it. 8/10			"

It is about the storyline and things happen that are outside of your control that people might feel is railroading but I feel it is very true to the song of ice and fire setting.  You won't spend hours managing your inventory or tweaking your followers.  Just play and enjoy the story.The DLC is bad... very bad.  Avoid wasting money on it.

												From http://www.dyle.org/blog/?p=187:Finished Game of Thrones last Thursday. Even though the game has a decent story it bursts and get shattered on the shortcomings of the graphics engine.You play two characters: Mors, ""the butcher"", Westford, a loyal warrior of the Night's Watch and Alester Sedwick struggling to regain his heritage as Lord of Riverspring after been away for 15 years.The story is really great and contains all the ingredients the famous Game of Thrones series features: honor, love, fights, betrayal, debauchery, violence, mystic and magic, deception, heroism, and cruelty. It's all in there. This is a true Game of Thrones story.Also if you watched the TV series you'll recognize some characters: Cersei Lannister plays the plotting ♥♥♥♥♥ and you simply can't get behind Lord Varys motives and schemes. As a goodie: you have a Cameo-appereance of Mr. ""Game-of-Thrones"" himself: George R. R. Martin is the Maester of Bergholz. Running a little Q&A with him is quite hilarious.Ok, there are some irrational items in there: e.g. it takes you 3 months game time to travel from Castle Black at the Wall down to the Riverlands, but after chapter 8 you are free to simply click anywhere on the map and are there within a blink of an eye.Or: at some point Alester murmurs to himself: ""pillagers will be executed"" during a riot ... which does not keep you away to grab and loot anything which is not nailed down. =)But then there is the story. And what a story it is! I can remember the events in chapter 11 leaving me with my jaws wide open: WTF! The game overdoes this theme and attitude of the core Game of Thrones nature in the end like in the final events in chapter 14, but all-in-all it is a great story to experience. Westeros is here.This is the very strong part of this game.Then the combat techniques is quite interesting and has some charm: like in a Dragon Age 2 manner you slow down time - it actually never stops - and issue some actions. This interface is not that easy to get your hold on but after some encounters you'll learn this new experience. And it is fun. As time does not stop you feel pressure to get to your decisions rather fast. I finished the game on normal level and every now and then I lost some combats and this is a real good experience. Be demanding so that success is sweeter.This is the interesting part of the game.... and then there is the game engine. They say it does not take a good graphics for a great game to tell thrilling and fascinating story. True. But the engine should at least bare some minimums. This game is an example to stress this principle. As the audio and speakers are ranging from ok (average peasant) to excellent (Lord Varys) the Graphics are weak. All in all the textures are squishy, some motions clumsy. You find a lot of people sharing the very same faces and if I don't know it better I would say I've been witness to the impossibility of the framerate dropping below 0! Seriously, you have to be very capable of suffering and be very high pain tolerant accepting this. Walking around the great hall in Castle Black is ... well ... demanding. Even though some places are nicely rendered like the Gift at the Wall.If the developers had more time to improve the graphics engine this game would have been rated much higher in the critic's world.This is the very poor, ugly part of the game.For the record, I needed about 36 hours at normal difficulty level and finished the story with Mors taking care of the baby outside of Westeros.I award this game 3 out of 5 stars, thanks to the pretty cool Game of Thrones story line ... nearly ruined by the half-baked graphics textures and graphics engine. It could have been better. Much better.			"

												I was hesitant to try this game because of negative reviews, but GOT RPG is now one of my all-times favorites. The story follows the lives of two war heroes, Alester Sarwyck and Mors Westford, after Robert Baratheon has taken the throne. Over and over I found myself asking, ""What would Mors/Alester really do in this situation?"" These true role-playing moments are hard to find in many RPG's because of weak characterization or their choices lack meaningful consequences. This is a game about the inevitable consequences that follow from making desperate choices between loyalty to one's social order and a more personal sense of right and wrong.			"

												It's hard to say something about this game. So lets explain topic by topic why you must play this game besides all the bad reviews and the low(58) metacrtic.First of all : Ambience, sound, storyline, characters, relation to the original GoT series and books this game is a 10 of 10.Then why in the Seven or Rhllors name this game has such a bad score. Well...The game mechanic is horrible, the combat is dull and simple...which makes the game challeging ,not by its difficulty ,but for the hard time you have to compensate the terrible combat system(yeah, it is that bad.)So, put it on easy and enjoy the tale. Finish this game because the story itself is amazing, better than most actually.Overall, even with sucky combat system i would give this game a 6 of 10.If you just think of it as a movie it would be a 10 of 10.and if you only think about combat gameplay its a 4 of 10.Worthwhile to watch and see a original GoT tale.

												It's annoying how much this game got panned in the gaming media. I didn't play it for that reason, and that's a good 12 months of not-playing-it I want back!True, the graphics aren't amazing (but no worse than the likes of Dragon Age. Better, in some respects). True, the voice acting of anyone who isn't a main character is largely terrible (but the main characters are pretty awesome, especially Mors and Valarr). Whoever voiced Septa Ravella should actually be banned from the industry. ¬_¬ But the story... the story picks the game up on it's back and carries it over the line, then runs around the track again for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles. If you're at all interested in games with great characters and stories, you NEED to play this game, especially if you're already a GoT/ASoIaF fan). The attention to detail is brilliant (I'm a massive pedant when it coems to ASoIaF, and even I only found a few things 'wrong' :p). Treat it like an interactive story with a few gaming elements, and you'll have a blast.			"

												There are different opinions regarding this game and whether its worth playing.All i have to say is that it packs an epic and awesome story Beautiful Graphics but lacks alot in the gameplay aspect.Therefore if you are a fun of the Game of Thrones Series and/or are willing to overlook the lack of gameplay and focus on its story ,you will definately enjoy this game.

												I heard this game sucked, and because of every other GoT game I had played, I believed it. This game isn't perfect by any means, but if you enjoy the show you will probably enjoy the game. If you have read the books and you aren't playing this game you are stupid. The graphics are not top notch, the camera is sometimes a bit wonky (yet much better than any of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ force unleashed games), and smaller ancillary characters are not voiced by the best actors. Those are my only complaints. I haven't beaten the game yet, but I'm enjoying the hell out of it.Both of the main characters are interesting and simply fun to play. Who hasn't wanted to warg into a nasty beast of a dog and rip throats out? Or setting your weapon on fire with the power of R'hllor before cutting down your enemies and converting the smallfolk to the Lord of Light?The game switches back and forth between these two characters, much like GRRM does in his novels. And as it is in the novels I'm upset every time I switch until I remember about the cool♥♥♥♥♥♥about to go down with the other character. Even my broke, bum of a friend purchased this game.Boosh and/or Kakow			"

												Actually a quite beautiful game which seems very faithful to the lore of the books. The combat is the only real weak point of the game, though once you get into it you forget the initial clunkiness pretty quickly.A very solid and interesting storyline, though Mors is easily the better of the two characters the game continously shifts between. Hope they make a sequel, despite the bad reviews. A LOT more fun than any review lead me to believe.			"

												Very skeptical about buying this game at first, but as i enjoy watching the show it was a must buy (and should be for you if you enjoy the show) this game has a very immersive story that has multiple outcomes (which i am a sucker for) the storyline consists of 2 characters that you play as one is a member of the nights watch  Mors Westford who also has a dog companion and the other is Alester Sarwyck, a Red Priest and the rightful heir to the town riverwood which he trys to reclaim. Without giving away any more i throughly enjoy this game.  It gets better as you play, SO DO NOT QUIT EARLY :)Pros-Multiple choiceGood storyNot boring (switch between characters)Cons-Laggy whenever you move the camera (can be very frustrating, need to slowly move camera)didn't really enjoy combat, a lot like the witcher style would much rather have to go up to someone and stick a sword through them rather than being tactical :)7-8/10			"

												A fantastic story driven game that will leave any fan of the Song of Fire and Ice series happy. This a purely story driven game that has the dark tone and twists that make the books and the TV series great. I will admit that the first few hours of the game is slow and it may straw people away from this game, but don't this game picks up the pace and never lets go. This game requires patentince and there are scenes that last for a very long time but are filled with great dialogue and even better characters. Many people complain that there hasn't been a great game that the series of Fire and Ice deserves, I would disagree with them. This game is a great compaianon piece to the world and lore of this sereies of the books and TV shows. This has a great and lengthy main story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It was very hard for me to put down the controller once i started it. At over 20 hours it provide a lot of great sotry moments. Also the side quest do not detract from the story at all and adds an incredible amount depth to the story and the characters. If you do all the side quests it will add about another 10 hours to the game, I would recommand that you do so. The gameplay of this game is a little weak and has a very steep learning curve. I'm not the biggest stragiests, so when I found out that the combet requires to you really think, it took me a little bit to get used to. But once I put the effort into it it become very rewarding. The graphics are not that great but they make up for it in the art department and the ability to recreate areas fome the show and books. the atmoshere is thick with style and can bery nice to look at. The game play and the graphics are not what makes this game great though, that's due to story. Get this game for the story, you will be a happy camper if you do so.  If you're someone that does not care for stories in games and only worries about gameplay, I would reccomand that you don't pick up this game. But if you are someone that love an incredible, darkcharacter rich and lore heavy story then this is the game for you. Pros-An amazing story that stays true(for the most part) to its source materail-Two wonderfull main characters that are great to play and level up-Two intersting intersecting stories that clash in a really great momnet-Fantastic vioce work from the main characters of the game-A Lengthy story that will keep you at the edge of your seatCons-Steep learning curve-First few hours are slow -Console port with no grahpic options escept for resolution (that can be changed by going into the invidia control panel and fixing that yourself)9/10			"

												You have to be a real fan of the series to sit through this one, very outdated game mechanics and middling graphics. The developers have a history of making little else save cycling games (Le Tour de France, Cycling Manager, seriously) I don't know why HBO liscensed them to make this game but it really shows. The difficulty is inconsistent and it's very jarring to find that in an RPG. Fighting street thugs was a kiting nightmare and yet I would go on to 1shot bosses skipping through their fight dialogue. The plot ties into Game of Thrones in a very subtle way that leaves the canon undespoiled. Ultimately it's hard to recomend, as based solely on the merits of the game and ignoring the Game of Thrones liscense it would be the worst RPG I've played. I'd watch a lets play.			"

												This is easily the most underrated game I've played in a long time, if not ever. The story, characters, and the choices available to the character are all fantastic, and are reason enough for me to recommend this game to everyone.It's not a perfect game by a longshot (the graphics are outdated, the voice acting can be pretty bad, the controls are odd, and the combat system isn't groundbreaking), but it's leaps and bounds better than other games that OXM gives a ""10 out of 10"" to. The fact that this game got such a low rating shows what's wrong with the gaming industry (People who praised ""COD: Ghost's"" dog segments hated the dog segments in this game, even thought they're far better).

												I really Game of Thrones TV series, but after all those bad and mediocre reviews, I bought it at sale expecting a disaster from the GoT RPG. I was wrong, very wrong... Gameplay seems clunky and unintuitive at first, but with every new level and skill it becomes more tactical. The combat system resembles MMO games, player is not controling the battles personally, but he's putting abillities and attacks into queue and the character executes them in the given order.  You have to think about, what abillity you use and when, how to combine them to give the highest damage possible. Enemies use abilities too, but with the right skills there is a posibility to interupt them or avoid taking damage. You can deal serious damage by combinig the right skills of yours and of your companions, on the other hand, if you distribute your skill points badly and just click on the abillity icons, you won't get far... The most exiting part of the game however is the story. The story is mature, dark and full of twists. Choices matters, and some of them may bite your a** later in the storyline. It's not about saving the world, characters have beliavable motivations and their lines are well written. I really love, how Cyanide made the plot lines of both main characters merge into one and how they fit them into the world of GoT, with events from series happening on the background. Bioware should takes some notes from this, about how to write a story.Even though it does not have the neatest graphics, voice overs of secondary characters are quite bad and there are few clipping and pathfinding bugs, I enjoyed it from start to the end, sometimes the story left me with my jaw wide open, which I didn't experienced in a videogame for a very long time.

												As previous reviews already listed;+ Great story, consistent with the narration style of books and tv series.+ Rich characters in terms of character design- Terrible voice acting (Maybe except for Mors)- Weird combat control. You really dont have to ace it to finish the game in any difficulty.- Skill trees are not well optimized. Had around 2 extra skill points at one point whereas I already purchased all of the avaible skill trees.- Really old looking graphics. Even though the main problem with the visuals is rather about how ""grainy"" they look, especially during some cutscenes.All in all, the story pulls you in after a rather rough initiation process invoving figuring out the gameplay. It is highly recommended to those who are familiar with the GOT world and fascinated by it. For others, well, I suppose there are many better action/Rpgs out there for them to try =).			"

												SPOILER FREE REVIEWThe Game of Thrones RPG isn't the perfect game, but it does have a perfect story. George R.R Martin helped write it and you can tell, especially with all the intrigue and twists and turns. The game suffers from annoying combat mechanics and there isn't that much to do besides the main quest and one or two side quests, but it is a perfect game for any hardcore ASOIAF fans.The story is great and you play as two main characters, and you visit many places throughout the game. The iconic locations are in such as Castle Black and King's Landing, you can go to Mole's Town as well. But most of the NPC in the game just stand around and offer nothing to the story but to make the locations look full of life. You can also hear the authentic voices of Joer Mormont and Varys, and the voice acting of the two main characters is great also. The combat is a good system, but the annoyance is being ganged on upon by 5-6 enemies at a time. Even on the easiest difficulty the combat was annoying, not hard, just a pain. Many times I just wanted to skip the combat and advance throughout the story. Levelling up is cool, and there are alot of cool items in the game. My character for example was weilding Ser Duncan's sheid, and you can even use The Red Viper's spear. Those items are included with the Weapon Pack DLC though. Each ""Chapter"" in the game has the main quest and 1-2 side quests you can do. Side quests usually help you out later with the main quest if you accomplish them. But once you complete the quests there is nothing to do in the game but maybe fight in the arenas to get more cash. Making cash is easy, just sell all the stuff you don't have. No need to really fight for it. The game is great for all ASOIAF and GOT fans to enjoy. The story is great and you will feel for the characters, but just remember in GOT their is no such thing as a happy ending.			"

												This game has one of the best plots out there, and for sure better than endless sea of boring like ""Skyrim"". I was charmed by drama and tough choices no other RPG could offer me in recent years, by characters actually playing instead of so popular nowadays standing and giving dull speeches (like in any Bethesda product), by giving the evil character that you can, from one side understand and from the other, want to slaughter without any mercy. Yes, yes... this game gives many emotions to a player. Character development options are quite good, with very nice extent of variety. Two characters we have occasion to control present completely different trees of fighting stiles and additional abilities.Many complain about combat system... Actually any player who remember ""Knights of The Old Republic"" should find it very similar. Sure it needs some getting used to after mindless click-fest from game I mentioned on the beginning or other pseudo-RPGs but it is nothing players haven't already seen. Some battles actually need planing and are very rewarding.Graphics. Yes, this game has outdated graphics. Everyone can see this on screenshots so there is no point in describing it but I need to say that except rare buggy camera work there is nothing that interrupts our gaming experience. Mechanics are ok, there is nothing good or bad to say about them... I experienced no major (or minor for that matter) bugs.So, bottom line... full price of this game might be too big for many players... but if it will be ever on sale with some good discount... then there is simply no reason not to take it.With regards,REDDQ			"

												Contrary to what most professional critics say, this game is actually quite enjoyable.If you are a fan of ASoIaF and RPGs (and who isn't really?), getting it should be a no-brainer. The game is a stripped down version of a Bioware-style RPG with a focus on a linear and tight narrative. The game has very little dialogue and content outside of the main narrative; for example, the only rewards for exploration of the often large areas are coin and lore entries, both being fairly insubstantial. Typical RPG elements in this game like tactical combat and character building aren't particularly interesting, but neither are they horribly boring or badly done. But since it is not a strong suit of the game you might want to play on ""casual"" to not be bothered too much about it. The story has a nice flow, with familar themes from the books (or the show) being present while also managing to stand on its own. The game is told in alternating chapters of two different characters, engaging you in different aspects of the story. This is an experience rarely seen in video games, which makes this title stand out. The dialogues are usually pretty good, but if you expect the same level of wit, sharpness, drama and authenticity as in the books you will be disappointed. This is a narrative RPG, with the main device of narration being cutscene dialogues, so you can expect an unnatural amount of exposition in the dialogues. The voice overs are a mixed bag. The cast is quite good in parts, but some lines are delivered painfully slow and the actors often seem aloof from the situation at hand. You get the impression that each line was recorded separately. (Of course, this is how it was done, but the job of both writers and actors is to keep you from noticing this)The dialog system itself is similar to the wheel Bioware uses without the responses being pigeonholed into certain personality types. To make the choice between options more clear, the possible responses are worded in a more introspective style, often describing observations about the persons that will inform one's response or flat out stating one's motivation. This is actually a huge improvement over Bioware's use of the system, as it feels more like choosing the character's thought processes than just making a character conform to a personality. If you are a hardcore fan of ASoIaF you might find some details unbelievable, but for the most part the game's story and dialogues fit fairly well into the setting.If you ever wondered what a Bioware game would be like, if it was more linear and focussed almost completely on the main narrative, you might want to check this game out.Edited: I nominated this for the plot-twist Steam Award.

												Game of Thrones: RPG is a game i expected to be decent, but it turned out to be great. It doesn't really have much exploration, but a number of interesting side quests and hidden loot should keep you occupied. The combat system is very dynamic and well thought through, with skills of different characters complementing each other. Brilliant voice acting, likable characters and a thrilling plot with numerous twists and (as far as I know) four different, moving and emotional endings. I'd recommend the DLC pack, since the new weapons can give you quite an edge in battle, it lets you replace the skin of Mors' butt-ugly dog and adds a bonus quest that tells the badass story behind Mors' nickname  and presents some stunning visuals from the top of the Wall.

I'm a GOT Tv series fan (haven't read the books and I don't plan to, at least for now) and believe me, this game picks up all of saga's pace and spirit, bringing you a story which starts somewhat good and becomes even better and better as it unfolds before your eyes. You'll meet some of saga's main characters and you'll be hinted about others, but what matters is that Cyanide really crafted a very good story, with good dialogues and a good number of plot twists and secondary quests to keep you enticed. The two main characters, Alester the Red Priest and Mors the Black Crow, both have strong and complex personalities, and their backstories will intertwine in quite interesting ways.Why rough? Well, some players here hatefully despise its combat system. I don't. Sure, it isn't be the best around, but does its dirty job and it becomes rather intriguing once you get the grasp of it and once your characters acquire more abilities and powers. Characters animations and voices are...just meh. Could be better but also could be worse, nothing you couldn't stand. Ambients instead, unlike characters, are quite well designed.Camera may give you some headaches during combat, especially when you'll have to fight in tiny areas against many enemies. Nothing too shameful , just mildly annoying every once in a while.So, let's sum it: Do I recommend this game? Absolutely YES. Scratch under a layer of few and tiny drawbacks and you'll find a really worthy and fascinating story.Even full price is not too much, but if you happen to see it on sale don't pass it over, BUY IT.

												A great and very over hated game. While the combat won't win much love and outside of the decent main cast the voice acting is medicore at best, two worlds at worst, the plot makes it all worth it. Made by GRR himself it more so leans with the books then the show.			"

												Pros:- The story & characters are very well put together- Pausable combat, which is always a + for me- Interesting approach to abilities tree, with skills u acquire due your decisions etc. (although  sadly they don't affect your game too much)- U get to control a dog and sniff around - pure genius :)- At first, i didn't like the combat system. But then i got a better hang of it, and it works just like a simplified DAO. Once you get what armour and weapon you should use, it is even fun at times.Cons:- A lot of small annoying bugs like corpses floating indefinetely in the air, NPCs just standing in the middle of the fight like nothing's happening etc. etc.- Graphics are kind of choppy for this age- The map is just awful, no other words to describe it - no pssibility of waypoints, the icons have no description (for instance, you have a door icon, but there is no telling where that leads) etc.All in all, probably the story is what keeps the game afloat. Probably a 6.5 out of 10.LE: After finishing it, and getting more familiar with the combat system, i think 7.0/10 is more fair.			"

												An intriguing storyline which as you expect leaves you constantly questioning who are your friends and who are your allies. Twists and turns galore and filled with quality voice acting. It plays well with interesting combat abilities but the movement and camera views are clumbsy and infuriating. If you can get over the irritating camera issues you'll get a good 20 hours plus of quality RPG gameplay.			"

												+Interesting concept on character creation (picking good traits but then having to pick a counter bad trait)+great story written with the help of George RR Martin+a few hard choices in conversation+interesting take on combat+you play as two almost polar opposite characters with unique abilities+good graphics for an older game+some good voice acting by the cast of Game of Thrones-..but sometimes the graphics aren't the best-animation is not the best by any means-cities and forests are not as populated as they should be-some voices are the same or poor voiceoversI would completely recommend this game, specially to a Game of Thrones fan. It is a well rounded rpg with a unique take one the common steps most games use when making an rpg. Yes, some choices however aren't the best but for the most part all are well made.If you are just looking for an rpg but know nothing of the A Song of Ice and Fire series, then you may not understand completely or have the same deep feelings in some situations as someone who is into at least the show. Therefore, i would wait for a really good sale on Steam.			"

												(+) George R. R. Martin again wrote a great story, with great twists and many dead characters as usual. The storyline runs parallel to the main story of the first book and they almost touch sometimes. It's a tragedy as close to the book as possible without just telling the same story or object it.(-) The technical realisation is awful. The fighting system is interesting but gets pretty boring after a few fights. The skill tree is unbalanced, you got some really strong abilities on one hand, but many are pretty useless. The settings are often really small (Kings Landing is explored in 5-10 mins). The graphics aren't that good also, not totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but they don't fit a story so mighty. Also you get about 10 different weapons and armaments for every class, but except for a few legendarys they are all the same and you end up fighting Lannisters, while wearing a Lannister-breastplate, because thats the best you get for quite a while, but you hate it since you are a ranger from the Wall. But only in the very late game you have enough gold (and the chance to visit a trader) to buy some legendary stuff. All in all there are some heavy issues with how the epic story is implemented and it's really sad, because with a little more budget and a little more time this game could have been awesome.(->) Anyway: I liked the game because of it's great story which made up for all the pain I suffered while playing. I think I won't play it again even if i want to check out some different classes (haven't played the archer yet), but it's just too boring if you know whats going on.If you are a GoT fan or even read the books you should consider buying this piece (at least on sale!), because it tells a George R. R. Martin story in the universe of GoTl, that you can't buy as a book.			"

												Cringe worthy dialog.False choices. (All options lead to the same outcome.)Grammar mistakes in item descriptions and quest text, several repeated sentence fragments in quest text. Several repeated sentence fragments in quest text. (Much like this line.)Scrolling the quest text is horribly slow, why do you write six pages of it if only the first is accessible in a timely manner? And why put new paragraphs at the bottom while starting display at the top? Each time the quest updates I have to scroll past the old stuff again. Very, very slowly. Excruciating.Slow movement, dumb, clunky controls.Zero combat AI aside from targeting a random enemy and spamming basic attacks.Every ability has to be used manually.The dog has a pointless attack ability that can be triggered for no extra effect over its auto attacks. The only difference is the icon. (bite vs sword)The auto attack uses the same sword ability that everyone spams by default (auto attack). Where did a dog get a sword from and how does it know to use it?Just when I get invested in my character I am kicked out into a new storyline where I had to make a new character.Several tutorial prompts trigger at inopportune times. Skinchanger tutorial should pop up after I assigned dog abilities. The first level 2 tutorial should alert the player to a new ability tree for their dog.Equipping items needs a tutorial. Right click item, left click slot, is that really the best way you could come up with? Smells like a console UI. Where is drag and drop? Where is auto equip? Why can’t I look at my equipped items in their slots?NPC dialog cuts out frequently.They interrupt each other, and break the main conversation. Or the main conversation overpowers NPC chatter.The first line of NPC chatter is always skipped. I barely hear the last word and cannot read the overhead text fast enough before it disappears. The remaining lines are fine.Dialog volume is not even 10% of combat volume. Barely audible. To compensate for this bug I had to boost Windows volume to 100% (Normally at 15%) and drag all volume sliders except for the dialog down to 5%. Combat still overpowers conversations. Of course the moment you enter combat all dialog cuts out. Even if the enemies are a courtyard away.			"

Impressive but not enough to make you feel like your playing CoD or BF but is good enough to play. (This is on max graphics)Combat 6/10i'll sum this up quickly, feels robotic & not very realistic. Its more of a select your options and wait for the cooldown to use again. Sometimes i feel there's too many oponents thrown in just for the hell of it.Story 10/10: 2 very small gltichs not even worth mentioning Some bugs and glitches , found only 2 so far... 1 i actually screenshoted it i found it so funny. The other was a conversation glitch where i saw the wall instead of the person.I feel there's just that tiny bit to much running around and gathering coins and extras things to help you in your game.(this is for if you want to get 100%)if you just want to plough through and dont care about the trinkets in the game then you wont notice.=======PRO'sGraphics 8/10:for me i don't really care for it but i know alot do.

												This game is nothing more than a few simple mechanics allowing you to walk (assuming you can find your way) between a seemingly endless series of cutscenes. Story is... ok.. just a snippet of some of the most boring portions of the books that vaguely attempts to tie itself in with the TV series. The Water Dancer mechanics don't really work, archers are useless. When not watching cut scenes or holding absurdly long conversations the game is little more than a treasure hunt with some random mindless killing. There is one puzzle, but it is so simple a child could solve it in seconds. The options for Mors have very little bearing on the story at all, not mych better for Alester - though at least some choice there. But bugs, wow so many little areas with glitches in them. I would not recommend that anyone buys this game at all, not for more than a few dollars anyway.			"

												I immedietly noticed this game used the actual soundtrack from the series and has some actors from the series actually voice act their characters in the game. That's a big plus. It's unfortunate that the rest of the game makes it seem as if the entire budged was thrown at exactly that, and everything else was rushed or just left alone. There's constant flickering in some textures. When starting combat there's a very colorful, mosaic-like plane on the sword for a second. A lot of the animations are rather unnaturally looking. Example of this is heads turning far further back than humanly possible. Walking pases are off, the lip-sync looks like people didn't even try to sync it.. Being someone familiar with 3D modelling and animation I can tell you that this is rather poorly done. The textures are low resolution, too. The dialogue is rather cringe-worthy at times and there are a lot of aspects that make this game not hold true to the actual environment of the universe. One immediate example is the Night's Watch. In this game they have good armour, a lot of food, halls are lit and seem warm. Whereas we know that the Night's Watch isn't being looked after in the books and the show. They need men, they need supplies; they don't have good armour. The dialogue, as mentioned before, is pretty cringy. Something that seemed odd to me was (close to the beginning) that I, as Mors, got to carry out the death sentence of the first guy I track. That's a commander's duty, not mine. I'm some ranger, a good one yes, but I am still just a ranger. Some of the dialogue options you get are really bad and don't keep you immersed at all. Everything just seemed very forced.The combat is rather lackluster. This kind of combat is good (like in Dragon Age) but it has to be done well. All of this combined made it very hard to enjoy any of the story.I know this isn't a great review at this point, I'll probably edit and fill it out later. But as of now I'd say don't get this game unless you get it in some bundle. I'm sure there are some people who could find enjoyment in this, but then again there are people who enjoy Goat Simulator P:  Jokes aside, I don't mean to bash this game; 3D animation and modelling is hard not to mention putting all of that together into a working game.Basically; some may like this and some may not. It depends on you, but I wouldn't recommend it. If you're really that GoT-starved that you need anything you can get, go for it.NOTE: my playtime is rather low, keep in mind I played this game offline, too.			"

												If you like the stories of Westeros, then I would say that this is worth buying when on sale. The story in itself is very good, though the game is no where near as polished as it should be. The combat can be clunky as whilst it isnt turn based (You assign skills in a slowed down real time), it can be very repetitive and there are often clipping issues where the characters will either occupy the same space or ""vibrate"" when they are standing half inside a wall. The system itself though is pretty easy to master once you understand the roles of each character (I always use Mors as a Landed knight and so he ""tanks"" whilst Alester can damage the enemy)The quest system can be frustrating too if you are new to RPG's as if you miss a slight detail, you will pretty much fail the side quests. Most of the side quests can be completed over several chapters, but if you miss a specific pickup that starts the quest in the chapter where it has become available then you won't be able to complete the quest once you have moved on in the story. This can be awkward for achievment hunters. I do wonder how this story would have turned out if it had been developed by a bigger studio, as it is clear that the writers have tried to keep everything in keeping with the lore of Westeros. It does kind of feel like this game was made by a company who snapped up the license before anyone else could and then they rushed to push out the game to cash in. All of that being said, if you are a fan of Game of Thrones and old style RPG's then I would recommend you buy this just for one playthrough. If you arent happy with slow turn based combat and linear levels, then I simply would not. I would also say that this game is not worth the full price and you should wait until you see it on sale somewhere.  "

												I immedietly noticed this game used the actual soundtrack from the series and has some actors from the series actually voice act their characters in the game. That's a big plus. It's unfortunate that the rest of the game makes it seem as if the entire budged was thrown at exactly that, and everything else was rushed or just left alone. There's constant flickering in some textures. When starting combat there's a very colorful, mosaic-like plane on the sword for a second. A lot of the animations are rather unnaturally looking. Example of this is heads turning far further back than humanly possible. Walking pases are off, the lip-sync looks like people didn't even try to sync it.. Being someone familiar with 3D modelling and animation I can tell you that this is rather poorly done. The textures are low resolution, too. The dialogue is rather cringe-worthy at times and there are a lot of aspects that make this game not hold true to the actual environment of the universe. One immediate example is the Night's Watch. In this game they have good armour, a lot of food, halls are lit and seem warm. Whereas we know that the Night's Watch isn't being looked after in the books and the show. They need men, they need supplies; they don't have good armour. The dialogue, as mentioned before, is pretty cringy. Something that seemed odd to me was (close to the beginning) that I, as Mors, got to carry out the death sentence of the first guy I track. That's a commander's duty, not mine. I'm some ranger, a good one yes, but I am still just a ranger. Some of the dialogue options you get are really bad and don't keep you immersed at all. Everything just seemed very forced.The combat is rather lackluster. This kind of combat is good (like in Dragon Age) but it has to be done well. All of this combined made it very hard to enjoy any of the story.I know this isn't a great review at this point, I'll probably edit and fill it out later. But as of now I'd say don't get this game unless you get it in some bundle. I'm sure there are some people who could find enjoyment in this, but then again there are people who enjoy Goat Simulator P:  Jokes aside, I don't mean to bash this game; 3D animation and modelling is hard not to mention putting all of that together into a working game.Basically; some may like this and some may not. It depends on you, but I wouldn't recommend it. If you're really that GoT-starved that you need anything you can get, go for it.NOTE: my playtime is rather low, keep in mind I played this game offline, too.			"

												GoT rpg is a fun game but with it's flaws, the main story is great. Most sidequests are interesting and fun but the combat is genuinely bad which explains all the bad reviews,but despite the combat it is a good game and worth your money if it's on a <50% sale. I rate the game  7/10  "" the game is great if you don't compare it to the books/series it's based on.			"

												This game is nothing more than a few simple mechanics allowing you to walk (assuming you can find your way) between a seemingly endless series of cutscenes. Story is... ok.. just a snippet of some of the most boring portions of the books that vaguely attempts to tie itself in with the TV series. The Water Dancer mechanics don't really work, archers are useless. When not watching cut scenes or holding absurdly long conversations the game is little more than a treasure hunt with some random mindless killing. There is one puzzle, but it is so simple a child could solve it in seconds. The options for Mors have very little bearing on the story at all, not mych better for Alester - though at least some choice there. But bugs, wow so many little areas with glitches in them. I would not recommend that anyone buys this game at all, not for more than a few dollars anyway.			"

												(if youre a got fan, dont read further the () part unless you like to be upset. i wanted to vent about this for a long time, now ill do it.first, you cannot ignore the fact that its a game of thrones game. that means that its basically a 'unconsented sexual intercourse'/woman-child-murder/incest porn in a mediocre, generic fantasy setting - with good writing. i watched the first episode of the tv show - that was more than enough - and as i remember it starts with incest and ends with a child murder; in the first two acts of the game theres a 'unconsented sexual intercourse' of a young man and a very young girl, but headless corpses and old women are also a fair play in the minds of the writers. im horrified at the success of the franchise, its one thing to write something like this, money is money but im amazed how many sick people are around to enjoy it. and this time there is no excuse like in the case of spartacus eg, 'we wanted to make it realistic, this is how it was', people, its a fantasy! yep, a 'unconsented sexual intercourse'/murder/incest fantasy. seek professional help. im aware that now i have angered about half the population of planet earth but i dont care much as i dont have a high opinion of the human race anyway. i have a small excuse for playing the game, it was a part of a bundle, got decent reviews, so here we are.)i was a part worried, having played of orks and men recently and, well, i didnt like it much. however many problems with that (somewhat later!) game were not present in got.-the attribute/ability/skill/trait system was much more refined and i felt actually compelled to think ahead and plan for my two characters.-in got you have much more freedom (something i very much appreciate in an rpg), you can travel back and forth, find new quests or secrets you missed.-it is more pleasing to the eye.-voice acting was great in both games, with a few miscasts (for minor characters) i guess they had to ask the janitor to fill in,-path finding is much better in got, there was only a few times when the not-player-controlled-character stuck somewhere (although there was a fun moment when the dog was stuck on a stairs under mors, both becoming unmovable).-i played alaster as assassin, there wasnt much assassiny about him: couldnt sneak, and poisoned blades should be maybe used in more covert fashion. at least we had the hound...-as with of orks and men music wasnt very memorable but fit right in, nothing to complain about (uh, i guess maybe it was from the tv show soundtrack and it might be an anthem or something for got fans, sorry about that.)-sounds are funny when you approach a group of people talking, it starts and ends abruptly getting close or putting some distance between you and them. no worries, there are subtitles (which behave similarly btw) and they are on a repeat mode. you can listen in to every discussion you want.-here, developers decided to make better equipment available to you as you progress in the game, not to throw the best stuff at you in the beginning. how traditional, how dull (sarcasm, see ooam.)-the game behaved reasonably well while alttabbing, not rock solid, there were a few crashes but nothing too frustrating. however i always had to mute the game as it doesnt turn off the sound when its in the background. minor inconvenience.-and again, talk, talk, talk. and again, i like a good story, when the game isnt only about shooting, butchering (heh), blowing things up, but sometimes the game felt like a - somewhat - interactive novel. maybe i had problems only with the distribution of the fighting and talking scenes, im not sure, but in hindsight there were times when you talked for half an hour then ran around with the dog for half an hour then fouught for half an hour (half an hour=might have been much more).-at least you can skip dialogue lines and cut scenes. not recommended btw only if you screwed up something and have to reload, but still, - though a feature which is common in the past 10 years - big step ahead from ooam.-lenghtier than ooam, steam says i played 40 hours but considering my abuse of alttabbing its probably between 30-35.-this also had some frustrating points, like the mark on your map showing an exit to your quest often led to a closed portal,-or you could reforge that damned valyrian (or something) sword to anything - except for what i wanted, a two-handed mace,-or the clunkiness of the character/inventory screens,-or a lot of (small) things i cannot remember and cant check as i - celebrating having the game finished - deleted it immediatelly.i enumerated faults and only improvements to my not-so-good experience with ooam but do not fret: this is a worthy game. far, faaar from being among the best, but a solid experience, entertaining, well written and most of the time quite well designed.if you like the subgenre i think the deciding factor might be, where do you stand with game of thrones, the franchise. if you like it, im sure you will enjoy it quite much.if your stomach tends to turn on describing or even depicting of incest and the most hideous kinds of 'unconsented sexual intercourses' and most vicious murders - well this might not be for you.i enjoyed the story and the solid gameplay but im sure ill never want to do anything with got again. telltale got? im sorry, so long, and thanks for all the fishies!still, ill wave the 'recommended' flag, as this game is a good effort, a worthy game, and im sure that many people with stronger stomachs (god, seems theres a lot of them!) would enjoy.EDIT: 'unconsented sexual intercourse': you know what. quite hypocritical from valve, filtering the r word while selling a game which is full of it. urinates me off a bit.

												Hardcore GoT fans = You'll be fully immersed from start to finish and more than satisfied to have experienced this game!Casual GoT fans = You'll notice some flaws, but the story and atmosphere are what you came for, right? You will more-than likely enjoy this game overall.""Kinda-but-not-really-that-much"" GoT fans = You should at least give this game a try if you enjoy RPGs... Keep in mind the storyline and characters are really the focus here.Non-GoT fans = Why are you even here? JK JK.. But if the 3 things I specifically mention below may ruin the game for you, then you might want to consider a different title of the same genre instead.[Was gonna do P's & C's but it looks like there's plenty of reviews containing those already.]Bottom-line:  7/10-3 points for frustrating movement/controls, clunky/repetative combat, and disappointing graphics. Pretty much everything else is on point.Hope this helped.[Edit: spelling and grammar]			"

												The combat was so bad I took a break. Eventually, I got used to the combat and just sort of accepted it. While this happened the story became even more interesting. Hence, it's a diamond in the rough. If you love Game of Thrones lore, you will love this game. It gives more choices than that dumb telltale ever will and doesn't leave a cliffhanger. I wish there's was a way to ignore combat because I found the story to be the only thing that kept me going.

												This game has one of the best plots out there, and for sure better than endless sea of boring like ""Skyrim"". I was charmed by drama and tough choices no other RPG could offer me in recent years, by characters actually playing instead of so popular nowadays standing and giving dull speeches (like in any Bethesda product), by giving the evil character that you can, from one side understand and from the other, want to slaughter without any mercy. Yes, yes... this game gives many emotions to a player. Character development options are quite good, with very nice extent of variety. Two characters we have occasion to control present completely different trees of fighting stiles and additional abilities.Many complain about combat system... Actually any player who remember ""Knights of The Old Republic"" should find it very similar. Sure it needs some getting used to after mindless click-fest from game I mentioned on the beginning or other pseudo-RPGs but it is nothing players haven't already seen. Some battles actually need planing and are very rewarding.Graphics. Yes, this game has outdated graphics. Everyone can see this on screenshots so there is no point in describing it but I need to say that except rare buggy camera work there is nothing that interrupts our gaming experience. Mechanics are ok, there is nothing good or bad to say about them... I experienced no major (or minor for that matter) bugs.So, bottom line... full price of this game might be too big for many players... but if it will be ever on sale with some good discount... then there is simply no reason not to take it.With regards,REDDQ			"

												It's a good game, between average and good but it sure has it flaws.First of all, it uses a tactical fighting system, it's nothing like The Elder Scroll, Two Worlds, Gothic, Risen, The Witcher, or whatever you want to name.It's kind of similar to Baldur's Gate, but not as good.You'll have to pause the game and use tactics to win the fights.I play on the hardest difficulty and I do have to use tactics a lot, it's still easy but without those tactics, I would probably die too easily.I do not know about easier difficulties since I first started the game on the highest difficulty.At first, I must admit that I've excepted a real time gameplay like Risen or even The Elder Scrolls, but it's nothing like that, I sure was disappointed, but it's good anyway, as long as you like this kind of gameplay.The story is good, nothing like the original but it's good.The animations are horrible though, play the game and see by yourself.In the end, it's nothing revolutionary but it's good if you're a fan of Game of Thrones and tactical RPG with real time pause.7.5/10			"

												So I bought this game during a sale, simply becausse it said ""Game of Thrones"" and ""RPG"". I always wondered why this wasn't a thing, since the story of Ice and Fire is just perfect for a RPG game. The game itself is definitly worth playing. If it were made in the 1990s it would have been the best RPG around, i felt very much reminded of Gothic. However, since it got released in 2012 it has to stand up to the expectations of today. And it cannot fully live up to these. First of all, the gameplay seems a little bit off. You have to use the right mouse button if you want to change the camer for better movement. The fights are in a ""stop to decide your actions"" manner and not as deep as the game wants you to believe. The graphics would have been good for a 2000s game. Espacially the missing details are noticable, in the graphics as well as in the world. On the other hand, the story is outstanding, interesting and once you get into it, you just want to know the end. It fits perfetcly into the world of Game of Thrones - intrigues, blood, a little bit of♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you like the world of GoT, you will like the game as long as you can oversee the gameplay flaws or if you prefer to play games that feel like yesterday's games anyway...
