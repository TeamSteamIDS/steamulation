												I played this game for 16 hours because I really wanted to enjoy it.First of all, I wanted to like it because I'm a fan of first 3 parts of Gothic. Let's say it straight, this is different game, don't expect fourth part of Gothic. Some elements are similar, but general feeling is: this is different game.So in the next step I tried to enjoy it as RPG game. If game is different than Gothic, that doesn't mean it's a bad game, right? So in that situation it is not true. This game is bad. Some elements, like graphics and music are quite nice, but generally game is just bad. Main story is totally linear, you can't go wherever you want. World is divided to small parts and you have to explore them one by one, you can't encounter a lot stronger monsters than you.I love RPGs, but this game didn't sucked me. I didn't feel that I explore the world I want to explore. I didn't feel I'm a part of adventure, I want to be part of. VERDICT:If you're a fan of Piranha Bytes games, save yourself the disappointment.If you're a fan of good RPG games, there are many better games out there.If you finished all RPGs and you need to play it, be prepared to collecting the honey in one of most stupid quests. So if you like winnie the Pooh, go ahead, this game is made for you.Like this review?

												Hello. Are you interested in buying this game ? Let me tell you about this game. This game is not worth your time and money. This game starts you off as a shepherd (not THE shepherd) and has you trying to woo your girlfriend on some island. This game will then do what any game does to ruin the good mood and send you away on a journey for revenge. All the story progress in this game is just for the sake of getting your revenge. Remember that, when you slug through the chapters, hoping for a cool story.This game lets you decide on how to play it by offering you all the options : Melee, Ranged and Magic. The overly simplistic and lame skill-tree requires tough decision making from you. +1% mana and +1% mana regen or rather +1% stamina and +1% stamina regen...or maybe +1% ranged damage and +1% mana regen ? The choices...Eventually you might also reach one of the maybe 10 new skills..I say new, but in the end they just change the skill you already have to something better, like giving you a power bash or letting you combo more attacks...meh.This game is kinda separated into different hubs, where the actual chapter is being played. As soon as you finish one, you basically move onward to the next hub area. This game is technically an open world game, but you don't have any necessity to ever venture back to the places you've already been to and instead keep following a linear route to your goal. This game sports acceptable environmental graphics, but butt-ugly character models. This game also features some of the most laid back casual combat ever. This game is hardly a challenge on normal difficulty and at least your progress will be steady..combat wise.. This game however does have a major flaw, which will most likely make you quit rather sooner than later :THIS GAME HAS NO QUEST MARKERS. This game will just tell you to find an item/person in the east/west/north/south of where you accept the quest and then has you run around the place trying to find the item/person without any sort of indication. Even worse, this game often has the habit of only spawning the item/person you are looking for once you accepted the quest to do so. That means you can run all over the map in advance, explore everything possible and then have to do it all over again after accepting some random ""HEY, FIND THIS CHEST IN THAT CAVE WHICH NOW EXISTS BUT DIDN'T BEFORE"". This game will then commence laughing at you, until you open google after an hour to just look up where the item/person is, that you're looking for.This game incorporates very boring and bland dialogue as well, which often makes you feel as if you're just playing some random mmo. Nothing in this game will make you feel involved with the world, mostly because the world itself is such a boring, empty yet quite spacy place..still very empty though..too empty even..way too empty..not enemy wise..quite a few enemies...but otherwise very empty. This game has no redeeming qualities at all. Even the lockpicking system is really irritating with its required timing. This game does allow you to craft, but thats just reading a recipe, press ""C"" , select the thing and click the ""craft"" button.This review is already way too long for this game, so let me tell you once again that this game is really not worth it.This game, which I have played for 10 hours, is not recommended :P			"

												This is one of the most disappointing games I've ever played. I was looking forward to this as a Gothic fan (on it's release it was called ArcaniA: Gothic IV or ArcaniA a gothic tale because it was supposed to be the next gothic game). It's supposed to be an open world RPG but it's more like a liniar bad hack n' slash game with level progression. basicly this is what the game is: after you finish the intro (which is the only fun part of the game) you get to a tiny part of the island, you do a part of the main quest and you unlock another tiny part of the island where you can do another part of the main quest and you unlock another tiny part of the island and so on untill the final battle. And than it's game over, no more exploring for no reason at all. the main quest is boring, there are only a few side quests which are even worse than the main quest. characters are boring and not memoreble at all, even the characters from Gothic 1, 2, and 3 and exploring is rarely rewarding, not that there is much to explore as most of the remotely interesting sites are used for the main quest. if you played the demo and liked it keep it that way the demo covers by far the best part of the game.ArcaniA a gothic fail scores a 3/10			"

												Far into the game as I write this. Eventually the desire to continue wanes when immersion is broken due to the callousness to which this RPG as been constructed. Speaking directly to Spellbound Entertainment, I really couldn't care less what your budget is and I don't care about the perilous finances of your now bankrupt publisher. When you undertake a project like this and dress it with the same repeating carbon copy npc's then you have no right to undertake such a project. It's a crime against the art of game development and shows no respect for your audience. I really want to continue. I like what's here despite the meaningless ""RPG elements"" and the damn crafting icon staring at me the entire play through. Go watch a movie with the same character playing 20 different roles each dubbed with a different voice. At this point in the game's narrative I should be fully immersed in the world of Arcania but you Spellbound Entertainment have completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ my immersion. I'm walking out of the theater now. There weren't that many here to start. Something about the title and the game not living up to it's legacy. The naysayers were right and I a fool for not listening.			"

 Playable, but pointless.I got this game free (thanks, Steam!) but I can't recommend anyone buy it. Everything that makes RPGs fun to play is absent from this game: Story is weak and formulaic, while also being incomprehensible at times; Combat is laughably easy and offers no real challenge; No choices or moral decisions that affect the story; Poor NPC characterization and acting, and; an ending that makes no sense and doesn't resolve anything;It's not broken by any means, and you may have some fun playing it if you're big into medeival fantasy. But in all, I don't think it's worth your time or money, as there are much better games available on steam that are dirt cheap.			"

												Arcania can be summarized as follows:A grossly simplified RPG with nice graphics (for its time) that is no longer part of the Gothic Universe. There are no quest markers, the story is possibly the most cliché I've seen in an RPG, and the gameplay makes Fable 3 look challenging. I also saw the same character model used for 5 different key npc's within the first hour and a half of playtime.I had more fun with Two Worlds. Don't play this.			"

												...so being somewhere half way through the game I remember thinking: "" who am I gonna recommend this game to in my review?"" I thought of this game as a ""game of missed opportunities"" but getting through the end game grind, final boos fight and enduring the countless fillers I finally found my  answer: I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE!!!Arcania is a bad game and even though the world is nice and graphics is still decent 4 years later there are just not enough good things to actually ask anyone to endure this!World is very small and with limited access, quests are extremely linear where you have to do chains of quests to access a location x only to be used by npc x and forced to do things XYZ.  This game would be compared to Gothic 3 or Risen but short answer is: it DOES NOT compary to either one of them at all!PROS:- beautiful world- good graphics- good evade systemCONS:- mindless button mashing combat - no skill whatsoever- low difficulty (havent used a potion till mid game)- HORRIBLE fillers towards end game- BOOOORING end boss fight (like most end boses but this one takes the cake)- WORST ENDING EVER?- boring, linear quests- bad voice actingUp till yesterday I thought I will give the short expansion a try but after finally finishing this game I do not want to have anything to do with it anymore...2/10 - avoid !!!

												When you play ArcaniA aka Gothic 4, it seems to be very important how the game is compared to it's predecessors. And there's a lot to live up to because the first 2 games were considered sort of icons of the genre. Here’s a list of remarks made while playing:Game mechanics:+ Looting is fast and simple.+ One of the coolest looking minimaps I've seen.+ Main quest conversations trigger automatically when approaching the right npc. This prevents fruitless dialogues with npc's who don't really have anything to say.+ Health regenerates+ Interesting lock picking system+ Game creates savegames itself in important places. Don't remember the previous ones doing that.- If the quest location stays out of the range of the minimap then the minimap doesn't show you the direction towards the location.- Minor bugs with characters getting stuck behind invisible obstacles.- The question weather it is open world or not. Fans of Gothic say that ArcaniA is not open world like the other Gothic games were. I ask: was Gothic 1 open world? They say 'yes, but a really small open world'. I say: well, there you have it. Arcania has those small areas, bigger than in Witcher, but it's not open in the same way Gothic 3, Skyrim and GTA were. I bring it up because it has been noted as a flaw.- Levelling up badly balanced. The game is way too generous in helping you max your stats. By the time I was through two thirds of the game I had maxed out everything I needed.Design:+ Beautiful textures, highly improved compared to Gothic 3 BUT they blend together horribly.+ Weirdly the game get's better designwise as the it advances. Looks like they created the first chapter just to learn how to do the job.- The guy who created the 3D models didn't have a clue about human anatomy. - Like so often in games the main character looks like some fancy-pants out of a men's magazine.- In game written material is in some kind of modern comic font which doesn’t blend with the rest of the game at all.- During dialogues, when the characters are zoomed in, armor stretches and bends as if it was part of flesh and muscle.- Insanely few character models. The orcs, for example, look all the same.Game flow:+ ArcaniA’s best feature: they've come up with a helpful, easy-to-use dodging system. My experience with other games (Elder Scrolls, Assassin's Creed, Gothic) is that going in for the kill is more profitable that starting to dodge/ block, which in most cases is hard and pointless. ArcaniA nailed it and I give them huge credit for it.+ Npc's with quests are marked with an exclamation mark.+ Auto-aim enemies in malee battle (like in Assassin’s Creed) . In ArcaniA you come across places where you fight off 8 enemies or so at once. The auto trigger feature makes the battle in such occasions more fluent and faster overall.Atmosphere:+ The protagonist actually talks when you trigger a dialogue. Games these days (Skyrim, Half-Life etc.) have taken the silent protagonist approach which in my opinion closes some potent doors.+ Diego and Gorn are the coolest they've ever been during the whole series.+ The character is a charming fellow with good spirit. It contrasts highly with the previous nameless hero who at least in Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods was a war mongering bloody dictator who went after some small tribes that wanted to live their own way).+ Goblins do whatever goblins might do before you arrive, they don't just stand there idly. They have a tribal look and seem a little more sophisticated than those poor bare guys in Gothic 3. AND they carry cool names like ''Warrior of the bugeater tribe'.+ There's actually an epic story behind the whole thing with twists and drama.- To the end it doesn't develop that true Gothic atmosphere that made the previous games popular.- Voice acting is terribly overdramatized, doesn't sound like natural speech at all.- In the whole there's not much to explore, the world feels empty.A remark about Gothic: some ancient cultures belived that your spirit is immune to harm if your enemy didn't know your real name. The idea is used in both fantasy books and occult rituals. You have to know the name of the demon to summon him. Knowing the name bends the demon to your will. This allegory now comes to mind as I think of the former nameless hero, now Rhobar III who has been attacked by a demon. While he was nameless, he was mighty, but once he got a name, he became subject to harm. The game unconciously plays with this idea.The verdict:Try the game. Never mind the old Gothic games, they had their flaws as well. Arcania had both good and bad sides.			"

												ArcaniA – Gothic 4 is a mediocre RPG that is mildly amusing, addictive, and simply boring all rolled into one. Its a semi-open world where you have to unlock the next area by completing certain objectives.  The hero a boy from Feshyr a simple shepard  and I mean simple.  This is one game that truly could have been an OUTSTANDING game. The hero he lacked substance and didn't grow he was still the simple ignorant, and dumb shepard from Freshyr.  If you are a hardcore RPG fan this game might be for you.  It does have some really good parts and the story has so much more to offer then it did.  Mind numbing questing everyone in the game just takes advantage of the main hero (honestly after 25 hours of game play I couldn't tell you his name).  I need to find this will you help me?  Yes but you have to do this first?  OK I accomplished the task.  NO you tricked me or What I have do one more thing.  The repetitiveness of the same quest just a different location hurt this game more then anything. The game mechanics on fighting were good.  On the other hand the enemy’s repeated there attacks in the same order over and over again just like the weather dusk, morning, afternoon evening all sunny.  Then night calm, lets say midnight rain, then dusk it stops and repeats the order.  That’s all the game does really is repeat its self over and over.  The graphics are descent the endless invincible walls not so much.    I don't  personally like to give a bad review because the designers of the games we love to play, put so much time and effort into them but this is one game had the possibility to offer so much more and falls short by a long haul in my opinion. It feels like they had a good a vision for the game but couldn't fulfill or even do it justice on what they envisioned.  One of the most notable parts of the game was the voice actor David Lodge. He was known for his voice role as Kenpachi Zaraki in Bleach and the role of Jiraiya in Naruto. Winstan a NPC that has only a few lines in the game			"

												I just finished this game...including nearly all sidequests. I really wanted to like this, but I just can't. The problem is not, that this is not Gothic anymore. I knew that already when I bought it (Even thou it tries to be Gothic by having the name in its title). The Problem is, even seeing it as a single game, without the series, its just not a good game. However I'll try to make a list of pros and cons here and you'll see for yourself if you want to play it or not:Pros:-Graphics + Design of the enviroment-Easy controls-Very easy, its pretty hard to die in the beginning, it slowly gets harder, but you never get to the point where you need more than 2-3 tries to kill an enemie, which makes it a good game for people, who don't often play RPG's and/or want quick and fast progress-It's not hard to find your way, they're all pretty obvious, there are no long walking parts-You meet some NPC's from the Gothic games (however meeting some of them makes no sense, because of the end of Gothic 3)-(Bandages are food ;b)Cons:-Voice actors in german and english (didn't try others) are terrible. You just can't take them seriously-The only thing you need gold for is potions, weapons/armor are free, which gives you nearly no reason to explore your enviroment -> if you do so, you'll find nothing better anyways-There are no real choices and the few choices you make have no influence -Combat is pretty much clicking, clicking, clicking...and rolling now and then-The story is linear, you visit one part of your map after the other, there is no need to go back and what happens next is obvious all the time, every possible cliché is used-Skill tree...is not a tree, more like skill lines, good thing is you can't do anything wrong here and your skills don't have influence on what weapons/armor you wear. Magic skill lines will upgrade your spell, there are only 3 spells in total for the whole game-Lots of quest items only spawn after you got the quest...one more reason to not look into caves as long as noone tells you to do so-The graphics are good in general, but you'll find lots of glitches/textures-Invisible walls everywhere-No reason to play it again, you'll see everything there is in one playthrough-Some small bugs (NPC's not willing to talk to you unless you reload your last save, enemies getting stuck)			"

												I have never played a game before in the Gothica series, so in regards to the reviews towards the game's story and depth I did not hold much creed in.  Because I had no basis of comparison from this series specifically, I dismissed those criticisms as associative and wanted to play the game on it's own merits.Graphically, this game is quite impressive for a title from it's time.  The bitmaps, many of the object models, and foliage and water all look impressive and would be comparable to a game from today.  Environmental sounds are also quite good.  Character models however are showing their age; all males and females share the same basic physique, and the character model used is pretty simplistic.  The player character looks like he's got a bird's nest growing on his scalp.  His hair is detailed but does not move; the hair spray in the Gothica universe must use super glue as it's base.  The writing and voice acting in this game are jarringly bad and repeatedly wreck the process of immersion.  For example, at the beginning of the game, you need to acquire a bangle so that you can propose to your girlfriend.  Despite just previously completing a quest that had me wipe out a camp of goblins (thus having gold from corpses and weapons to sell going into this quest), here I see my character rationalizing having to do a retrieval quest for the bangle because he 'has no gold', which was clearly and obviously incorrect.The dialogue 'tree' in this game is flat-out nonsense.  You rarely have any actual options, and after a couple of hours, I stopped caring about what lore they may reveal and just wanted to move on to questing.  A couple of hours after that, I no longer wanted to play.Despite the fact that this game was also made for consoles, this version does not have a functioning inventory while using the controller.  I found this to be an unacceptable technical oversight when compiled with the other problems I had playing this game.I can't recommend a game that I have no desire to finish.  I don't know how this game compares to other games in the Gothica series, but I generally don't think this is even a good RPG.			"

												First of all, ignore the time played counter, it is not reflective of the amount of hours I spent playing ArcaniA. Because of technical issues, I had to constantly switch between the Steam version and a retail version. A more accurate game time would be around 20-21 hours.At it's core, AcraniA is a failed experiment. After Pirahana Bytes washed its hands of the series after the publisher, JoWooD, forced Gothic 3 out the door before it was ready, Spellbound Entertainment (who is most notable for Desperados) was given the reins. However, Spellbound was a studio that didn't have any prior experience in the type of RPG that Gothic was, and it shows. ArcaniA's intended purpose was simple: To reboot the Gothic series and turn it into a more accessible, console-friendly experience. This idea was misguided at best and while there is nothing at all wrong with making formerly very hardcore franchises into more welcoming ones (Deus Ex, System Shock, Hitman, etc), ArcaniA completely fails to understand what worked about Gothic as a series. The property is simply misused here, and the additions to the mythology and world of Gothic only serve to undermine it. The much beloved freedom the previous games had is also sacrificed in order to have a more linear experience that exists in an unhappy middle-ground between Fable and Oblivion.The story takes place on an unexplored island that has not been represented in any Gothic game before and features a new protagonist. After Gothic 3/FG, The Nameless Hero was crowned Rhobar III and has embarked on a campaign of conquest with the goal to unify all of humanity under one banner. This campaign comes at the cost of many lives, however, including your hometown and your (immediately killed off and fridged minutes after introduction) fiance, which is razed to the ground with you as the only survivor. The story continues from there and characters from the other Gothic games make appearances as crucial characters in the story, with each getting redesigned from the ground up. Examples would be that now Diego is a swarthy, vaguely Spanish-ish, pirate and Gorn loves violence and fighting. To be fair, the Gothic games didn't have the strongest of characters to begin with, so this can be excused. What can't be excused is how the plot ultimately progresses into nonsense. Not the fun kind of nonsense that developers like Quantic Dream deliver, but the confusing, irritating nonsense of a story that was written in a hurry and poorly translated. Even at the end, I still didn't know anything beyond a surface level understanding of the events that are taking place. ArcaniA also ditches the Genome Gaming Engine that powered Gothic 3 for the Vison 7 engine and at times, the game can look quite nice. There are some nice lighting effects and the view distance is quite good as well. However, that is about all the nice things I can say about the tech that drive this game. While Genome was buggy and unoptimized, I would have very much preferred it during my time with ArcaniA. The Steam version in particular is currently broken on the highest settings, with lighting and shadow rendering being miscast onto characters faces, to name one problem. The framerate/framepacing was also abysmal on hardware from 2016, with an incredibly bad play feel. Eventually I googled the problems I was having and discovered that the best way to play is with a patched up retail copy. So I ended up buying this game twice in order to play through it because of the lack of maintenance on the Steam version. However, the retail version is also very broken, with textures and shadows sometimes completely failing to load, 2D elements such as the HUD and map/mini-map becoming corrupt and video cutscenes refusing to play. In order to experience ArcaniA in the best possible way, I ended up having to constantly switch between the retail version and the steam version. The overall aesthetic of the game is also quite plain. Spellbound was clearly 'inspired' by the success of other console-focused western RPG's, especially Oblivion, and attempted to replicate that look. So expect lots of European looking castles, farms, inns and the like. There are also some snowy temples, a giant magical tree surrounded by swamp, but it's mostly castles and villages. The most interesting looking area, which had a very Arabian look to it, was blocked off in the game and you only ever see the front facade of it, along with the skyline. Nothing about the art style is notable or exceptional in any way.The combat and RPG systems of Gothic have also been left behind in favor of a very basic combat and leveling up system. The core gameplay loop is indistinguishable from most RPG's where you see an enemy, kill the enemy, get xp, repeat. Not to say that Gothic didn't reinvent the wheel with combat, but it felt far more interesting then it does in ArcaniA The interesting Learning Points system is replaced with a menu-driven perk system, which is, again, very plain.Overall, ArcaniA dosen't succeed in it's mission. The game didn't sell well, Spellbound went under with JoWooD, who was already in dire fiancial straits, and history moved on. I can't even recommend this game as a curiosity for fans of the series or a simple timesink because the game is so plain and mediocre as well as bug-ridden and glitchy.Spend your time elsewhere.

												This game is trash, from the horrible story line, to the horrible voice acting, to the horrible DRMSeriously, I came back to this game after a few months to see if they had done anything to the game and I couldnt install it again because My hardware had changed and my registered copy was on another set of hardware. IE different hard drive...I've had better luck reactivating a system builder version of Windows. At least with them you call them and be like my motherboard fried had to replace it. They give you a code right away.After playing the game I really was trying to figure out what they went to great lengths to protect. It was because their game was garbage, it didnt turn out the way they thought it was going to, and they didnt want anyone pirating it to get a free first look, because they knew they wouldnt buy it after trying it. Every review on steam has between .2 - 20 hours, with 20 hours being the outliar.This is not a gothic game. If for some reason you played the gothic series and you are here looking at this review so long after not knowing much about this game, take it from a gothic fan, don't buy this trash.			"

												An unbalanced and poorly executed game. I find it peculiar that the publishers decided to not longer include the game in the Gothic franchise years after its original release by removing the ""Gothic 4"" title enterily from the Steam store page. It is not completely un-entertaining, but it lacks many of the aspects that makes a good RPG, if not game. It says a lot about the attention to detail when the faces of ""key"" NPCs are very noticeably duplicated.+ Apealing graphics, at least in 2010+ Makes you enjoy better RPGs more+ Hilarious voice acting- Hilarious voice acting- Weapons and armor system- Fighting mechanics- Severly unbalanced difficulty (if not patched)- Overall poorly executed			"

												Though the story wraps up the conclusion of the three previous Gothic titles and begins a new story arc, this is not a true Gothic game.  The story is very linear.  The map is divided up by invisible walls, nintendo shall not pass JRPG gaurds, and barriers that require completion of story line quests. You also can't murder or kill anyone unless they are hostile combatants.  Don't get me started on the leveling system, it sucks and isn't anything like the Gothic games.  Combat is super easy and repetative, roll, combo, roll, combo, win.  Story is predictable in the beginning and so far not very interesting.  I played through the first few areas, got passed the Silverlake Orcs, and I got fed up with the game when I got to Blackwater.  The hero is a push over and does everything he is told in order to progress the story.  For someone who is seeking vengeance, he sure is a ♥♥♥♥♥ cat when it comes to being told, ""no you can't pass into this area until you do 10 menial quests"".  That alone irkes me, as I hate being forced into a crappy linear story.  Uninstalling.			"

												Overall a mediocre game. Tons of minor graphical glitches and odd dialogue hiccups. The combat is so-so, not too exciting but not difficult. The talent tree is very lacking, especially if you want to play a Ranger/Bow class.The story is pretty shallow and doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times. The ending actually angered me with how abrupt and anticlimactic it was.If you're looking for an RPG to kill some time, go right ahead but if you're looking for a true RPG experience, don't waste your time.

												I really tried to get into this game but I gave up. It's terribly boring and consists mostly of running around the coutryside. If you loved Gothic 2 and disliked Gothic 3 for what it became know this: I played through Gothic 3 and even liked some bits but this game is even worse, just plain annoying, generic and void of details, lacking any redeeming factor. It's ok for a few hours then you realize you'll be backtracking many more days of your life away if you continue playing and just quit.			"

												I have played all the Gothic games in the series.The first and the second are epic.The third is ok.But this ""ArcaniA - Gothic"" is......The game has nice graphics, and some ok gameplay.But the gothic games are story focused, and this is the problem.I have finished the game in 12h with all side-quest's.No content, no depth, no Gothic.

												An average RPG game and very poor representant of the Gothic series.-Boring, predictable and short storyline.-Poor animations.-The combat's also not challenging at all(with a mage you can annihilate the opponents before they even realize that you're nearby).-Not the best voice acting.-Clones,clones everywhere!-Overly simplified character development.If you are a veteran of the Gothic series by Piranha Bytes and you're looking for a successor of it then better buy Risen,created by the original Gothic developers.

												If you don't want to read the whole thing, you can just read this sentence.I never played Gothic, and I can clearly say it's a nay nay, I couldn't even force myself to finish it._______________When I saw screenshots of this game, it looked pretty okay. I didn't read the reviews, as I did not buy it individually so I thought it was a lucky strike to get this game in addiction to the ones I actually wanted, as it looked cool.Oh boy, was I wrong.Here's the thing, This game is boring as hell. I can look pass the bugs and glitches [first 2 minutes of gaming, I fell into a whole in the ground and ended up floating for a while walking on air]I can Ignore the somewhat... awful combat system [I mean, you just press the same button repeatedly until the enemy dies, as they're all sluggish and dumb as a wall, with no reflexes. You have magic but it's basically useless as you don't actually have magic powers and use scrolls you have to buy first]I can even pretend not to notice the dreadful character design and voice acting , But getting tossed into an infiniy of ""fetch quests"" with no actuall development to the ""storyline"" [Is a super generic story with the less charismatic main character ever - I'm trying to remember his name, and I actually can't - who goes on a quest for revenge yada yada yada] Just sent me into a near coma journey.The whole game revolves around you getting from one point in the map to another one, to get some random NPC some random Item, until the next NPC asks you for another random item. I spent 6 hours in this, and it actually felt like a lot more. I ended up uninstaling it, without even wanting to know how the story ends. Just never buy this, for your sake.			"

													This is another one I have mixed feelings about. I might as well start with the good; The interface is sexy, the equipment customization is decent, the music is alright, and the voice acting doesn't suck... constantly. Even the lockpicking has now been given its own minigame, adding gameplay where before it had been trial-and-error, and then removed altogether. The graphics are good, but suffer from a stuttering problem on all visual quality settings that I sort of figured out in the expansion. Unlike the previous title, the game progresses constantly and rewards the player at an acceptable pace. The combat is a decent change from the monotony of Gothic 3, but I would suggest turning the difficulty up. It can also get a little muddled in melee because all of the attacking, blocking, and dodging actions are still mapped to only two buttons.	I have only one complaint that ruined the game for me. Arcania is streamlined, and when I say that, I mean, you could hand me a map of the game world, and I could draw the rough path the player will take through it on every playthrough. It technically qualifies as an open-world game, but doesn't really try to be one. Most of the time, the player is just supposed to keep going on the path ahead, which works in some cases, I suppose. Not every RPG needs to be a living, breathing, truly open world, and I did notice that this design did allow for some more specific detail in certain areas, but there are still the occasional floating plants, stretched or missing textures, and indefinitely closed doors, the hallmarks of a rushed game. However, those problems can be overlooked compared to the bigger gameplay faults compounded by the same linear nature.	For example, the teleport system is just bad. In the previous games, the player could teleport from where ever, as long as he had the proper rune or stone. Here, teleporting can only be done between two designated pads, which are uncovered in a fairly linear pattern through game progression. Often, the distance between connected pads is shorter than the distance from one ""pad network"" to another. Why does this suck? Well, imagine you want to go to the other side of the map to finish up some uncompleted sidequests, and you haven't gotten to the point where the linear path around the map finally loops. This would mean that, to go back, you would have to run back to the nearest teleport pad, teleport, and from that pad, run to the next pad, and repeat. It takes so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ long to get anywhere in this game, and most enemies stay dead. No fast travel, no ""teleport from anywhere"", you're just running through areas already conquered.	Yet, the most insulting part of this change to the formula is the fact that most interactive objects in the world (anvils, kettles, etc.) have been stripped of purpose, to the point that the game actually provides the option to turn them off so that the player doesn't waste his or her time by accidentally activating them. Being able to craft what I want, when I want from a clean interface is convenient, but it removes any kind of premeditation and planning from the experience, and only highlights the fact that it was made this way so that players wouldn't have to do any monotonous, risk-free backtracking.	I'm not sure whether to fully recommend this game. Gothic 3 was a great concept executed poorly. Arcania is a bad concept executed fairly well, but only within its own context. Without any of the familiar names within the game, this is just a bland, generic, linear action RPG that doesn't really stand out, and certainly does not live up to its predecessors.			"

												Never thought that i'm going to play ArcaniA a.k.a Gothic 4, because as we all know, it's not even close to real Gothic 1/2/3, but i decided to give it a try, theese are my thoughts about this game:Visually this game looks awesome. Dialogues are not booring anymore compared with previous Gothic parts. Combat system is much easier compared with previous parts. The thing I really dislike about this game is Open World. Like, you can't go anywhere without a premission, or if you don't have a right key or something else, you just can't walk around like you could back in 1/2/3, I would say that it's like auto balanced game - you complete the quest, you move to next area, where you will need to fight against your lvl creatures, then you complete this main quest again and you have a premission to next area, where you fight against your lvl creatures and so on. I don't really like that type of gameplay. Back in Gothic 1/2/3.. You just start the game and you can already die in first minutes, if you go somewhere random, because there was no such thing as this ''auto balance''. When I play this game, i feel like i'm playing a different RPG game, it's fun, but it's not Gothic anymore. I bought Arcania + Gothic pack (6games together) for just 5$,If you ask me - Is this game worth 5$? then my answer is yes, you should give it a try.If you ask me - Is this game worth 20$? Then my answer is no, there are other nice games for 20$ out there. "

												This game functions better as a virus than a game!The writing in this game makes youtube commenters seem literate and the voice acting makes Kristen Stewart seem like a well rounded actress. The game is glitchy and forced me to reload when I randomely fell through the graphics. When the game repeatedly crashed right after a boss fight, I decided to unistall it. Unfortunately there is no uninstaller and using steam to delete local content just launches the game without deleting anything. I had to go into my directory and delete it manually.Save yourself some money, buy a brick to smash your computer with instead of buying this game.			"

												Okay I wanted to review this game when I have finished it, but I can´t. When I told myself that I will play arcania, I found myself washing dishes and cleaning my room. That is how much I didn´t want to play it.In the end I never got to finish the game.Story sucksCombat sucks. Even combat in vanilla skyrim is better and that is saying something.Level up skills sucksCrafting sucksCharacters sucksGraphics were okay.If you are a diehard fan of gothic 1, 2, 3. Do not buy this game. I bought this game for 5 euro and I still regret it. Incredible. Go and spend this money on something else. Or go buy Risen series, they are quite good and they bring back the gothic feeling.10/10 would rather clean my room again than to play this game.			"

												One last adventure with the nameless hero, Gorn, Milten, Lester and Diego. Unlike Gothic 3, Arcania is playable on windows 7. But apart from being the last installment in the Gothic series, unfortunately, this game does not end it with a bang. Its a mediocre RPG at best, and at worst its a mediorce RPG with a handful of technical issues that lacks the charm of Gothic 1 and Gothic 2. I can't say that on its own its worth playing, but as an installment to the series its worth playing if you're a die hard fan of Gothic. Otherwise besides that, its pretty sub-par. The Gothic series for me ended with Gothic 2 (which is the best game in the series IMO).			"

												This game lacks pretty much everything that makes Gothic 2 or even Risen (the real successor to the Gothic games) special.The atmosphere in Gothic was always the highlight for me. That feeling of being new to a world full of different factions and people who all have their own schedules and agendas and belongings and character. Arcania only brings gated zones that you unlock as the story progresses and characters who are bland. Most of the people in this game don't even own or have ownership over anything, or say anything meaningful or at all when you try to talk to them.In past games going into someone's house or stealing their belongings would get you in trouble. In this game citizens will go about their day as you pilfer their chests. Another thing that really struck me was that I was able to fight 3 wild animals in the middle of a crowded tavern and not a single character reacted in any way to what was happening. In Gothic 2 or Risen, the NPCs react to creatures, and will actually fight them. Sometimes they die and are dead permenantly! In Arcania I tried to fight a bandit who was blocking a region I needed to get into, and my attacks did nothing to him as he stood there oblivious to my efforts to kill him. It comes off feeling lifeless and empty compared to previous Gothic games.While passable as a RPG, this game does nothing to live up to the tacked on 'Gothic' name. For fans of the series this game holds practically nothing for you and I do not recommend. For newcomers you are better served playing Gothic 2 or Risen.			"

Graphics:+ The graphics were decent for a game that was released in 2010. There are quite a lot of details on characters. The areas look pretty neat as well.- Many characters are clones and animations could be smoother here and there.Sound:+ The music is good overall but really not as amazing as it was in past Gothic games. The voice acting in the English version is completely horrible and makes you cringe at times. Stream should allow players to decide themselves which sound packs to install. The german voice acting is much better.- The environment does not make too much sound. You would expect to hear animals and other things.Balance:+ You can clearly feel that your character is developing and there are 4 difficulties.- The 4 difficulties are meaningless. Having played the game on 'Gothic' which is supposed to be the hardest difficulty I have never felt like the game was hard. I have never died a lot except for the last boss which was the first time I started using pots and buffs. Funnily enough I only died 3 times on the last boss which isn't even a lot.Atmosphere:+ Many dialogues are neat if it wasn't for the horrible voice acting. You can feel part of the world. You keep meeting characters you met before and NPCs seem to be moving with you. You also meet old characters from past Gothic games which is a big plus for fans of the franchise.- The world is very stale and boring. There is nothing to explore except things that you are meant to explore. You can only quest in the area you are meant to quest. All areas are cut off and you can only progress once you do the required main quest. The atmosphere is long not as brilliant as in past Gothic games.UI:+ The UI is decent and I never had issues with controlling my character. You can put up to 10 items and spells on your bar which is more than enough. In addition you can bind the keys.- The character gets 'stuck' pretty often when he shouldn't be. Sometimes he gets stuck while simply running which forces you to jump occasionally.Content:+ The game is somewhat long. It took me 40 hours to finish but that's including doing extremely boring quests which forces you to run through the entire world to look for hidden artifacts.- Many areas have nothing special in them. Sometimes you run through a jungle area in which you do nothing at all except run. Why not put one quest where nearby orcs have stolen or killed a friend? Instead there are just random little camps with orcs which you clear and move on. A lot of potential was lost. There are also barely any side-quests at all. Quests:+ The questing is very bad in Arcania. There are nearly no side-quests. However the story starts off in an interesting way.- Most quests are only about either killing a few monsters or bringing the NPC a few items. The quest stories are also very boring and even when you can do it in more than 1 way it has no effect on the story or even the rewards.Charactersystem:+ The charactersystem is decent. Most of the abilities are useful and you can specialize in things.- However the system is very simple and boring. You barely have a choice in what to specialize in since there are so little abilities and you will learn all by the end.Combatsystem:+ The comatis fast and interactive. You have to dodge certain attacks which you cannot parry. Other attacks can be parried if you are fast enough. - The AI is horrible. Many monsters simply keep hitting you with special attacks which force you to dodge. They also hit so slow that it is no challenge to get away from them before they hit you. There are also only 3 spells in the game which make being a Mage pretty boring.Items:+ There are many items and you can craft a lot of items yourself.- The crafting is useless though. I played the entire game on the hardest difficulty and have never crafted a single pot. When the game was over my inventory was still filled with all kinds of materials. I only crafted around 3 items to wear. Many items were simply useless. You also get new armour very rarely when the game decides you should get a new armour.Conclusion:I have played Gothic and Gothic 2 in the past and was highly interested in Arcania. Sadly I found out that Jowood and Piranha Bytes had an argument which is which Jowood removed them and took the rights to the game themselves. They paid another developer team to work on Gothic 4 which is why the game is completely horrible compared to the other Gothic games. I would even say that they ruined the Gothic story. Even though you meet old friends you don't actually seem to work with them that much. The game turned into a drag half-way and I just honestly wanted to finish it which is why I did not even obtain the best armour available. Worst of all is that they end the story abrubtly. The DLC of the game is required to really understand the story. They obviously cut the game off before release just to sell the DLC of the rest.I would only recommend this game to real hardcore RPG fans and fans of Gothic but not to anyone else.I have played this game on this sytem at maximum settings and very high FPS:GPU: ASUS HD 7970 Matrix PlatinumCPU: Intel Core i5-4670RAM: Kingston HyperX Blu 16GBMotherboard: MSI Z87-G45SSD: Samsung SSD 830			"

												When there are so many good games to choose from these days, there really isn't a point to forcing myself to play more of this game. It doesn't help ArcaniA's case that I've played this in a post The Witcher 3 world. ArcaniA's story is mundane. The dialog is so basic. There was one interaction in my 5 hours that I found slightly amusing - the orc (I think he was an orc) that wanted to become a master and sent the protagonist on a couple errands.The otherwise attractive world is marred by weird shadows that tattoo NPC's' faces. Performance was fine.The combat is pretty basic but has just enough involvement from the player so it isn't horrible - basically some timing / rythem of attacks and rolling out of the way. I didn't bother blocking. If these were still the days where I could buy a game every couple of months, I'd probably continue playing it. Maybe not even then, but there would be a chance. These days I can't think of a reason this game needs to be played.			"

												PROS-Decent Story, and good story flow.-Enviroments are pretty big-Good weapons-Good Armour-Good crafting, and was easy to make money.-Worth playing if you buy it for 75% off or more.  It's not worth more money than that.-Has a Demo you can download on Steam.  Try before you buy!CONS-Fast travel is terrible, and feels unfinished.  You get two portals to travel within each town, so you can fast travel within a town but you can't fast travel to a far away town.  You pretty much have to run from portal to portal.  Simply it's only half as good as the fast travel of Oblivion or Risen.-The ONLY way you can sprint is with the Runes or Potion to run fast.  Runes have cool down, and potion ingredients are limited.  A real pain when there isn't a great fast travel built into the game. You get a little bored with the slow traveling, and discouraged me from backtracking to find all the statues etc for the bonus items.-Dialog is really bad! Not the writing, but the mismatched inflections in the conversation.  Most of the time the hero comes off as a jerk.  It's like they recorded the actor saying one sentence then copied and pasted it into every conversation whether the tone matched the conversation or not. -The mission tracking on the map is only good half the time.  The other half you'll be googling to figure out where the heck your mission is located.-Graphics aren't great, espcially sky lines and shorelines.-Trader menu for crafting scrolls doesn't tell you whether you own it or not. Also you can't compare item stats you have equipped to items in trader menu.-Women are not painted in a very good light. After playing through Arcania then Fall of Setarrif right after, I was wondering if there were women haters who worked on this game... The women are painted as stuck up b*tches, or ♥♥♥♥♥s.-The PS3 version had Trophies, it would have been nice if it had Steam achievements.			"

 Summary	Arcania: Gothic 4 is as the name suggests fourth installment of the Gothic series. Unlike its predecessors, this game was developed by Spellbound.If you expect something similar to previous Gothics, you might want to avoid this game and rather get Risen, or you might get disappointed.Plot is set on Southern Isles, which are ravaged by war led by King Rhobar III in his effort to unite rest of the kingdom under his rule. The new nameless hero inhabits one of these islands and after his village has been burned down, his goal is to find those, who are responsible for it. Rating  1) Graphics (✔)     Even though the game is from 2010, I have to say graphics is great. Wilderness, monsters, weapons, armors, lights,     shadows etc. everything is nicely done. Only thing that was irritating me where faces. Looks like designers created about five faces and those are repeating over and over on different characters slightly changed with hair, beard, hats etc. 2) Optimalization (✗)    Game is poorly optimized. Only thing you can do is to set different values in configuration files. According to default    settings, game is supposed to run only on one processor core, which is nonsense. Considering release date in 2010,    most games were optimalized to run on multiple cores by then. 3) Voice acting (✗)    This game has one of the worst voice acting I've ever heard. Most voice actors are simply exaggerating and final result is implausible, which really breaks the immersion. 4) Dialogues (✗)    In hand to hand with voice acting comes dialogues. Dialogues in this game are poorly written. I can't believe a mature person would write something like this. Example: ""What kind of mystery?"" ""Mysterious mystery."" ""What mysterious mystery?"" ""That my friend is a mystery.""I mean, who the hell would write something like this? 5) RPG elements (✗)    RPG elements are non-existent. You cannot interact with most things which are not related to quests. Character development is very simplified to leveling up certain abilities. 6) Combat (✗)   Combat is very easy. You either dodge attacks by rolling, or it is simple click-fest (which is easier since you stunlock your oponents). Trying to achieve certain combos is needless since click-fest is more efficient. 7) Quests (✗)    Quests in Arcania are similar to those from most mmo games. Go there, and either gather X items or kill X enemies and come back for reward. Verdict I really wanted to like this game while playing. At start I had really huge problems with everything, but as I progressed through the game I either got used to it, or things started to get better. But the ending made my decision easier. It was simply cut off from game and released in so called expansion.  "

												I'll write this review for the sake of those who haven't followed the Gothic games.See, long story short there was a divide between the old guard who liked Gothics 1 and 2, believing Gothic 3 was a poor sequel, and folks like me who agree that Gothics 1 and 2 were classic but 3 had a charm of its own. It's true, I enjoyed 3 and I still recommend it, even if I had some mechanical problems with its expansion (For the record I NEVER had any problem with the base game and although it could've used more content, I had a lot of fun exploring it!).Now when Arcania (the de facto Gothic 4, under a new name for understandable reasons due to studio changes) was announced, the old guard of the former group were pessimistic and people like me were hopeful. I wanted a more polished game that offered the sort of open-world exploration, side quests laced through the main quest, secrets to find, factions to join or oppose and engaging choices that made the last games great, coupled with improved visuals and controls but especially more options and items and goodies in general.What I got was an unbelievably linear, limited game that seemed to strip everything that made 3 fun while keeping everything the old guard criticized about it. I couldn't even finish it. I was bored out of my skull before I could even save the capital, let alone figure out what the nonsensical plot was about.Maybe it's a little better if you aren't familiar with the previous games, but even then it's an unfortunate use of money to buy. You want to play Gothic, check out the previous three and leave this on the shelf. Fair warning though, I have trouble getting 1 and 2 to work on newer computers.			"

												Short ReviewDon't bother.Longer Review:What the hell was that? The final boss was a cake walk, the end movie didn't involve my character or his fate at all, the magic sword I spent half the game questing to craft was replaced with in two hours (My crafted magic sword: 40 damage, no magic effects. The magic sword of the lieutenant bad guy boss: 36 damage 100% chance to slow on strike. Which would you take?).My characters entire motivation was to kill one guy, who I killed, than I took his sword (the slowing one) and killed a whole bunch of other people, undead, demons etc. so I could save the king who employed the one guy to kill my love interest, everyone I ever knew and probably my dog.Best part of the entire game, and what kept me playing on through, long after I knew I could find something better to play: The voice acting for the main character. I could just hear the sarcasm in his voice every time some handed out a quest: ""What? Another side quest? suuuuurrrrrre, why not"". ""Your not going to tell me what I need? Oh, you need me to do something for you first, how many orc ears is it this time?""It was one of the prettiest games I've played, especially in 3D, but there was no substance to it and for the end game someone just shoveled on the suck.﻿			"

												ok lets start with controls: standard mouse and wasd for moving around. with shortcut keys for casting spells, switching between swords and bow, or to drink/eat stuff to regen hp and whatnot. its a good solid control system (if the players dexterity is good) you can kill almost anything by using ranged atk and switching to sword at the right moment. controls get a 9/10 score only cause theres always room for improvement. graphics! : ok its graphics are decent almost like the early skyrim but has a few unique things like when you get real close to a bush it disapears so you can see whats behind, under, or past it. if the bush does not disapear its either a grabbable item or its hiding a collecting quest item. there is no jump cheating to climb mountains its makes the graphics a little buggy when you try to. some trees you can walkthrough BUT i have yet to find a fall off the face of the earth glitch yet! YAY!  for graphics ill give it a 6 or 7 out of 10. GAMEPLAY AND STORYLINE: the storyline itself starts out good but it switches states of mind to quickly to seem realistic :/ but its a good way to pass 20+ hours. as far as gameplay its got alot of details in the items system so many MANY items to collect with no carryweight limit. so for gameplay and story line ill give this game a 7/10 because i like to explore all the little corners and the devs took the time to put stuff in said corners.

												I am not prone to exaggeration so believe me when I say this is one of the worst games I've played in roughly two decades of gaming.  Even ignoring the fact that it's branded as a Gothic game (though not made by the original developers) it is still horrible when viewed on its own (lack of) merits.  The quest design is shallow and borders on MMO quality.  The world design is linear and uninteresting.  The writing is on a borderline fifth grade level.  The character system is overly simplistic and boring.  If I worked on this title I would literally feel embarrassed to have my name attached to it.			"

												This game is alright for a while, but gets boring pretty quickly. Every section is the same. You need something, but to get that you need to help somebody else, but you can't help them unless you find an object. So, you find the object, return it to the person whose help you needed, they give you the object you needed originally. You do this over and over again.The story is formulaic, the characters are one dimensional...This isn't a bad game, but it isn't good either. It's just bland.			"

												TL;DR - This game is superbly gorgeous visually, but lacks vision and boils down to a very linear, and repetitive gameplay. The combat is just button mashing, and the story is boring. However, if you are a hardcore RPG fan, I recommend this game, as it still offers a new experience, and the world is fun to traverse. If you're looking for a Skyrim or Dragon Age experience, LOOK ELSEWHERE. This is an odd game. In depth review -This is game is... Interesting, to say the least. Now I can't necessarily say it's horrible, and I can't really say it's good, either. This game is a weird anomaly of a game, and has an interesting combination of good, and horrible, mechanics and features.  To be honest, I have never had the pleasure of playing any of the original Gothic series, so going into this game, I didn't have any knowledge prior of some sort of bar this game had to meet. However, going in, I did get that ""Weird RPG feel."" You know the one. The feel you get when you launch a game from the Risen series, or the first Witcher game. It just has a weird feel to it, and I can't explain it, unless you've experienced it. Anyways, let's start with the basics of the game, and what's not good or good about those. First off, I'd like to mention the first thing I disliked; the voice acting. Good lord. It's like something out of the Arma franchise. So much overacting, or there's complete lack of enthusiasm with these people. You'll go straight from a stereotypical, high-pitched, screetching witch, to a bored, complaining footsoldier who is in mid-combat. Appropriate. It's just very bad, and very... jarring. It takes you way out of the immersion, and that's not a word I like to use. Next on the list is the aesthetic appeal of the game, and to be honest, for a game that's 5 years old, it looks great. The colors are fantastic, the sceneries are incredible, and the lighting effects, down to some of the tiniest details is great. Just wait til you get to the point where you fight some flaming stone golems, and you'll see exactly what I mean. Adding to this point as well, there is a GREAT variety of environments. You have everything from starting with a sandy, lush beach island, to a volcanic cliffside, rain forests, and green moderate forests with plenty of rain, and lakes to enjoy. Adding to this again, the world is quite nice. It's not overwhelmingly huge, but they did a good job not making it too linear, even though it has more of that path system. The only thing I'll add that I didn't like about aesthetics were the character models. They weren't BAD persay, but they all tend to look VERY similar, which tends to be a problem with these larger RPGs, especially the older they are.The next thing is the gameplay. Really, to be honest, there isn't any. It's trying to be The Witcher, or Dragon Age, with dialogue options and in depth combat, but what it boils down to is just click, click, and click some more. No need to dodge, or even look at what dialogue you're selecting. It all will do the same thing; you win. I have not had a problem ever with the difficulty. I HAVE been playing on normal, but I didn't die til about 6 hours in. Just keeping clicking that sword around, OR just run away. That's always an option, unless the quest specifically orders something to be killed. The dialogue is just dumb, just look at what I said about voice acting.Now, here is where my BIGGEST problem is with this game; ♥♥♥♥ THE QUESTS. Oh my god. I have never seen a more roundabout way to keep a game's playtime up. Jesus, these people milked the ♥♥♥♥ out of these quests. Get ready to fight some goblins, because that 99.9% of your problems. Not your friends and wife-to-be being murdered, NO, your biggest problem will be goblins. Need to prove yourself to someone? Kill goblins. Need to return the kings standard? Goblins took it. Need to help an herbalist get his stuff back? Goblins took that ♥♥♥♥ too. Need to ANYTHING in a cave? GOBLINS ARE IN THAT ♥♥♥♥ING CAVE! And believe me, there are way too many quests that involve going into a cave with goblins. I would easily say that 70-80% take place in a cave. I'm not making that up. That's my honest guestimate. The other problem with the quests is this; they drag them the ♥♥♥♥ out so long. One of the quests you need to go find a king or something that was taken prisoner. Ok, easy enough right? Wrong. You go talk to the orc who's guarding the gate of the camp, hoping you can just kill, or run your way through. Wrong again, you have to talk to this guy. He wants some booze from a shaman who brews the stuff in a forest nearby. Ok, easy enough again, right? WRONG AGAIN. Guess what, this guy won't give you the booze (which is called skabooze, by the way, real imaginative, right?), until you find his nephew somewhere in the forest who ran off. EASY ENOUGH RIGHT?? ♥♥♥♥ING WRONG YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, BECAUSE GUESS WHAT? YOU NEED TO GO FIND THIS GUYS AMULET THAT ANOTHER SHAMAN TOOK! At this point you want to just kill everybody, and what doesn't help is that your character acknowledges along the way that all of this stuff is redundant, and stupid. He constantly gets impatient and makes sarcastic remarks about having to go do menial and boring stuff, and then later, he EXPECTS it. So the DEVs KNEW this ♥♥♥♥ was redundant and menial, but still willingly put it in the game. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Anyways, the Shaman that took that other orcs amulet, that you need to get booze, that you need to get into a gate, that you need to get the prisoner? Guess what? After you fight him, YOU HAVE TO GO INTO A ♥♥♥♥ING CAVE THAT HE HID IT IN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FOREST, FILLED WITH ♥♥♥♥ING GOBLINS AGAIN!!!!! So all of that ♥♥♥♥, and guess what? YOU JUST KILL THE ORCS INSIDE ANYWAYS, SO WHY WASTE THE TIME GETTING THAT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ HIS BOOZE TO BEGIN WITH?!?!Whatever. Beyond that, there's something about this that I can't explain that's rather appealing. The skill trees are ok. Combat works, even though it's just button mashing. The areas are rather gorgeous at times, and the music is just on par. The dialogue is complete crap, and story is uninspired, but at the same time, I get enjoyment from this game, and will probably end up playing the original Gothic games. Those are supposed to be the really good ones. So if this one works for me somewhow, I'm sure those will too. Overall, it's a 5/10 for me, but I still recommend it to the hardcore RPG fan. Give it a shot, you might enjoy it if you're into those weird RPGs. But remember, it ain't no Dragon Age, or Skyrim.			"

												Let me say it straigth: I didn't like that they ruined the reputation of the unamed hero of the Gothic Series.Initially, the game starts a bit slow, but it becomes fun after the first part is complete.The gameplay is much easier than the usual Gothic experience, if you get past the initial stages. It has some nice additions too, e.g. the ability to roll in order to dodge attacks.The game is very short, it ends before it becomes boring.The plot is very linear, like a children tale.Adviced for very young players.

												German Style ARPG. The game has its flaws, but they don't overshadow the overall experience.Pros:+ beautiful ambient (city, landscape, mountains etc.) graphics+ a mix of Gothic and Risen in terms of gameplay mechanics+ nice soundtrack+ Windows 10 (64 bit) and supports Ultrawide.Cons:- I had to change the quality of my soundcard to 48000 Hz because the game did not start appropriately- Forced V-Sinc through software- Bad camera over the head (I tried to focus on the scenario, like a FPS)- You must download a mod called TreasureHuntersMap15 to locate all the secret artefacts.- The introduction chapter does not represent the quality of the game. To enjoy it, I recommend to give it a chance after the tutorial missions.			"

												The Good , The Bad and The Ugly best describes this game.It's visuals ( which are great imo ) are unique and attractive. Huge explorable lands with varying weather effects and day+night cycles.Magic / Bow / Melee combat are all pretty fun , though i'd recommend playing on hard or normal difficulty for it to feel balanced.Plenty of Mobs to fight and Loot to hoard.Character Dialogue is hilarious and refreshing though not in a bad way.While this game isn't for everyone if you're the type of person that can over look a few problems then this is worth a play through especially if you enjoyed the Risen + Gothic Series. A history of being plagued by bugs and problems doesn't make it a bad game.  "

												Don't buy it right now. I bought it out of hype because of the previous risen games but the combat feels even more fixated than before. Though the path the true gothic devs went into  with the story/characters/graphics is great and I like the health system a lot. The combat is however tediously boring due to the somewhat buggy and dodgy tactics you need to 'cheat' yourself with to kill all the enemies in the exact same way. After both using a controller and mouse/keyboard I didn't felt like hurting my hand for too much longer.  My advice, pick it up at a steep sale or wait for a combat overhaul mod, as I'm going to do the last.			"

												If you're thinking of getting this game wait until its on sale. It is hard to recommend this game to people simply because of all the things you have to look past in order to enjoy it. The voice acting is hit or miss (and when it's miss its a HUGE miss), some character models specifically female characters) look really weird and poorly made, and the first couple of hours are just a huge tutorial filled with horribly boring quests, like ""kill the molerats invading my farm"" and ""Bring me some mead"" and ""collect some iron bolettes"". The strange tradition in RPGs to start the player out doing menial tasks for other people, like the quests referenced above, is super over-done and desperately needs to be retired for something more meaningful and fun in the beginning of a game. This is especially true when the trailer for said game shows a bunch of awesome monsters to fight but only after you go through hours of ""go fetch me this"" and ""kill these rats!"" quests. The Witcher 2 did this great by starting out with that badass castle siege pretty early on. Another RPG to have a great opening was Skyrim where once you got to the first village of Riverwood, you had the ability to begin a quest that sends you through a dungeon filled with bandits and draugr, AND ended with you seeing your first wordwall. Through all the horribly played out beginning quests and the god-awful voice acting and modeling, I'd give Arcania maybe a 6/10 at best.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. The plot direction is definitely interesting but the gameplay really lacks. The fast travel mechanic is so useless that it may as well not exist, and the combat is so repetitive and badly balanced. You know that you may as well never bother using magic because melee combat will always be more effective unless you flesh out your skill tree COMPLETELY on magic. I really wanted to finish the story but I got bored with all the wasting time in between plot points.			"

												Just finished both Arcania and Fall of Setarrif.  My times were 36 hrs  and 7 hrs. I think most folks could finish in under 30 for the main game and probably 5 to 7 for the Fall of Setarrif. Arcania ends in a cliffhanger, but the story comes to a true end in the Fall of Setarrif. I enjoyed the story and found the ending, and end battle pretty epic. I thought the end battle in Arcania was not very good, but at the end of Setarrif things heat up nicely. I was glad I came prepared although I would have leveled up my skills differently.There were some graphic glitches and one really annoying game breaker after a boss battle about a third through Arcania. I had to go on the forums to get the solution to that issue. Also, you also see the same faces over and over. But there is also some beautiful scenery in the game. Really good for a game from 2010.I liked the hero of the game. He starts as a village playboy, but his character grows through the game. The leveling up is kind of simple, but I enjoyed seeing the effects of increasing my skills and gear. The music is well done. A very good orchestra and choir were used. Added a great deal to the atmosphere of the game. So I would recommend. You should play both to the get the full story.			"

												Dies ist keine Empfehlung, weil dies Spiel einfach nur eine Gurke ist.Viele Jahre haben PB uns glücklich gemacht mit der Gothic-Reihe.Ich erinnere nur an Gothic 1 und Gothic 2 mit dem tollen Addon ""Die Nacht des Raben.""Was haben wir gespielt..am Tag, in der Nacht..uns ergötzt an den  witzigen Dialogen und an den abwechslungsreichen Begegnungen, die der namenlose Held so gemacht hat in der Minenkolonie, Korinis usw.Die Gothic-Reihe war berühmt für ihr tolles Gamelay, die schöne ""Open-World""-Präsentation und den Handlungsfreiraum, den man bis zum letzten auskosten konnte.Es war dieser bestimme ""Flair"", der mich Gothic lieben lis, sogar den dritten Teil, der gottseidank eines tollen Communitypatches auch gut spiel war (wurde).Jetzt kommt Gothic 4.Was soll das?Lieblose Schlauchlevel...gehirngelähmte Story, seichte Quests aka ""Bring mir zwei von dem...hol diesundjenes aus x"" und ähnliche anspruchslose Kapriolen.Mich ärgert es, dass Gothic draufsteht und kein...nein KEIN Gothic drin ist.Dies Spiel hat mit Gothic soviel zu tun wie ein Ameisenbär mit roter Grütze.Dies Spiel ist kein Gothic und das ist auch das Kernelement, doch damit nicht genug.Das Spiel ist eine Verhöhnung an den RPG-Sektor, besticht es doch mit zahlreichen technischen Schwächen und einem lächerlichen Charaktersystem.Dies Arcania ist unsympathisch und der Held ist mir völlig egal.Nein sorry.Selbst gesondert betrachtet ist es ein sehr mittelmäiges Spiel, darüber kann auch die recht hübsche Grafik nicht hinwegmogeln.Daher kurz und knapp:Nicht kaufen!Gezeichnet: Ein enttäuschter Gothic-Fan.

												Arcania: Gothic 4 is the next installment in a franchise of RPG games similarly titled products, but is anything but similar in gameplay and storytelling. I was initially enticed by the fact that this would be another great product from the brand but is anything but.Pros:+ Really easy combat?Cons:- Really easy combat.- No quest markers - Exploration is very limited and linear, only opens at certain trigger points in the game- Bland unmemorable dialogue and characters- Unresolved ending and nonsensical - Lack of character customization- No choices as to where the game goesAs you can see, the game has many more cons than it has pros. When it come to combat, it's laughably easy. Even on harder difficulty settings. Quests are boring and unnecessarily difficult to understand, where they point you in a direction and you're left to figure the rest out. There's certain trigger points for quests that will unlock the portion in the game in which you can finish the quest, but not before. Which means you could spend a good hour or so exploring the entire map, only to go accept the quest and have to re-explore it again. When it comes to the map, it isn't so open world as they make it out to be, as you have to complete one tiny area before you can continue to the next. And even then, you're unable to re-explore past areas. NPC's have a very rehashed feel to them and lacks customization. When it comes to the main character you're left with a boring, poorly voice acted, very unmoving character that just doesn't help make you feel immersed into the game world.TL;DR:2/10Pointless RPG in a great franchise. Too many flaws to recommend this higher than a 2.			"

												Let me start off by saying that i didn't buy this game when the game came out nor did i really buy it, i bought the gothic bundle which contained gothic 1+2 night of the raven+3+ 3 expansion + 4 + 4 DLC. I happen to be a big fan of the gothic series and played 1+2+2 notr till the end. when 3 came out i tried it but i felt like the game i once loved had changed beyond recognition. when i heard they were making a 4th i was at first excited because i thought that this was a chance for the series to rewrite it's wrongs. but instead of going back to the old concept of a good rpg with unique elements and a good setting/storyline it has become maybe the most generic RPG game ever with horrible voice-""acting"", unlikeable characters, ugly graphics and a HUD and UI to puke at. The voice acting sounds completely unconvincing and makes you feel like all the characters are cardboard cutouts. The female interrest of the (start)game is both annoying and a useless plot device. All the characters look ""decent"" as long as you don't look at them. once you get into a conversation with them their weird blob faces come to light and show how horrible the faces look, combined with the voice-acting it doesn't make any of the conversations you have with the NPC's a good experience and sucks you right out of the game, hence i skipped literally ALL the dialogue in the game. The before skillpoint system from gothic 1+2+3 seemed to be not ""of this time anymore"" since they threw that idea out of the window for a new fresh... aged system that even an MMORPG would laugh at. the skill window is ugly, unfinished and rightdown insulting to the series. there are no special talents for hunting, no different fight styles like two-handed, sword/shield or dual wielding. just 2 bars, one for flurries and one for heavy attacks. The active HUD also is VERY aged and doesn't stand up. it's big, gets in the way and is ugly and takes away immersion and focus.I obviously didn't play much of this game and i intend to keep it that way. 2-3 hours of this game have shown me enouth to know to stay away from this game. some may say that this game has a better story the longer you play it but i really doubt that.so it gets down to this: if you can look aside ALL the flaws of the game, you basicly have a stripped down singleplayer MMORPG with less depth and a combat system so dumbed down that they actually reached a new low. then this game is absolutely for you. If  however you're looking for an intriguing RPG that is immersive and stands out from the rest, look further because this is not that kind of game.			"

												First of all...the price! It's not worth it's 35 euros/whatever currency. It's best you buy the whole gothic collection when it's on sale.I am 26 hours in and i am only in the third zone of the continent so it's long enough to be an rpg.Pro: -It is GOTHIC, it has Diego, Gorn, same mobs with more variety and different look(stronger), atmosphere, mistry.-The graphics are nice, weather system that changes often...so you will hate running in the rain and love fighting in the sun.-The main character is likeable and all the other characters have good dialogue with some funny lines, they do have glitches and funny voices but it's ok-Humor, more indirect, sometimes it hits you: Ex: Orcs do dirty deal and clean deal, ""Hahahaha, my name?"" hahhaha""-Items, you have choices to make since they have more atributes and some work together making you more deadly and specialised.-World building...damn is this good, all gothic games have good world building but this one has a lot of heart into it, the houses, the cities, the villages, the farms...sometimes i wish i could live there(with internet).-Useless interactible gothic stuff like beds, anvils, campfires-Everything is streamlined, this can be bad but it makes exploring and stealing(you open chests and no one cares) stuff take less time....so i will put it as a good thing since exploration is enjoyable but not as long- Combat: it's a lot more active and really needs your attention, enemies change names to be relevant the whole game. It's really a good change BUT i play on GOTHIC and it still feels easy. So you really need to play on hard difficulties.Good pacing: first island is a tutorial, second zone is an extended tutorial, you fight some bandits and advance to big insects, some cultists, a lot of goblins. I really hated how you started gothic 3 killing orcs, it threw away the difficulty scale of enemies. Here you fight orcs in the third zone but you have real armor/weapons and they are weaker because they are lazy slackers, no armor, no training and they are not vicious.Cons: - I can't say that something bothered me that much, i mean this is gothic 4, it has  the same problems as the other. I don't know if it was patched but now it's a great game. I will still mention them but they don't affect the game that much-Glitches, dialogue glitches, terrain glitches....sometimes the game seems unpolished, like it was made and not checked again.- Combat can be unbalanced and you can cheat with range weapons. I play only on gothic difficulty and i use all 3 weapon types(ranged, magic and melee).Some enemies can be frustrating in groups but they were made that way....still, i ran a lot from wild groups of animals.-Npc...some look the same, others are generic, sometimes it looks like they just made 2-3 types and put them all around.-Fewer quests, you can still explore and find a quest or two but it really looks streamlined, you have to explore or else the game is a lot shorter-Some quests seem useless, like gathering 30 pieces of a certain thing...don't know if i will ever do it-It's not really a sandbox, it's very scripted, you go forward, the maps are blocked by quests and i don't see any reason to return after you do them.My final note is 7/10 for gothic fans and 6/10 for the others. But it gets my Diamond seal of approval....it's a clasic game, you can love it and it's ageless. Even with all it's glitches and balance issues......belive me, a lot of modern rpg suck really bad and compared to this game....they look like rejected game projects:) "

												Where should I start... Dear fans of Gothic serie, this franchise died with the moment this title got released. I's painfuly linear. It has lost all of its charm. I was really happy when I've finally finished, but not for a good reason. I recomend Risen, that took everything good from Gothic, instead of this thing.			"

												As a fan of Gothic series, I have figured out that this game (Arcania: Gothic 4) is incredibly worse than standard Gothic experience. I've played all of other titles of Gothic series, and I am thinking that the series was losing blood just after the first game. The first game was a masterpiece, and Gothic II was only clinging on the first game's astonishment. Third game was also behind the standarts. And fourth game was... lower than that. The RPG elements of the game consists of just about the character development and thats all. There were no dialogues, no stealing stuff, in the end no role play stuff. Also there was no story at all. We (the proantagonist) only follow some figures' suggestions. If I couldn't continue on my own and register for a guild (for example Monestary) that what is there to play? If u were Gothic fan u can play this game, only 2 or 3 hours I guess. You could smile when u see some familiar faces from earlier games and that's all you gonna get. If you are just searching a lousy RPG game, then may be you could play a few hours more.			"

												I haven't finished the game, there it is.But this game is terrible, not because it's the worst in the gothic series (which it is). But because nothing seems completed.- Voice acting: Terrible (Same applies to the other gothic games though)- Rpg aspect: Not present, it's an Action(HA!) adventure game, hack'n'slash edition, the click mousebutton 1 repeatedly to win way.- Movement in the world: Terrible, not much to say, feels really heavy, lot's of terrain that you can't pass through or jump over, even though your jumps seem like theres very low gravity.- Graphics: Very glitchy and not pretty at all even for a 2010 game.- Key mapping/controls: mediocre, if everything else had been allright it would't have been a problem.All in all its not even a decent game, i know the standard was different in 2010 but even back then this was bad.Unless you are a masochistic fanatic it's not worth either your time or money.

												I don't feel this game deserves all the hate that it receives but I will admit that it is objectively a bad game. With that, you can still find some enjoyability and I just-barely recommend it for at least one playthrough if you've beaten your other action RPGs. Some quick thoughts after beating it...Pros: *Good visuals. *Easy to pick up and learn.*Ability to choose between melee, archery, or mage paths.*Main voice actor does a decent job.*Story is just interesting enough to keep you interested at times.Cons: *Most of the voice actors are garbage. *Character development is really shallow.*Pace of the game is agonizingly slow at times if you explore everywhere. *Story is a fairly typical revenge story. A shepherd becomes a god (figuratively). *Linear game progression. (This didn't realy bother me, though)*Combat is fairly basic. Ranged playstyles are basically easy mode while melee can have a really hard time on the harder difficulties. Conclusion: If it's on sale, give it a shot. You can rush it if you like. If you focus on the experience and don't try to find things to hate, you may even like it a little bit.			"

												Well, how to start. The game begins in a good way, a good cinematic with a plot and some solid lore behind.Then you see yourself and some lame dialogues appear...then more lame dialogues and boring quests....then a crappy ""item"" system with no options or few options...but ok. Then the lvling system...oh my.. just because you have to click to advance lvl and put points on a 7 skill tree that doenst make you a RPG man. There is no skills, nothing, just plain and simple hack slash, ""skills"" are earned and auto-used on hackslash, which means there are no skills.But ok, the plot seems good. Your life ruined, vengance, a mad king...but wait....you advance, advance and..the plot dissipates.Then something cool appear(no spoilers) and you think ""ok, lets try to finish""....well, waste of timeGameplay 4 of 10Mechanics 2 of 10Graphics 7 of 10Sound 8 of 10OST 8 of 10Plot 5 of 10Overall 5.5 of 10Dont lose time, there are better stuff from this genre.

												Not at all a legitimate part of the 'Gothic' series. Terrible story, awful narrative and devoid of any profound similarity or entertainment value had with the games developed by Piranha Bytes. Takes all the charm and rewarding qualities that made 'Gothic' unique and turns it into a casual hack-and-slash.The best example of how they screwed this game up is... In the other games you get skill points which you use with skill trainers to teach you how to be and do what you want. With magic, especially, it's difficult to acquire because you have to get accepted into the mage's guild/monastery before you learn how to use magic. So you're taught to save your skill points until you can become a mage, if that's the way you want to go. Making becoming a mage an actual ACHIEVEMENT and something difficult to pull off. But it's the most powerful class in the game(s) because the fireball ends up being able to one-hit-kill. It's an incredibly rewarding feeling.In this game? At level 4 you can use magic. No skill trainers. Just a character screen and you click the little plus sign.And magic is completely meaningless.Without putting any points into any skills, you can be waving a massive sword around wiping out mobs like there's no tomorrow. Again, you originally needed to train to be able to use large weapons. Again, it was an achievement to get that.It goes to show how some publishers (and new developers working with an old IP) don't comprehend what gave these games their dedicated fan-base			"

												It's kinda hard to write about this game. I bought Gothic when it came out originally, it ran badly on my pc back then but i loved the environment, characters, quests, everything, when Gothic 2 came out it again ran kinda badly on my pc (the teleport rune to the port brough all PCs down) and Gothic 3 was too much for a small team and a publisher that released a game to early. After that we had an add-on developed by somebody in india and a new game by Spellbound. That company never made an RPG, being more famous for their Airline Tycoon game as well as Desperados and Robin Hood, Tycoon and Strategy games, they had no experience with RPGs and it shows.Even if you remove the ""Gothic!"" stigma from the game (and that's hard considering you still encounter the same characters and they sometimes (like Lester) act like they know you from long before) you have a very mediocre ""by the numbers"" rpg with the same old ""go there and get this"" and ""go there and kill this guy"" quests, with caves that usually go in a circle with the objective to get being right there at the start high above on a ledge.Gothic always also had a world that was crafted with unique places, surprises, even up to Gothic 3, there were lots of great places, no town looked the same, there was a lot to discover and Arcania fails in all categories. There's no open world, just small places/islands you work your way through, caves follow the same ""run in a circle"" motion mostly, it's even worse than in Skyrim.The AI is non existant either. Back even in the first Gothic if you draw your sword all NPCs reacted telling you to put down your weapon and when you dragged a whole lot of enemies behind you, NPCs would come to your aid, fighting them. That was in 2001. A decade later we have Arcania were nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥ about what is going on. You can lure monsters to a town and nobody cares. You can fight (mild spoiler) an orc boss with 6 orcs sitting close by and thow orcs never care, they just sit there without any animation. In the Gothic games when you looted a chest, when you tried to rob somebody, when you anything, the npc's reacted, they acted and reacted depending on their nature and how they thought what was right or wrong. Arcania is a linear, easy (even on the highest difficulty setting that laughably is called ""Gothic"") game that more resembles Diablo 2 than Gothic. Go there, kill that, the Quests you fullfill easily along the way since most of the time you act in a bubble of a worl and not an ""open world"" like Gothic 3. Fighting is also equally bad. Roll around, strike, roll, hit, roll, hit, or load up your big hit to make some big damage. There's nothing that makes fighting challenging or interesting. Enemies just attack you, run into you and again, Gothic 1 made that better, the blood flies in gothic 1 would fly around you and hit you, in Arcania they fly in one place and shoot something at you that doesn't do a lot of damage. You also level up to fast, enemies level with you (in Gothic 1-2 there wer areas you only could enter after a certain level, making the whole ""exploring"" worthwhile) and after you become a master you breeze through the game at ease. The only 2 good things and really only good not exceptional or awesome are the graphics (steam version has a lot of problems though) and the music which tries to recreate old gothic themes and it sounds kinda nice but it's nowhere near Kai Rosenkranz' stuff for Gothic 1-3 and the Risen games.

												Is it ""Gothic 4: Arcania"" or ""Arcania: Gothic 4""? I never was sure about that. Nominally it is the fourth game of my much-beloved Gothic series, albeit the first title not developed by the originating studio, Piranha Bytes, and instead created by Spellbound Entertainment, creators of such excellent games as Airline Tycoon and Helldorado. Anyway, Gothic 4 nee ArcaniA got a lot of flak for not being true to the franchise and, let's be frank, quite fairly so. Unlike it predecessors, Gothic 4 is a disturbingly linear game, with the player led by hand from one encounter to the next with almost no opportunity to explore or follow his own path. There is a distinct lack in the number of sub-quests, and the few that do exist rarely required me to travel far off the beaten path. The combat system has been streamlined to the point of idiocy; there's was little need for tactics or skill on my part when I could just walk up to the bad guy and click on him a few times until he fell over dead. The combat was so unchallenging that I almost never used healing potions or spells; there just wasn't any point.There isn't much in the way of a story either; a bad guy kills my lady-love and I'm off for revenge. There might have been more emotional commitment on my part if I had known her for more than five minutes before her untimely death, or if she had spoken more than ten lines to me. The other characters are similarly flat and faceless; the few that show a glimmer of personality only do so because I had met them before in previous games and knew them from those adventures. And just when the story hits its climax, I kill the big bad and get dumped to the main menu with nary an epilogue. And yet, and yet... In many areas, the game does have the FEEL of a Gothic game. It certainly has the look down pat, with its lush forests, thick-body characters and crumbling, dark-ages buildings. The attitude of the main character is wonderfully snarky, just like in the previous titles and while it never fully expands on it, there are hints of the grey-on-grey morality that made the earlier games so much fun. It is so obviously a game that was rushed-to-release - in fact, there is a whole huge section of the map that was inexplicably and obviously cut out - and I can't help but feel that, given enough time, Spellbound might have recaptured the magic of the first three games. It is so temptingly close to the solid gameplay I expect from the franchise that I kept at it until I completed the game, but sadly disappoints in the end.  "

												This is a great game. Yes there are some things you'll need to manually adjust in your configuration folder before you play but once you do you'll be running highest settings on any modern none gaming rig with no lag or any crashing. Honestly I havent experienced anything other than lag until I did my fix(Yay no lag XD).Who ever says they don't care for the graphics they are insane. The characters faces are my ONLY ISSUE so far. The environment is beautiful and feels real. Grass and trees sway in the wind the sun shines in bits through the trees casting fantastic shadows that overlap very well with alternate lighting and works great with other shadows. There's a day and night cycle/weather system and creatures that aren't blind and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so there's another plus.It is it's own story so what it's not some fast paced over the top madness some may be use to (COD Players) but the pace allows me to craft forage and fight where im not being overwhelmed meaning I get to enjoy the game and feel like im in a real adventure. Seriously I really did think at several points that I'd get some cliche' nonsense missions that just turn to your character not even dignifying the quest by basically telling the npc to ♥♥♥♥ off lol (not in those words[I wish]).The combat is like if twoworlds wasn't terrible and clunky and was refined instead of a rushed mess. (Twoworlds had a better spell system)I got this in a bundle awhile back and I'd say wait for a sale. I don't really see paying anything more than 10 for the game despite the joys I'm experiencing. I say this because I find there is a major combat flaw that maybe I'm just not noticing but the keyboard controls don't have a lock on button. The dodge works great until large monsters rush you so being able to strafe i combat would be nice. The Gamepad has it but you'd still have to use a keyboard and mouse for your hotkeys and inventory management more less defeating the purpose.so far a strong 7/10AMD A10 Quad-Core Laptop Integrated GPU			"

												I´ve played the old Gothics and loved them. This title is a little bit tricky. You can´t compare it to the roleplayness of the older ones. Especially because you can´t interact with obvious things with obvious effects. I know, I know, there´s a setting, where you can enable or dissable roleplay element, like cooking or ""sleeping"" but it doesn´t give you effects. For example you can´t skip the night in a bed. Or regenerate health in a bed. i don´t actually know why this is not possible, because it´s even possible in the older ones. Most people be like: Ok i jump ingame, set difficulty to normal and maybe enjoy something. But that´s wrong. In my opinion you can only play on hard or gothic (very hard). Easy: Is just you are running through the world and killing Undeads with a kitchen knife. On normal it´s a little bit harder but still not a good experience. On hard it´s almost perfect. It´s not unfair, but not too easy. It´s a challenge. For example you can easily be killed by 6 or more Bloodflies. I´m almost at 100 health and have the best equipment you can get for this chapter of the world and it´s the perfect difficulty. ""Gothic"" is for the experienced player. But with ""experienced"" I don´t mean someone who played the older Gothics. This is far away from being a ""real"" gothic. You could compare this to Risen 2/3. This difficulty would be ok, but in my opinion it´s ridiculos how they don´t stop the attacking-chain (infinite combined attacks) Now something about the world. Now to the world. If you played the older Gothics, you most likely think it´s an open-worldgame, too. Wrong. It hasn´t an open world. You have one great island, where you fight from chapter to chapter. For example you can´t get from the beginning to the place where the game should end. But it´s not so bad, because you have a really good teleporting-system. No, sorry I was joking. The teleport system is useless. Imagine. You have points A, B, C and D. all of those places have a teleporter, which can be unlocked by just going to it and being near to it. You want from point A to point D. It´s not like you can teleport there, naaaaaah. You need to go to teleporter A, you teleport to teleporter B, you walk all the way through the island to teleporter C, to teleport to the final teleporter D. That´s how the system works. You basically have 2 connected teleporters where you can teleport between. So it could be a disaster. If you forgot something at the beginning, like a Tomb with a piece of an antique rune. You need to get 30 (not sure) of this to get this rune. And with this teleporting system, I only have one advice: NEVER forget about something. NEVER. Ok, that where many negative aspects of the game. Is it still good? Yes. I play it for like the 3rd time and I still enjoy it. Oh, and i have something to say to all the mages: The magic-system is crap. You only have 3 spells (lightning, fire and ice). You can upgrade them to do more damage and have a bigger range, but it´s a shame compared to the older gothics. There are some scrolls, but they are exactly the same thing, as you can learn. Just a little bit better. Maybe. You can´t summon a rain of fire or a huge demon. Not with ArcaniA. I still enjoy this game, so i rate 7/10 points. Because it´s not actually that bad. The landscapes are beautyful. It´s just a nobrainer to play sometimes. But it also have contra-aspects. (I´m sorry for my bad english, if I did some grammatic mistakes)			"

												Moderately Acceptable Spin-offAt first, you can't tell if this is a direct successor of the Gothic games, because some things point to that (the intro cinematic) or if it's something else completely, as other things go against everything that the Gothic series was known for (the gameplay, the skill progression).Then you realise that it grows on you, like a scratchy beard that eventually becomes the second most played with part of your body. You see or hear about important characters that were present in each Gothic game so far and there are iconic monsters to fight with as well (damned scavangers!). You see a lot of bugs, so that helps too. You get used to the fact that everything is so much easier to do: - Fighting and low HP? Just press your hotkey for the Health Potion and your combat isn't stopped; hell, sometimes you don't even see the character's animation for drinking, but at least you don't get killed by a freakin' wolf pack anymore!- Reaching a new level and need to get new skills? Just bring up the Skills menu and bask in the glory of adding those 3 new learning points wherever you wish, even while fighting! Who cares how you suddenly learned how to cast a fireball after you finished off a scavanger and the rest of his pack is now chasing you?- Learned how to brew a new potion or how to craft a new sword? No need for an alchemist's bench or anvils, go ahead bring up the damned crafting menu and make everything you want.It's not really a Gothic game. It's not even a good RPG game. But if you want to get a few more Gothic like moments out of anything, this is the best option you may have.			"

												My first time, to give a thumps down.This game is not recommended, and I am sorry to say so, becouse I acually liked some aspects of the game, and some of the lore in the game were really cool, but the games bad sides overrule the good, I will tell you some of the bad and good sides.Good:Some of the only good parts about this game is it`s atmosphere. At times the game gives us some cool locations, to look at. You can run around to explore more of the locations, and maybe find some secrets. Some of the lore parts are very cool like the three mages of power there are in a three, I really liked them.Bad:There are many bad aspects of this game if you ask me. I will take you trough some of them. Loctations:Didn`t I just say the locations had some good atmosphere? Yes and they have that, but it`s more of the boundaries of the game that bothers me. You have to go to special locations throughout the game, and when you get to them, you will feel that exploration feeling. The sad part is that the game feelt really lockt to me. I knew I could explore, but there were so little to explore, and the game makes you take it`s own route so fast, that you feel you have no freedom at all.Gameplay:The game is a RPG and it could easily be called a hack and slash, even though you also have bow and arrows. The gameplay is very simple, hit, block, avoid and it get`s boring fast. I don`t say simplisiti is bad, but this game purly used, what it could have used of diffrent tools, to make the combat more exating. You are constantly avoding enemys, only beocuse you will not bother to kill them, and that is a minus in my book, if you don`t wanna play the game, what`s then even the point? You can change gear and weapons throughtout the game, which is nice, but would it be to much to ask that the gear would change your appearance? You only change appearance a few times in the game, which is a bid wierd for a RPG, you wanna get the feeling that you got something out of the game all the time, but again the game falls flat on that part.Characters: I bounded to none of the characters in this game, not even the main character! I found the main character to be annoying, I did not feel free to answer anything in the game, my character would always be an annoying brat, who would be an idiot towards nearlly everybody in the game. I really hated the main character, but I am stuck with him, becouse he IS the main character. No other character said me anything, and when I finally found a character I liked, the games ""stick to the story"" acpect, made me leave the character and never see him again, which makes you forget them very fast. Bosses:I have to shortly talk about the bosses. All the bosses in the game, has a big lead up to them, which is good. You are hyped to fight them, but then something happens. Since the gameplay is so easy, the bosses are very simelar, and there are few changes to them. The most major changes is one of them can fly, and some can shot spells, and have minions. The first couple of bosses is some kind of hard, and one of the last bosses is a nightmare (the guy that burns down your city, I will get back to him). But the last boss was so anticlimatic, that I feelt an incompleted feeling inside, when I killed it. The story:This is the part I feelt the most angry about. For all RPG`s it is important to have a interasting story, so you can keep your player intertainted, and want him to search for more story, in order to experince how it all hangs together. But this game delivers a really wierd thing, I have never treyd before. The game start by telling you an evil demon of some sort, have sent out more demons in the world of Arcania, then you play as a king, who you then find out has become curopted by the demons. Then your story start, and you are a person that have been washed up on a beach. In the beginning you are about to marry your girlfriend, and that starts a big tutorial to learn you all the basics, then you visit some witch who teels you, you are destent to do great things, and then your city is on fire! Everyone in the city is killed, even your girlfriend (which were one of the characters I liked). This makes you as the player want to revenge her, but then it start to go down hill. And that is wierd for me, I liked the story to begin with, and the it change into this:After this you take to a small island, and safes a fortress, goes to a big city, and goes to another big city, which has been corupted, you are in a three world and at some monks at a time. Sounds like a mess? It should becouse it is, the story takes such a big U-turn, and that U-turn curves at the same time. All of a sudden you forgot about your girlfriend and city. Even after you kill the guy that are resonsible for it. The problem with this is that none of the storys really hang togehter. It`s like eleven different persons wrote each part of the story and then put them all togehter.The sidequests in this game is boring, and is mostly collecterthons which is normal for a RPG by now. I liked a treasure hunt sidequest a lot though, it was something different, and a big relief for the repetetive gameplay.The ending is were I started to yell at the screen. It makes a cliffhanger. Normally I actually have nothing agains cliffhangers. But in order to make a cliffhanger, you must tie up all lose ends, from the movie/game you are playing/watching. And the game dose that, but in such a unsatesfieng way, that I did not understand what the cliffhanger meant. Or what would happend next.The game get`s a thumps down. Becouse of all the bad things I have said about it. It was a big dissapointment. 3 out of 10			"

												I love the Gothic series, so due to the years of backlash and hatred this entry has received from fans, it's taken me a while to muster up the courage to play it. My first impressions of it were that a lot of the poor reviews were exaggerated. The combat system is fairly intuitive, the graphics are nice, and it definitely has that Gothic feel to the world and gameplay.After a couple of hours though, I understand where the complaints are coming from. First of all, it isn't an open world game. It's extremely linear, and the quests are pretty boring. The voice acting is fairly rough, and the cutscenes are poorly constructed. It feels like a semi-complete experience, overall. The worst part for me was not being able to massacre the NPCs like in the original games. Seriously, wtf?I'm going to recommend this to Gothic series fans only, even though most of them end up hating and resenting it. There's no help for most of us (like myself) but to scratch that itch of curiosity surrounding it, and it's not to say that absolutely everything in the game was done horribly. Overall, it's definitely a disappointing experience for fans of the series, but it's worth a bit of experimenting if you can get it for a cheap price. The rest of you will want to steer clear.			"

												I enjoyed the ever loving hell outta this game. First off it has some God awful design, it has repeating NPCs every three characters you come across,  it's as linear as I've ever seen a rpg, and its so stupidly charming it makes me chuckle. I like the people in this world, I like how the protagonist gets sick and tired of helping out ever moron out there. It's what I imagine a game to be like when  A group of the most talented developers on earth get forced to do something on a  shoestring budget. That soundtrack however, is just fantastic.  this game is far far better than the risen games, it's simplistic to be sure, but deep enough to get your money's worth, and entertaining enough to pay twice what they're asking for.   I bought this game a few years back on the 360, beat it and had a blast with it. When I found it on steam, figured why not give it another go?  I'm glad I did, its fun to see it all again (only with a much better coat of paint) and have found that it runs fairly well on any modern hardware.			"

												Far away the best of the gothic series. I love this Gothic 4. Furthermore, I would prefer more than 3 skills points in every level. I think five is enough. I hate one thing, that is in story line. I don't like that, the nameless hero doesn't know his old friends. I am talking about Diego, Gorn, Lester, Milten. They past 3 gothic games series together as best friends and all together played important role to the MAIN STORY OF THE 3 GAMES. Now they don't EVEN know each other. I was surprised that he didn't know them. Gamers of Gothic were waiting something like the big meet or something like ""where you've been, we lost each other"" or ""what did you do in the meantime"" and stuff. Not like this. For me, this is big mistake from the story creators. Gothic game fans will understand my critic. For the others I believe is one of the perfect games.but anyway 9/10, I recommend this game!!			"

												A very average game! Nothing is really good an nothing is really bad. If you want a very basic 3rd person rpg where you run around killing things with the most basic magic and weapons, this is the game you want! But belive me when i say that there isnt a single epic moment in this game. It is all very static with a start and finish with barely any changes. So you wont miss out on anything if you do not buy this game. Its a solid rpg adventure that wont leave you any good memories but it works great if you're just bored and want something to do.			"

Whene the npc starts to say ""What most I do for you to get on my way "" The game kinda speaks for it self. In gotic3 u had a big open world and choises to make.

Went past a gate into a vally. but its a point of no retur so the only way to get back was to move forward. Thats ok so I ran.

												Even though I selected that I would recommend this game, I only did so because there is not a ""maybe"" or ""undecided"" option and saying no would not be exxactly what I am feeling.To the absolute Gothic series fan, looking for the continuation of the original storyline, the game would be a torture to play and a let down from the getgo. As for those that are interested to see how the world of gothic turned out after Gothic 3 and our original nameless hero, well this game is for you. Though the cinematics were moionless cartoon images after a certain point, the story was nonetheless acceptable and I did play through the whole game. Having said that, the story was pretty straight forward and no surprises or twists along the way. All in all, the story could have been more intriguing. I'd say it would get a 5 out of 10 overall for the story line.As for the gameplay, I felt it was lacking compared to other RPG games that were released during and even prior to Arcania's release with respect to NPC interactions (or lack thereof), non-combatant NPCs and absolute lack of assistance from NPCs (with respect to reality of their responses; imagine a swampshark popping out of the ground and an NPC just standing there like nothing happened...), conversation/dialogue options with the NPCs that you can communicate with (lacking) and lack of directions at certain points in the game. Let's not forget the almost total uselessness of sneaking.As for what was better, graphics were good (nothing that will blow you out of the water but totally a new level (more like 10) above that of Gothic 3), bugs were much much fewer than any of the previous Gothic games too, which was a nice change... :) I enjoyed crafting, though it could have been much improved (but wasn't, even in the add-on). In summary, this game is not for everyone. For those interested to see how the change in devs changed the views on the events after Gothic 3, OK game. Grab it during a sale. As for those that wanted to see the events as they should have been had the original devs continued working with this publisher; total let down and poor game that is not worth buying even duting a sale.

												How would you like to see a combination between Fable [old school first game] and Elder Scrolls?Gothic 4 - Arcania is pretty much the thin line that unites these 2 ideas.I gotta say I have never had experienced the whole franchise before, only tried a bit of Gothic 3 after a friend told me about it [and wasn't bad at all].Game was out around Oct 2010, which kinda made me expect a tinny bit better optimization regarding a few details than it had..[Story]The story is intriguing at start and in the end. Buuut after having played a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of games in my age, can't say I had my eyes popped. But it was cute.A few side quests reveal a few more details to you and some fun points regarding what's going on.I don't know if it is connected with the previous games but it stands alone not leaving me with major questions... Well.. except the final seconds of the cinematic at the end of the game, wasn't sure what I saw and what it meant. [*cough* probably leaving space for a sequel *cough*]In average it's a cool story to be told, there's much drama script-wise which adds to the suspense but you can say that most of it gets pretty much expected after a point.It's balanced, not too original.Also RPG-wise it's ok, though they could add a few elements regarding romance or key characters to connect more with your character and not have just one super hero that kills and burns and stabs and slashes through everything just to see what's going on afterwards. I mean this isn't the 00s any more guys come on.. [Gameplay]The gameplay is pretty linear but seeing it from an open minded point of view it didn't matter.And I mean linear because you are indeed in an open world [and a pretty nice one actually] environment, but you cannot go everywhere you want unless you unlock the area through your main quests. Unfortunatelly you cannot climb mountains and you drawn the moment you step into water [facepalming a bit] so when you reach a bridge or a gate, you cannot pass it unless you get the key or some official letter to show to the guard in order to go pass it.Lot's of quests to do, many RPG elements like tons of items, a crafting system, gathering materials from herbs, teeth and meat from animals to ores from mines.Leveling system with a not too complicated [and actually maybe too simple] skills tree.3 basic classes to go through, warrior, ranger, mage. Some nice animations to attack, block, evade etc.Not really bad but then again too easily to be repetitive as hell and make you a bit bored after a long while.Few bugs to notice, though my weak CPU cannot go without noticing some silly moments like snaps from frames that show my character in a model position [open arms and legs frozen half gear on] due to loading, or stupid unnnatural dialogue moments due to the way the data is loading..[Graphics]They are good for a 2010 game. Sweet open world filled with nature, forests, caves, dungeons, lakes, swamps, mountains etc..People are nicely designed, though not really pretty faces. Maybe it's ok for being realistic, but sometimes I felt like I'd kill to see a pretty woman's face in there.Armor and weapons are detailed and sweetly done, you can also have various effects with a few magical items.Very nice weather system, animated nature depending how strong the winds are, rain with realistic sound and thunders and water that you can actually see the water dynamics even on your own armor [something not many games had achieved at that time]. Also has a night and day cycle, pretty neat when you see people going to sleep, then waking up to do their work or keep their shop.[Music]Very nice music. Pretty well done and balanced. Suits every moment in the game. I was surprised that I felt like going through some sort of Elder Scrolls game here and then.[Sound]I have to mention that sound is realistic. Not just due to good environmental effects, but for a 2010 game noticing a realistic difference of noice and sounds betwee being out in the wild and in a town, or between being ouside or inside a house is something worth appreciating.[Characters]I was not really satisfied by the characters in the game.I mean, they are all done very nicely, designed and animated well. But there's just that one thing, that one element missing that never helped me to connect with any of them.I never cared about whether my character was a nice guy or a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I never got sad over a few dramatic events that occurred during the game.I wasn't even noticing the change of character and his evolution during the story until some points were made by the NPCs at some times.This was a bit disappointing for me because connecting with my main character in a game is a major and very important thing when I play a game.I cannot give you examples cause I don't wanna spoil anyone, but from time to time there had been a few major events happening that really left me standing with apathy in from of my screen wishing the dialogues were a bit shorter or even skipping them so that I could go on.[Cast]The voices are ok. Seen worse. Seen better.Meeeeh. For a 2010 RPG open world mechanism they were ok.[Others details]The game had tons of exploring to do. If you are the explorer type you would enjoy going around gathering materials or collectibles.Fun fact; nothing is randomly generated. Every flower you gather, every monster you kill, they are all unique and will never respawn again. That was quite realistic for me and loved the idea.Also there were a few elements that reminded me of Fable. Starting of from a humble young man from a village, growing into a uber powerful super hero of muscle and awesomeness badassery and heavy metal while holding flaming swords and magic shields ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ass through the plot. \m/ [at some points you can see people acknowledging as a hero figure and their reactions are fun to hear]Tons of RPG elements, but not quite developed. I mean they put so much efford in everything, they could at least add a few more ideas about spells or increase the max level cap and let you try other classes since there's no free roam mode after finishing the game.Another thing; You all know me. I LOVE ROMACE in my stories. And this game had nothing at all except a small flirty idea at the intro of the game. I was like, come on is there anything to help me connect with this guy? Even the action sequence was completelly stable; explore, kill, talk to NPC, do quest, explore, kill, talk to NPC, do quest, explore....One thing I liked, since everything in the game is not unlimited or randomly spawned, being an explorer is rewarding in many aspects. For example sometimes i would first completelly explore the whole new area I unlocked and if i was done I would talk to the NPCs. That way I already had the quest items they wanted and I would farm exp instantly. Easy to get some extra skill points and make you happy for a while? Yes.Does it make sense to already be able to distinguish a quest item from the rest of the world without having taken the quest thus making the item as useful to you as a random rock on the ground? No. But i ain't even mad ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ [Average]The game is pretty good.It's hard to see through many points because there are imperfections to notice but let's not forget that the game is old.If you are a hard core RPG fan do try it out. It's sweet and give food for thought regarding game elements and tastes.If you are a person with high expectations and wants kickass high end video games. Do not buy.The game is ok. A bit above average. I'd say around 7/10.cheers			"

												First off, this isn't a Gothic game. It's Arcania. If you're expecting a Gothic game don't buy this game. It doesn't deserve the title of Gothic. This is more of an Action-Adventure rather than an RPG. Sure, it's called Gothic 4 and there are characters/story elements related to Gothic, but just don't think of it as a Gothic game and it'll be ok.With that said, it's actually not a bad game all-in-all. The story is... lets say... laughably entertaining. The combat was rather good along with very good world building. Maybe I'm a sucker for it but I felt the world building was very pretty and well done.			"

												Seems like most people are leaving negative reviews because they are comparing it to older Gothic games.  I am a newb to the Gothic series, but this game, standing alone, is AWESOME.Amazing music/sound, amazing graphics, great combat (limited magic tree), but amazing smooth control/feel to combat unlike previous Gothic games that were chunky and had some limited targeting lock that wasn't at all smooth.  Great voice acting, very good levelling as far as speed, and weapons/loot available.  Great side quests/stories.  I agree it appeals to some level of casual, but it is AMAZINGLY done. But I am judging this game as a stand alone, not as a piece in the series. For now, I can't understand why anyone would have any reason to downvote this game. It's awesome and very enjoyable. Even the loading/saving speed is very tight. You can tell this was a very well programmed/polished game.			"

												I'm not going to pretend that this game is amazing, nor am I going to re-hash the issues that everyone else has more eloquently gone over. I came into this with fresh eyes, never having played previous Gothic games. I can't even remember how I ended up owning this; likely with a coupon from a badge or something.BUT, that being said, it's not terrible. It's somewhat mediocre, standard high fantasy fodder. But it's very easy to pick up and play, it's -for the most part- nice to look at, and you could certainly do worse. If you're looking for some nice medieval aesthetic, go for it. If you're looking for something in-depth and groundbreaking, look elsewhere. Simple game for folks who aren't expecting more than what's at face value.			"

												Lets face facts, this game was a huge dissapointment for all Gothic fans looking for the next chapter in the series. It had very limited character choices, a small, incredibly linear map, and of course the combat felt like you were going to break your left mouse button. I'm not even gonna talk about the one sided characters, limited body models were every second character looked the same and the lack of sidequests. Now that's out of the way I can tell you why I enjoyed it. The first part of making this game enjoyable is by not looking at it as a Gothic game, since many claimed it ruined the franchise I just pretended that it's not a part of it. Secondly, I enjoyed the story, which was short but decent, and I liked the world's look, very polished looking. It might suffer from the dissapointment factor but once you get past it I'm sure that if you find all the good parts you can learn to like it.			"

												I loved Gothic 2. I had the non Steam disc version a few years ago and it was amazing! I got the Gothic bundle recently with hopes of playing all of them(including Risen) in order. Well, unfortunatly I cannot get Gothic 1 & 2 to work and I can't get the community patch for 3 to install.....So, I installed Gothic 4 with very low expectations. Boy oh boy was I wrong. This game is quite fun! The combat is delightful and the graphics are very pretty, I even want to try and find the soundtrack. As far as ""open world"" goes we will see... Story 7/10 Graphics 9/10 Sound 8/10 Gameplay 8/10When its on sale give this game a try! "

												While I would not consider ArcaniA a ""Gothic 4"" it is still a solid game. It gets rid of the major selling points that became big selling points for the Gothic series such as large open world exploration and comprehensive combat, skills, and tools, but ultimately wins out with the story.  I for one still eagerly anticipate a continuation, though that may not happen.			"

												As a Gothic fan, I hear so many people say this was the death of the Gothic series, yet I feel this was more closer to look and feel of the Gothic 1 & 2 then 3 was. Yes, there are some short commings as the game is pretty linear and the ending is quite abrupt without the expansion. Yet the graphics are fantastic the story gets better as the game goes on. Gameplay is simplistic, but still retains fun in battle and exploration keeps things fresh. I do recommend if you're a fan of open world rpg's giving it a shot.			"

												Pretty nice game. Not the Gothic, unfortunately. Maybe it is too simple both combat and roleplay. There is not much to explore or collect. ""Open World"" is actually linear. You cannot go somewhere unless you get permission or the key (with a next quest, of course). Worth to try, in my opinion.  "

 I have very mixed feelings.	The game has very low FPS in towns and it's not any better than the previous gothic series in all the aspects. Actually it's a down graded gothic. Still I would have enjoyed it if I hadn't so many problems with the graphics. Nothing new is introduced in the gameplay and the story is much simpler than the gothics game. Buy it only if you like a simple RPG with many (really many) quests and sub-quests such as... go there-kill x enemys-return to get the quest. Do not buy it if you are a true fan of Gothic games. you'll be dissapointed.			"

												Dark Souls - a frenetic knights & skeletons offering that puts the full emphasis of gameplay on combat, which is excellent if you have the machine to run it. Arcania 4, like the past titles in the series does not cater exclusively to the speed smasher of buttons, but does offer a bit of storyline, great graphics (remember, it's not a new title), enough action to keep the player awake and on edge and there's plenty of small details that push the game up the scale to an overall 7.8, in my humble opinion. Graphics are slightly dated as is the copyright so I don't slam the title for graphics that don't meet the standards set by Skyrim! Graphics 8 / Action is plentiful and combat is adjustable in the settings menu so you can adapt it to your personal style of melee combat. Our hero is seen from a 3rd person POV, a slight downer. Action 8.5 / Storyline is simple and straight forward, boy loves girl, girl's father dislikes boy, boy must complete 3 quests to win his approval. Along the way he finds others in need and helps them out, which generally means killing monsters and bad guys like it's a Olympic game and he wants nothing but gold!  Weapons, armor, and bottles of potions are found in chests and these are accessed easy enough by pressing the ""E"" key, there are no locks, or at least, I have yet to encounter one. Storyline 7 /  Presentation is done with a somewhat humorous approach, though mostly dark humor is used. I only played for 3 hours, but I want to play a lot more, and I will, once I get some sleep! Being retired has advantages, but there are dangerous facets to it as well. I stay up at times for 36 hours, 24-29 of those spent in Skyrim, or in a pitched combat situation whilst playing Battlefield 4 on the PS4, and there are times when I simply randomly select one of the 40+ games I have on Steam and reintroduce myself to it. It's all good, but there's no time for other things, like playing excellent titles such as Aracnia 4 on my laptop. Overall game 7.8 but I always bear in mind the date it was first introduced and the number of serious upgrades from then to now, which shows how the industry really feels about us gamers, the ones who buy their titles without too much price ♥♥♥♥♥ing, and play them until we're blind. Game on!			"

												This game is a visually stunning Action-RPG with the emphasis on Action.  The combat and visuals keeps things flowing nicely... however if you are looking for an engaging story and top voice acting, look elsewhere.  The voice acting is so bad I laughed at its complete idiocy often.  Its also very linear and little to no actual role playing.  If you want to have fun dismembering various baddies for about 10-20  hours try this one.  Stick to Dragon Age otherwise.			"

												Right off the bat, I would have a hard time recommending this to my friends yet it was still able to keep me somewhat entertained for about 20 hours. I would give it 5.5/10 overall.The game itself has surprisingly better graphics than what I thought they would be however there were some poor texture loadins and some odd texture spots floating around occasionally. The main quest was very linear and besides some minor sidequests, you basically went in a line as you never revisited any other previous locations. The main quest itself got very disracted as at first, you're fighting for revenge (I am trying to avoid spoilers here!), and then you get distracted with trying to stop the paladins, and then you get distracted with trying to help the king, and then you get distracted by trying to save the city, etc. It felt like the quest was all over the place and when you finally accomplished one of the things, it was less than satisfactory. The sidequests themselves were mildly interesting. They actually rewarded pretty good loot and made them worth while.It's listed as an RPG but the game isn't really one to be honest. Sure you can sort of focus on using swords or spells, but there are so few skills to upgrade, you end up getting all of them and it doesn't really matter what you're focusing on. The crafting system felt tacked onto the game as it doesn't really serve much of a purpose. I literally only used the health potions even though I could have made 30+ other potions. I also could have crafted some other weapons and armor but by the time I got the material required for them, I already had better weapons and armor than the thing I was trying to craft.Some minor things I disliked about the game was that it seemed like there were only a few voice actors and there were only a few NPC models. There was basically no variation when meeting NPCs. Also it was annoying that I couldn't tell if I got hit by enemies. They would make a quick movement and I looked down at my health and saw they had somehow hit me.The game itself was incredibly easy but I only played it on normal. After that, it can go up to hard and then gothic. I felt very overpowered and didn't really have to pay attention to my HP. I just pressed the attack button and rarely tried to dodge.Some positive things about the game is that the bow mechanic was really cool. I also liked the overall lighting ambient in the game.  My favorite thing about the game however was probably that I was able to easily find better and better loot, from doing sidequests to doing the main quest. Normally games have a bunch of bad loot that you can get but this was a nice change.As I said, overall 5.5/10.  "

												Arcania was a nice game you could enjoy if you dont expect a Gothic. It was fun meeting the old chars from Gothic in Arcania. Unfortunately Arcania is not a real open world game and the fact that you have only 10 different faces for the npc is also adding a minus. And yes, you can touch many objects and get some nice animations but there is no effect. E.G. using an anvil won't sharpen your blade :) The quests are linear and the ending is a bit disturbing. You can choose your skills matching to a warrior, rogue, or mage. However, I liked the story, the animated faces, the voice acting. It was an okeish game that could have been a great one :)			"

The Voice acting isn't the best and a lot of the time the animation doesn't fit to the words spoken. Is it Skyrim or Oblivion? No. But there's a lot to do in this game and if you want a great experience the PC version as opposed to the console versions is the way to go. Very smooth framerate, great graphics, the sounds of nature while traveling through out the world. A definite buy for the money. If you like adventure this is a great game to get lost in.			"

												Overall, I think it is a good continuation of the Gothic story. It was good to see again the old faces. This game however is fundamentally different then it's predecessors, so you have to set your expectations right. The story is rather interesting, but very linear. It does not have the same feeling of exploration as the previous ones, rather, feels like a dungeon crawl, where you clear an area, and move on to the next.There is one great downside of the game though, and that's stability. I've played it on Windows 8, and after fiddling with the compatibility, and setting the sound quality on the system to 24 bit 48k sampling (both are recommended and helps a bit), it was mostly playable, but still frequently crashed. I recommend saving often.I still think it's a decent game, worth trying if you liked the previous ones, but does not have much replay value.			"

												Great game! 33 hours of my life was spent in this brilliant game, graphics are nice, quests are easy to follow, although finding some of them, not so easy! Storyline was longer than i thought it would be and just as you think you're getting towards the end, something pops up and you got another 3 - 4 hours worth of game time. One thing that never got old, was the amount of characters in the game, way over 100 different characters that you interact with, but there are only a handful of character models, so you'll come across 10 people that all have the same facial characteristics, which i thought was very amusing! Besides the obvious tabboo inbreeding going though-out the game, there isn't really that much to complain about. Me personally, i had a bit of trouble with the FPS, and it seems the game has a 40 - 50 FPS cap, but a few times it will drop to 10 or less and was fixed after a re-start. Seems all Arcania games have this problem, and they haven't released a patch and probably never will now. Besides that, its a game that even with the problems, is playable, and is worth the time taken to play it. Im looking forward to playing the expansion Arcania: Fall of Setarrif. 6/10			"

Yikes! This is NOT Gothic!

This game feels more like 'Fable' and much more like a MMORPG (if you're thinking that's a good thing, you are wrong), even the story quests feel like pointless grinds.I'm not very far along in the story but I think I've already lost all interest. Very different feel and a very different character from the original Gothic series. FAR LESS compelling.If you are a fan of GOTHIC (III, especially), then you will probably enjoy 'Risen' much more (I did) which is very similar and LOTS OF FUN. 'Risen' even has great cheats and a sequel (which I haven't played yet).Possibly the WORST thing about this game is the lousy CHEAT configuration.You can edit a file easily enough to enable an, in-game, developer ""cheat"" menu BUT there is no god-mode and, EVEN WORSE, after you go through the trouble of maxing out your character's levels, points and stats - you die way too easily and way too quickly!!!Meh, this game sucks.

												In a nutshell:+ Gothic NPC's+ neat world design- liniear map progression with no reason to come back to previously visited locations- story telling and dialogues are the worst- no character depth whatsoever- straight forward skill tree- wtf was the cutscene at the end?! - does (by far) not meet the expectations from Gothic 1 - 3Played through it because I had some spare time on my hands. However, would not play through again. The story-telling is bad, characters lack any kind of depth (*) and the main hero always sounds like he's in a hurry and irritated. (*)Example: I found a dead soldier and went back to his fiance: - me: ""Your fiance is dead, unfortunately""- her: ""Really? *sobs* This cannot be.."" *next text line, still her* ""What are you going to do now?"" (sadness suddenly vanished out of her voice).You cannot get rid of the impression that the (german) voice actors have read each line one by one without having the slightess clue of what the next line will say.Map progression is linear to the point that I missed a quest hub completely because I went another way that lead straight through a mountaint to the other side of the map. To get back I would have had to walk around have the map again (mountain was a one-way road), because there's ""no way"" of fast traveling (only to a certain amount). I decided not to go back and have no idea what I missed. Nothing apparently, because I was able the finish the story anyway. All the old NPC's from Gothic 1 - 3 were planning some ""secret mission"" at one point, but they would not tell me about it. I thought they will tell me later... I just realize they didnt at all... Last quest area (major city) was a clusterf*** of alleys blocked with barricades and alike. Which fitted the plot, but is irritating af when you simply want to reach different parts of the city, which you have to for the main quest. You get several ""choices"" on how to progress your story, which do not matter at all, because there's no alternative. Do whatever you find the easiest without any consequences.Skill tree is pretty straight forward. Each ""class"" (melee, range, mage) has 2 - 3 talent choices which you simply skill until maxed out. Played as a mage, which is basically kiting your enemy while using your fire, frost or lightning spell (yes, there's exactly one for each affiliation with updates on dmg and AoE-capability) until it drops dead. Got 2 hitted occassionally, but basically no difficulty at all (hard difficulty).All in all: Would not recommend.			"

												I am not a Gothic fan; I have not played previous games in the series.  I came to Arcania without expectations colored by the previous games.  I chose 'recommended' only because Arcania is not a terribly bad game.  It's a fairly mediocre RPG.  There are better games out there, no question.  But if you're in an RPG dry spell and you can get Arcania on sale, it's not a bad 40 or so hours.  It's also pretty stable, the only crash I had was after minimizing several times.The graphics are fine for 2010.  The game lacks AA but the jaggies didn't really bother me here.  I did have problems with the horizon between the sky and sea blinking constantly, but I don't know if that's an original flaw in the game or it just isn't aging well with newer graphics cards and drivers.  For the most part the game looks pretty good.  The big exception is the human characters.  In dialogs the hair is frequently translucent and faces can look horrible.For me, the strength of Arcania lies in its combat (melee at least, I didn't use bow and arrow much at all).  I chose to focus on melee and go sword & board.  The combat relies on flurries and power swings.  The flurry system is very similar to combat in The Witcher.  Combine that with dodge rolling to escape getting hit and you have a fairly engaging melee combat system.  I thought melee combat in Arcania was more engaging than in any Elder Scrolls game I've played  (even though, yes, every Elder Scroll game I've played is overall much, much better than Arcania).The magic system is very simplistic - 3 types of magic (fire, frost, electric) with added features gained on leveling up the appropriate skill.  The magic system enhances the melee combat nicely: you can paralyze opponents with the electricity spell or slow them with the frost spell, before attacking them.  But it's nothing like the complexity in Two Worlds 2.Crafting is a bit of a let down.  It's all done in a menu, no need to be at a bench or specific location.  I found weapon and armor crafting to be almost useless (except for the one quest specific crafting of a weapon).  Alchemy and cooking was more robust with a decent selection of potions and recipes to buff/heal your character in various ways.  The story is fairly standard - an unknown man (you cannot play as a female) saves the world.  The story starts off as a revenge tale, which would have been just fine, but by the end it morphs into a save the world cliché.  The game is pretty straight forward.  There is the main quest and various side quests.  There are no factions to join or advance in like in Elder Scroll games or Two Worlds (1 and 2).  Arcania is not open world like Oblivion or Skyrim.  Various sections of the world open up as you advance the main quest, similar to Two Worlds 2 or The Witcher.I've played worse RPGs.  Arcania is stripped down and bare bones compared to something like Oblivion or The Witcher.  I had fun with it considering its limitations.  If I had to do it all over again, I would have waited to get Arcania on sale if I had a fantasy RPG itch that couldn't be scratched in any other way.  It definitely wasn't worth the $50 I paid back in 2010.  But given that I bought it, I don't think it was a total waste of my money.			"

												Recommended, but with reservations. The frame rate bug spoils it for many. (However if your hardware is powerfull I think it's always going to be OK.There is a point later in the game where you think you can go round the whole map again. Collecting the artifacts you didn't pick first time feels like a good idea. You have to jump down a ledge that you can't climb back up. You think it's OK but the path ahead is actually blocked. You're stuck between a gate ahead (which closed without most people probably knowing) and the ledge behind. All you can do is load an old save to get out of it. Long story but you'll know it if you get there.The ending. The last part of the game is in a massive area, and it's a maze of streets and areas. Too big, too confusing. The very ending. It left me suprised because there was no acknowledgement of what you did. Otherwise it would be a great game. Combat is brilliant, the graphics are awesome, and the story otherwise is good..(Apart from sometimes feeling they littered it with enemies just to fill it up.)What a shame they left it with issues-bugs, because I really enjoyed it otherwise. Believe it or not, it's a game that has stuck out in my mind. This is a couple of years after I finished it.			"

												I just finished that game and got some enjoyment out of it. However, the (English) voice acting is terrifying and for a game of the Gothic series it is far to linear. Just having slayed the final end boss, I was prompted a very bad cut scene that leaves you with an open ending. So if you don't own the DLC anyway, don't start to play.			"

												While the Arcania games are not as good as the previous Gothic games, they are quite enjoyable and a nice walk down memory lane with old friends popping up again to say hello. Arcania starts up a little slow, though, there are quite a bit of fetch quests even in the main storyline which postponed the immersion a little for me. The story is linear and while the map is pretty large, you're always guided in the right direction. If you're a looter like me, the sub quests - the figurines and artefacts hidden in the world´- are worth pursuing since the rewards are quite nice and interesting.The game ends a little abrupt, though. I'm used to being able to walk around the world in rpgs after end-of-game but not in Arcania, which makes the ending feel a little lacking. So if you do decide to play, I recommend getting the Arcania: Fall of Setarrif, which is an addon that remedies this a little. You still won't be able to roam the world but the ending feels more polished.			"

												I was surprised with this game. The visuals are good (though sometimes buggy), voice acting is decent, and gameplay is pretty easy to learn. The audio/soundtrack is somewhat staticky. Turning the music down helps. I like the linearity of the story, makes it easy to follow. Combat isn't too hard, though some enemy attacks are hard to dodge. I find the best weapons are swords, magic spells don't do much damage.My only gripe is it constantly crashes. Having to manually save every 5 mins is annoying. Overall I like it though.I should probably note, I'm playing it under Wineskin (set for XP) on my Mac. After updating the wine engine, the crashes are much fewer.			"

												Never played the other ones so I can't complain about it not being related to the games that came before it. I'm normally not a RPG player and I couldn't even get into Skyrim which I own here on Steam but for some strange reason I enjoyed this game until the end. It seems like most of the negativity is directed at it not being directly related to the previous titles which I can understand that but if you're like me and only like to play a RPG casually here and there for the adventure and scenery this is a great game on its own IMO. I read through some of the other reviews that complain about it not having quest markers but as someone who rarely enjoys RPGs (because they tend to be too involving and hardcore) I never once thought of quest markers being a problem? Well I enjoyed the game all the way through. I just thought the addon Fall of Setarrif wasn't no where near as good as the main game and kinda on the short side.			"

												The game is average. Nothing really great but it's ok if you need a new RPG. There are some bugs though in the game with the environent. And the most annoying thing is that they never show where quests (or the next checkpoints) are on the map, so you have to pay attention when they describe how to get there. Also, the story is not too special.I would only recomand this game if it's in a bundle and you get it really cheap, and you have nothing better to play.			"

												This game... Let me put it as clear and simple as I can: it has more issues than a... you know what, forget it, it's not worth trying to elaborate on the frustration. No matter what I tried to do with it it wouldn't want to load AND to top that bit of nonsense off when I tried uninstalling it... It started itself again as if to say 'Please don't, give me another 30min and a strawberry cheesecake and I'll load, I promise!' A successor to the Gothic series without a loading bar to see the progress...? GJ Jowood. A game that resets it settings after rebooting DESPITE asking you to reboot it in order to save the new settings...?Aside from all the technical issues you're gonna have with the game (and trust me, if you're a steam user you WILL. It is physically IMPOSSIBLE to not have'em) it's just a dumbed down, simplified, casualised RPG for people that have to put down their left hand and make an 'L' sign with their thumb to know which side is left. From what footage I've seen of the game it should be downright ILLEGAL to ask money for it... An RPG with no choices aside from the weapon you choose, a linear story and narrative, recycled MAIN NPCS. Yeah, keep looking for an actual RPG and dump this on the pile with all the new FF releases.TL;DR- technical issues, dumbed down cash in by Jowood that shames the franchise. Pick up the previous titles if you want an actual RPG experience.			"

I haven't had anything so far that stands up against it and the nonexistant diminishing returns.This game reminds me of playing angel arena on warcraft 3, there would always be that one guy who picks the hero with bash and spams agility for some of the worlds longest and most uninteresting slapping fights.On the bright side, I love the engine. Some of the nicest graphics I've seen in a game, remember kids graphics are supplimental to gameplay.Seriously go play something from Spiderweb Software and you will be converted, the older the better, all the way back to Exile if you can stomach it.

												I am sorry I have to ask this question here. The devs did not message me back and I doubt they will so I will explain my problem to you guys and hope that somebody out there can helpSo what happens is, I launch the game, play the tutorial and, and it hits me there's no interface, no life etc. I thought it was a tutorial thing. So okay, I continue. Tutorial plays just fine, but the game is too loud. So I press escape and go into options, but whatever the I do I cannot switch from the gameplay options to video, audio, or any other option. Then, I notice that even in the gameplay options I cant do anything. Not with the mouse, not with the keys, I can only exit the options menu. So I get over it and play the tutorial further, finish it, and then the game starts, some girl comes over talks to me, I skip the entire dialogue using the escape key. Then an informations shows up that I should view my quests by pressing ,,L''. And at that point all hope is lot. I tried pressing L. I tried Escape, i tried clicking the OK button at the bottom with my mouse. There is nothing I can do from that point on except restarting the game and playing the tutorial all over to get to the same point. Can anyone help?			"

												  The story seemed poorly contrived and seemed to take up a quarter to a third of my time in game.  This meant when I started a new chapter I could not remember what I was working toward and sometimes I confused the main story quests with side quests.  Furthermore, the ending felt unsatisfactory and when Fall of Setariff came out, I finally understood they had released the game without finishing the story.  The game is described as RPG, but good luck finding any opportunities to rp.  The game is very linear in that once you've cleared an area you have no reason to return.  Any companion or main story npcs have flat personalities and their main function is to act as quest givers and info dumps.  The greatest decision I made in game was deciding between a two or one handed weapon.  In the end, the most memorable part of the game is what a disappointment it is.  I recommend enjoying the previous Gothic games, the Witcher series, and TES series if you're looking for an engaging fantasy RPG.			"

												9 Hours in and im uninstalling this Single player MMO, This is no gothic game. Even the massively buggy Gothic 3 at least had a fun open world to explore. This is just a series of locked zones you move around in looking for random fetch quests and 30 hidden items of the same type to unlock high level gear late game. Lack of classic gothic skill up and stats have been replaced with a sterile point buy system. The crafting interface is well done but it amounts to mass producing buff and healing potions. All the gear is incredibly static and leveled. You find a massive two hander then later you find a crude club that has +2 more damage on it as an early upgrade till you find a new two handed sword with higher damage.Skip this one and play risen. Its much more involved and has higher production values. Though I gotta say Arcania 4 has great graphics and looks fantastic.			"

												The game is easy even on the hardest Gothic mode, but I die normally as my game is lagging, thus I will wait till I buy better computer. It is just left click slashing and combining with ranged attacks and magic. Though effects are good I do not like how it is raining every day many times like if there was no break for raining. Quests are simplified in Skyrim way, when you enter dungeon you get out of there other shorter way leading towards the person who gave you quest. World is open but kind of linear as is in Fable. The fighting reminds me of Witcher style just choosing the right style and rolling around enemy. Fights are even easier as the animals will stop following you after the same length distance.I gave it a try but eventually my computer is too weak for the graphics. It looks good to me. For now I can not critisize as I can not fully enjoy game due to my computer performance but seems pretty ok so far.			"

												I am embarrassed that I actually played this game for 41.4 hours. I think the only reason that many hours stacked up was because it was so boring that I fell asleep after one hour and woke up 40.4 hours later. This game put me to sleep for nearly two days! WTF!			"

												This game lacks a lot. Gameplay is over-simplified, with only three spells for a caster and a very simple melee system. You can craft, cook and brew anywhere without using a workbench - hell, workbenches are in the game but don't have any use, even if you turn on 'Roleplaying elements' in the options. There is no penalty for stealing stuff, you can't beat up friendly NPCs. Although you're playing in one big world, the pathing is painfully linear. You can't walk down edges (unless you jump), and exploring usually kills you - like when you touch the water surface of a lake you thought you could swim through. The new main character doesn't keep up with the previous nameless hero (how could he anyway?), the story is dull, quests are repetitive and most characters are unconvincing.Most. What made this game for me was really was the opportunity to meet old friends. Especially Diego and Gorn really shine in this game, and seeing Lester and Milten again also didn't hurt. Besides that, the game is stripped down and shifted way more from the hard old-school RPG to a casual Action RPG, which - if you let yourself in for it - has its benefits: the game is incredibly intuitive, you don't have to put a lot of time to learn the skill system or whatever, and combat feels wonderfully dynamic. The game also looks pretty nice.I started the game on difficulty 'Gothic' (of course...) which is the hardest one they give you. If you come from Gothic, do this! After about 3/4 of the game I put it down to 'Hard' and then 'Normal' because it started to get difficult and enemies had riddiculously high HP, making combats last forever. This made the late game kinda chewy. It took me ~21 hours to finish the game, which isn't incredibly long for an RPG, but some hours less wouldn't have hurt.I'll give it a 6.5 / 10, mostly for 'nostalgic value', nice graphics and overall a very polished and smooth experience. If (and only if) you are into the series, it's worth playing!			"

												Horrible. The teleport system works from A to B and back but not B to C or farther. The load times on it take just as long as it would to walk. Quests and map flow are uninspiring. Theres very little to keep players attached to the game.Original review posted May 15, 2015 @ 10:33amUpdated review posted on Spetember 11th, 2016 @ around 9:30pmI went back and beat the game. I still would not recomened it. There are only a few teleport pads in the game, the world is still linear. I finished the game at level 30 as a mage, fire is the way to go. If you are thinking about playing this after reading my review and going the mage route save you skill points from the first 4 levels and put them into magi skills when you have a chance.I played through both times on normal. It should have been called easy. I died a few times from low health, Im sturborn when it comes to using potions. With a little health regen you dont need potions at all. The game slows down your movement when your inside. You can see/feel the running slowing and its painful to play at times. The overall story is ok. Still, combat is extremly repetitive. As a mage I charged up my firespell and let fly. Most enemies died with one hit of a fully charged spells Those that didnt burnt to death. A small handful needed a few extra hits. I was able to find most items in the game, the shops are useless. I didnt craft anything with alchemy but I made a mage sword for myself and later a 2h mage sword and upgraded it through the crafting system. Other then about 4-5 weapons that have caster stats, there are no caster weapons. Save your money and spend it on something better.			"

												Arcania is a good beginers entry to rpg games.  It has been stripped and dumbed down from other gothic titles to appeal to a lighter crowd. What you have here is a streamlined story with minimal side quests, terrible voices, repetative character models and mediocre combat.  Most enemies have timed power attacks easily avoided with a roll and almost everyone can be killed by backing up while firing arrows.  The graphics are better than older gothic games of course but arent anything special.  The amount of armour and weapons is extremely limited with a pathetic crafting system.  On a plus note the game is easy to play if your not familiar with or are intimidated by advanced rpg games.  The games npc's occasionally offer a bit of adult humour if your patient enough to listen to there awful voices.5/10			"

												Dont know why so many negative comments i guess its just old people who played the previous gothics and didnt like that they updated the game into a better style.Took about 15 hours of fun to beat the game, i think i did most of the side quests lots of fun.Fun gameplay, good story, lots of side quests, simple gameplay.Only problem is hard to find all the collectables, and magic just seemed really weak and too hard to do full mage playthough.

												Arcania: Gothic 4 or should I say ArcaniA is a good game but if you have previously played the other Gothic games, then you may not like it as much, the game is good, just not as better as the previous were, they probably shouldn't have call it ''Gothic'' but anyway, It's still a good game worth the try.There are a lot of flaws in this game compared to the other Gothic game but it's still a fun game if you get it cheap.2 big flaws which are the same as the previous Gothic which are the freeroam and the ending.Do not except  The Elder Scrolls or even a Fallout game, it's open world but at the same time it's linear.You cannot continue after the ending, not even a new game plus.There are many others unlike the other Gothic because this one is way too different from the previous onesThe game is even more linear than the previous ones.ArcaniA doesn't always makes sense, that's for sure but it's still a fine game In my opinion.If this game would have been more like the previous Gothic but with a better open world and a better ending then it would probably have been really great.My favorite list:1. Gothic II2. Gothic3. Risen4. Gothic III5. Risen 2: Dark Water6. Arcania: Gothic 4 (I wouldn't consider this one as a Gothic game though)They are all good In my opinion, but some are more worth than the others, of course, they all have their good and bad.If only they would have a true freeroam and no ending.6/10 (I'd suggest you get it while on sale, at least for 80% then it may be worth playing it a little).

												This is the my second replay of the game. This is really fun and enjoyable game. Graphics are real good, combat system is much better than in Gothic, once I downloaded mod to get my perfect zoom ( I like it further away ) and made a minor adjustment so I could get rid of that quiver off your back the playing experiance for me got sooo much better. The only thing is wish they would have done is to have a one big open world, more character skills and customization and perhaps a bit more armor and weapons options since I love my armor. Other than that this is a relaxing well made RPG and I hope they  will make a sequal.			"

												Overall it is a good game but feels like incomplete. The story is impressive but very short when compared with the previous Gothic titles. The map is small and linear. Do not ever try to swim accross the sea, it looks like our character doesn't know how to swim although he grew up in an island :)They changed a lot of things about the gameplay, character panel is very brief (which is bad I think) Actually I can say the only thing that resembles the Gothic is the main characters like Gorn, Milten, Xardas etc. The game doesn't offer enough interaction with the surroundings, things like camp fires, anvils, lecterns doesn't work. To my opinion they should be... Another annoying thing is the teleportation stuff, the stones used in Gothic 3 should have been used but anyway the world is really small. Horses would be good as well.There is opportunity for lot's of DLCs like ""rebuilding Fesher"", ""king's son in law (marrying with Zyra of course) :D"", ""united islands"" but after 5 years I do not hope any will be released.As a conclusion I can say it is a good game for playing in a weekend but you will miss the old Gothic flavor, there is a reason they did not advertise as Gothic 4 explicitly because it is not.

If you want a cheap 10 hours enetertainment then this could be it, It's not the complexity of Skrim etc but it delivers on story and enjoyment. Look for the version with the expansion pack.			"

												It's definitely not the best rpg out there, but I enjoyed it. This may be different for some people, but I  found the story very forgettable. The combat felt very comfortable, although a bit repetitive for my character (dodge roll, sword combo, run around regaining health, repeat). The pacing was pretty good, you never see any huge jumps in enemy dificulty. And it is a very pretty game. If you can pick it up on sale for around 5 or 10 bucks, its definitely worth your time. Any higher than that, you'll probably feel like you aren't getting enough for your money.			"

												Not bad, not bad at all. But better than Gothic 3 ? No. More polished ? Yes. Gothic 3 was a bug- and crashfest, but it did deliver one thing. Fun. With a capital F. It had an open world, quests that you mostly had to find and solve yourself (no handholding) and challenging, but rewarding combat. Gothic 4 is linear (sure, you have open areas, but they're all connected to eachother instead of one gigant world), solutions to quests are shown on the map and the combat is easier (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). I did have fun with it (see; no capital f), but it just isn't Gothic. It doesn't have the same feeling. But if you like RPGs in general I guess it's worth a try.[Rating: 77/100]			"

												After playing more than 3 hours of the game,here are my thoughts :ArcaniA or Gothic 4 is nothing to compare to the game with same name Gothic 3. The game has nice graphic,but the battle system is hideous. Namley the creeps are too easy to kill, their attack to easy to avoid, don't do much dmg and are overlay too dumb to fight against.  Next of is the game itself. There are textures everywhere.EVRYWHERE! You will get stuck on imaginery objects, a small stone,wich is more a pebble than a stone, is blocking your movement. The fight animations,jump and moving of character in general is laughable. The game is prety nice to play as a time killer since it has nice story to it. But the quest and the side quest dont even have no information at all! Example:  Collecting Beliar Artefact's. The quest says a quick story behind it and says collect them, with no info about whereabouts (is it the area where you picked it up,the same island you picked it up or the same fricking continent).The only good about it is the roleplay system that allow you to use object such as cettles,waterbarells etc.For me I can't even look at this game as a real Gothic sequel. The  Piranha Bytes who made G3 did almost perfect job on it, but when they joined with Spellbound that made ArcaniA the game lost all its glory. Overall the game isn't  worth 20€.  I had luck (if I can call it luck) and got it in bundle.			"

												NOT a strong recommendation! but I figure if your thinking about getting this game you'll do proper research before you spend your money on it. I got the whole Gothic series in a bundle on sale so I didn't pay anywhere near 20 USD for it, definitely not worth that much in my opinion. But worth something.Ok RPG. (revised from AMAZING) I would recommend it because I had fun until I read people were hating on it then other people's opinions kind of changed my own. after reading the reviews i realized the game was very linear but before anyone told me it felt a lot like The Witcher 2. Still with that said I have never read reviews for The Witcher 2 but i seriously doubt people bash it as much as this game. Its not bad but it's no Elder Scrolls either. I have all the gothic games but haven't really played any other than this one simply because I buy way too many games and never have enough time to play them all before I have something new to play. So I'm not 'disappointed' by the deviation from the RPG elements of the earlier games. From my stand point I'm looking at it as a stand alone RPG not the 4th in a series.The games graphics are amazing if your computer can handle running them at full blast, but some how the tone of the over-all game seems to be very empty. Partly due to the fact that the only fast travel is restricted to 2-way teleporting pads separated by long, LONG walks between areas. The game doesn't really have any exploration value though so backtracking to old areas is almost nill. once you've completed an areas quest and unlocked the next area you will have little to no reason to return.The game play mechanics were great at first, but that's bearing in mind that I have only played shooters on the PC and this was the first real RPG that I played. they are simple and fun enough, but annoying later on when you just dodge and hack enemies up over and over.Loot, there's not much to speak of. more than anything you'll be carrying a bunch of junk around with you most of the time waiting to sell it. The magic they tried to incorporate into the game seems unfinished to me, mostly useless. Except one that makes you run faster for a short duration which is nice but annoying at the same time for having to walk such arduous distances in the first place.			"

												Greetings All who read:Well I may not have played this game for long there is a reason behind it.The Game Graphics at high settings are slugish and ♥♥♥♥!The game at low Graphic settings are Still Slugish and ♥♥♥♥!The Story line was looking to turn out to be a OK story but never got that far into it to realy tell you if it is good or bad.The FRAME RATE was absolute Bull ♥♥♥♥! I was getting 30-60 FPS at teh best I could posibly muster out of my $1,200 SystemTo tell you my first view of the game was looking good, then the vidios where slopy and slow, after such I played for a few moments and game CRASHED!, So I checked my graphics card up date and did a full Update to make certain that was not he case.Did some muking about with game files to make certain that STEAM had not been the cause of the crash.Finaly I got the game to work and not crash, only to be Boged down by more SLOW ♥♥♥ FPS. I played a little longer to see if it was just a slow start to warm up the game (some have this feature) , but no the game was just pure BS FPS from the get go and never cleaned up, this did not matter what settings in Graphics I did, window mode or not, the game performed like a SNAIL passing threw Molasse!I have and can no longer play this game as it is just to damm GLICHY slow for me to even tolerate playing, and I have played some real shity FPS games, this one takes the cake!Here is some of my system info for you to think about.Graphics card = 2 GRAM = 16 GCPU =  I7So if you  think you whant to play this game because mabe my system is just ♥♥♥♥, that's cool go for it.I have even tryed this game on my High end Desk top and it puts this lab top to shame.The game still ran like a Tun of Bricks in Water!I will say this, if I had payed there full price for this game I would be PISST to no end!Buy it if you want but I for one will never play it again!

												Story is average, combat is above average, graphics are incredible, gameplay is enjoyable, ending is average. Overall this is a above average to good game. 6.5-7.5/10. I enjoyed it alot, so if your into rpgs and dont mind a cliche story go for it. Heres a tip, go one hand sword and shield. I beat the final boss without ever going below 700 hp (751 hp max). This was on the 2nd hardest difficulty. But keep in mind this game has no sense of pacing, at one point i was fighting some spiders and golems and ♥♥♥♥, than i turn a corner and fight 2 demon overlords and 4 flying naked ladies, which are all way more difficult than spiders and  golems. I won, bearly, but still, had to be the worst pacing i have ever experienced. The final boss was cakewalk compared to beating this insignificant mob.			"

												Ooh Great,GOTHIC 4! Time for some dark heavy clouds and high proud castles and wilderness exploration!Why am i nonchalantly slaying generic skeletons in a poorly made generic dungeon? Oh well, thank god was intro sequence. Ok now, WHY I HAVE TO CARE ABOUT MY ANGRY FATHER IN LAW? Who is this woman i am suppesed to care about and go to a fetch quest for her love? Where am I? WHO AM I? Seriously, i couldn't shake this kafkaesque feeling - i was in a poorly made. generic. empty husk of an rpg, far away from what made GOTHIC great... so predictable it gave me slight anxiety, as if i was trapped in some empty MMORPG world all alone.I won't go into the corporate ♥♥♥♥♥torm behind this shame of a game.  Just the beginning is enough to let you know it is soulless.I keep playing Arcania, trying to love this game. It worked with Two Worlds 1 & 2 - i somehow loved those games as i played.Yet Arcania somehow manages to feel ...offensive. And here's why:The total abandonment of the series tone and color has happened before in other games - but here the lack of care about anything is, like, RUDE. Storyline and undertone are not merely uninteresting. they kinda feel generic IN YOUR FACE. Like, sadistically. Instead of atmosphere, intrigue and corruption you get unintroduced linear fetch quests with zero reasons to care about them. The characteristic smell of moneygrab  is all over, ''we don't care about your games sucker$$$''.Thankfully the spirit of GOTHIC lives on in the RISEN series. mysoulhurts/10 do not recomment Go play RISEN or even TWO WORLDS			"

												+Good Visuals (Lighting, Post-Process, Effects)+Great World/Level Design+Good Loot System +Combat is fun -Inconsistent Visuals (No native Vsync, Disappearing Vegetation, Artifacts)-Easy Game (Put difficulty to Hard/Gothic)-One Playthrough Is Enough-Average Story and Voice ActingThis game is not accurately described by its Metacritic score, however, the developers/publisher did not do themselves a favor in purporting the game as part of the Gothic franchise.  While the story is technically more interesting and coherent than previous Gothic games, the style of gameplay is significantly different as the design is aimed towards focused progression from point A to B.  The world is technically open, but there is never a reason to backtrack.  This design is not bad, however, as the developers make each step compelling enough with beautifully detailed locales and creatures to keep your interest.  If a fan of previous Gothics, understand that the structure is significantly different.  There are only a couple of decision points and there isn't a faction system to limit your abilities.  Abilities are also acquired via a skill tree rather than being trained and purchased from masters.  Still, this is a fun Action RPG and is worth a purchase when on sale.[GET AT SALE]			"

												Beware this is a very old game, at least it comes off that way.  Total garbage, it is supposed to have partial controller support, but many menus in the game require the mouse and keyboard so basically to play it you need, a keyboard, a mouse, and a controller.  Not only that it seems the devs ignored the triggers like they dont exist because the triggers and bumpers dont work in the game at all.  That is alot of equipment for one game to be juggling back and forth and makes for a terrible gaming experience.  There is no vsync in the options, so this game may not run properly on even the best gaming rigs without forcing it on through some setting for a specific video card.  This game takes place in the olden days from what I played, maybe it was made then too judging by the archaic game design, seriously in the last 5 years I havent seen a game without vsync, in comes this game to break the mold...Rating:  0/0  Value:  $0.00			"

												I think I'm ready to recommend it. That's a nice action RPG, rather friendly to the player: it's easy to learn, intuitive enough, and it takes quite a lot of effort to die here - at least, as far as the beginning of it is concerned. I've played 12 hours so far, and I died only twice (more out of curiosity, in fact, than because of real failure). I like games with strong lengthy storylines, and that's one of such cases. You can take a variety of side quests as well, but you always feel that it's just a pleasant addition for you to entertain yourself while doing the main quest, the Gothic Story. I have also appreciated the scrupulous approach to environment modelling that my favourite TES games lack sometimes: for example, when it's raining, the ground becomes wet, and people around you start to seek shelter.What I really disliked was the fact that all NPCs have the same faces. Well, not all of them, but approximately 80-90% of people I met do. It seems that the developers have designed two or, maybe, three faces and decided that it's enough. In addition, women's faces are either unpleasant or plain ugly, and it really strikes you when someone supposed to be a nice young lady has a face of mature woman in her late fourties.			"

												Far more fun gameplay wise than some of its predecessors, ArcaniA soon comes off as rough and unfinished. That roughness only increases as the game progresses and it becomes clear that it must have been rushed to completion.Enjoy the early parts of the game that are more like Fable for they will not last. The later parts of the game are more of a slog and with each passing moment it became less like fun and more like work. To make matters worse there is no satisfying conclusion to the game. A short cutscene merely paves the way to the next expansion.It's clear ArcaniA had potential to be far more than the game that we were given.  If anything that makes it an even bigger dissapointment than its predecessors.			"

												I was hoping to get that Gothic 3 feel out of it, but it just didn't happen. I was expecting open world, but you're just lead through some zones with gates in between where you can't return to the old one.			"

												A great followup to an even greater series. While it has downsides such as cloned NPCs (same voices, faces etc.) and slightly repetetive quests and being quite linear. It still has a very dark fantasy charm to it that sticks to you and urges you to learn more. Just one more quest! just oen more quest!			"

												Arcania was a lot of fun, but I have two qualms with it.  First being that the game is relatively easy in terms of combat and quest completion, and the second being that it was extremely linear.  If you explored and found a cave, there's a good chance you can explore it but you'll likely be completing a quest you didn't know was available.  Fortunately the game makes up for this quite well as once you encounter said quest giver they'll explain that they need something and you'll be like ""you mean like this thingy I found in that cave?"" and the quest giver will respond with "".....uhhh, yeah, it is.""  So it's not a total loss, but nothing is hidden, you won't find something you're friends won't in their own play through as everything in the game serves a purpose to the story or side quest.  Ending in what seemed a quick 31 hours, all in all the game was very fun, I really enjoyed the story and must admit I'm new to Gothic, and this only compells me to want to experience the other games.

												Ok, I liked the Gothic series.  I even liked the critically panned Gothic 3, possibly even more than the first two.  I am also a fan of simple RPGs; I don't need graphics and complex combat systems.  I really can't find much positive about ArcaniA.  Every quest is ""go get this thing for me then the blocked passage will magically open.""  The combat is inexact and unoriginal.  The voice acting is so bad I had to mute it a couple times and there are only about four different faces for all of the NPCs (learn the names because they all look the same).  Maybe if I can force myself through it, the story will make up for it, but thus far the story line is unoriginal.  It is too bad that this game effectively killed an entire franchise.  Maybe Risen will be able to advance the mantle.			"

												First off: Never played any other game in the Gothic series, and everyone says this is far from Gothic 4 so lets assume it isn't.ArcaniA, as an RPG is not bad.  The story moves along and it occasionally runs into speed bumps in the storytelling but otherwise for an almost 5 year old game it doesn't look or play badly.My biggest gripe is that the game seems to be designed for strictly melee combat. You can certainly get spells and upgrade them and use a bow more if you feel thats your thing but from experience if you go down any other road than a typical barbarian build you're going to find difficulties. For instance, theres a skill tree for stealth but it doesn't give you a bonus for a stealth attack until you've accumulated a lot of skill points which you don't get a lot of per level. You can certianly build a mage if you prefer but the game is pretty clear in it's limitations in regards to how you build the character.Otherwise, the game is fun. The characters are interesting but more or less pretty standard characters for a fantasy game.If you're looking for an inexpensive RPG that will hold your attention, ArcaniA should do nicely.If you're expecting a Skyrim-esque experience, this is not it. One thing I liked was the collectibles. In most games, they do nothing but reward you with some sort of achievement or otherwise forgettable reward. In this game, it clearly tells you what the rewards are and they could help your character depending on how you play. but at least you know ahead of time rather than finding out collecting all those items wasn't going to be worth it.Its good. Get it.			"

												Even if you don't compare it to Gothic I & II, it still is a bad game.The combat system is just rolling around like a mad man when enemys do their power attacks and just left clicking when they don't. Also there's far too many invisible walls, partly in completely unnecessary places.I especially liked that the game spawns you right next to the ocean with a tiny invisible wall 'guarding' it because they were too lazy to implement a swimming feature or water physics, because when you jump over the wall your character just dies for no reason whatsoever and just slips around in the water like it's not there.I also couldn't stand the storyline in the very beginning. So uninspired, so dull.It might be that I haven't played this game long enough for a fair review but I just couldn't stand it any longer. "

												I've found the Gothic/Arcania series to be some of the best CRPGs ever. Sweeping story lines, meaningful efforts and cool perks/skill trees. These true European-style RPGs are worth playing & serve up dozens of hours of fun and challenge. Sure there have been bugs (I've played them all before owning the digital versions on Steam without patching), but patching and the community has made those non-issues. This chapter seems to oversimplify rather than streamline somewhat but provices an enjoyable & rich story for you to be the hero & get the girl. What more could you want? Oh...the get the Fall of Setariff too!			"

												Have you spent lots of money on games? Have you ever bought a game that was extremely cheap but still make you regret paying 1-2 dollars? You've got the chance here.To be honest, I was wondering if I should write a review of this game for you, gamers. I was wondering if I want to for two reasons: the game is really bad, no one will ever buy this game. But I assume I might be able to save someone right here, so here we go!Firstly, I got this game in a bundle (I guess) and I let it stay in my library for a long time, as first time I ran the game it was literally unplayable (performance reasons), my pc is not the best, but still I hoped they would fix some performance issues so I could really test this game. It's playable now. Performance-wise at least?Talking about performance, this game should be more of a benchmark than a game as even strong PC may not run it well. It's also got non-existent multicore detection, so not only lowering the details might be necessary, but also tweaking config files (and it's really quirky - I've heard it made some people return the game back to a store).Let's talk about the gameplay itself. You begin with a poorly designed interactive intro (basically the game, but without hp bar and with some other character - not to spoil). Then you will need to do some casual questing - complete a few, simple tutorial quests, not so lengthy, you virtually can't die, very casual. They are mostly badly designed and don't make sense, but it's just a tutorial. As the storyline continues: you're thrown into the deep waters (just a figure of speech) and some very NOT surprising stuff happens right off the bat. If you've ever played Fable: The Lost Chapters you will even see how similiar the beginning is, just... worse. This's less of a ""life is a ♥♥♥♥♥ and then you die"" kind of game than other games of the franchise.Game is mostly about fighting with sword, spells and such, and this part is so badly designed it will make your eyes bleed. The camera work is terrible - it takes the player away from the action. The fighting and combo system are very unreliable and not satisfactionary at all. Enemies kinda seem to have high hp, but they are easily (mostly) perma-stunned, don't offer much of a challenge, and rarely you will have any trouble taking out the enemies. Also the roll is so OP in this game, it's not even funny.Well, what about the audio? Many voice actors seem to be from different countries and they don't really speak English well. Some characters even have some wicked manners of speech, cringeworthy really. The dialogues are pretty boring really, there's nothing exciting or funny about the personas. You won't ever quote this game, that's for sure.For the aesthetic values of the game, just to complete this rant: it's bad, really bad. Strangely acting shadows, models with less polygons Gothic 3 used to have, some weird textures at times, also poor facial expressions and this strange ""mist"" or ""fog"", it's just really bad.I can't find anything positive about this game, really. I'm trying, but I can't. If you like badly designed action RPG games, needing a lot of tweaking, patching, patience even, then be on your way, play this ♥♥♥♥. I don't think this game can even be salvaged by community mods (and I doubt someone would go through all the pain). If you really want this game because you like Gothic, try Risen or Risen 2. If you just want a rpg-like TPP game, you can go with Fable, Fable 3, Kingdoms of Amalur even, Gothic I, II, III, Risen, Risen 2 and a bunch of other games. Just DON'T TOUCH THIS PIECE OF FECES.

												Good, but lacking. This game is definately not openworld (thus really kills it's relationship to the previous gothic games) with the player going through 'zones'. as of writing I'm half way through the game and really un-motivated to continue, any characters I enjoyed or was attached to will no longer be visited as there's 0 reason to return to a complete zone (no new quests, under levelled gear, no new enemy spawns). besides that the whole game feels like your stuck on a specific path with one or two side quests per-zone, illusion of choice and free-roam that overall got sort of frusterating.all in all I wouldnt reccomend to someone who's into Risen/Gothic, but I ONLY give this a yes because its a good 'gateway game' for those new to gothic. has some of the tighter combat and controls of any in the series, so its most accessible			"

												If you liked the RPG elements in Gothic, prepare to be disappionted.If you liked the progression in Gothic, prepare to be disappionted.If you liked the combat, the world, the quests and every thing else that made Gothic Gothic, prepare to be really disappointed.When ArcaniA (back then also called Gothic 4/ a Gothic tale) came out, I expected the old gothic feeling with improvements. What we got was an oversimplified RPG with a mediocre story at best that has not even a bit depth like the previous ones. The combat is very easy, making dying the more challenging task even on the ultimate ""gothic"" difficulty. I made it through the game first just using my two-hand-weapon and left swinging them to death and sometimes rolling to become invincible to projectiles like spells and arrows or to dodge melee attacks that sometimes hit you for no reason. After 1/2 of the game I got tired of this dull combat and just walked through the masses of enemies which works until you hit a forced encounter or a locked door and then you can just kill the 2-3 enemies that are still behind you.Instead of an interessting world with many great, optional characters and a lot to do, we have linear enviroment (it is literally a chain of somewhat open areas that needs the completing of the main quest part to advance to the next chainlink) with the same character models being reused over and over again. Instead of being able to attack any NPC, you can only duel some for a quest and else they noclip through your attacks; instead of being able to choose a fraction, you are being forced onto one line to obey; instead of being able to get reputation in a city, all quests are either fully optional for gear or are needed for the progression aka the main quest; instead of being able to get into city fights with you leading the rebels against a whole army of orcs, you are a lone wolf and any NPC will refuse to interact while you are in combat.Only good things are the graphics (for its age) and the small learning curve, if you are into casual RPGs. Not worth the time. Better get an old one and get community patches for them.			"

												I've played every Gothic game out, and I've enjoyed all of them. I did enjoy this one as well, but, not quite as much. That being said, I'm still hoping for Gothic 5. The game seems to start in a fairly narrow area, that grows to a fairly large map, and then tapers down. I guess maybe the design was intentional. Once you are off the beginning stage, where the story is set and you learn the combat etc. you end up on a very open map, with plenty to do, and explore, I enjoyed it. As it goes on closer to the end, the maps tend to close off more and more to make you follow a path. I wish the end had been more like the middle. The NPC's have the same face, There must have been a lot of NPC inbreeding going on in that game. No hotties, not even one Hot character. I was disappointed in that. However, I did take a day off work to finish because in the end, i was ready to finish it and see what happened. The end was a very hard battle, but the just went to credits with no real closure. I think it could have been done better. All in all, I enjoyed it and if you like RPGs that let you play alone and work at your pace. It's a pretty good game.			"

												The good thing about this game? The rain looks amazing. That's about it though.I only played through the beginning, but I can already see where the game is headed: nowhere. Let's look at it.You start the game as the nameless character from the gothic series, if you had chosen the good apth in Gothic 3. You go through a cave, get to know the combat system, you roll around a bit. Cool enough.Then you wake up as a different character and are introduced to your girlfriend. Your girlfriend apparently forgot how to voice act, just like any other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ character... Main character included. So you are a sherphard and apparently your relationship with her is a secret and her father found out. So you have to go through these 3 tests that the old geezer is desperatly trying to make you fail because... some reason, to get permision to marry his daughter, which you as the player have absolutely no interest in because you don't get to know her... at all. *spoiler* It is so clear that she is a plot device and will die later. The only time you feel the slightest bit for her is when she leaves you her bow at the third test, and that is pathetic really. Then there's this other dude who wants to marry her aswell, and he challenges you and your like ""whatever"" and beat him up, so exciting.You do get to meet Diego though, which is honestly not very exciting still because he is not much like his old self.Then for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason you help this weird witch kill bugs, and while you do that your village is burned down by the old heroes army and your like ""called it"" because it was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ obvious, and then you go with diego somewhere and is like: ""I must have revenge, because I was so connected with everyone in that village""Game, If you want me to take your revenge plot seriously at the very least make me feel SOMETHING for the characters. At this point I stopped playing because it was too stupid for me. I have deleted this game from the Gothic series. It now goes:GothicGothic 2: NotRRisen (Gothic 3 is set aside for those who want to mod it untill its good)Risen 2 (even though I havn't tried it, I am 100% sure its better than this game)So in short: Don't buy this game unless you really like to look at rain in a game.

												The first feeling I got was that I was playing one of those non-challenging MMORPGs, where you just get one quest, run, hit, loot, quest, run, hit, loot and so on. The background history is very poor, without details and passion. I didn`t like my character nor any other in the game.The game just don`t manage to grab the player.Even though the environment wasn`t that badly designed, there are strange animations going on, and the movements of the character doesn`t feel natural.Leveling up is also odd, not making it clear what to do with the skills you choose.The combat system is just too poor. It is easy to kill anything with little trouble.Well, in overall, I think the game left a huge gap in grabbing the player and making the experience pleasant.4/10			"

The acting was pretty good and the plot line was decent. Some of the battles were pretty easy but the further I got in the game it did get harder. The game is pretty linear there’s not a lot of latitude about what you can do and were you can go. Certain areas don’t open up until you finish the required tasks. I was a little disappointed that you couldn’t romance some of the characters you meet along the way. Except for the few problems I outlined above I enjoyed the game. Considering the price I paid during the Steam sale for the series and the game lasting for 36 hours of play I got a lot of bang for the buck. I would give it a 7 out of 10.			"

												ArcaniA, a controversial game within the community. ArcaniA is set in the world of the infamous Gothic series, but should not be considered as the next installment, but rather as its own game.It has a decent, average story and characters, but great areas and landscapes. Visual aspect and atmosphere were well done, back when it first came out, I was impressed. Another huge plus is the combat system. It is fluent and dynamic, which made it all the more satisfying and enjoyable to fight against enemies.Character progression was kept quite simple, focusing on your average, casual players. Might not have hurt to go more in depth, maybe by giving us a couple more extra options to improve the character, separating stats and skills. But it didn't bother me that much.It is not an open world game, which is not a bad thing, but the different areas could have profited from more indepth side quest and stories, maybe by adding various dungeons. Equipments are somewhat neglected, and not as thought out as I had hoped. Could have combined epic loot or rare reccources with side quests to get or to create all kinds of different armors and weapons, or make us overall more dependent on the crafting system. I believed I used it once to create ""Innos's sword"" at the end. More weapons and armors like that could have been a nice addition.But in the end I had a good time and quite enjoyed myself.			"

												I've played every Gothic game out, and I've enjoyed all of them. I did enjoy this one as well, but, not quite as much. That being said, I'm still hoping for Gothic 5. The game seems to start in a fairly narrow area, that grows to a fairly large map, and then tapers down. I guess maybe the design was intentional. Once you are off the beginning stage, where the story is set and you learn the combat etc. you end up on a very open map, with plenty to do, and explore, I enjoyed it. As it goes on closer to the end, the maps tend to close off more and more to make you follow a path. I wish the end had been more like the middle. The NPC's have the same face, There must have been a lot of NPC inbreeding going on in that game. No hotties, not even one Hot character. I was disappointed in that. However, I did take a day off work to finish because in the end, i was ready to finish it and see what happened. The end was a very hard battle, but the just went to credits with no real closure. I think it could have been done better. All in all, I enjoyed it and if you like RPGs that let you play alone and work at your pace. It's a pretty good game.			"

												For a game that got mixed reviews, I'm on the side of the more positive. As a fan of the older Gothic games, I was glad to see another Gothic game come around. After playing both XBox and PC versions of this game, hands down the PC version is the best. Not because of the better graphics, but the menus as well. On the console, the menus were kind of a pain to use and not thought out very well, whereas the PC version had easy to use menus. The game just felt as if it was designed to be played on the PC rather than a console. One thing that striked me as odd was the disapearing foliage. I understand something like that if there's no machine that can handle playing it, but why have this in a game at all? It really felt out of place, AND a menu option didn't show up for it until I messed with the game settings saved on my hard drive....just odd..The overall story was very good, but lacked substance. Not because it was a bad story, but because the game didn't do a very good job of explaining it to you. I had to play through the game to completion before I could get an overview of the story and why you do what you do. Still, I don't understand half of it, and had to actually read about it.The gameplay is by far the most outstanding portion of this title. I really enjoy the combat in this game as it just feels more free than your standard hotkey RPG like most MMOs. Hotkeys are present, but their more for selecting weapons and skills rather than combat.Overall, I give a 7.5/10. If you're a hardcore RPG fan and a fan of the older Gothic games, I recommend picking up this title. It's worth the $20.			"

												This game is definitely more of a casual RPG, but it's a lot of fun. There isn't a whole ton of places you can go outside of where they want you to go, but they do a great job making you feel like the world is semi-open, and there are definitely choices you can make. The graphics are pretty sweet, the gameplay is decently fun but not overly complicated (the game play is sort of like FPS diablo you can't really do much besides attack or block or roll out of the way). The sound and music is quite good, and the voice over acting is also quite decent. Yes, certain NPC character models are recycled and same with voices, but it's not a big deal. I think the land is beautiful and the levels are very well designed. I would love to see this title evolve into a modern engine in 2015, with similar gameplay but maybe a little more difficulty.I'd recommend this for some casual RPG play. The skills system is interesting and can provide for maybe 3-4 different builds of characters: warrior, archer, mage, alchemist. It'd take some elaborating but creative games could play the game a few times through I think. I've not finished the game yet but I think I will eventually. It would be great if there were some mods that would make this game a little more hardcore; like there is no encumberance or weight to the inventory so you can literally just pick up hundreds of everything without consequence. The pace in which the main character moves makes me grateful for this. Also, jumping and colision detection is kind of goofy you can jump like off of a small hill and sustain some damage from that height. It feels like jumping physics are a little weird with the gravity too. There are invisible walls that can't be traversed (and that's OK IMO, even Skyrim has this kind of thing) the weird thing here in this game is the way the character is like caught on the wall, and skies invisibly like floating/skating away from the wall (to prevent him from getting stuck)? It's a little weird and it ruins the immersive feeling of the rest of the game which is pretty decent.I'm playing an archer/melee guy (leveling my Precision first then I'll do Discipline) and it's fun, I find the balance to be pretty decent. The main issue I have with the difficulty is that the game is almost too generous with healing items, I have over a hundred things in my inventory right now at level 9 that can heal me almost completely in addition to items I've got equipped that boost my time lapsed health regeneration. This is where the casual side comes in.The issue is that casual would be a little more acceptable if the story was better, but the story is just fair. The main character has a decent plot line and the idea that we're going to stop a war and save the country eventually is kind of plain but fun to play through. But the game doesn't have enough meat on it's bones in between the main plot points. The side missions are fun, and I really enjoy my time playing through all the various quests just grinding. Others might not though.Anyway I'd recommend this game to people who would enjoy a casual RPG-esque adventure through a beautifully rendered world who don't thrive on difficult game engines and are in for more of a Choose Your Own Adventure++ FPS with some RPG bits thrown in. It's definitely worth the money I paid and I'm glad I bought the game.I'm really interested to see what this developer could do with a modern RPG. It's no Skyrim, but it's worth playing if you approach it knowing it won't wow you but give you sufficient entertainment and a steady pace to make you feel heroic even if being a little too easy.

												It's not a spectacular game, but the real gem in games like the Gothic series is that they aren't blockbuster spectacularus; they're small, nearly indy titles of some decent acclaim that you can find your own little niches in and enjoy.  The graphics in this particular title carry a lot of love.  Sure, compared to the rest of the series, it's a bit easier and more casual, but for what's here, it's fun.  Don't expect big things; just know its genre, pull up a seat, spend a weekend and go with it.  It might just be enjoyable.			"

I wouldn't recomend it, but at the same time i wouldn't think less of any one who likes it. If you are interested in this game i would suggest Fable lost chapters over it as it does much of what arcania tries to do, but better. (also just as a note fable is 5 years older than arcania)			"

												I've played every Gothic game out, and I've enjoyed all of them. I did enjoy this one as well, but, not quite as much. That being said, I'm still hoping for Gothic 5. The game seems to start in a fairly narrow area, that grows to a fairly large map, and then tapers down. I guess maybe the design was intentional. Once you are off the beginning stage, where the story is set and you learn the combat etc. you end up on a very open map, with plenty to do, and explore, I enjoyed it. As it goes on closer to the end, the maps tend to close off more and more to make you follow a path. I wish the end had been more like the middle. The NPC's have the same face, There must have been a lot of NPC inbreeding going on in that game. No hotties, not even one Hot character. I was disappointed in that.

												Ok, I liked the Gothic series.  I even liked the critically panned Gothic 3, possibly even more than the first two.  I am also a fan of simple RPGs; I don't need graphics and complex combat systems.  I really can't find much positive about ArcaniA.  Every quest is ""go get this thing for me then the blocked passage will magically open.""  The combat is inexact and unoriginal.  The voice acting is so bad I had to mute it a couple times and there are only about four different faces for all of the NPCs (learn the names because they all look the same).  Maybe if I can force myself through it, the story will make up for it, but thus far the story line is unoriginal.  It is too bad that this game effectively killed an entire franchise.  Maybe Risen will be able to advance the mantle.			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												Overall Score 4/10.This game ended up in my library as part of some bundle, and I felt it was my duty to complete the game. A somewhat spiritual successor to the Gothic series, Arcania attempts to be an open-world RPG. Only, without the open world.I played through the game using a mouse and keyboard but the game is also playable using a controller if you prefer, although I wouldn't recommend it as the controls are awkward and some functions are absent.The story line is generic fantasy fare but is servicable to the game. The voice acting is sub-par, the controls are shonky, and the writing is just outright terrible, even laughable in places.Despite this, the game manages to be completely playable and suprisingly bug-free.Arcania does nothing out of the ordinary and nothing particularly well. Even if you're a fan of the Gothic series, I'd recommend skipping this one unless you absolutely have nothing better to do with your time.			"

												If you liked the RPG elements in Gothic, prepare to be disappionted.If you liked the progression in Gothic, prepare to be disappionted.If you liked the combat, the world, the quests and every thing else that made Gothic Gothic, prepare to be really disappointed.When ArcaniA (back then also called Gothic 4/ a Gothic tale) came out, I expected the old gothic feeling with improvements. What we got was an oversimplified RPG with a mediocre story at best that has not even a bit depth like the previous ones. The combat is very easy, making dying the more challenging task even on the ultimate ""gothic"" difficulty. I made it through the game first just using my two-hand-weapon and left swinging them to death and sometimes rolling to become invincible to projectiles like spells and arrows or to dodge melee attacks that sometimes hit you for no reason. After 1/2 of the game I got tired of this dull combat and just walked through the masses of enemies which works until you hit a forced encounter or a locked door and then you can just kill the 2-3 enemies that are still behind you.Instead of an interessting world with many great, optional characters and a lot to do, we have linear enviroment (it is literally a chain of somewhat open areas that needs the completing of the main quest part to advance to the next chainlink) with the same character models being reused over and over again. Instead of being able to attack any NPC, you can only duel some for a quest and else they noclip through your attacks; instead of being able to choose a fraction, you are being forced onto one line to obey; instead of being able to get reputation in a city, all quests are either fully optional for gear or are needed for the progression aka the main quest; instead of being able to get into city fights with you leading the rebels against a whole army of orcs, you are a lone wolf and any NPC will refuse to interact while you are in combat.Only good things are the graphics (for its age) and the small learning curve, if you are into casual RPGs. Not worth the time. Better get an old one and get community patches for them.			"

												(I played this game for 30+ hours on PS3)This game is decent, but likeable. -The combat is okay-The story is decent enough-The world feels alive. -Voice acting is bearable.-With very few armor sets, customization is not a huge factor. -While fairly linear (by zone), the areas are still big enough to satisfy a semi-open world. -Enemies are good only in late game (damn bugs!) -Very low replay valueWhat really kept me engaged was the character of the game. It is obviously not a huge budget title, but definately worth up to $20 I'd say. If you are looking for a decent RP game to play for cheap, this is it.			"

												For some reason I bought Arcania around the time it came out.  I was in a weird place and was starved for crpgs.  I was ignorant of better, older games, other than the time I played the demo for the original Gothic as a kid.  See, for some reason, they stopped calling this game Gothic 4, and when played, it is apparent.  There is way less customization, and while there are hub worlds, they aren't as open and interesting as something like Risen.Arcania is not a bad game, but by trying to shoehorn it into the Gothic universe they upset alot of people.  Again, this is coming from the perspective of someone who never had any experience with Gothic before this.  While the game isn't total garbage, it isn't really any good either.  Combat feels clunky, character options are rather limited, the story is... completely forgettable.If you want a game like this, but better and still relatively modern, go buy the first Risen.  I'm still not sure why I beat this nothing game...			"

												Fan of the Gothic series?  Splendid.  You should be.Want a more immersive experience playing what many feel to be a sub-par RPG?  Why wouldn't you?Do yourself a favor: turn off Quest Markers, Health Bars, Overhead Feedback, Enemy Captions, and Feedback Bar.  This will improve the experience and make the journey feel pretty close to past Gothic games.  Thank you, Spellbound, for giving us the option to turn off these hand-holding aberrations.Oh yeah, play the game on Hard difficulty, at least.Now, a few good points:- A meaty feel to combat (I went two-handed + bow & arrow), including excellent sound design reflecting type of weapon impacting ""flesh"" type of enemy.  Hitting a golem with a sword or warhammer will produce distinct sounds, hitting a wolf with a sword or axe will produce distinct sounds- Great soundtrack, as has always been the case with the Gothic Series- Lots of armor sets, a ton of weapons, an absurd amount of items to craft of each type (foodstuffs, potions, weapons, armor, amulets, etc.)- UI-friendly inventory - Meaningless interactibles:  you can take short naps, saw tree trunks, watch Nameless play goblin drums, pray, rotate rotisseries, take bong hits, and more- Good story... at times odd, quirky dialogue, decent voice acting, and, of course...seeing old friendsA few bad points:- Clones, clones, yeah....clones- Fetch quests, lots of them- The ""world"" can feel empty at times- Crafting can be done anytime/anywhere.  You're no longer required to be at an Alchemy Table to brew potions, no longer need to be at a stove or campfire to cook, no longer need to do any blacksmithing- Skill tree is underwhelming- The last few hours of the game is a tedious and total slaughterfestIn closing, ArcaniA can still feel like Gothic, if you let it.  I did, and I enjoyed the 39 hours I put into this game.  Recommended.			"

Why wouldn't you?Do yourself a favor: turn off Quest Markers, Health Bars, Overhead Feedback, Enemy Captions, and Feedback Bar.  This will improve the experience and make the journey feel pretty close to past Gothic games.  Thank you, Spellbound, for giving us the option to turn off these hand-holding aberrations.Oh yeah, play the game on Hard difficulty, at least.Now, a few good points:- A meaty feel to combat (I went two-handed + bow & arrow), including excellent sound design reflecting type of weapon impacting ""flesh"" type of enemy.  Hitting a golem with a sword or warhammer will produce distinct sounds, hitting a wolf with a sword or axe will produce distinct sounds- Great soundtrack, as has always been the case with the Gothic Series- Lots of armor sets, a ton of weapons, an absurd amount of items to craft of each type (foodstuffs, potions, weapons, armor, amulets, etc.)- UI-friendly inventory - Meaningless interactibles:  you can take short naps, saw tree trunks, watch Nameless play goblin drums, pray, rotate rotisseries, take bong hits, and more- Good story... at times odd, quirky dialogue, decent voice acting, and, of course...seeing old friendsA few bad points:- Clones, clones, yeah....clones- Fetch quests, lots of them- The ""world"" can feel empty at times- Crafting can be done anytime/anywhere.  You're no longer required to be at an Alchemy Table to brew potions, no longer need to be at a stove or campfire to cook, no longer need to do any blacksmithing- Skill tree is underwhelming- The last few hours of the game is a tedious and total slaughterfestIn closing, ArcaniA can still feel like Gothic, if you let it.  I did, and I enjoyed the 39 hours I put into this game.  Recommended.			"

												ArcaniA, a controversial game within the community. ArcaniA is set in the world of the infamous Gothic series, but should not be considered as the next installment, but rather as its own game.It has a decent, average story and characters, but great areas and landscapes. Visual aspect and atmosphere were well done, back when it first came out, I was impressed. Another huge plus is the combat system. It is fluent and dynamic, which made it all the more satisfying and enjoyable to fight against enemies.Character progression was kept quite simple, focusing on your average, casual players. Might not have hurt to go more in depth, maybe by giving us a couple more extra options to improve the character, separating stats and skills. But it didn't bother me that much.It is not an open world game, which is not a bad thing, but the different areas could have profited from more indepth side quest and stories, maybe by adding various dungeons. Equipments are somewhat neglected, and not as thought out as I had hoped. Could have combined epic loot or rare reccources with side quests to get or to create all kinds of different armors and weapons, or make us overall more dependent on the crafting system. I believed I used it once to create ""Innos's sword"" at the end. More weapons and armors like that could have been a nice addition.But in the end I had a good time and quite enjoyed myself.			"

												For some reason I bought Arcania around the time it came out.  I was in a weird place and was starved for crpgs.  I was ignorant of better, older games, other than the time I played the demo for the original Gothic as a kid.  See, for some reason, they stopped calling this game Gothic 4, and when played, it is apparent.  There is way less customization, and while there are hub worlds, they aren't as open and interesting as something like Risen.Arcania is not a bad game, but by trying to shoehorn it into the Gothic universe they upset alot of people.  Again, this is coming from the perspective of someone who never had any experience with Gothic before this.  While the game isn't total garbage, it isn't really any good either.  Combat feels clunky, character options are rather limited, the story is... completely forgettable.If you want a game like this, but better and still relatively modern, go buy the first Risen.  I'm still not sure why I beat this nothing game...			"

												(I played this game for 30+ hours on PS3)This game is decent, but likeable. -The combat is okay-The story is decent enough-The world feels alive. -Voice acting is bearable.-With very few armor sets, customization is not a huge factor. -While fairly linear (by zone), the areas are still big enough to satisfy a semi-open world. -Enemies are good only in late game (damn bugs!) -Very low replay valueWhat really kept me engaged was the character of the game. It is obviously not a huge budget title, but definately worth up to $20 I'd say. If you are looking for a decent RP game to play for cheap, this is it.			"

												I played this after having played Risen, and so in many ways it felt like more of the same, except the differences between the two, while small, made them completely different games. It actually felt more like playing a new Source Engine shooter in that respect - everything is familiar, the guns all do the same ♥♥♥♥, and all your settings are the same, but you love it because it feels comfortable. And that's exactly how I'd describe this game in one word: Comfortable. If you've played Risen or Ego Draconis or something similar, and enjoyed it, you will enjoy this. Only real flaw in the game is the whole, ""I'm going to try keep you in the map by making you slide off ♥♥♥♥ when you do parkour"", mechanic. In one instance it sent me back to a spot that was going to take hours to run back to, where the map doubled back on itself. It didn't work in Risen, it didn't work in Arcania, and it better ♥♥♥♥ing not be in Risen 2...			"

												Original review - Recommended:Its not Gothic but its ok .. it is good for what it is, a linear rpg, meaning just follow whatever advice and direction npc's gave you and you'll save a lot of time from unnecessary exploring .. whatever it is, it kept me entertained so far ..Latest Review:Total played time when I wrote the original review = 6.0 hrsTotal played time when I wrote this review today = 6.0 hrsConclusion: It only managed to kept me entertained and interested for 6 hrs. I've stopped played when found some texture glitch (people has black face) couple with framerate drop make me lost  interest. Considering that those glitch will never be fixed, I would not recommended this game. There are lot more better RPG out there.			"

												For all you Skyrim fanatics out there, be sure to check out the Gothic series. One of the first of its kind in which sword figting is controled fully by the keyboard to make for smooth and amazing fight scenes. Check it out! Currently there are 4 titles spanning back over the past several years.			"

												Terrible everything, just stay away. Console game where the menus/inventory don't work with a controller, environment shadows showing through character's skin, terrible voice acting, mouse input is laggy somehow, camera is weird and too fast, but the cursor is extremely slow in the menus.Everything is laughable.
