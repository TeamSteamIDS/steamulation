												剧情还是和前作那样有趣搞笑，游戏系统和前作没有本质上的变化，玩法上仅仅是多了开船和多结局。Fun and happy as usual, but the game system still simple as usual too. Now you can sail and choose your ending.			"

												...in a life's journey paved in blood, and steel, and bacon...This game is the definition of 'hilarious'. There are so many great jokes and fun moments in this game, you simply can't stop playing it. Of course the gameplay, art style, musics and voice acting being really good helps too. I strongly recommend both this and the first one. They're both equally funny and awesome!			"

												Deathspank Thongs of Virtue. More of the same. Exactly the same. Same gameplay, Same UI, Same items. Same enemies. More thongs. Many more thongs.As much as a sequel can often be completely worthless because in an attempt to innovate and streamline it loses what made the original so great the opposite is also true. A sequel that does nothing new whatsoever will often feel hollow and foolish.Deathspank Thongs of virtue is one such sequel. It's a very simple action RPG that relies heavily on a quirky sense of humor that attempts to poke fun at the RPG genre in general. Unfortunately while the humor and silly art-style could carry the first game both have been worn quite thin by now and you are left with just the shallow action RPG that form the base of Deathspank's gameplay.Nothing has changed other than the story and if you have already played the original Deathspank this won't be much different.You should note, this game has a game breaking bug that corrupts your savegame if you exit the game at certain locations. The developers fixed the bug but never shared the update on STEAM. You have go find it yourself on the Steam forums and manually fix your savegame. Guess EA is rubbing off on them.Not really a game I'd recommend buying if you already played Deathspank. If you're new to the series you can safely pick either although playing both will be a stretch.			"

												DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue is a terrific game.  The exploring and adventure of the maps is extremely fun, and the dialogue is even better.  It is a goofy game, but it is not so goofy that it ruins the finer points of the game.  It is just the right amount of ridiculousness mixed with the right amount of seriousness (in the missions) to be a perfect game.  Also, this game has virtually no bugs (at least I have not noticed any), and the gameplay is extremely fun.  I bought this game 4 years ago, and never got around to playing it until this past Saturday.  When I started playing it Saturday, I immediately got hooked.  I am usually not interested in RPG/Adventure type games, but this game just blew me away.  In my opinion, if you like RPGs, you should buy this game immediately.			"

												I was happy to hear more DeathSpank would be coming. Thongs Of Virtue is basically more of the same, which is great. The new content includes new weapons (assault rifles, bazookas, etc.), enemies and of course many environments to explore, but the formula stays the same. It also has a great deal of fetch quests and grinding, which can be kind of tedious if you play longer sessions, but all things considered, Thongs Of Virtue is on par with its predecessor!Personal playtime total: 20 hours			"

												Honestly it dont find this game to be any better than the first one if any thing i personally found the first game more fun.That being said  this game was still very fun to play albeit slightly more difficult than the first.The classic deathspank humour is still here and is just as good as before the story line is funny which i love the game play is for the most part very smooth (some little problems here and there)Bearly anything was changed this game other than the introduction of grenades and guns for the most part the weapon types are exactly the same and i liked that.The biggest problem i have with this game is the sudden difficulty spike that happens out of nowhere early on the same problem was in the first game as well as in both games i found leveling was tediously slow at the start and you kept getting rewards in the ways of new weapons and armour that are a level above what you currently are at the time and then you get shoved in to fighting enemies that can basically 2 hit kill you. Best thing i  found was to lure 1 enemy away form the rest kill it and repeat. If you have a friend with you who can play that makes it much easier ( the rainbow heal)once you can muscle past the difficulty spike the game goes back to having the proper difficulty curve it should have and continues feeling fair againAnother problem i had was teleporting with the outhouses the 10second odd wait after you teleport before you can move gets annoying as it throws you out of the flow of playing.Overall 7/10			"

												I love the stupid humor in this game. I love the stupid quests and stupid story. And I love the stupid characters.But the gameplay is weak. The combat system is clunky, repetitive, boring after a while. There will come a time when the fun from the humor will be defeated by the weak mechanics. After the that point, the game becomes bigger and bigger pain.I would buy it on sale and enjoy it while the fun lasts.			"

												DeathSpanks forte is the dialogue, but since I played the first game recently I found myself clicking myself through it a bit too fast in this follow-up. The added feature of ranged weapons would be nicer if the range wasn't ridiculous compared to blast radius and if you could actually see a longer distance in maps. I found myself dying more from my own grenades than anything else due to the extremely poor handling of such items. Still, it was a worthwhile playthrough with a nice conclusion to the Thong story.

												Picking up where the first game left off this Deathspank contains the same ridiculous humour. The game play is quite altered by the use of a huge number of consumable items, including ranged weapons and the corresponding lack of consistantly usable versions of the same. The story makes it all worth it though and despite the odd annoyances I fought to the end.			"

												The Dispenser of Justice, Vanquisher of Evil, and Hero to the Downtrodden, DeathSpank, is back! This time our hero journeys on the quest for the Thongs of Virtue. The game embodies a variety of classic RPG elements, tons of loot, quests and the same humorous touch we got used to in the first episode. If you liked the first DeathSpank, you'll also enjoy this one. + Funny storyline + Funny take on protagonist + Classic RPG elements+ Tons of loot, quests, and a multitude of equipment combos/sets+ Easy Achievements+  Local Co-op- No Trading Cards (Emotes/Backgrounds)Personal Ranking: 8/10 "

												Humor is all this game has going for it. The graphics are interesting, but the way the world scrolls into the background is annoying, and at times claustrophobic. The boss battles can be fun, but they can also be insanely frustrating. The game world is utterly linear. There are side missions you can accomplish, but they are all in the same teeny tiny area, and don't really net you much reward.If this has a demo, check it out, but otherwise, avoid it unless it's on sale for under $5. Thank heavens I didn't pay the full price for this, or I'd feel somehow obligated to suffer through it all.			"

												This is the second Deathspank game I have played until the end. The original Deathspank was fun, it had repetitive combat, alright controls with a controller and a good variety of quests. It was only 7 hours long though.This game is about 10 to 15 hours long if you complete all the sidequests, so that's an improvement. Where it fails, is that I played it with a keyboard and a mouse and it was a pain to control my character! It felt clunky, I had to hold shift to attack enemies behind objects, I missclicked some dynamite crates, I unequiped items by mistake... Etc.The humour was O.K. at best compared to the first one, I laughed alot less in Thongs of Virtue. A good bunch of quests and dialogues were copied from the old game and many of the old characters were re-used too. This game was easier than the first and requires alot more backtracking. I have to say that the bosses in this one are better than the first game though.Overall, it's not the best game i've ever played, it's worth playing... But, I personally didin't like the second one too much. I would have rather sticked with my memory from playing the first Deathspank than completing Thongs of Virtue and being disapointed.			"

												Did you play the original Death Spank? Then you played Thongs of Virture.For anyone who hasn’t played the original Deathspank, it was a comedy aRPG that I really enjoyed and you can read some of my thoughts on it here:After the original, I was super excited to get into Thongs of Virtue and continue my epic, hilarious quest. Unfortunately, after booting it up I realized that I had essentially just restarted Deathspank from scratch; and after playing for a while I had lost all interest in the charm of the characters and the writing. Thongs of Virtue was quite a disappointment coming from the original Deathspank with such a positive experience. If you haven’t played either title, I would recommend waiting for a sale and just buying whichever one is cheapest.			"

												Very similar to the original with some dull quests but all in all a pretty damned fun game, as good as the 1st? Well yeah but no better			"

												More DeathSpank, more laughs to be had. Though it wears a tad thin after a while, it's still a recommended playtrough for fans of the original.			"

												This game is anything but serious. The storyline is so silly and the weapons are so weird you got to love this game for it! Genius gamemechanics and a lot of challenge (Of course compared to the difficulty that has been set to begin with). An awesome game to play and laugh at!			"

												The game was fun until the savegame bugged out and now I can't progress. I spent 10 hrs on it and was really close to the end. If it were not for the buggy state of the game(others having issues with this and other things) I would highly reccomend it, but now I would say don't touch it as you will be flipping a coin on if it will bug or not.

												Excellent for those with a silly sense of humor...which I am fortunate to possess.  In fact, I would recommend this to anyone without a sense of humor as you might just get one :D  Here's hoping ;) .....			"

												Really fun ARPG that improves on the original. If you like hack-n-slash games with RPG elements and tons of loot, this is definitely a game to try.			"

												This game is freaking awesome!  From the creator of the two first Monkey Island game comes a Diablo-style RPG with great humour!  A must-play!			"
