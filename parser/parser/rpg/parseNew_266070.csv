												The Good: It will satisfy your RPG thirst... for a while (about 20-30 hours until you hit a grind wall or a realization of a huge game flaw which will be explained later in this review).  The story is decent.  It isn't your cliche cookie cutter story out of a rpg recycling bin, and is good enough to come back for more. There are lots of quests to do, besides the main story line.  In fact, later on, most of the leveling will occur from doing sidequests rather than the main questline.  At any time of the day, there will be a global event for you to participate in and earn gold or gear.  There is a guild system and a PVP system.  There are 2 types of PVP, which I find pretty ingenious.  The first is your regular PVP combat... the more powerful character wins.  The second is where the game equalizes the playing field for both characters.  In other words, a lvl 50 character vs a lvl 10 haracter will have the same exact stats.  This helps newbies become acclimated to the combat system.  THe PVP system is also implemented in a variety of ways.  There are 2v2, 3v3, 1v1 equalized PVP duels.  There are guild wars.  There is a regular 1v1 pvp based on the strength of your character with the AI controlling the opponet.The Bad:It's... yes, you guessed it, a godamn pay to win. I have added a few of the top players (ranked in PVP and level) how they attained their current statuses.  One told me she paid $1000 (no I counted the zeroes correcly) and the top 2 paid over $2k. The items that are purchasable only with electrum (the in game currency only obtainable through cash) are ultra end game gear that have no level requirement.  It takes about a little over $100 USD to gather most of it.  (If you want all of the gear, itll be an upwards of 200, excluding armor upgrades which can become very costly.)  What's worse is that this gear is unobtainable anywhere else.  You MUST pay.  While other games may offer xp boosts, temporary gold gain boosts, or a sweet aesthetic item (like leagues of legends), this game falls within the very definition of pay to win: exclusive ultra gear for those who drop money. (Even Leagues lets you eventually buy champions if you grind hard enough. This game doesn't.)Sadly, it rewards this type of behavior.  Those who pay money, even get to claim more rewards for charging their credit cards.  Consequently, this Pay to Win encouragement totally destroys the guild PVP system out of the water due to the higher tier companies having members who have paid their way to glory.  Aside from the major pay to win flaw, there are other faults with the game.  Item customization is very lackluster.  While there are color rankings for rarity, there is no INHERENT customization of stats.  E.G. Diablo 2 had great item customization in terms of different rare items providing alternate stats to skills and even helped characters gain abilities.  For CoS, the rarer the weapon, the stronger the stat.  Each item adds one stat. (Yes, just one stat... different pieces of gear add different stats)  Item customization is minimal. SO is the skill system. Over the course of your gameplay your character will receive 5 more skills on top of 3 default ones.  You unlock a skill every 5 or 10 levels.  When you do unlock a new skill: you are given a choice of 3 different skills that do different higs.  You pick one and level it up as you progress.  This means, the game has 15 different skills for each character.... as I said, builds are not very diverse.  This is not like D2 where there are vastly different builds... a different build varies by 2 skills. THATS IT.Gameplay is unresponsive and at times, is severely handicappd by lag.  Lag is a reocurring problem as there are only 2 servers.. both located in the US.  As you begin playing, the pay to win problems will be masked by the fact that there are just so many evets abvailable for you to do.  However, as you begin to gain a decent grasp of what the game offers, you slowly realize the huge, lingering grind wall in front of you.  The novelty wears off, and the tedium of grinding begins.  Main quests are the same: dungeon clearing with a boss at the end.   This is when you start searching for alternate methods of lveling faster, as it begins increasingly difficult to reach the next level.  This is where you fall trapped to the pay to win scheme. You begin to think bout spending real cash on offers such as""brand new ultra gear!"" ""Tired of being ♥♥♥♥♥? SPend 200 dolars and become awesome!""Bottom Line: The game is pure pay to win.  Unbearably and horribly pay to win. Stay away.  It encourages the behaviour with rewards for those who spend money.  Not worth your time. Spend your time elsewhere looking for another RPG.  Not here.			"

												This isn't the game that we have supported back in the day, with a deep background and steampunk themed hack'n'slash MMO. This is yet another Korean Grinding game with tons of illusions of choices, with lots of cheap rewarding systems that are actually other ways to make you pay. - This isn't the project that we've backed, loved and cared. This isn't the Great Mechanism that we've wanted to play on. This isn't City of Steam.Something happened to City of Steam Project in its early days, when Mechanist Games gave their publishing rights to R2 Games. They issued a Regional Ban, caused serious problems in community and they couldn't maintain the game as it was. Eventually, Mechanist Games got the rights to publish City of Steam back and renamed the game as Arkadia; We hoped that it would end the nightmare and actually make this whole project something.But, they choose to become a Browser Game that has an Energy System to make you pay for almost everything. Don't know what has changed since then, but as I've played after about a year, I didn't see anything new, or at least something for me to care as I've cared about it before, but more fake rewarding systems.You can play it, without playing it, by the way. You would just push a button and the game would play itself. - Point? None. I wish things would be a lot more different than this, Dave. Your universe had so much potential.And, for god's sake, what happened to the Soundtrack Album? It was composed beautifully; Now, you have a fake Intro Music that is NOTHING compared to City of Steam's old Main Theme.Update - Absolutely nothing has changed. I mean, literally, nothing has changed. This one's also probably going to join the Uncontinued Club, pretty soon.			"

												I started playing City of Steam: Arkadia mostly due to the fact that it was a Steampunk based MMORPG with the fantasy touch that I enjoy added in. The story at the start was interesting and easy to follow, and it held my interest long enough for me to get to level 20 something as one character - which depending on the MMO you play can range from super easy to down right difficult.Now, let's get down to the nitty gritty.../PROS/* Steampunk, Steampunk everywhere. Glorious top hats, goggles, corsets, and a Steambike! * The Story - It has a story, I'll give it that, and one that's actually interesting enough to keep me curious about the next chapter.* Easy-to-get Costume Items - While they do give some perks, via set bonuses or on their own - they are easy to get with daily log on and your 5 free lesser items and your 1 free better item, and if you keep opening those, you eventually can open more boxes to get a chance at the rare set.* Different Battle Options for Classes. I like this, but at the same time it doesn't really do much when half of your ability to kill things depends on your gear that you're actively using.* Mercenaries. A good idea, pretty nice at low level./CONS/* Graphics - They're not all that great, but considering it's a Free MMO, there's not too much you can do [aside from maybe polishing it up, I guess?]* Music/sounds - Music makes a lot of the game for me, and if I have to turn off all sounds just so the game is remotely bareable, then that's a huge issue.* Auto-Battle - While this could be a good thing, it's not. You can set yourself to AFK level and get through things [if you're high enough of a level and item-set] and never talk to anyone in the game ever. If that's your thing, go ahead.* The amount of difficulty ramps up /quickly/. I'm all for a hard game, but when you have an auto-battle system in place, you're pretty much saying ""Press button to win"" and if you're not paying complete attention to how your gear is set up and when you're using potions, you will die pretty fast, even with things being done for you. The dungeons and other areas aren't marked off by level restrictions like most other games, but by item restrictions. If you don't meet them, even by a mere 20 points, you will be killed off. * Limited Character Customization. This one is self explanitory, but even WoW has more customization in comparison to this game.* Pay-to-Win - Like I stated about difficulty, it ramps up hard if your gear doesn't meet the requirements. Funny thing - If I remember right, Costumes add to that. You can buy really good costume armor and weapons and just glide your way through a good chunk of the game. This also includes Bike skins, pets that also give you stats, as well as mercenaries that can wreck things.* Mercenaries - These guys can make or break you too, as /they/ are also figured into your relative ability to kill things fast so you don't die, even as a tank class.In short - Play at your own risk, this game has more Cons than Pros.

												Here is the main problem with this game. It basically plays itself. Everytime you click on your quest tracker to take you to where you need to go, it will do so, which is fine and all until you get to where it wants you to ""complete the dungeon objective."" Then it puts you into ""Auto Combat"" which you can turn off and fight on your own, but why is that even a thing? Why have a game that can play itself and allow you to just sit and use potions while the game fights for you?The game is also still buggy in the tutorial section. I kept dying repeatedly against one of the first bosses because i got stuck on absolutely nothing and kept getting pulled back and forth to the same spot so I had to keep relogging before it finally stopped doing that.All in all, the game has a good idea for what it was going to be when it was in pre-alpha but something made the devs change their minds or something to make it like it is now with the ""hold your hand"" combat system and still many bugs to be found. Definitally not worth my time anymore unless they fix the problems.			"

												This game is in a huge make-over from a nice game to a heavily P2W game. Current features are being changed, just to lure people in spending more. Good example would be the mercenary system. The first one was unique, simple and works nicely. Right now they've copy+pasted a feature from R2Games (company that's only out on people's money), changed the looks, and that's the new mercenary system. Giving players the option to get a orange (best) mercenary for 3 dollars. While players that doesn't spend probably get that chance just once or twice a day. After that they changed the pet system. Now they changed Daily Goals.Further every single patch they update, it contains so many bugs that it just makes anyone sick. Sometimes even leads to exploiting. Half of the time people get away with it. Other half people getting banned. The game is just being developed and run by amateurs. Probably interns/externs working on a game. Even lacking on simple math and logic.			"

												I've seen this game a couple times around the web, and had good hopes for this game......turns out it was nearly anything but good, wich really made me sad.Only 'good' things i could fint, was the setting. Magitech/steampunk is fun...but that was about it.VERY heavy pay2win model, big subscriber advantages, buy yourself to rank 1 in cash shop if you got the dough, and at base just another bland, linear, hotkey based hack'n slash-ish mmo without anything really new or intuitive. Oh, open pvp anywhere at level10+ for those who could actually LIKE being stomped around every other minute by heavy cashers/endgamers.Yes I may have <1h played, but there's a lot to understand by simply exploring the menus and experience with similar games...So, with this, I say farewell to this game, and will never come back.

												I'm going to be honest...I kind of liked this game, at the start. Steampunk and fantasy, what could go wrong? And at the start, it was quite fun, seemed like good story...until you get to Arkadia. It doesn't take long for the game to get repetetive. In fact, to level up all you need to do is log into the game and claim daily prizes, that's about it. Fighting is routine, just mash hordes of monsters. As a player of MMOs such as Dungeons & Dragons Online and The Lord of the Rings Online, I had high hopes for City of Steam.Alas, while it was cool in the beginning...it gets boring once you get to the main city in the game. There's not much storyline after the intro, and you can't do much in the way of exploring. The races are balanced, the concept of the game is very promising...but if you're intending on playing it past the intro, I can't suggest it. All it's good for in the end is going into a dungeon and killing hordes of bugs and mechanical annoyances, which aren't that hard to beat. Even the bosses are easy to take down. As a player of MMOs, I was hoping for more actual fighting and...well, being able to explore the world.As much as I wish I could, I can't recommend this game. Does the story show promise? Yes. Could the game have been more than it is? Yes. The sad part is the developers didn't take that route, and City of Steam: Arkadia seems like it's vastly unfinished in terms of story and exploration.

												If you go to the website of the game you will see that the last update to the news was almost 1 YEAR ago. The forums are overrun with spam posts made by spambots and there is no attempt being made to clean them up. Obviously, a bad sign. The sub-reddit for the game is also dead. The last posts were ages ago and no developer presence whatsoever. While the game isn't terrible, there is obviously no one left working on it. It's in the barest form of maintenance mode which is the surest sign of a death spiral for an MMO.Edit January 22nd - And now it's officially dead. Confirmed that the game is being shutdown on the 31st of January. Pretty damn short notice.			"

												The idea of a steam punk game, drew me into checking it out. Once in game, you get lost in the clutter of the areas.There isn't a nav to point you to your next mission destination. The missions you do get most enemies or bosses are very OVER POWERED,to ensure pay 2 win happens. I hadn't fallen victum to this guise of a money pit. Once, I realized the true motives of this game and observed no real f2p capablity to progress I stopped attempting to pay. I say attemptinig because I never realy got far into the game.The UI and map design,aren't unique, and attention drawling to keep your from falling asleep. When you get killed on low levels so many times, giving up is your only option with out going bankrupt. I have this crappy game still on my desktop , only to remind me of how disgustingly rushed a game can be developed. Also, because I want to always remind myself to really stop being optimistic of new games, specifically because it is my time, i'm wasting on playing. LAST THING I WANT TO DO, IS TO BE GETTING FRUSTRATED. ESPECIALLY ABOUT HOW POOR QUALITY OF A GAME, I JUST PICKED COULD BE. My advice to anyone out there reading this ,is always read the reviews of a game before you try and play it. If its not completely positive reviews then its not worth your time and anger over. Good luck, and I would say skip this one!			"

												1: Total P2W  You can ignore it if you are not going to PVP compete, but then you are stuck killing the same 2 bosses and doing the same 5 dungeons every day. Example: there is event twice a day, everybody fighting big boss. Who deals  more dmg to him wins (first 10 places with rewards). The hilarious thing is you can buy blessings and ressurcections during the event so who spends more wins :D2: Lack of matchmaking: strong ones allowed to fight weak ones. Basically most of arena tourny etc fights otcome are determined before the start. You cannot influence it. Very boring regardless on whiih end u are.3.: You are unable to catch up with players who started playing earlier. If you started to play on new server expect to be merged to the old one in 3 months.I could write really more, but I dont think there is a point. "

												After attempting to enjoy this game for roughly 6 hours, i had to give up.  One thing I found from other reviews was that the game babies you a lot. They do have this thing called ''Hardcore mode'' which is intended to disable the auto combat mechanics that essentially plays the game for you.  However, even when on ''Hardcore mode'', the game is all too boring because you can click on your quest objective and it will literally walk you there by itself. If your objective is far enough away, it even summons your ''mount''  (motorcycle) for you.  This kind of LAZY GAMING is what i despise most in the current world of videogames. Aside from the poor gameplay mechanics, the variety is very lackluster, and in order to get the variety I needed to not be bored, I would have need about 30 more hours of boring grinding to level up a decent amount.  Here are some examples of which I am talking about:4 different classes to play2 starting skills (3 including your auto attack)1 additional skill every 5 ish levels (you have an option of 3 skills evey time)After walking around in game for 6 hours, i noticed that those who had put the effort into leveling up past 40, all looked the same.  The gear had no variety, and speaking without experience, I assume the game rewards those who follow the beaten path, and punishes those with creativity when building your character stats.All in all, I'm sad I wasted my time on this game, but hopefully i can warn others of how boring this game will be after about 2 hours.  This game is sadly free for a reason, because no one would pay to play this on a constant basis.			"

												The weirdest game I was not playing. Even though I was playing it.Like spectating a really bored gamer playing a boring game.To understand what I mean, you need to know that the game features two vital functions:Auto-run to get to quest locations, and auto-combat which will spam all your skills it can and glug any potions you need for either Health or Mana. (called 'Steam' in this game)And that's all you need to know. If you're not fighting or moving, click the quest marker and your character will go there. Upon which they'll then end up fighting if that is required, which is automatised as well. And in general, the game's enemies are simple enough that, all you would have to do anyway is spam your skills. That's all there is to it.The 'selling point' for this game is that it's a mere 50mb. A nice premise, but there are flashgames out there that take less than 1mb and are tremendously more fun than this. Again, there is no reason to not play this game on auto-mode because in 95% of the time, it is the most efficient way. Not to mention that potions are stupidly cheap to buy in mass ammount, and auto-combat includes auto-looting.In fact, whenever you pick up gear that is a straight upgrade to what's equipped, it will prompt you to equip it. Have skillpoints or stat points to spend? The game will remind you of this and offer a convenient 'automatic' button that'll spend these in the amount best suited to your class.Everything in this game is designed to remove any thought process from you. You choose a class, choose a race with a handful of variations, have a VERY basic array of options to change your hair (the face is stuck with the one of the 'race presets' you picked) aaaaand... that's it. Press quest marker to continue.There are games out there that make tremendous usage with little space. They draw you in, even if their style happens to be 8-bit. And then there's games that use very little space, and have absolutely nothing to show for that feat. City of Steam just doesn't bring anything worthwhile to the table.Don't get me wrong, it doesn't do anything particularly horribly bad. If anything, what the game does is simply somewhat sub-par, beneath the commonly accepted standard across the board. This game just enables you to turn it into a lazy man's game, a detriment to an already unimpressive title.Honestly, this shouldn't be on PC. This should just be on iOS and Android and it would flourish like crazy. games that size are not uncommon and it wouldn't be impossible to translate the controls.Maybe it already is on mobile devices, but I'm having a mighty hard time finding it.I would really just say... don't bother with it unless you've got absolutely nothing else to do and you want to spend that free time on something that won't enrage you.But neither will it really engage you.

UPDATE: the game will shut down on january 29th 2016-I came back to this game after a while, mainly for nostalgic reasons. My experience is rather mixed.The environment is wonderful, the story interesting and the in-game universe has a great potential. There's many races to choose from and the way the world works is amazing. Unfortunately, this potential is unfulfilled because so far there's very little difference between the stories of various races and the game itself makes the player focus on other things (mostly PvP). The RPG element is kinda taken away because your dialogue choices don't really matter.However, every steampunk fan should try this game. It's a great inspiration for costumes and/or steampunk props, some armor sets are kinda cool and there's not only steam guns but steam swords too! (not sure how that works but whatever) Plus the soundtrack is A+ and gives the game a nice touch.Possibly the worst thing (or two things) is that it's pay-to-win and if something goes wrong the support won't help you because they're gone. No updates for months, no bug fixes, dead forums. Many players experience problems with loading or other things and there's no response from the devs or anyone. Some people are complaining about the auto-combat feature but it's completely optional. Turn it off.My recommendation would go like this:Try it. Play the game for a while and see how you like it.But don't take it too seriously and don't use your real money on it.TL;DR+ environment and lore+ soundtrack+ skills animations+ detailed weapons/armor+ wheelie on a steambike+/- auto-combat feature (optional)+/- focused on PvP at higher levels- non-existent support- pay-to-win- bugs, bugs, bugs			"

												I gave this game nearly an hour and a half to show that it was something even slightly more than a neat concept, and to say the least, I'm not sure if I can even call this a game. Not even does the tutorial hold your hand with more menus for basic actions just to give you an ""autofight"" ""autolevel"" and ""autoexp"" buttons, and the suprising thing is that the ""auto"" buttons play the game very well, to the extent that you really don't need to actually play it. I left mid quest to get food, came back and I'd leveled up and beaten the dungeon. I can hardly say that is much of a game, if you don't have to actually play it.It is also a bit irksome that there is a ""training"" button that generates exp for sitting still while online, as this encourages players to stagnate online and clog up servers so ""We have thousands of players"" really means ""we have 10 guys actually playing, the other 990 are grinding exp and most likely not even paying attention"", as you can imagine, this REALLY makes the login and server exchange of character creation really long, in my case I had to wait almost 10 minutes staring at the character creation screen after I had clicked to finish my character and start playing.Not reccomended: good concept, poor execution.

												Most people seem to dislike this game and honestly, I can't see why. The gameplay is good and the graphics are decent. People say that since you can auto-walk to a quest, it makes the game bad or boring, but you don't ""have"" to auto-walk to it. You can use the auto-walk when you need to do something else off-game. I especially like the backrounds. I'm not that far into it, but the fight between the robot and the brood at the begining was amazing, and the train ride to Nexus was great to. I spent 10 minutes staring at the buildings that went by, and last but not least, at Nexus, hearing the woman over the intercom calling out different transportation times is just cool. People just judge this game too quickly and honestly aren't giving it a fair shot. This game is good and has mass potential for the long run.			"

												Make a steamy steam punk character. Click NPC. Sit back with a beer and let the game play your character for you. Maybe interact for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles. Try to make sense of the story line. Realise there is no story line. Let the game play itself some more.  Smile and escape into a fantasy world of laziness.Finally, a relaxing game that will can give me more than 8 hours sleep each night.  I even thought about learning an instrument!Play CoS:A, and get a life.			"

												Take it as it is. It is a F2P game, that can bring you a lot of fun.- The Steam bundles look like a good way to start into the game, but they are more or less a trap, do not buy them at the moment!You will NOT get any extra reward for your account, the items are bound to ONE character, therefore the bundles are (in the current state) a waste of your good money.- If you want to buy something, buy electrum directly ingame, get rewards for doing that and get even  more rewards for buying items with electrum, and those rewards will be there for any existing and future character!I wish, i had spend my money that way right from the start...- There is something to gamble at every corner, and while that might be fun for some player, it start to get annoying after some time, and of course you get more chances to gamble, if you spend real money...- At first it is very easy to play, you get rewards and free stuff at every turn, but from level 20, you will  start to feel the pressure to upgrade your equipment with everything you can find... or spend real money, to get those required metals, alloys and (from level 30 on) revamp gems from the item store.- And if you plan on getting into PvP... now that will either cost you a lot of time farming and uprading the right equipment, or spending a lot of money to be on the same level with everyone else.There are some quests, that can be done in PvP areas, and promise some better loot, but i would say, that is a waste of your time, unless you put enough time or real money into your character.- Events, same as PvP, if you are new, or your level is still rather low, you will not have much fun with them.You will either die a lot, and get more or less nothing at the end of the event, or if you are really lucky, you might get the last hit, and some reward.Depending on how much damage you did, you might get some Shillings in your mail as ""reward"", it looks like as if you try those event as healer, you will not get anything out of it...Even with all the problems, i still give the thumb up. Since the game is fun for a while, and in the end it is your choice, if you spend real money here or not.			"

												First, the bad news. The first time you do a (level 10?) dungeon (PER character), expect the game to lock the dungeon reward screen on you to the point you have exit out of the game. Near as I can tell, this only happence once per character. For good or bad, you get 5 characters per account. Any server you log into will show any characters you have already made.The game is sometimes hard to log into. They seem to be working hard on content and bugs. I got fairly quick responses to the emails I sent to them, and have edited and kept this review updated accordingly.Next, the good news. Its actually worth dealing with bugs till they fix it.  My husband and I discovered this game on the same day, and as we played, it seemed every 10 minutes or so we were finding something new that we loved about the game. I haven't seen him this hooked in a loong time.  I've paid it the highest compliment I know how for a game... I created a solo... I almost never solo.  Yeah, its that much fun. If you like steampunk at all, you want to give it a shot. Yes, the character creation is exceedingly limited, and the classes *seem* limited. Trust me, by level 6 or so you dont care. The classes have variations within them. And the looks of the character constantly develop in game, given a combination of luck and your taste.They are generous with rewards for those who log in every day for up to seven days in a row, and have a constantly changing event giving out new rewards simply for being logged in and playing on any given day. Almost everything you do has a completion reward, collection reward, something extra built into it. It may sound overwhelming, but give yourself a day and you will find that they did an excellent job of helping you track it. While it may seem too easy at first, you really come to  appreciate their ingenious ways of helping you to track as you level up and find more to keep track of.Now something that some will see as horrible and others as excellent... I happen to love it. This game reaches new heights in pitting brain vs brawn. If all you do is push to level up to max in one weekend, you could find yourself with a level 50 character with little better than level 10 abilities. Every time I play I find new ways they give to make your character unique. There are miriad ways to buy, build, plan, level everything about your character, and every level counts. Each time you finish your quest and level up, take the time to look around, did you do your dailies and level up your abilities? Do you spend more on your merc(battle pet, in essense) or more on your armor, or more on your abilities? Do you buy more bag space or a better buff pet? All choices are good, and all take time to build.  If you love to do a slow, thorough build of your character, like I do, you will find this game addictive. If you are all about the max level as fast as possible, you may find yourself a little frustrated with having to slow down and plan your character. Either player type given time can find themselves addicted to this game. Hope this review helps. Keep up the good work!			"

SO if you want to download this game to just press the auto button, walk away from your computer and then come back in like 7 hours, youll have the whole game done, every thing unlocked, and all for what?

												3D MMORPG situated in a steampunk universe can't be bad. What a mistake! The game seems that has so much to offer but it's only a first impression. You can find yourself repeating the same activities over and over again. The game is filled with ""buy for real money"" adverts and gets boring quickly. I can't recommend it even though I love steampunk.			"

												I had some issues getting the game started, but after updating Steam client was able to get started. I played for 6 hours to get a good understanding of the game on first day available on Steam. I made it to level 23 so far.  I found some buggy issues, but overall not a major issue for me. The game was enjoyable. I met some people from other countries which was cool. At the beginning it seemed very easy but as I got higher level it began to get tougher to beat the mobs and bosses. I asked around and am under the impression I now have all the icons available. (as you level you open more opportunities to power up, which is needed to defeat higher level mobs/bosses) The graphics were very good when I ran around and visited the suburbs to check them out. I was disappointed to see NPC's that when you clicked on them had nothing to say or led nowhere. Why have them if just for looking at? The pvp ""of fate"" events were good and I was able to beat a couple of higher level people. I have not done the pvp tourney or deathmatch where you can win free in game currency yet but plan on participating soon. I have not joined a company to join the company wars, so will find out about that when I do.For those that complain about the ""auto-combat"" mode, DON'T use it if you don't like it. There is a hardcore mode just for you. LOLThe two things I did not like as I was going through so far:1) The server has been online for others for past 3 days and Steam players are way behind to be able to win some of the ""NEW Server"" awards. It doesn't seem fair that Steam players are at a huge 3 day disadvantage.2) Seems the GM of the game is able to play, which I have no issue with, except he is on the leader boards to win the ""New Server"" awards. I am assuming he is getting free in game currency to be the GM here. Maybe I am misunderstanding the way it is, but don't think I am. Please correct me if I am wrong.All in all a very enjoyable game.			"

												First day of play:Simple to pick up and play.  Almost too simple and too automatic.  Overall-Fun, engaging, great for passing time.  Look forward to the progression of improvements and additions that will be added over time.Respawns in Dungeons are pretty fast.  Once XP objective is met, killing additional enemies beyond the objectives provides nothing but wasted items and possible death {if you decide to walk away thinking auto-attack continues endlessly (it deactivates once the objectives are met).PVP needs an overhaul.  Sucks having to choose from the top 7 ranked players in beginning stages of PVP and suffer utter defeat 5x's a day to just earn the daily reward.Don't quite understand the lmiitation on Fishing/Mining allowing only 5 successful tries in each per day (I could be missing something here...).Being disconnected from servers while in an instance will cause you to respawn outside of the instance.  Electrum (In-game, paid or bound-earned currency) can be lost or wasted if used to revive in an instance then being disconnected either from network issues (player) or service issues (company).The game is still new and many changes\updates\improvements are constantly being added to fix bugs and implement overall game balance.  The statements above are a quick assessment of gameplay from a first time player perspective.			"

												This lightweight game is a typical F2P MMO, with the ""Chinese MMO"" style that was so popular in the late 00's/early 2010.Based on The New Epoch Tabletop RPG (which sadly crashed in flames and ran out of... steam), City of Steam is less Steampunk and more Steam/Rune Fantasy. There's a more ethereal vibe to a majority of the quest hubs (which look radically different from the normal areas of the game). The game reminds me a lot of Forsaken World and while I feel that game has a better art style (besides being a Steampunk myself), I think City of Steam is more worth playing due to it's accessibility and mechanic features.Mechanist Games is based out of China, New Zealand and the United States, but the playstyle and art quality greatly resembles MMORPG's you saw in 2008 out of Korea/China.City of Steam's worth playing if you're looking for a time killer or inspiriation in the Steampulp world.

												This game had me for the first couple of hours. Then it hit me, its to easy. The game gives you the great weapons and armor from the begining, and every time you get something new, its not as good as the stuff you already have, making you feel unacomplished. It aslo hands out cosmetics, and special cash that you normally have to but, for free. If you want a good time, dont use any of the epic gear, and use the crappy stuff. And I almost forgot the magical floating island, were  you hit a rosk with a pickaxe, and level up. Or you can fish, and get some otherstuff. And lets not forget the daily gold giveways so that you have millions of gold coins, but nothing to buy! 2/10			"

												I will be honest, when I heard the name of this game and knew it was steampunk, I thought it was going to be just amazing! Sadly I was wrong, it's an ok game but I would not recommend playing it for a two reasons alone. 1. I felt like I, as the player, didn't have any decisions of what to do for myself or to do stuff the way I wanted to, everything was just laid out in front of me. My own path already chosen before I had anything to say about it.  2. All you need to do to complete the next objective was to click on it in the right side of the screen, and your character will go there for you or do whatever they need to in order to either go there or complete the task.

												Okay, This is an honest review coming from someone who has played it for over an hour and has notdecided it's horribleIts true, this game holds your hand, alot, but thats only through the first 15 or so levels. The game can be VERY challenging later on and its worth the time to actually get to the higher levels.THIS IS NOT P2W; You can be a subscriber for FREE, yes, thats right. Free, you can sell items on the in game market for a special currency which can be used in game to by 30 days of subscription. The subscription only inlcudes small xp boosts and such, you can do EVERYTHING the subscriber does, you can play the whole game not spending a penny and still be on the same track. Common guys, give it a chance.I feel like the only one to see any good out of this game. You guys just need to get your glass half full.Edit: I've been playing this for quite a while prior to the steam release, so dont let the play time fool you.			"

												This game is very good for gamers that are into MMORPG games. Somthing that supports this game being good is that as it is a widely played game it may get abuse in some ways but as it has now been publiced by steam it will always have new players that like it. If you are a gamer that likes to upgrade your equipment this is most likely the game is for you as you can find multiple types of armor, wepons, medicine and other general stuff from killing enemys. If you are looking for new ""internet friends"" then your job will be quite easy as the comunity is ok to get along with. Along with this there is also some down points to the game. One massive thing that should not happen in freetoplay games is that you have to pay for in game stuff, with real money. Its called a freetoplay for a reason, I know that the game producers need to make money to pay for the game but this is a huge factor that comes into ""city of steam"". If you want to play to try to get to the top of the leaderbord, you need to be really lucky with drops and chests or put you own money into the game. Along with this problem, when you are in the main area you have to put up with the lag that comes with everyones sidekicks and pets just filling the whole of the map. I know that you can fix this problem by tearning off the option to view other players, but I do like to see other people so that I can try to go for new armor and or weapons. If this could be fixed in the next update I kow that me and many more people would be gratefull.			"

												A fun casual MMO.ProsEasy to learn:  If you have played any MMOs the control set up is pretty intuitive.Light Specs:  Plays well on older computers and laptopsAttractive: Partitcularly considering that the light specsAuto movement:  Use standard movement or pick an option from a road sign to auto walk to the next destination or quest.You start with a mount: a steam bike that gets upgraded as you play, the first two to three upgrades come very quickly.Tons of content that gets unlocked as you play, item customization is particularly cool.Mining, Fishing, Myth Tablets, Transmutation, and a Pac-Man style mini-game. Vanquish, Auto Battle, and Training Modes:  -Vanquish: allows you to repeat a quest in vanquish mode this starts a timer and when it is done you simply grab the rewardsAuto Battle: a ""botting"" option for battle, you can walk in to a battle and hit this button.  Note: it just spams your abilites, so it works best when you are not worried about using up health/mana potions.  You play more efficently if you are at your keyboard, but it is nice to have a button to press while you pay the pizza guy or grab a coffee. Training: allows you to afk grind for experience, it gives you an amount of XP every 30 seconds of AFK time, up to 6 hours. _ Cons:Pay to Win:  You can buy advantages in the cash shop, this is not too much of an issue for PvE, but I could understand how it could kill PvP.The human races let you play any caucasian you want (WTF?), character models have fairly limited customization. Bottom Line:  Skip the PvP.  Come for the setting, PvE, and the nice interface.			"

												Where to actually begin? Well for starters I have played this game since before it was on steam, before it got shut down by it's devs because ""the lack of players"" (I say it like this because in fact it had population, we all knew it) and well...if I have to be truly honest the game concept was actually quite catching and it's theme very interesting, in the end there are very few the games that have that steampunk element that all of us find so great and interesting. The story was also quite interesting and it was really nice to see it narrated to you during cutscenes and also showed to you in the way they didYeah, the game looked like something that could become a diamond if polished well enough, and back when it came out despite not being the best browser game many people, including myself, saw more or less where the devs wanted to go with this game and it was very exciting for all of us, yet sadly, yet another game that could be good sadly fell into the below average pitFirst is the issue with the gameplay, because despite we all have seen games that grab your hand and guide you to do what they want from you this one does not only does that, it literally grabs your keyboard and mouse and plays the game for you. You walk automatically to the quest giver, something that is not that bad, other games have done it but please...why even give us somekind of map then? But this does not end here, oh no, the combat can also be turned into auto mode and even you don't need to place your stats, the game does it for you too if you want to, leaving zero to none chance for you to make mistakes. And the dungeons...don't even get me started...if this game was not easy enough the dungeons are so easy and dull that you literally fall asleep while waiting to apply a potion to yourself so you don't dieThe next issue I really would like to mention is the customization, now I know we speaking about a browser game here but I have seen browser games who have done a lot better when it comes to customize your character to be rather unique, in fact, it feels like at some point they had the intention to aim for a better costumization system but then just dropped things and left us with this...wich...well...sometimes feels bad. Now, I'm not mentioning the graphics at this point and that is simplily because we all have an idea with the kind of game we treating here, all I'm mentioning is that perhaps giving this game a little visual upgrade wouldn't be badNow, the third and last issue I'd like to adress here is no other than the payment system, now, during the first part of the game you see the signs of this, and that there is actually a suscription system along with an item mall...but...not until you over with those first quests and taken into another city you are able to see the full extent of the bonuses this can give you. Pay to Win? Well the game is still awfully easy to the point it sometimes gives little to no difficulty to get through, but one has to admit that the bonuses you get by paying are many...maybe a bit too many. Take for instance the pets that can pick up the money the monster drop, combine it with the autocombat and the incredibily easy way for you to finish a dungeon...that only leaves you with the task of staring at the screen boring yourself out, or maybe you can just left it playing for the night for no reason at all, it will be the sameNow I don't mean to offend anyone here, but this game despite not reaching the awful side is pretty close and maybe should get a full rework on it...because at it's current state it does not even count as a good browser, let alone an standalone downloadable tittle that you get from steam			"

												Heck yeah! Steampunk! Heck no, terrible game.The world itself isn't very compelling. Sure it felt like a Steampunk environment, but the overall game environment was extremely bland. The questing system was a constant extermination and delivery quest type, both of which can get boring really quickly.Although I haven't played much of the game, I didn't see very much open world. It was more of a dungeon crawler, but the dungeons were extremely short. You could see the exit from the very beginning of the dungeon, which gave the player almost 0 interest in exploring.The game itself was incredibly.. uninteresting. The combat wasn't engaging, the quest-line wasn't engaging, not even the environment was engaging. This game provided 0 immersion for me, it was a huge waste of time.If I have anything good to say about this game, I'd say that it'd be the concept. The concept of a Steampunk MMORPG. Although there may be a few Steampunk mmo's, I haven't seen them, but I would like to see a good quality one.I'll give this a 2/10. It has agreeable asethetics and graphics, but the overall game is just terrible.			"

												This steampunk MMORPG is alright, being a web-browser game and all. As you progress, whether it be story or level, the game gives you many varieties to build up your character. The game doesn't depend too much on cash money, just only on short cut ways to progress faster. You get to choose 4 races: Humans, Elves, Greenskins, and Dwarves (Males only). There are 4 classes: Warden (Melee), Arcane (Mage), Gunner (Long Range), and Channeler (Healer)The story is good, but not much voice acting on the NPCs, you only get dialogue. It's not interesting, in my opinion, due to the narrator tells your story. So if you care for the story, it's not worth listening to (once again, in my opinion).The gameplay is your standard MMORPG style game. You start off with 3 moves and as you progress you get to unlock more skills (resetting skills to use the other variety is free). If you play with a friend, it's more fun. People say this game is lazy, what with it having auto-attack and when press the quest you automatically go to the location. But that's the beauty of it, I recommend for those that always needs to take a break from the game play this game.If you already made an account in their website, you can't play it on the Steam version since the two are different accounts, one being Steam and the other being the CoS account.

												City of Steam: Arkadia isn't something new, and could be declared as another World of Warcraft clone, but it has features that are truly unique from any other MMO game. Firstly, it has plenty of real-time events and each of them have tons and tons of rewarding items. The more you level up, the more you unlock events you can participate in. Secondly, you have bike which you can ride over landscapes to get to your objective faster. You can even upgrade your bike, which not only improves it's speed and other attributes, but it also changes it's design. You can upgrade your armor and weapons using metal and mods (mods also changes the design of a weapon). Even though the game supports micro-transactions, personally, it doesn't feel like a pay-to-win game. But the greatest feature of this game is it's file size, I have no idea I how they got it right, but all those 3D elements and everything with just a 50mb download, that is incredible. The game is no near perfect, especially when it comes to the PvP elements, because you might just face someone with 20 to 30 or more levels higher than you but other than that, the game is certainly enjoyable. With lot's of free rewards you can get daily and some very challeging quests and challenges, this game is definitely something to try out.			"

												City of Steam: Arkadia starts out fairly charming with pleasant music, respectable visuals, and nice atmosphere.Leveling starts out extremely rapid, almost too quickly. Each quest rewards a full level up until level 16 or so.Quest related dungeons are not solo/party instanced, you will find yourself competing with other players and potentially losing out on rewards due to other players rushing the boss.There is also the ""Casual"" mode, where you can tell your character to auto attack and it proceeds to wreak havoc until 1. the objective is complete, 2. you tell it to stop, 3. it dies. I actually found this feature rather amusing.The cash shop itself is reasonable for a f2p, you can buy boosts, materials, pets that collect loot, mounts in the form of jetpacks, and cosmetics. Nothing too outragous.There are quite a few bugs, some not so bad while others will render the game unplayable until you email support and get them to fix it. The support crew are very quick and my account was repaired in less than one business day. (Mercenary Tutorial quest at level 11 completely disabled my curser ingame and removed parts of the UI)Recharging cash shop currency gets you premium weapon skins with large stat buffs (I was willing to overlook this)Spending cash shop currency also unlocks rewards.All of the above didn't seem like much of an issue, but one thing that really got my attention were the Subscription perks.Subscribers also get collectible stamps every day that can be redeemed in the Collections menu for permenant stat boosts.I don't want to call this game pay to win, so I'll let this screenshot say it:


City of Steam: Arkadia 
A Screenshot of City of Steam: Arkadia
By: Aedensin




If you can overlook all of the above, you can have a decently fun time. There are events held almost hourly including huge boss raids, wilderness boss hunts, PvP tournaments, events that give free ingame currency, and events to collect free experience.Not to mention Modding, where you insert mods into armor and weapons to alter their stats and their appearance (appearance alteration is only for weapons+shields). This is my favorite feature, unfortantely mods seem to be somewhat hard to come by. I've only found 2 or 3 on my own. Also mods come in different shapes and you must match the shapes with compatible slots in your gear, which is very frustrating.I still find certain charm in City of Steam: Arkadia, but I would not recomend this game to my friends.

												I'll be honest, this is is pretty good. it's not great, it's not terrible, it's good. People have said that their problem with the game is that it basically plays itself because of the auto-combat and when you click on the quest, it automatically takes you to it. It's not like you HAVE to use those things, it's most likely there for people who have little to no experience with MMORPG's. I'd probably recommend this game to people who havent played MMO's, or for people who dont wanna spend money on one, like me.			"

												City of Steam: Arkadia is a fun game if you ignore all the microtransactions. Yes, there's endless microtransactions, but the bottom line to the game itself is that everything affecting the storyline comes for free. What I've noticed is that they've added a new currency- Account-bound Electrum, which can be used for most electrum transactions. This electrum you CAN earn, through clock-in rewards and login bonuses. That aside, this game is like World of Warcraft for those who can't afford WoW. And to those of you complaining about it being Pay2Win? That's only in PVP, and PVP is COMPLETELY OPTIONAL! If you don't PVP, it's a fair game.			"

Many of them are plain wrong, after logging into the game for 5 minutes and selecting the admittedly stupid ""relaxed"" playstyle they complain that there is no fullscreen and the game plays its self, while the combat is incredibly dull and generic its not quite as bad as so many have made it out to be, and the fullscreen option is presented to you right at the main menu.While not the worst game I've ever played, and not as bad as several negative reviews claim, I cannot honestly reccommend it to anyone but the most bored of individuals seeking something that not only wants your money, but your time afterwards. So far as I can tell from the relatively short time I played this game, the subscription model is rather odd, you pay for a basic subscription (if you so choose to of course) and over time as you play, your exploits within the game upgrade said subscription to higher tiers in order to recieve more bonuses. As someone who enjoys MMORPGs thoroughly I understand that they are a medium for making money, no matter how much love is put into the game, so I can't complain about that fact in its self, but it seems rather odd that after you make a purchase the game requires you to play it to get more out of it. Now before you say ""But you're going to play the game anyway, why is it a problem?"" the issue I have with it is that when you do pay you still aren't guaranteed your moneys worth of in game advantages, Now I don't normally pay in free games anyway, but if I'm going to pay a subscription, then Im definitely not going to play the game exactly the same slow grinding way that someone who isnt would be.That brings me to another point, grind. Now I will admit I played this game for a relatively short time considering how much content any MMO brings to the table, theres plenty that I didn't do, however there was  one thing that I did do, and that was grind. Grind grind grind. Now grinding isnt always a bad thing, some people enjoy it, in fact, I do myself to an extent, but every quest felt EXACTLY the same. The description and lead up might seem like you're going to go collect something or find something but either way, 99% of the quest objective required to complete the quest its self, was summed up by 2 little bars under what most of the time was your ""Dungeon objective,"" an experience bar, and a shillings bar. In order for you to complete nearly any real objective (excluding standard 'go talk to this fellow' quests) you are directed to an open instance in which you pretty much just murder everything for a minute or two, click a shiny clearly visible objective, and leave. Sometimes you have to kill a boss as well, but with the volume of people inside the instance with you, you normally don't have to actually kill it, in fact you dont even have to hit the thing, you can walk in and someone can get the killing blow on the boss creature and you instantly get credit for the kill as well. The combat its self doesnt aid in making the grinding any more enjoyable. I myself played a warder, the warrior class of City of Steam. While the class had some interesting mechanics, one of which being switching between equipped weapon sets to boost different stats, the combat is generally uninteresting and bland. You have a resource, you have health, you have some buttons. You click, character whacks, you press a button should you feel the need to (I rarely did) and then numbers and death proceed to spread everywhere.The game's aesthetic design however is somewhat nice, I 'll give it that, but only to a certain degree. The game has some decent style despite having relatively dated graphics, however this style is quickly ruined by the vast amount of clutter and dull color palette used within the game. Being steampunk focused, I can't expect too many color splashes, but the way that the game is presented with its browns and metallic grays just makes the game look confusing and crowded. On the note of aesthetics I will say the character customization is okay, all of the races look relatively interesting... all but one... the only one I wanted to play. That being the orcs. Now every race in this game has SOMETHING about them that makes them look a little stupid, whether it be a somewhat silly facial expression locked on their face, a strange array of hairstyles, huge ears etc, but the orcs just downright look terrible, and I love orcs, so this made me sad. Their hair looked glued onto their heads, their moustaches looked like paper cutouts hanging under their noses, and the beards looked no better. Well at least I looked pretty neat on the free motorcycle dressed in my overly badass level 5 armor.Yes I said motorcycle. Everyone gets one for free very early in game, as far as I know this is the only mount in the game. The motorcylce can be upgraded with vehicle parts to go faster and look cooler (though I thought the last several upgrades available looked less like badass steampunk motorcycles and more like something I would unlock in Mario Kart) but the upgrades are another way of getting your money, you need more and more parts to upgrade it, and one of the ways you can get them is connected to the payment system.All in all the game is by no means the worst game I've ever played, and I admit I didnt play very much, but the first impression is always the strongest in an MMO, and sometimes you can just tell when an MMO will play the same throughout, this was a strong feeling with this game in particular.I wouldnt recommend it to anyone, however I do encourage you to try it if you really wish to, theres no large download to deal with, in fact I assume that only those with the slowest of internet connections can download the game within 30 seconds, the game downloaded in less than ten for myself. In fact by the time I had clicked on my steam library to confirm it was downloading it was already finished. You don't have much to lose aside from an hour or two of time becoming disappointed.			"

												Gritty graphics and linear gameplay that basically plays itself.CoS is a very casual MMO that could be considered a point and click. The Combat system is so easy you can play without using your skills for the first 10 levels. I don't mind linear gameplay, its helpful and simple sometimes but when the game basically holds your hand though the entire thing, its just plain boring. It's certainly noob friendly, which is always a bonus.Skill system is also very simple and slow, since you only get new abilities every several levels, there isn't any variety. From research through reviews and videos, it also seems like the gear is also bland and generic, making end game pointless. Many dailies that allow you to gain loot,experience and mastery/expertise points to level up your core stats and upgrade your abilities.PvP system is slow and primitive, lagging out like crazy and giving players unfair advantages. This is strickly a PvE game.Gambling system, where you can use special orbs to try and get in game currency and items. Auction house and many vendors to buy items with special currency aquired during heroic mode dungeons, pvp, or special events.Also, pay to win, which is always fun. But hey, its a free game that can be classifed as a MMORPG Point and Click. Free, noob friendly, linear as ♥♥♥♥ and easy as hell. If your looking for a free, casual and easy RPG, give it a try. (its more RPG than MMO in my opinion)Personal Rating: 3/5			"

												Do I suggest this game? Yes and no... I can't say that I don't enjoy this game, Because I do. I've played it hours the past weeks. The steam theme is nice. I'd just like it to be less pay to win. Some upgrades/actions need too many stones or parts and are overpriced in the mall. One more thing.. Sadly the game has log in issues. It seems to be a main problem. Fix it!			"

												This game plays itself, no joke. You just have to click on quest objectives and your character does all the walking/fighting/looting. However, you can disable this ""auto"" mode and play it like any other WASD mmo.It's a neat system, and the game itself is very pretty with a fairly original setting (there have been a few other steampunk themed MMOs in the past). Unfortunately, the game gets boring fast, at least it did for me.			"

												Very Interesting game.It's an ULTRA casual MMO, I'd call it a MMORPG / Point & ClickIf your an avid MMO player you will probably hate it,But if you like the idea of a casual point & click style MMO then give this a try.The game is obviously designed for the Casual mode,   I started playing it in hardcore and by the the time I got through the first area I was ready to quit.   Luckily I decided to give the auto combat casual mode a try....   and it actually makes this game more enjoyable,  It's WAY to easy and boring on ""hardcore"" but on auto the game flows really well.

												This game is one of a kind! Its a quick download with a lot of content. The game is 50/50 on PvP/PvE - You can go to places that are PvE but is a PvP danger zone. But, you can also go to places and choose if you want to join the hostile (PvP) or friendly (Just PvE) areas. The one thing I dislike about the game is the speed in which it takes to level, its too quick! I want a game where it takes me at least a couple of months to get to max level, people are already getting close to max and its been just under a month since they started on the new server...I would suggest this game to my friends & family - p.s. Its not Pay to Win, its subscription based so you don't have to pay, but if you do you get a few bonuses, after all you are funding the updates and servers!			"

												While the game its self is enjoyable, the recent update and string of ""compensation payouts"" for bugs and glitches that shipped with said update have put me off the game. The true nail in the coffin that has me not recommending CoS is the horrific customer support they fail to offer!!! After a previous update they changed the tutorial section of the game and a lot of players got stuck in the early quests, I followed their instructions, submitted the required information and supporting screenshots, then waited... waited somemore...... figured they were busy helping everyone with the issue, after 4 weeks i mailed them to ask what happened, Quote ""Really sorry for the delayed response, I might have missed your previous email. I will try to transfer as many items as possible later today, need to double check their IDs with the devs. Thank you for the patience"" waited 3 days with no reply or updates from them so stopped playing, logged in briefly over 2 weeks to see if they had fixed the issue, still no!! so i wont be back!!

												Can't recommend this game in its current state for two bug reasons.1) Leveling/soloing in this game is extremely hard. They nerfed the xp gain to 1/10th so now it is a huge grind to level 60. On top of that when you hit level 18 or lower depending on your class. It is almost impossible to solo a heroic dungeon to farm materials for gear.It's hard to find someone close to your level to xp with because this game uses ""chances"" that gets used up in every instance. So everyone who isn't level 60 is using their daily ""chances"" to xp grind and with a small player base, it's very frustrating.2) HUGE PAY TO WIN. Even the cosmetics have set bonuses. I can deal with #2 if they had a healing merc npc like in SWTOR to help you grind but they don't. If it's almost impossible to solo heroics at 18 when great gear doesn't really matter then it will be impossible at 20-60.			"

												This is a MMORPG with some great ideas. Steampunk, merc system, motorbike upgrades, transmuter, companies & shares etc. It falls a bit short on the RPG part itself where most of the quests seem to be linear corridor minidungeons. Also, the engine is not really 3D (no falling off ledges or jumping fences). Recommended, but I suspect its longevity may be limited.			"

												For a browser game it's might be very good.  Could become repetitive, could use some polishing, and if it weren't just a PVP griefer world it would be fun :)The ""autoplay"" button is a great idea!However, the game has a forced PVP mode and I am a strictly PVE player so I'll be uninstalling because of that.  Though I only played a few minutes I liked the feel of it, environment and pace, and only wish they'd take out the forced PVP idea, as more than 50% of the game playing market is PVE/stand alone game play only (again why autoplay is a great idea) so they've reduced their potential market substantionally, even though expanding it with the innovation of an autoplay button (which wouldn't be workable in PVP obviously).So I recommend this for PVP players as it gives them a chance to grief others from behind their computer screen, to have fun with others who find that fun as well as abuse new players who don't realize this game forces PVP.The Steam info about the game on the right needs to be updated to include the fact this game features forced PVP, and if that's not being mentioned because it would discourage some players like me from even trying the game (I wouldn't have tried it if it listed the force PVP), then maybe it's time to take the forced gameplay out of the game instead of fool people into thinking it's not PVP by failing to mention that in Steam's listing on the right side.  Yes this would be my gripe, but not to say don't play the game.  If you're a PVP player you'll love this, just play it while the game affords itself for the narrowness of the market for this game means it has basically less than half the financial potential it would have without forced PVP, so it may not last long.

												This game plays itself, no joke. You just have to click on quest objectives and your character does all the walking/fighting/looting. However, you can disable this ""auto"" mode and play it like any other WASD mmo.It's a neat system, and the game itself is very pretty with a fairly original setting (there have been a few other steampunk themed MMOs in the past). Unfortunately, the game gets boring fast, at least it did for me.			"

												This game is pretty good. It isn't supposed to be this good. I mean it's web based (although that doesn't really mean anything nowdays, since html 5, and unity web player), runs on a potato, and needs like 60 MB hard disk space. But it's suprisingly fun! The graphics look pretty good! The models are detailed, textures aren't that blurry, I can say it looks the same as WoW. It's just much more fun! You can play in TPS style, or in ""2.5d"" (kind of like Neverwinter Nights or Baldur's Gate). Plays much more like an actual crpg, than any other mmo-s i have tried. The character development system gives you much more freedom over your character. Your choice if you want to have more accuracy, more health or more armor. The actual gameplay is like in similar mmo-s, you have your skills, that you can upgrade, some of them are aoe, some of them are cc, you have seen it before. There are pets, you have a steambike you can upgrade (and even change the looks of your ""mount"", like to a mech). There aren't many customization options at character creation, but after that, you can have like a hundred different steampunk clothing pieces, and accessories. Also there is a pretty interesting mercenary system. Crafting is there, but that only upgrades your gear in a variety of ways. There are events constantly, like boss killing, clearing dungeons for rewards, asynch pvp besides normal 1v1 arena, and of course the hillarious golden egg smasher event.Oh yeah, rewards. You get a sh*tload of rewards just for playing the game, xp, money, crafting materials, you name it. You get rewards for being online, you get rewards for being offline, you get rewards for everything!So is it pay to win? Well if there are still games that are pay to win, this game is the complete opposite. You get shop currency as rewards (bound electrum), only a few items can be bought with paid currency (unbound electrum), and you can get that, if you manage to sell something on the market, without spending a dime. You even find subscriptions as item drops.I have only one problem with the game. The dungeons (especially the early ones) look boring, and they aren't that long either, however you can always go deeper, where stronger monsters wait for you. The developers did a pretty good work on this game. If you are looking for an mmo, with original ideas, and not something along the line of WoW, just give it a try.I absolutely recommend this!			"

												This game has some wonderful atmosphere and tons of pluck.  I have followed it's development from the get go, and have watched it's evolution and how this small team has overcome some legitimately substantial obstacles in the name of getting their game out in the world and breathing on it's own.  I love the steampunk vibe this game has, and they have crafted a world and backstory that could well be the fodder for a good novel.  The races are all distinct with cultures and quirks (Though at last play, i noticed the simplified character race descriptions were gone from the character creation screen.  Likely a bug.. (There ARE a good few of those, though they are always working on it.  Indie - you know how it goes) The gameplay is pretty standard MMO fare, but its also very easy to pick up and run with.  The city itself can be rather overwhelming when you first enter.  It is much more than a traditional games faction hub - WoW's Orgrimar or Dalaran look like roadside tomato stands next to the shear scope of the city here - and with good reason - That city is where all the action is.  You adventure into old ruined quarters, forgotten sewers, and things of that nature instead of ventring off over the hills...  There is a lot to see, and the different districts all have pretty neat style and flavor.  If you like steampunk stuff, you will likely spend good time just admireing the design quirks and details in the different districts.  Combat is fast paced, and generally fun though I do have a gripe concerning the fast monster respawn rate - perhaps owing to this games roots as a browser based program, and the limited instancing, monsters continuously respawn - you clear out an abandoned courtyard, turn around to kill a thing in the alleyway, and turn back to find 4 more monsters in the courtyard.   Makes it feel like a meatgrinder, and eliminates the ""Room Clear - move on!!"" element of a dungeon crawl in a typical game.. (In fairnes I havent played for a while - this may have been fixed.  I need to dive in and see, but this is the way it was, at least.)  Gear is neat and varied, they have a crafting system, spells are cool enough  and the whole thing is lightweight enough to run on pretty much anything.  (Big point.)  The only other real  talking point i want to bring up is the whole ""Arcadia"" element.  Originally this game was simply ""City of Steam"" Published by another company that had a small stable of MMO type games.  That company started to do badly, and the folks at Mechanist really wanted to save their baby, so they bought the rights back, and self published - no small achievement, and also part of how it came to Steam.  Now, presumably due to copyright issues or licensing things they needed another name.  That led to City of Steam: Arcadia"" being born.  Along with the new name, they added this Arcadia realm where you can participate in games and fish and do other powerup related stuff.   Problem is, for me at least, it seemed tacked on, and sort of pointless.   I thought the game had better feel without it, but all told its not that big of a deal.. Bottom line, this game has a lot of charm and character - it is original, while still incorporating a lot of the stalwart features you would expect from a big money developer.  It's a little rough in places, but this isnt Blizzard.  This is a few guys from (Canada/UK - dont remember) who moved to China to found a small studio to build the game they wanted to build.  This is an indie studio and the game is their labor of love.  For the size of the team, what they have created is astounding.  I would very much recommend you give it a shot!			"

												You press a button and the game plays for you. Autocombat, goes through dungeons in a breeze without you lifting a finger, does all the quest for you. Needless to say I got to level 15 within 20 minutes of download. On the brightside, I got to name my avatar Kim Kardashian. 3/10.			"

												This game has some wonderful atmosphere and tons of pluck.  I have followed it's development from the get go, and have watched it's evolution and how this small team has overcome some legitimately substantial obstacles in the name of getting their game out in the world and breathing on it's own.  I love the steampunk vibe this game has, and they have crafted a world and backstory that could well be the fodder for a good novel.  The races are all distinct with cultures and quirks (Though at last play, i noticed the simplified character race descriptions were gone from the character creation screen.  Likely a bug.. (There ARE a good few of those, though they are always working on it.  Indie - you know how it goes) The gameplay is pretty standard MMO fare, but its also very easy to pick up and run with.  The city itself can be rather overwhelming when you first enter.  It is much more than a traditional games faction hub - WoW's Orgrimar or Dalaran look like roadside tomato stands next to the shear scope of the city here - and with good reason - That city is where all the action is.  You adventure into old ruined quarters, forgotten sewers, and things of that nature instead of ventring off over the hills...  There is a lot to see, and the different districts all have pretty neat style and flavor.  If you like steampunk stuff, you will likely spend good time just admireing the design quirks and details in the different districts.  Combat is fast paced, and generally fun though I do have a gripe concerning the fast monster respawn rate - perhaps owing to this games roots as a browser based program, and the limited instancing, monsters continuously respawn - you clear out an abandoned courtyard, turn around to kill a thing in the alleyway, and turn back to find 4 more monsters in the courtyard.   Makes it feel like a meatgrinder, and eliminates the ""Room Clear - move on!!"" element of a dungeon crawl in a typical game.. (In fairnes I havent played for a while - this may have been fixed.  I need to dive in and see, but this is the way it was, at least.)  Gear is neat and varied, they have a crafting system, spells are cool enough  and the whole thing is lightweight enough to run on pretty much anything.  (Big point.)  The only other real  talking point i want to bring up is the whole ""Arcadia"" element.  Originally this game was simply ""City of Steam"" Published by another company that had a small stable of MMO type games.  That company started to do badly, and the folks at Mechanist really wanted to save their baby, so they bought the rights back, and self published - no small achievement, and also part of how it came to Steam.  Now, presumably due to copyright issues or licensing things they needed another name.  That led to City of Steam: Arcadia"" being born.  Along with the new name, they added this Arcadia realm where you can participate in games and fish and do other powerup related stuff.   Problem is, for me at least, it seemed tacked on, and sort of pointless.   I thought the game had better feel without it, but all told its not that big of a deal.. Bottom line, this game has a lot of charm and character - it is original, while still incorporating a lot of the stalwart features you would expect from a big money developer.  It's a little rough in places, but this isnt Blizzard.  This is a few guys from (Canada/UK - dont remember) who moved to China to found a small studio to build the game they wanted to build.  This is an indie studio and the game is their labor of love.  For the size of the team, what they have created is astounding.  I would very much recommend you give it a shot!			"

												After playing for an hour, I've decided not to play anymore.This is a fairly standard and generic MMO with a steampunk paint job. You follow the loot arrow to your next quest, go into a dungeon, fight through a bunch of easy quick-respawning enemies picking up coins, and then go back and repeat. \You hardly even need to do anything for combat. Just hit a button, and you'll go off and start fighting things own your own, without any work. You don't even need to move your character! Nothing special about this, besides having having a steam-punk paint job. There's better free MMO's out there.			"

												Played it for about 5 minutes, I hated the whole experience.. I love the concept of 'Steam Punk.' Though, the way the game set it, I felt I was playing a poorly made game that some developer threw to the public to satiate their insatiable lust for a GOOD MMORPG. I will admit, some aspects were fun, though graphics were poor even when I ran it on the highest graphic option, I felt I was playing a terrible version of vanilla world of warcraft; graphics bad, gameplay fun, but eh. If you fixed it to make it more than the certain type of 3D style it is in now. Maybe I will come back and write a better review of this game. I know that I am going to get haters on this because they will yell ""How could you say that?! Comparing CoS: Arkadia a 'great' game to some horrid piece of rubbish such as world of warcraft."" Now, the people that say that do not get me wrong we all have our preferences so please do not hate on me for writing a poor review about the game that you may claim to be the best. I would agree if some things change I.E (Graphics and camera style.) In an over all sum up of this, I would more than likely not reccomend this game to anyone. In my book it has gotten a 3.5/10, this game got this rating for the playstyle and the concept (Both were amazing.) though, it was a low score because I did not like the graphics, and you were thrown into a non interesting thing. Like some games make you jump right into the action like Transformers: War for Cybertron, Fallout 3-New Vegas, Borderlands, and even dear I say it..Hells ride (God awful game about a biker, watch the angry Joe for it, gave it a 1 or something like that out of 10.) Though it still jumpped you into the action. So, I am sorry, but unless the game has major changes I will not be returning to it. I would rather play a game like Dino D-Day, and we all know almost no one plays that game anymore. On a final note, the company that made the game may have other great games. But, who is to say that not all game companies have their screw ups? Like the people who made the Devil may cry games, the series is my favorite game set, yet they had a screw up on the new one. So, this game may be this companie's only fluke?			"

												Gameplay in City of Steam is very reminiscent of most action RPGs on the market today. In fact, quite a favorable comparison could be made to Diablo 2 or Torchlight 2 from the standpoint that players work to level up skills to make them more powerful. On first glance, City of Steam's combat system is terrific and it certainly isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination. What is boils down to is that it is uninspiring in ways that the aforementioned games are not. As players level, they are granted skill power-ups in one of three disciplines. Points are allotted according to a player's wishes and combat skills are granted. In the end, it's not that the combat system is poor, it's just so much more button mashing of 1-2-3, rinse repeat. Players are faced with pretty standard fare and work from a belt of abilities learned over time that increase in damage and effectiveness. I played as a Warder and my character had the typical arcing swings of both a great sword and two one-handed swords. It's pretty cool that players can choose a second weapon set for different skills and ways to fight monsters. Weapons can be changed out on the fly and it's worth having that ranged weapon handy to aggro only the monsters you want to rush out.Questing is pretty standard fare as well. Head to a quest hub, grab 3-4 quests, head to the instances needed for completion, turn them in and done. Again, it's not unusual, just uninspiring and not as well done as most. The quest givers are not voiced which, depending on your particular style, is either a good or bad thing. Players can utilize an isometric over the shoulder camera or toggle a free ranging camera on the fly. This is a marvelous touch on behalf of Mechanist, something that most players will like very much. In addition, questing can be directed if a player gets lost simply by clicking on the directional arrow that will automatically take characters to the desired location. Still in the end, combat gets repetitive very fast. Between the same look and feel of all the instances and mashing the same combination of buttons over and over, it's a rather tiresome affair.			"

												First let me say I started playing CoS back when it was first created and then closed down. It was fun and I had high hopes for it as it really seemed like a good browser game. Unfortunately there were some major gamebreakin bugs that were never addressed so I left. So I came back now that it's been reopened and renamed CoS Arkadia. I installed this game and tried it briefly. The auto path/play feature in this game totally killed the experience for me. An MMO with a feature that plays the game for you is just not something I'm interested in. The game seemed to actually take steps backwards instead of forwards.			"

All you do is click  here and watch, wait a couple seconds, done task, click there do that done. It's repetitive really and you will get bored of it unless you love repetitive games with no interaction other then clicking and a few typing there. Unless you love games by R^2 I deeply recommend save your time and do no even download this game.			"

												Dear City of Steam creators,As a person who loves the genra of Steam punk, I was delighted and thrilled to see an MMO styled in the theme, but me and my buddy know about MMO's, but none the less, we WANTED this game to be good and succeed.We discussed about the good and bad's of the intro, how we could quickly and hassle free get through the start vs the huge worlds to exsplore but taking up a hefty time to trek.Then we found the button that took us to quest points, we then found out it could recover quest items for us, then we found out it could auto combat for us... atualy, it could pretty much play the game by itself, making me wonder why I ever needed to put in input.  The only button we needed t press was push to talk on our mics.  Is a game a game if you don't need to play it, an intresting debate.Then I got to the sewers... The Glut, those rat people man, I frickkin love those rat people, I wannted to join them, but sniper rokkie kept killing them and I got sad and started a protsest, bla bla bla bla goobity goop, didddly peep nobbly domty doopy do, THEN OUT OF NOWHERE, FLIPPTY FLOOPERS< EVEREYWWEREEWW, then I added cappatals to make the snetance more shocking and excitteing, then i went for a poop and added more random words for comic effect, like bazangle and jeeloomologoops, my fav out of all of them it hamjeromo.I amd Geenathex, I have the power!Please don;t stop makeing games, your hear was in the right place for a steampunk themed games, but MMO's always are hard t get right and harder to win a huge audiance, after all they are Massive online Multiplayers.Best of luck, green skin Geenathexx			"

This is basically World of Warcraft with these 3 main attributes:- Better than World of Warcraft- Loads of sidequests, attributes, and fun things- Great music, graphics, and gameplayThis game in great to get into. It is great for both people who don't play much MMO's and people that play a lot of MMO's.In conclusion, this game gets a 95/100.			"

												It is very cluttered and i found it difficult to maneuvre between what is going on, where to go, and what is happening. Most times I found the auto combat was crazy and would target every creature and then I had a minion that was attacking as well. Wow, it was pretty scrambled when you cristen the ground on this game. I think the artwork was well done, and the storyboards seem cool too. Near future, maybe a bit more guide and less of the jumping from station to station feel. Maybe they could make the player work more to explore rather then just click and go. Just a suggestion, but I played it and it wasn't my favorite. Keep adding and working on this it is a cool concept tho.			"

												Normally a browser-based MMORPG, this game uses the Unity Engine for its 3D Power. For those of you not aware, Unity is a 3D Game/Model engine similar to that of Unreal and other engines in the market. It uses FMOD for Audio. All in all, the game is very ""Pay to Win,"" you can buy a lot of ""Power"" with real money, in fact, the ""Auction House"" uses that same real money digital currency, known as Electrum in-game. The game has a few faults, though it's only recently been released. For instance, you cannot move the quest tracker, you cannot move the chat box. Some other normal MMORPG amenities aren't in it, such as auto-decline duels, guild invites, etc. As well as basic chat filters, so you don't have to look at world chat on the first tab of game chat.The audio in the game is pretty clear, but it sometimes cuts for a split-second randomly. This may be due to the audio engine it uses. There is very little customization for characters, but being mostly a browser-based MMORPG, I was expecting no customizability at all. The game even allows you to turn off costumes, showing individual armor models.The game is mostly instance-based, yet the instances usually have all types of players going through them. (This is only experience up to level 10 or so. I am unsure about higher levels.)Like most browser-based MMORPGs, costumes bought through the cash shop usually give stats, as well as mounts giving passive stats such as attack, etc. (As do cash shop pets.) If you don't mind ""Pay To Win"" then this game is a nice little browser-based or Unity-Based gem.			"

												Lightweight, as advertised, and runs smoothly, but ... extremely boring combat hampered even further by the low-end graphics-- attacks don't feel like they have any sort of impact or weight to them and the target-then-stand-around mechanics don't help the matter. Uninspired, restrictive writing that does nothing with the setting, and the already-mentioned irritating F2P model doesn't help anything.From a first impression, it's just very difficult to see how this game could possibly be any fun.

												All around an awful game, especially so for an MMO.From the very start, it hand-holds you the entire way. The game has Auto-Travel, Auto-Combat, and Auto-Targeting and seems to try and do everything for you. I only spent about an hour playing through it, but from what I can tell, it also has server and optimization issues as I had frame rate and lag problems consistantly through the entire game.Also, the game seems to have Pay-2-Win packs you can get, which makes the aspect of sinking any time into this game even worse. I'd avoid this game unless you have a thing for games that seems trivial and focus on tossing reward after reward at you to keep you playing.			"

												Gameplay is bland and boring. It's interesting to see an MMORPG to have the option to essentially play the game for you. There's auto-walk and auto-battle. Using these options, you can just sit back and let the game play itself while you relax and do other things in the meantime. While this may seem like a great idea, it gets boring real quick when the combat is already slow. There is no real tutorial to show you how to play and what things are. For example, there is no description that describes each race in the character creation screen. Nothing that tells you the difference between each class and race. Basically, you have to figure it out yourself, be it playing through the game blindly or searching up a guide online. This review may not have been helpful at all because this merely just a first impression of the game. The first things I noticed right when I started the game. In my opinion, the idea was great, but execution could have been improved on greatly. If you enjoy doing nothing in a game, this might be just for you.If you would like a game that involves more action and whatnot, I recommend avoiding the game. Of course, you can go ahead and give this game a try.			"

												There's a decent amount of potential here. But it just makes so many mistakes.It's too much like World of Warcraft in its controls and feel.The combat requires no skill at all.Its aestetics claim to be steampunk, but it just lacks the feel of having any soul at all.It claims to be MMO, but you only see other players and can attack the same people. I haven't seen the actually MMO aspects that aren't dated back to 2003. However that might be due to the fact that I've only played just under an hour and haven't seen it yet.Despite all this I see potential, if the designers were to take it and rework it there might be something good in here. As it stands right now it's not worth it.			"

I collected all this hair in the jar. Oh god, it's still bleeding. My head is still bleeding and I don't care because watching the blood drip off my chin is more fun than watching this 'game'! I'm going to name the label on this jar 'City of Steam: Arkadia' and add it to my ripped hair collection.Alright, back. I put the jar on a shelf above my bed.

Shop is ridculously pay to win. I look under cosmetic shop items and found gear for sale with pretty epic stats. So, yeah...Honestly, I could play an hour of this game, before I got bored and uninstalled			"

												I can't honestly say i would recomend this game. Very, VERY asiany feeling.. automated quests, you just click on the quest text and it does it for you, so what is that point of the game? Heavily Pay to win from what i can see. A TON of things to ""make sure"" you come back every day for the next month, at least! They also have about 5 things that reward you for buying their Real money currency, which is dumb. Basically, if you buy their currency, you get rewards, then when you spend it oyu get rewarded again, along with the item oyu bought.			"

												So far, I enjoy this game. The graphics are pretty good, but you still have the problem that comes with just about any MMO, too many people on the server and everything lags. There is a lot to do with this game. At first it's a little confusing, you're kind of thrown in not really knowing how to do anything, but it's pretty easy to catch on to. Character creation is limited but still with enough selections to not make everyone seem the exact same. I really like this game.			"

												It's amazing, this game. I've never played an MMO before that could actually play itself. The learning curve is straight. The challenge goes well beyond middling. You get the trophy just for warming the bench, not even for participating. The graphics are pretty enough, and the overall aesthetics of the world the developers have built is neat, but there is so little substance to this game you might as well watch Let's Play videos of something more interesting.

												I tried to give this game a chance despite the reviews I had read. The movement is horrible and glitchy, and the game, as mentioned in othre reviews, is pretty much run by itself. You shouldn't be able to let your character run to an objective by themself with the click of a button, especially not in a MMORPG. This is really the one thing that dettered me right away. The movement I could probably get used to, but the fact that the story runs itself is a big downfall for the game.If you like that sort of thing, then play your heart out. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend this game to any of my friends.			"

												Although this game is quite simple for a seasoned MMO player, it's actually one of the better browser games I've seen.  If you're interested in some very basic combat to turn your mind off for a while, the game is decently entertaining.  The idea behind the game and the steampunk genre makes this game entertaining enough for a few hours.I disliked the fact that so much experience, skill points, in-game currency, etc. is just given to you carte blanche.  There's an in game mechanic where you can earn experience just being AFK and there are various events where you're just awarded in-game cash.  All in all, it's a very simple game and I'd recommend it for people new to the MMO genre.  More seasoned gamers who are used to more diverse mechanics and challenges may find this game too simple and ""mind numbing"".			"

												Greetings! After me is 9 years of World of Warcraft ( daily playing ) - Aion - Lineage2 ( started with Chronicle I Harbingers of War ) - EverQuest II - SWTOR - RiFT - Defiance - and so on and on. All those games had something special in them one way or another.And as for City of Steam: Arkadia - I would have simply few words to shorten the description. : I simply love everything about it. ( And I choose hardcore mode of playing style ) Everything feels so relaxed and just fun, after many many many games I turned around I actually have some fun.The only thing what I could put this game Thumb down is - Dragon Age II version of dungeons - they are repeating it self to much. Areas are too similiar one to another. But then again Dragonage II was 50€ when it came out and it has 8gb. This has 50mb installation package with some updates rest is load on screen. So I belive even that will be eventually fixed and changed. Well, to the last conclusion if You are sick of all MMORPG's up to the neck try this out out. You wont regret it. :) "

												The fact that this game plays itself seems more somewhat of a sign of a show and less of a sign of a game makes peoplethink of what are considered games these days, yet I still find myself busy making sure my character is on the right track to establishing my inventory. These games are really just meant for people that want to just sit down and enjoy a nice looking game with the less hassling feel of a normal game.So my review is somewhat a little easy on the game for the fact that it plays itself, stillthe fact that I would rather spend most of my time on Flash Games then this really justifies the factthat it does get repetitive. So I would like to give this a 5/10 ""Half an Half Baba!""			"

												Edit:♥♥♥♥♥♥customer service, bugs with item mods, Real money items can be spent and vanish for no reason via Bugs. ""Bug"" forums that lock your topics without resolution... ♥♥♥♥ this game.Well I've been tooling about with this game for a while and figured I would write a review for it. (Mmo pedigree: Alodds, Runes of Magic, Guild Wars, Rift, WoW, Dying Earth) All things considered my impression of this game has been mostly positive. If you don't choose ""Hardcore"" mode at the start you can expect a very easy ride for the first 10 levels. The auto combat mode may be a turn off for some but it is optional and disabled during PVP. The graphics are quite attractive (more so if you appreciate Steampunk I imagine). I can only run it with an acceptable framerate on low setting due to a crappy pc but it still looks quite nice.The ""pay"" aspects DO afford some benifits but nowhere near as breaking as other games I have played (Looking at you Runes of Magic...) My friend bought me a silver pack. The jetpack and pet have proven useful but nowhere near unbalancing past level 10 where their stat bonuses start to become irrelavant.My only sincere complaint is that traditional grinding is IMPOSSIBLE. After a certain amount of kills in an instance you will cease gaining xp. Online and offline training helps to offset this but if you enjoy grinding off your progress it's a sad note.As far as content goes besides the main questline and optional quests you have PVP, Team Arenas, Paragon Dungeons, Monster Lairs, Vanquisher Raids, World Boss raids and a bunch of other goodies (Though there is a daily limit to each catagory of instance which shouldn't be an issue unless you're an addictive personality. Like me. >.<)All in all there are several small ways I could picture this game improving. But for a small investment of cash or for free it is certainly worthy of exploration.			"

												FANTASTIC free MMORPG...esp for beginners to the genre.  To start the load times are incredible due to this being a browser based game, also means not eating up allot of memory as well.  Very simple basic instructions throughout that allow anybody to figure out what is going on.  Even if you dont know what is going on you can auto click through allot of the early stuff.  This is a newly released game if I am not mistaken so I am sure there is more to come.  Currently I am level 21 and get on to do my dailies most days if nothing else. 8/10.			"

												Well, I just got this game yesterday, and I've put about 4-5 hours into it. Its quite fun, if a bit confusing if you're new to MMORPGs. I mainly got this because I like steampunk, and I didn't want to have to pay 20$ for Dishonored, the other big steampunk game around. I like the gameplay, although it does seem a little like LOTR Online in many respects. Also, the universe is very complicated and hard to understand, I feel like the devs could have made it a LOT easier to understand the world. Plus, I'm not really sure if I like the whole ""magica/mana"" element in a steampunk game. My only other complaint about the game is that you have to be level 15 to use the marketplace, which is just plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in my opinion. Overall then, its a solid game, but I would maybe change some things with respect to the marketplace and universe. If you like steampunk, you'll probably like this game!			"

												A Steam Punk version of WoW, only better. You can do Hardcore mode which is basic play, including all the grining for xp and shillings (gold) or you can do relaxed mode and allow the auto-combat to do the grinding for you. Daily quests, some easy some harder; daily rewards; optional side quests; optional dungeons to explore then grind for xp and shillings; an engaging story-line. You can determine for yourself the difficulty of this game by what features you want to use. You can choose to not accept daily rewards and instead gain the items yourself just as one can choose to not use the auto-combat feature and turn off the auto-potion feature. PoE, Baldur's Gate, and WoW fans should gve this game a try.			"

												I am extremely addicted. It has a bit of a learning curve compared to most RPGs and I don't really recommend it as your first to learn the genre. This game is definitely extremely fun and it keeps your interest piqued throughout the game as you advance through levels unlocking more and more features of the game to help boost your character from skills to benefits! The community is pretty cool for the most part too. You will often see the same people chatting in World chat with each other getting along most of the time. I definitely recommend it!			"

												From the time I played of the game which was 6 hours. I enjoyed what I did. Now I do have to say the classes to choice from are llimited the classes seem to be real good. At least once you have choosen you class and lvled up enough. There are about 4 classes to choice from. I choice the gunner class, and my lvl is currently 14. Like in most rpg games there is a guild in this one it's called a Company. There are Company War's everyday at a certain time. Besides the Company War's there are many other events to do in the game once you are the right lvl to take place in them. Some events once you get to a high lvl you will no longer be able to take place in them. Also once you get far enough in the game you will be able to get a vechile that you can get on when you want to. Now for attack style you can choice from three different things. Dual weild Two handed and Shield and Weapon. Each one gives you a different boost. This is a fun game to play you can upgrade your weapons equipment and vechile.			"

												I do enjoy this game's combat system.  I good mix of mobility and strategy, and it's not just a simple point in click.However.  Absolutely remove the 'click to complete' quest option, where once you click it, it automatically finishes the quest for you.  Makes it feel like you think player's are clueless.  These other things I could really ignore because it has a good theme to it despite the rather low model graphics.  However there is one HORRIBLE thing that keeps me from playing it.The camera angle.  Seriously.  It's awful.  You can barely customize it, and when you do it resets it back to the default, low-to-the-ground, close up angle.  Makes this game impossible to play.  Maybe that's why you put the 'click to complete' option?3/10 - Don't recommend.			"

Lack of challenging content, with AI questing that seems quite weak. Limited exploration and growth make this a game to log inot and play for half an hour when all your other game servers are full.

												I have played this game for a reasonable amount now and I can give a decent review of it.First off, CoS is a great MMO, especially since to play, it's 100% free. It does have microtransactions and some big rewards to encourage 'recharging your electrum' (buying the in game currency). While that would put some people off, you don't need to spend money on this game, it's naturally fun in many ways.The graphics are not the best, though it makes up with the imagination of the whole landscape and characters, it's outstanding.The game uses dungeons mostly to create gameplay, the quests are slightly 'meh' and dull but the dungeons they throw you into are pretty cool and fun to do, but then i'm easily impressed.Anyone looking for a unique and fun MMO with dungeons and buyable mounts/pets? CoS is great for you!			"

												Mechanist Games is just one of those seedy developers that takes your money than shuts down the game to work on a new one.In regards to gameplay? This game is what you would get if you combined Diablo and WoW together in a Skinner box then removed the requirement to be present at your computer to play it. What do I mean? Well this game is so simple you could play it with one hand. Thankfully if you pay money everything is automated so you can play it with no hands. Frees up that other hand for even more furious batin'.			"

												Ehhhhh...there is no non vote so I am going with a no. My review is going to be all over the place because I am just going to type it as it comes to me rather than seperating it out.  Like others have said, there is a lot of auto piloting in the game, though that isn't necessarily tragic. what gets me is the rigidity of the world. the world has potential but its repetitive and has lots of invisible walls. It isn't a horrible game but it isn't an outstanding one either.  It does reward clocking in and consecutive play but also rewards you for down time as well.  It does these rewards for each individual character. There is no switch characters button though, so you have to quit completely and relaunch the game for every character.  For a game that tries to be cash shop heavy by giving you a way to buy extra upgrade supplies and cosmetic stuff, it is almost impossible to buy the currency. None of the buttons for buying/recharging work in the game. The only way is to buy the bundles through Steam.  Another thing is if you played this from their launcher originally and hoped to move your character over...nope, not happening, either stick with their launcher or start over through Steam.  There is more stuff to be positive and negative about but I give it an overall Meh rating.  It is however something easy to do when multi-tasking other projects and is relatively computer resource light.			"

												I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to play a casual style MMORPG.  You can even set your dungeon runs to auto-pilot if you happen to have to go AFK for a minute or two, which is helpful when you have to refill a drink or use the bathroom lolI am however having trouble logging into the game today and the game updates in the forums are lacking.  I don't know if anyone else is having similar issues but after verifying the game integrity and then updating the missing files it puts me in a constant loop.  Maybe my graphics card finally needs to be replaced or something but it can still play high end games with no issues so i suspect it can't be the graphics.Either way it is a fun game and for free you have nothing to lose :)Edit: I solved my issue by closing the Steam Client, right clicking on the Start Menu icon and running as Administrator.  Game ran fine afterwards :)			"

												I really wish there was a neutral recommendation for this game because I don't love it but at the same time I don't really hate it either. There are some aspects of the game that are interesting and different, at least for me anyways. Such as all the extra quests you can do when you don't want to follow the storyline (if that's even a thing in this game). The fishing and mining mechanism as well as the motorcycle ride and upgrade system and the transmutology feature are very interesting.However, the game is quite glitchy. I started a character awhile back and she ended up falling through the map and I couldn't figure out how to fix it so I had to start a new character all over again. The graphics are also not the best, but I'm not saying that graphics make a game good, they're just very mediocre. The glaring problem with this game is that YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO PLAY IT. There's an autocombat feature. If you click on the quest on the right hand side, it'll just take you to the npc or dungeon entrance, you don't have to do it yourself. This game is faceroll easy, even WoW is more advanced than this.In short 9/10 recommend for newbie MMORPG players.2/10 recommend for experienced MMORPG players who aren't looking to waste time not playing a game.EDIT: There's also a strong emphasis on P2W. Even so, it doesn't make the game unplayable if you choose not to invest in it.			"

												The fact that this game plays itself seems more somewhat of a sign of a show and less of a sign of a game makes peoplethink of what are considered games these days, yet I still find myself busy making sure my character is on the right track to establishing my inventory. These games are really just meant for people that want to just sit down and enjoy a nice looking game with the less hassling feel of a normal game.So my review is somewhat a little easy on the game for the fact that it plays itself, stillthe fact that I would rather spend most of my time on Flash Games then this really justifies the factthat it does get repetitive. So I would like to give this a 5/10 ""Half an Half Baba!""			"

												I have played this game for a reasonable amount now and I can give a decent review of it.First off, CoS is a great MMO, especially since to play, it's 100% free. It does have microtransactions and some big rewards to encourage 'recharging your electrum' (buying the in game currency). While that would put some people off, you don't need to spend money on this game, it's naturally fun in many ways.The graphics are not the best, though it makes up with the imagination of the whole landscape and characters, it's outstanding.The game uses dungeons mostly to create gameplay, the quests are slightly 'meh' and dull but the dungeons they throw you into are pretty cool and fun to do, but then i'm easily impressed.Anyone looking for a unique and fun MMO with dungeons and buyable mounts/pets? CoS is great for you!			"

												Boring combat, quest system, and world. The only loot mobs drop are shillings (money) and one item off bosses. There's nothing to find in the world. Playing a melee class, I hardly ever dropped in health and never needed any potions. Others may think this is a plus, but for me it was just boring. Further easy mode evidenced in the quest system whereby you just click on the quest in your q-log and it just takes you there. Again, some may think it's a plus but it just amounts to clicking one button and spamming one key for the whole game. No reason not to give it a try, because it is free to play, but I couldn't be bothered to keep going once I hit level 11.			"

												I don't really mind this game, I've played  a couple hours and it's free. There are pay options but I haven't needed them yet.The only bugbear I have is that at one point I had to by a potion from this machine to progress through the game, I didn't need real money to buy the potion but the instructions didn't state buy a potion from here to proceed so I almost got stuck. Then there was trying to find lumber in one of the areas as part of a quest it was relatively hard to find. I played this game in advanced mode where I could 360 the camera and use abilities and such, and I chose the fighter route because I wanted to tank it out.I beat the bosses and such and got some good gear, it seems the bosses only sometimes drop gear sometimes they drop nothing and it's not clear that they will ever drop anything unless you redo the dungeon, beacause there is a limit to how much gold exp and a boss counter you can get per dungeon run through. Also bosses just keep respawning pretty quick if you hang around be prepared to refight the boss or run for the exit which is usually not far from the boss.But I did get good gear and I picked skills that helped me solo dungeons because I don't always have friends to bail me out.As far as what you need to put in to the game to play well thats the good point just a 50 mg download and small updates and your in.As someone who deletes games off his computer because of file size especially mmos I don't like, I'm happy to keep this one going as it's not that big a deal leaving it on.  I can see why people don't like it but hell it gave me a motorbike in the first hour of the game and then upgraded it in the second and I don't care if the game auto drives me places if I click the quest button if I want to drive around I can and if I'm lost blammo a button that takes me where I need to go, pretty smick.I give it a 8/10P.S. on my comp it comes up with an error saying to close the program, I just minimzed it because the game runs fine then made sure I had read the error message and set my taskbar to auto hide so I could see the whole screen and everything was hunckydory.

												From the time I played of the game which was 6 hours. I enjoyed what I did. Now I do have to say the classes to choice from are llimited the classes seem to be real good. At least once you have choosen you class and lvled up enough. There are about 4 classes to choice from. I choice the gunner class, and my lvl is currently 14. Like in most rpg games there is a guild in this one it's called a Company. There are Company War's everyday at a certain time. Besides the Company War's there are many other events to do in the game once you are the right lvl to take place in them. Some events once you get to a high lvl you will no longer be able to take place in them. Also once you get far enough in the game you will be able to get a vechile that you can get on when you want to. Now for attack style you can choice from three different things. Dual weild Two handed and Shield and Weapon. Each one gives you a different boost. This is a fun game to play you can upgrade your weapons equipment and vechile.			"

												The game is a very interesting MMO to play. The combat is like what you'd find in dungeon crawlers like diablo and torchlight while mixing it in with normal mmos like Wow or Guild wars. The main problem i have with the game is it is rather easy so i wouldn't jump into this game if your looking for a challenge. Alot of the items that should be hard to find or get can be easily obtained by just doing secondary quests, leveling up, or just gathering resources. And becase of the dungeon crawler like combat you have alot of control of the fights and it really makes it so that all challenge is removed rather quickly after the tutorial. And cash is so easily gained that it might as well just be thrown out of a window. But if your looking for something to introduce you to mmos or just something to pass the time this may be worth a look			"

This game gives the players a chance to watch them selfs just relax to the filling of getting stronger it also has good selection of outfits and a nice simple battle system that anyone can learn in under five minutes. The people who complain and dont like this game are just people that want every game to be the same. Give the smaller games a chance and see what its like for your self before judging. p.s  sorry for any spelling mistakes.			"

												I don't really mind this game, I've played  a couple hours and it's free. There are pay options but I haven't needed them yet.The only bugbear I have is that at one point I had to by a potion from this machine to progress through the game, I didn't need real money to buy the potion but the instructions didn't state buy a potion from here to proceed so I almost got stuck. Then there was trying to find lumber in one of the areas as part of a quest it was relatively hard to find. I played this game in advanced mode where I could 360 the camera and use abilities and such, and I chose the fighter route because I wanted to tank it out.I beat the bosses and such and got some good gear, it seems the bosses only sometimes drop gear sometimes they drop nothing and it's not clear that they will ever drop anything unless you redo the dungeon, beacause there is a limit to how much gold exp and a boss counter you can get per dungeon run through. Also bosses just keep respawning pretty quick if you hang around be prepared to refight the boss or run for the exit which is usually not far from the boss.But I did get good gear and I picked skills that helped me solo dungeons because I don't always have friends to bail me out.As far as what you need to put in to the game to play well thats the good point just a 50 mg download and small updates and your in.As someone who deletes games off his computer because of file size especially mmos I don't like, I'm happy to keep this one going as it's not that big a deal leaving it on.  I can see why people don't like it but hell it gave me a motorbike in the first hour of the game and then upgraded it in the second and I don't care if the game auto drives me places if I click the quest button if I want to drive around I can and if I'm lost blammo a button that takes me where I need to go, pretty smick.I give it a 8/10P.S. on my comp it comes up with an error saying to close the program, I just minimzed it because the game runs fine then made sure I had read the error message and set my taskbar to auto hide so I could see the whole screen and everything was hunckydory.

												This is definetely the best MMORPG I've ever played. The controls are simple in the steampunk world, mostly the same as any other in the genre, but this game brings more to the table. With a very simple and unrestricting story line, you are free to play any way you want. Whether you play for the PvP and make your way to the top of the leaderboard, or you play a story based game, or you just mess around with your friends, the game is always exciting to use. I have played for almost 300 hours now (mostly AFK since you get rewards for being AFK) and the whole game has been constantly rewarding. The game has so many rewarding features that no other MMORPG has, and they all make this the greatest MMORPG I've ever seen.There is also NO need to purchase anything with actual money in the game. Everything can be gained with a little elbow grease and time. Of course though, this game should not be so sparing. If you had to pay for a subscription in this game, I would do so gladly, even more gladly than games such as World of Warcraft and ESO. This is a have to have for anyone who wants a new spin on the the repetitive MMORPG genre.			"

												If u dont mind repetitive daily fights and a WoW like game then this can be amusing to play. The auto combat button makes fighting easier. Just click and sit back and let ur avatar do the work. Having a mercenary to help ya fight and a pet to collect ur dropped money leaves little for the player to worry bout. This is one of those games where u can play and collect xp while ur playing another game or off doing ur chores. u even collect xp for being offline. no reason not to try it			"

												Mechanist Games is just one of those seedy developers that takes your money than shuts down the game to work on a new one.In regards to gameplay? This game is what you would get if you combined Diablo and WoW together in a Skinner box then removed the requirement to be present at your computer to play it. What do I mean? Well this game is so simple you could play it with one hand. Thankfully if you pay money everything is automated so you can play it with no hands. Frees up that other hand for even more furious batin'.			"

												I really wish there was a neutral recommendation for this game because I don't love it but at the same time I don't really hate it either. There are some aspects of the game that are interesting and different, at least for me anyways. Such as all the extra quests you can do when you don't want to follow the storyline (if that's even a thing in this game). The fishing and mining mechanism as well as the motorcycle ride and upgrade system and the transmutology feature are very interesting.However, the game is quite glitchy. I started a character awhile back and she ended up falling through the map and I couldn't figure out how to fix it so I had to start a new character all over again. The graphics are also not the best, but I'm not saying that graphics make a game good, they're just very mediocre. The glaring problem with this game is that YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO PLAY IT. There's an autocombat feature. If you click on the quest on the right hand side, it'll just take you to the npc or dungeon entrance, you don't have to do it yourself. This game is faceroll easy, even WoW is more advanced than this.In short 9/10 recommend for newbie MMORPG players.2/10 recommend for experienced MMORPG players who aren't looking to waste time not playing a game.EDIT: There's also a strong emphasis on P2W. Even so, it doesn't make the game unplayable if you choose not to invest in it.			"

												Played until level 60 then left due to too many glitchs, game crashes, in game items and currency disappearing and dev's/mods refusing to replace or fix the problems. Too many class balance problems that the dev's are floundering to fix. When they do make an attempt at balancing the classes they are taking bad advice from the players who only want to see their class become 100% op with heals and support classes weak and unplayable as anything else. Long story short it is a grind, PvP, rinse and repeat game. If your into rude mods and dev's that only have an interest in finding more ways to make P2W players empty their pockets you'll feel right at home. "
