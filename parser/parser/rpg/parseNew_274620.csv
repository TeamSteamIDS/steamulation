Early Access Review
								Writing this based on the first alpha build!The game has improved a lot ! Positive :  Class skills Smooth combat Skilled based combat (actually hard) Fun battlegrounds with a nice pve style boss touch.  Level system that gives you a reason to play. (achievements etc. incomming) Both keyboard and Console.Negative :  Heavy on the gpu Some bots are just impossible to beat :) (might just be my lack of skill)   Not so many players ( yet again alpha so this will improve! ) Overall opinion: The game is still taking babysteps but they are amazing steps, From trying the pre-alpha to the alpha i saw the game changing so much. My favourite change is the whole Lobby menu and optimisation for keyboard. Very nice!I recommend everyone to try this game aslong as you're willing to accept it's alpha and you might have to wait a while to get a deathmatch going. Patience is a virtue!			"

Early Access Review
								OK, It is Early Access game and so its still work in progress. There are some tech issues in joining a match lobby and Devs are working on it and on keyboard controls and further customization. Now is the game good at basic? I think yes. It has potential to be very good and is even now quite fun and I fear addictive. Its Combat arcade meets RPG Fantasy. A Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter in fiery pits of hell and fighters from fantasy epics meets survival. Its simply a fun multiplayer combat game set in RPG mould. I found it simply fun and addictive. Even at early stage its deeply satisfying. Menu is simple and easy to follow. Graphics is quite good. Its a dog eat dog ruthless world. The environment, the players everyone or everything is your enemy. You don't just have to beat the enemy players in rapid deathmatches or the Bosses that jump in simply to kill all, you have to survive also the hostile environment while trying to stay alive and thats both challenging and fun. There are no friends here or even temporary allies to face bigger enemies. You are on your own all the time and anything that can move will certainly kill you. Between friends this will be a kind of extremely fun vs mode, if you are bored of shooting folks down or sniping them in normal vs games. Have fun guys! I look forward to playing this more in coming days.			"

Early Access Review
								I have difficulty at present joining a friend server but its due to this being pre-alpha and in early stage of development so there will be tech issues. Good GFX. That said, once I got to play a few rounds i think it was awesome fun and can be a great hangout for friends who want a new flavor in deathmatches. Kill each other, kill big bosses and try to top the round at same time even as the maps can make you do suicide if you don't watch out. Layers of challenge and all fast paced. It can only get better. Yes lots of work left to do but it seems to be going in the right direction. I would like to see some single player campaigns in this, or quests added to multiplayer mode.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is still early access so I wasn't expecting a complete game, however, I was expecting to play the game.There are hardly any players on this game, usually 1 or 2, with an all time peak of 13. Let me put that into context:   Game Playing Now All Time Peak   H1Z1 10,160 40,254   The Crew 373 12,180   The Secret World 322 3,634   Elite: Dangerous 3,003 9,139 The lack of players wouldn't be a problem for Skara if it had a single player mode. There are lots of steam users who have the game, 60 out of 290 of my friends own the game.Currently this online only game is basically unplayable. You can start a game alone but you are just battling against the same bot, over and over and over...If this game changes in the future I will update my review.			"

												Lots of potential here. Skill based games have gotten scarce over the last few years. Multiplayer gaming is being dumbed down to an extent, where there is literally no learning process required anymore. I think, that for players looking for a game, that's demanding to learn and hard to master Skara could be a blink on the horizon. At the current state, there is only a sneak peak offered I guess but it gives quite a good insight of the games feel. As far as I have seen know the Devs are sticking to a regular pace, when it comes to updates. Personally, I have big hopes for this game. Many of the negative reviews are kind of misleading imho. It's a multiplayer arena game, if you don't like arena games, don't buy it and write a negative review for gods sake. So basically, if your into the idea of a skill based, multiplayer arena game you should deffinitly give this one a closer look.			"

Early Access Review
								*Will update with each update*Can't recommend this game yet.1) Whenever I try to enter an existing game-lobby I get a black screen.2) Whenever I press start in the menu, game crashes.3) There is no kills counter so playing is pretty pointless at the momment4) Controls are not optimized, any movement has a delay that makes you feel you have no 'control' over your character.I recommend the developers to aim for playability and smoothness rather than graphics. Also, once you have the controls, the fighting stuff, you can play with game-modes and more kind of characters, but rushing it like this isn't the way to go imho.			"

												This product was given for free to review. tl;drThe game has potential. I suggest grab some friends and play it. Its fun, although it does have its issues. It has a long way to go before I can fully recommend it.tl;drSkara is a medieval PvP RPG action game. There are 3 game modes free for all, deathmatch (which is actually a hard-point type mode) and a duel mode. I played with the Kharn class which was very fun to play, the more you play and level the mode abilities you unlock such as the charge etc. Skara is a strategic game where hits and dodges must be planned before hand, so do not depend on button mashing.. It won't get you very far in this game. The game is stunning to look at, since it was made with Unreal engine - that isn't that hard to believe. There are a few cons with this game but I will get into that later. I feel like this game has a good base, it just needs a push in the right direction.Pros  Looks stunning, the world is just awesome to look at, I played in high settings and it looked gorgeous.  Controls are solid, and you can remap them easily in the menu if you don't like them (I played with the Xbox controller.)  There is a nice range of classes to chose from and a few customization features with in game credits.  The game modes are fun, I liked the deathmatch mode with the hard-point game play. You captured the hard-points and then pillars spawned in the middle for you to defend after a certain amount of time.   The game is easy to pick up but you have to master timing of hits, abilities etc which gives a nice learning curve to it.  The menu is nicely set out and is easy to navigate.Cons  I had some screen tearing issues... But there was no v-sync setting in the graphics tab. Actually there was no in depth graphic settings, only the basic low, medium and high  Controls feel quite clunky at times  This is not the games fault completely but there are very few players... When writing this review there is 4 players in game with a peak of 8... So please find some friends to play with or you will be stuck with the bots  This brings me to my next point which is the AI. The AI needs improving. A lot of the times the AI would be running into walls and not capturing points or attacking when I was capturing.   The game has crashed and black screened my computer resulting in me having to restart my PC. "

Early Access Review
								**Edited 9/18/2015I would like to start this review by commending the Development Team for being extraordinarily involved with the community and quite friendly. I asked a question before purchasing the game and the creator of Skara The Blade Remains, cromlech_, responded in a detailed and helpful manner. He then proceeded to invite me to his friend list and took the time to chat with me about my opinion regarding the game. This Dev team seems to be trying really hard to engage the community, be transparent, and take all of our suggestions to heart, and it's wonderful. For anyone interested in Q&A about the game etc., I recommend asking on the forums about when there will be Dev streams on Twitch. After the Q&A they will also be playing the game, so you can watch live footage straight from the Devs. See the TL;DR at the bottom for a short summary of my review. Now, for the actual review- which I will likely edit as I play more of the game, play more characters, and as the game evolves:As you would have likely noted, this game just released in a true Alpha state rather recently(about 3-4 months ago). Currently, since the announcement of true alpha, there has been at least one update a month; the last two updates added a playable tutorial, some new skills, bug fixes, implementation of suggestions by the community such as keybinding etc., This game is still in early Alpha - and I repeat, IT IS EARLY ALPHA. Do not expect a fully fleshed out game yet. The framework is there, and it looks quite promising. It will be free to play in the future, so if you would like to wait until its full release to play, then by all means, please do so. That being said, right now your job if you purchase this game is to test current balance between characters, test maps and game systems, and make suggestions on how to improve the game - because the Devs will listen and almost always respond.General Gameplay - This game has a ton of potential and will be ludicrously fun once all the features are implemented. Right now there are 3 maps, one for each game mode, with plans for more. Some have lava(fall in it and you die) and levers that activate certain map effects. For example, in one map there's a ring in the center that gives way if you hit the lever and this leads to you, or your enemy, tumbling down into a pit of lava. There's also a huge boss-like monster that arises from within the depths of an arena. Currently this monster is an NPC and will attack every player that comes near it - players get extra points for hitting and killing it. A clever player could just stand back as his/her feeble opponents attempt to battle it..and pick them off as they back away in horror. Alas, you will respawn after perishing..so find solace in that.There are 3 game modes. Team deathmatch, free for all, and duel. They are fairly self-explanatory. - I will update this section further the more I play, if I notice any notable deviations. Each character, as you level up, has a set of skills the player can pick. Hold down RT or RB on the gamepad to execute said skills. Shinse has a skill that makes her invisible for a short period of time, and a teleportation ability that switches the player's position with that of his/her target. Also, the devs recently added an ability called, ""forest wind,"" basically you can dash forward in a straight line, damaging any opponents in your path. They also added 1 new skill for the other two currently playable characters, which you can unlock through progressing(leveling up). There are plans to add passive skills and more primary skills.There will be a store where you can buy costumes and weapons with in-game currency as well. These costumes will modify stats. There will be daily quests/missions, factions, gems to modify stats and more in the future. There are placeholders available for them in game already, but they haven't been implemented yet. For new players - There is a playable tutorial right after you create your first character. It explains basic attack, movement, and how to utilize your special attacks. You'll also be able to test out your skills at the end of the tutorial against a few AI opponents.Most of the above systems are fairly barebones at the moment, because, well, it's an early alpha. Once they become more fleshed out, the game will have far more depth. I say that to warn the people expecting some kind of fully fleshed out product, in the hopes that the people purchasing the game will do so knowing that they are helping develop it with their suggestions et al., Combat Gameplay - Each character utilizes a string based on heavy/light attacks. I use an Xbox 360 gamepad so this would be RB and RT. I have played Shinse, thus far. She is a quick assassin-like character.  Her attacks feel appropriately light and heavy depending on what combination of attacks utilized, and they also look nice. Each character can also throw projectiles, a limited number, per life using the A button. Blocking is here too, but blocking attacks drains stamina - and you do NOT want your stamina drained or your block broken as you will be brutally punished by the AI or other players. That being said, the AI so far is kind of placeholder - For example, if you stealth as Shinse the AI will just stand there until you appear again. The last of the controls I will mention here is the ""dodge"" ability(B on the gamepad), which effectively...dodges. How effective the dodge is depends on your character - some of the heavy characters are a bit slower to dodge. The devs also added 3 new abilities - one for each class, so far I have tried Shinse's out and it is mapped to the X button(again, using a 360 gamepad) by default.Graphics - The game is optimized fairly well for an early alpha, though with recent updates the optimization seems to have gotten a bit worse. That being said, I experienced no notable system lag with all settings maxed. It looks really nice too. I realize ""nice"" is a vague descriptor, but it's the best I have. To put it another way- this game pleases my ocular orbs.Controls - They are quite responsive. There doesn't seem to be any noticeable input lag. This game does have gamepad (360/Xbox) support as well as keyboard support. The developer has implemented keybindings with update 0.5.3.Community/Online - You'll likely match up against the creative developer and creator of the game if you try out the online. Sadly, the community is fairly small at the moment and you may fight exclusively bots a majority of the time. I hope this changes in the future because these guys deserve both your support and your input as both will help make this game great.So if the game is so early, why do I recommend it? Well, because I really like how involved the Developer is with the community, it shows supreme potential that I have no doubt will be met, and as a barebones early alpha, it's actually pretty fun! TL;DR - Right now you're buying into an early alpha, with an established framework(meaning there's stuff there, like characters, some maps to fight on etc., but it's basic at the moment. Many features still have to be implemented), to help test out balance, make suggestions for improvements, and support the developer. That being said, it's only a $5 buy-in, and it is indeed fun even at this early stage of development. ^_^			"

Early Access Review
								Game is in early release, and may improve.Cons:Game is controller-centric. Game has no single player  experience.Game is NOT an rpg: It does have a full, rich storyline. However, the only thing you the player can do is fight in an arena - you aren't engaged in the story element. There aren't even NPC to interact with.Combat controls are subpar - weapons do not work like their real-world counterparts. If you try to host an arena-match, you will be fast dissapointed as the controls are not explained to you, and the NPCs all attack/stun you to repeated death.This game is in a severe alpha and is in need of massive improvement.

If you want a defined, completed game, you shouldnt buy this, cause you would be so frustrated since is an alpha.Is you want to be part of the game, you should totally buy it. You will have in your hands the power to enhance a fighting VS game, from the very beggining. The devs are working hard to give us info so we can work. They encourage us to give our feedback, they listen and they will do EVERYTHING in their hands to implement it if most of the community wants it.The game right now is at is core. Still, it has a great source (Unreal 4 i think). Thats gives the game some nice graphics. The mechanics need to be polished, but thats why we are here.They really work under 2 basis: Skara is OUR game, meaning this: We will contribute a lot for the game, in this state and even when released. And: Trust your skills, not your Stats, meaning this game will aim to be a skilled game, and, in the future, maybe an E-Sport, where nothing is left to luck.The amount you pay for the game, will be compensated in the future with in-game currency and some things. So, you dont loose your money, you just contribute from earlier (Wich is needed, given their nature as Indie developers).Im really engaged with the development of this game. Will you be part of Skara? "

Early Access Review
								Downloaded this game after hearing a fair amount about it in various press articles / Facebook.IMO it's got a lot of potential. It seems that the graphics and visual quality are extremely high, particularly for a 'to-be' free-to-play game once it is officially released. Despite this, I think there remains a fair amount to do for example improving the FPS levels and smoothing the motion of characters during combat. It would be cool to see the combat systems developed a little more also, particularly for the Kharn race which is a personal favourite.Clearly this is a early-access version so i'm struggling to understand peoples complaints -  I'm assuming that's why the developers have uploaded it, to get feedback from the community. Verdict: by no means perfect, but a game that possesses serious potential - the UNREAL4 engine's graphics are quite astonishing. I'll be keeping a close and regular eye on this one. Worth a download if you want to give this game the final push it needs to make its mark.-S			"

								If Early Access is your thing and you are willing to go for a game development ride, then go for Skara. The team behind this game are hard working and dedicated to making a game that is community driven and reflective of what they want to play. I've watched the team change big elements of the design just because some active players had a few good ideas. This is the magic sauce that will make a potentially good game great. It's still a ways from being completed, and there are hiccups (especially for less than perfectly up-to-date computers) but looking past those, it is clear this is going to be a game worth playing for a long time.

								Skara - The Blade Remains is a very interesting project, I am one of the original Kickstarter backers. You can really tell that the developers have a passion for the game and do their best to improve it. They are eager to hear what the community thinks and love to hear feedback of how to improve the game. They’re really putting that feedback to use by implementing and changing things suggested by the community. It’s one of the things that I can highly appreciate.The design of the characters, environment and the concept art  is phenomenal. They definitely have talented people working on the project. The characters are all very unique and diverse which is pretty nice. Currently they have implemented two out of the five characters that they have announced. The environments have changed over-time quite a bit and are beautiful. You currently can play in three different maps and they’re pretty diverse. I like the fact that they keep things minimalistic yet diverse. The game is in early access still so the game is far from being completed. If you’re looking for a well-polished and functional game I wouldn’t recommend the game in its current state. The combat, user interface and some technical issues are the biggest problem right now and they still need a lot of work. Because there’s still quite a bit of work that has to be done before the game will become “good” there’s also a low population.If you’re willing to see the project grow larger, test new builds and give feedback to the developers then I would definitely support the project.

												itsy bitsy review(more of a note about the progress really):the game has come quite far over its development(i've had it for approx. a year now if my memory serves me right, i can check if it really matters to anyone).the game currently has 4 different classes, which players can unlock for free(just need levels)each class currently has 3 skills which you can mix and match to suit your style, in addition to ranged abillities and talents.the game itself is an arena fighting game which plays very well.you have all the lovely basics- light attacks which stagger the foe and do most of the work,heavy attacks which add their own special touch to the mix, combination attacks, and lastly, dodging and blocking(all in the flavor of dark souls- to those of us who need a reference).things get a little different thanks to the different races(whose roles ill try not to go too far into because the game is still in development and things change but on the surface):-khan, the tanky giant axe carrying folks with a bit of a super armor and a slow attack to go with it(super armor as in doesnt stagger not the ""i dont take damage"")-shinse, nimble, agile, dextrous, more words that show accuracy and quickness. these guys are the friendly neighborhood assassins with their set of skills to get past armored foes and keep them guessing while they do it-tamvasa, the newly introduced ice folk with their dual axes who can either support their teammates by weakening foes or unleash a barrage of blows on their own-celean, the veteran humans(humans, right?) who use their spear and shield to keep enemies in check before they charge them down.(currently things are mostly balanced btw and ive used all classes to defeat all classes with fair ammount of ease but not lacking depth)the game also has different game modes, which will change how you can use your classes a little:a duel 1v1 mode, simple as it soundsa colloseum free for all PVPVE mode with a giant boss monster(named ""the groth"")a team versus team conquest mode.tldr;the game plays well. its taking its shape well and and came a long way over the time,the dev team is nice and communicative(very active on their steam forums)the fighting is the easy to get into hard to master kind of thing.the bad parts:fps drops come to visit at times, lags in multiplayer and crashes(inevitable for a beta build)			"

Yet what you have here is a Dark Souls-esque arena third-person fighter with a rich set of lore and solid graphics via Unreal Engine 4.I love stuff like this, for some reason.  But it's free at the moment; just need to sign up at the right place.  I argue it's worth trying.			"

Through unique versus combat technology, players can control the direction of their attacks and make specialized combinations, block and dodge their enemies and counter-attack. The Combat system will be customizable and players will be able to unblock new movements, special attacks and even fatalities as they progress in the game.			"

								So I now have almost 50 into this game and can say its really good for the state it is in. It just went through a stress test this weekend and the servers are being improved based on the data gathered. The devs are super active in the discussions and seem to reply within less than an hour in a lot of cases. I love the combat and setting. The cultures feel really unique and smooth. Each character has interesting abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Some people have issues with being stun locked but that is why you are able to dodge. Focus on not being hit in the first place. It plays similar to Mortal Kombat in the sense that you are always trying to find oppening to punish your opponents. Give it a try!			"

YouTube™ Video: ARENA WITH PEOPLE AND AI?! | Skara - First Impressions 

			Views: 82		

			How long has it been since I did a First Impressions Video??? Thank you again for watching and leave a like if you enjoyed the video and subscribe for more videos in the future!		

I've been following Skara on Twitter for a while and I was quite excited to check the game out when it arrived! I mention this in the video as well, but I realize how hard it is to create a game on Unreal 4, and I think they did a fantastic job on it. The animations weren't choppy nor the graphics. As an indie game, I think they're going in the right direction.But, as an indie game and of early stage of development, a lot of things currently are questionable. One thing that really stood out for me is the free-for-all arena with a boss battle. The mode lacked direction as I had no idea what to kill. Hitting the boss gave me some points, but it wasn't as rewarding as killing off the characters who were getting damaged by the boss. In conclusion of this, I felt that the boss was more like an obstacle for people to avoid instead of trying to defeat. Regardless, I'm happy that this game was able to go through testing and I was part of it. I see great potential in the game and I hope the devs continue their best to keep it going!			"

I have played the game with the graphics maxed out @1080p on a GTX480 and an old core 2 quad-controls are easy to get used to -characters are totally different but well balanced-challenging enough but not hard to be frustrating-i did not find a single bug / crash yet-back-stabbing is fun :D-very active developers-fair pricecons: -not that much content for the moment (that's normal for a game in early access)I personally loved it and i can't wait for it to get more updates!Really recommend it!10/10, would stab again! :)			"

Early Access Review
								I am very excited for this game. Obviously, as it is early access, purchasing the game at this stage isn't for everyone. However, I enjoy seeing the updates as they come and playing them as soon as possible to get a feel of where the game is going. I heard about Skara a few weeks ago and cannot wait to bring all my friends in to play it when it's more stable :) The graphics are beautiful and what they seem to have in mind keeps me excited for updates.TL;DR,It's early access, buying it now will mean you're getting it before it's ""finished"".If you don't want to go ahead and buy, add it to your wishlist and follow it and check back every so often!

								If Prince of Persia were to have deathmatches, this would be it. Its early access and not quite ready. But the framework is there. The deathmatches are fun, the boss jumping in to make it random good idea. Long term lots of potential to work. Its fun enough for a few rounds between friends.			"

												The game is great, has good combat, and shows a lot of promise. Being early access, it has a small community, and needs some server tweaks (the games a bit laggy) but besides from that. Shows a lot of promise, I suggest trying it out at least once, this game could get a lot bigger.			"

												This is a game that you say to yourself ""I must start to play this game now because this is going to be huge and i want to be a legend in this game."" In this game money does not mean anything it's all up to you. If you understand the game mechanics you will be great at this game. Of course there's some problems in game.. but it's a close beta so it's a normal thing. -Graphic Optimization is not okay. I have a mid-tier computer but i cant play ""Team Deathmatch"" in low setting. I hope it will be fixed-Chars are not balanced. I think Shinse is too much powerful. She's fast and his skills making too much damage. It would be great that if her skills were making less damage. -Throwing stuffs should be aimable. Because i want to throw stuffs to opponents route so i can hit. -There aren't too much players playing the game right now but in 2-3 weeks there will be more players because it's going to be open beta(As i read)Great things about game:+Graphics are looking great+Gameplay is hard. So it makes the game more competetive+Soundtrack is ok+And developer of this game is cooloest person on the earth.  You guys can add him in steam. Ask him questions, talk him and make suggestions for game.+Game has too much potential and it's becoming more and more better every day. You guys should start to play this game right now because it's going to be huge believe me :) "

Early Access Review
								With the latest update, I am finally actually able to play this game.Before this update: IF I got into a match (crashes happened)(only ever mess with bots, not sure I have a good enough connection to mess with PvP), there was a delay of no less than 15 seconds between hitting an input and finally seeing the action happen.After this update: I can play the game almost as smoothly as is shown in the trailer. I have very high hopes for Skara. Yes, the game is incredibly rough if you consider the devs' ambition, but, seeing the amount of polish put into the game in this one update (i.e. there were no options at all and now there are enough to (maybe) satisfy most (for now)), I am incredibly hopeful. If you approach the game at face-value - as an arena fighter - you, too, will no doubt see only potential and spread the word that ""Hey, there's something to this game.""[[I am friends with one of the dev's because they friended me after I posted in a discussion, where I complained (before this latest update) that I couldn't play the game. He reassured me that a new update would be coming soon that should take care of it. Skara is, at the moment, an arena fighter, capable of supporting single player versus bots, but meant for PvP. My endorsing of the game might seem like advertisement I was paid to do. It is not. It is simply my recognizing that without a community, Skara could go nowhere. I want this game to be successful. *spreadin' the word*]]Skara definitely seems like a prime example of Early Access done right - invest in the game and watch it get better and better. Currently there are three maps and two characters with three different Armors/Skins (one of these cosmetics is ""Coming Soon""). The basics of the fighting system are pretty well done; Skara is not a button-masher, so be decisive in doing what you do (the only complaint that I have with the controls is that the Lock-On (using a controller) seems unresponsive at times) - this is to say that if you get your fighter into a combo, there really doesn't seem to be a way to cancel out of it. Rolling might work, but the camera (whether you're locked-on to an enemy or not) seems to get locked, or at least stiffened, while you're in a combo too. Playing as the Gladiator, I get destroyed by the Assassin, who is much quicker and can teleport (not necessarily hinting that there is a balance issue, because I really think the game is pretty polished thus far - except maybe the fighting being a little too stiff(?)). (Perhaps too) Optimistic (that word usually goes as well with Tynon as ""cold"" goes with ""fire,"" so hopefully that's a good testament), I think that there is zero chance of Skara being perverted into a bad game that disappoints. The developers truly want to make a great game; they are eager to play with people who post ""Multiplayer game with no players?"" just waiting for that word of mouth to help Skara take off. With devs as invested as these, yeah, Skara will be big.EDIT: To clarify my ""the fighting [is] a little too stiff"" comment: Having played the game further, I now have a better feel for what exactly Skara is. It is a deliberate, basic fighter. To elaborate:Have you ever been playing a fighting game and just could not reckon it? There're the 88-fingered wiz's and there are those with, er, an eidetic muscle memory. Thus, there are those who mash buttons in the hope of achieving some awesome combo and there are those who attempt to memorize specific combo's (no doubt just to mix them up and fail). Skara is a deliberate, basic fighter. Though it could be argued that in those other fighting games you've only yourself to blame if you're not good - I think, in that case, it's either a lack of will or manual dexterity. In Skara, it is ONLY up to your ability to anticipate and react. There are no 4-line long combos. There are no cheap Hadoken techniques. So if you're not good at Skara, it's either because of lag in hand-eye coordination or because you're approaching it wrong...My complaining that the combat might be too stiff was misinformed. I was expecting some sort of flighty fighter; Skara is more akin to a heavy-weight chess match. You really do have to plan and counter with the quickness - it's hard (if even possible) to cancel actions so as to reinforce this: If you make a mistake, you will pay. So. If a game of pure skill is what you're after, as opposed to games in which a certain Champion has this one power they keep spamming / a certain Killstreak keeps decimating you / a certain tactic is abused, rendering the game a ""Wait out the clock for inevitable defeat because there's no defense from that""...

Early Access Review
								Its early days and I was not trying this as this was a gift key from friend and I farmed cards. So when he invited me to play with him a round or 2, I obliged because he had gifted me, with a feeling of being put into a drag. I don't really like F2P multiplayers as there seem to be too many of them around. So when I tried a round in obligation, I was pleasantly surprised at how good this seemed despite being early days and how fun the vs games with a crazy big Boss jumping in was. Survival at all costs in a vs game? I am tempted to try this more now and am glad I kept an open mind in the end from my initial trepidations. My fears of this game were misplaced and it can only get more better.			"

								This game could be fun for a arena battle with friends ....if co-op it looks like you would be in a arena with friends against others. The only problem im having is no one is hosting a match yet and i hosted one and waited a while and there's nothing to do unless people are joined in a match to fight.  The graphics and character control is really talented artist with alot of potiential.  With what's available on this game i don't agree with the price if it was 1/4th of the price and each arena was a $5 add on that might make sense. But I bought a $20 game and no one to play with me or to battle.  I give this a recommend though because I think these guys are onto something good though. I like the graphics and gameplay. It is early access so i'll keep it a recommend for now and see how it goes.			"

Using range to your advantage, timing abilities, blocking and dodging, it's all there and it's well done. Controls are responsive, strong moves have good prep/reactionary periods, all that good stuff. As mentioned, the AI needs work (especially in pillar control, whatever that mode's actually called), and there are lag issues for actual multiplayer.Has potential, buy it on sale and hope they make the AI better?

												So far so good! Being a beta its still unpolished in some areas but my overall experience with Skara is great! Im loving the free-for-all mode with the boss at the end, a very nice touch.But what really shines here is the Team deathmatch mode with the interactive environment element added, it makes for some very interesting gameplay! Although i reckon it should be called ""Team Map Domination"" or something along those lines since thats pretty-much what it is, You need to control 3 points within the map for as long as possible while simultaneously attacking and defending.Like i said, so far, so good! judging by whats now available, i am very excited for the final release. After receiving my access code i hadto directly ask for more codes (5 in total) and we are all enjying it! Keep it up 8-bit!			"

								This is a great Early Access to join. It's AAA style quality but it still has a lot of room for player input. Moreover, the vision these guys are pitching is BIG. I mean, c'mon--players are going to get to be characters in the game?? That's awesome. But returning to the current game: I had a good time, played probably 4 or 5 matches, 3 of which took place with others. Lag wasn't a huge problem on my end (I know that's usually a hard issue for Early Access games to handle) and I really REALLY enjoyed playing with other players. The bots however aren't easy. I got slaughtered by them way too often to feel bored. In the end, this is a skills based game that can only get MUCH better. It already is fun, so get it and see you on the battlefield!			"

Early Access Review
IntroductionI believe this isn't my first review, although it certainly feels like it. Please forgive me if the following review is somewhat disjointed or disorganized in its structure. I would also like to tell you to take both my review and other reviews of this (and any game) with a pinch of salt. What I've written here are, of course, my own opinions. If this game interests you at all after reading this review, you should try it and form your own opinion on it!Skara - The Blade Remains is a multiplayer online team-based battle arena (or perhaps I should call it a fighting game?) with controls and gameplay similar to that of Lords of the Fallen or Dark Souls. You could call it a MOBA with the exceptions of the usual towers and minions that are commonly associated with those kind of games - this is all about the fighting. It is being developed by an independant group (in Spain if I'm not mistaken). It is currently in open alpha testing at the time of this review.So what makes this game good?To be perfectly honest, I went into this game with a clean mind. I had read many of the negative (and positive) reviews and so I decided it would be better to form my own opinion. I was quite surprised by the game, though.Skara has a lot of good elements going for it. While it is not that uncommon to find a third-person MOBA today, I think Skara is one of the only ones that actually has all of its emphasis on the fighting. If you've played a Souls game or something like Dragon's Dogma, you'll get the controls down pretty quickly. Other than your usual WASD-movement controls, your player character has a normal attack and a special attack which they can freely mix into combo attacks. Your character also has a defensive move (for instance, one character can block and another one can counter an attack with the right timing) and the ability to dodge (rolling, stepping or dashing depending on character) which gives you some frames of invincibility. It gives you all the tools necessary for enjoyable (if not a little clunky) intensive fights.Apart from your basic moves, each of the character types have access to three ""Signs"", or abilities, unique to them. These can be all from throwing your shield while setting it on fire like a pyromaniac Captain America, or placing a trap that encases your enemy (or even yourself or your allies!) in ice so they can't move. These Signs add a lot of versatility to your character and really opens up for interesting tactics, especially during group fights.Skara has two game modes currently, with a third one planned for release soon: A 1v1 duel mode and a 3v3 last man standing mode. The third game mode coming out is a 5v5 domination mode. I actually found it very interesting for a game like this to include a duel mode to begin with, and as such it was the first mode I ever played.The biggest thing that Skara has going for it is how player-driven its development is. Players can post their suggestions and ideas for lore and even character designs and game features, and it is very important that they do so as well. A major part of how the game is played today is because of the feedback the game has received since the beginning of its development. At the time of writing this review, the developers are quickly and happily responding to queries and suggestions on the Steam discussion forums all the time, which is quite impressive.Another large part of Skara is its lore, which does take the player-driven development into account. The previous highest-ranking players were placed as part of the game's lore, for instance. There's a lot to read and a lot to add to the lore, and I don't want to spoil it for you in case you decide to try the game out for yourself, so I think that's all I'll write about it.The game currently has a shop where you can pay real currency to buy cosmetics (and only cosmetics, no pay to win here) for the different characters. The reason I bring this up in this section is because, at least in my opinion, the majority of the cosmetics look really good! I've already spent some money on pimping out my two favorite characters! The graphics overall look very nice and really portrays the overall kind of grim atmosphere.And what makes this game bad?It really depends on your own tastes. As I mentioned, at the time of this writing the game is in open alpha, so there is a lack of content. The duel mode has one map, a frozen little island in the middle of the sea, and the last mand standing mode also only has one map, the lava coliseum. Currently, there are only 4 (with a 5th in the ""Coming Soon-making) character types to play with, and even while they are very different from each other, there are indeed only 4.There are bugs, of course. When me and a friend tried to add each other to our friends list or party the first time, it just didn't work - we had to restart the game first. Ever since it has worked though, and when I posted about it on the forums I got a quick reply from one of the developers too. The game is also not very optimized, which is a common thing for an early build, but still might put you off a little if you aren't expecting it. It doesn't slow down dramatically or anything like that, but it can have the occasional stuttering.The matchmaking also seems a bit weird. Even though me and my friend queued up for dueling at the same time, it took the game ~40 seconds of searching for a match before we got to play. It's not a long time, but it is quite strange that it works like that. If you queue up and the game can't find another player, it will pit you against bots until a player takes its/their place.On a final note, I do wish there were more diverse sound effects in the game. The ones that are in are not bad or stock by any means, but how the sound of a spear blade penetrating your flesh is the same sound as a massive pick made out of bone or a curved sword in eastern style is beyond me! It's not gamebreaking though and I imagine this is something that will change as the game develops further.ConclusionSkara - The Blade Remains is a fun game. Fighting other players, especially in last man standing, is a blast and every fight feels different. It is not a perfect game as it lacks content (it is in alpha, after all) but the content it currently has is quite enjoyable. It has been said many times before, but this game has a lot of good potential (and so far it is not being wasted one bit). The only thing Skara really suffers from is a lack of players, and I can't stress that enough - if the game had more active players, it would likely be the one of the games I've invested the most hours in ever on my steam account, haha.Gameplay - 7/10Audio - 7/10Graphics - 8/10Story (Lore) - 6/10I definitely recommend giving this game a try, especially with friends. Thank you for reading!			"

								I played only 1 match, and its a very rough game with an interesting design. Lack of resolution options and questionable optimization can make for a sour experience but the development team needs worthwhile consumer input and constructive help to fully realize the game. The graphics did look rather slick, and if supporting early access is your thing than heads up. Recommended because of transparency from developers. Not recommended for those who want a finished product that resembles an arena based Dark Souls.			"

I've not updated the review since then.Skara - The Blade Remains is an online multiplayer arena fighting game with a fantasy gladiator setting. It's currently in Early Access, but I believe it's very close to release.There's some lore around the character races and setting, but ultimately it's fairly irrelevant to the gameplay, which involves beating opponents to a pulp in short- to medium-length arena combat.GraphicsGraphics in Skara are a bit of a mixed bag. The character graphics and animations are quite good, and the team deathmatch arena looks quite impressive, but the other two arenas and the various special effects are a bit of a letdown.I also noticed heavy motion blur when turning, which both looks a bit meh and also slows down the game noticeably on my gaming laptop (admittedly a fairly old one). Unfortunately there seems to be no way to turn this effect off without lowering the overall graphics detail, as there's only one variable setting available for graphics quality.SoundSkara features fairly typical gladiatorial type battle music, which fits the game well. It's nothing I'd want to listen to outside of the game, but I didn't see any need to turn it off or adjust the volume down.Sound effects, too, are suitable, if nothing out of the ordinary for the genre.GameplayWhen you begin Skara you're given a single character slot and a choice of three races to choose from, each with names that you'll not remember or be able to pronounce unless you're familiar with the world. There's no customisation available unless you use real money to purchase gems to customise your armour, helmet, or weapons, but the developers were wise enough to make these cosmetic only, rather than falling down the pay-to-win rabbit hole. But it does mean that basically all characters of each race look the same, so you'll quickly become used to recognising what's what.There's a brief tutorial that introduces you to the basic moves. Full controller support is available, so I played with an Xbox controller, which worked fine: left stick for movement, right for targeting; triggers for block and basic attacks, B for dodge, and A/X/Y for race-specific attacks, one of which is ranged for each race.The game then drops you on the main screen, from which you can choose to fight in one of three arenas: duel (one on one), free for all (four players, the most kills wins), and team deathmatch (four vs four, a sort of 'hold the fort' type of arena). The most fun and interesting of these by far was the team deathmatch arena, which is well designed and very pretty. The free-for-all arena is reasonable, too, with a trapped area that can be sprung by any player and a 'boss' fighter that is released towards the end to change it up a bit. The one-on-one duels are the most disappointing, and the arena is small and not much fun, with obstacles constantly blocking you in when you try to manoeuvre.Regardless of mode, the game uses an automatic third-person 3D camera that mostly keeps up with action well. I did find myself off camera a few times, and fell to my death multiple times in each arena due to the camera focusing on my targeted enemy and making it hard to keep track of the level dangers.Unfortunately, though, the online-only nature of Skara means that even with a relatively good ADSL2 connection I found the lag unbearable at times. I'd press my assassin character's 'blink' attack button, watch her shoot across the screen and then the game would catch up, teleport her backwards, and drop her right in front of my enemy's swinging blade. Countless times I'd be mid-attack and my target would disappear and reappear out of range behind me somewhere. Even against bots the network code just doesn't seem to cope well enough for an action game like this, where timing is everything.Skara includes character progression through gold and experience points. The former can be used to buy extra abilities, of which there are only very few available, while increases in the latter improves your account level (which is the same across all of your characters), which unlocks extra slots in the game as you progress, giving you space for up to three characters with multiple ability slots. It's a good idea, but as with the game as a whole, it's only fairly limited in scope.Remembering that Skara is still in Early Access, I don't want to be too harsh on it. But something really does need to be done to improve the networking, as lag is a killer in a game like this. Load times, too, are incredibly long; I waited 28 seconds (in-game counter) just for the main screen to disappear after selecting a battle arena type, and then it took about the same time again for the actual lobby to load. Other minor issues include the use of Steam name in some places, even after asking for a different screen name, and terrible grammar in some places. I'm not sure whether the game will include more arena and character variety after release, but I hope so; the choices at the moment are fairly limited.PROS AND CONSPros:+ Fairly good character graphics and animations+ Team deathmatch arena is very pretty, and the game mode is fun+ Free for all arena is interesting and original+ Progression system is a good idea and a good start+ Trading Cards (although as with other F2P games I assume these won't drop after release if you get the game for free)Cons:- Lag makes the 'timing, precision and accuracy' required for intelligent play almost impossible- Very long loading times- It's very easy to fall to your death on any of the arenas- Only three arenas, one of which (ice lake) is rather poor indeed- Limited character selection and customisation (only through purchased gems)- Limited progression limits replayability- Motion blur is annoying- Other minor EA issues (e.g. poor grammar, Steam name used sometimes rather than screen name)CONCLUSIONSkara - The Blade Remains is very hard to not recommend now that it's relatively easily obtainable for free, and will soon be released as free-to-play on Steam. It has its problems, but even when you can't find anyone online it's still fun beating up the bots for a few hours. With more arenas and characters, better loading times, and a big reduction in lag, it would be much better, though.6/10 "

												This game made me extra mad because you can change literaly every other button in controls, except the one that is broken for me - middle mouse key.Game cant even open itself properly, but it opens as window in background. If you are lucky game might even start.Just..please add the option to change the button for lock so i can test the game further... because without locking i cant even pass the tutorial.			"

Early Access Review
								Hello everyone, I really should not post anything until I have a complete or at least clear understanding of a game. Unfortunately this game has failed to catch my attention as it is an Arena game, in an Arena game players JUST fight each other inside an arena and that is it. It is a good bid because most gamers nowadays use consoles and the personal computer is NOT on their wishlist (just speculating but it might have something to do with having to think when having a computer while having a console you just need to know how to turn it on), so if you want to make a quick buck on the console market this might work. I am an extremely complicated person and I LOVE a challenge in complete contrast to most players who are just looking to let off some steam. In a perfect world this game would be more about using the flow of movement to defend or attack an opponent, just look at fight scenes in every movie you've ever seen where the hero is fighting with EVERYTHING available to him/her. Using elbows, knees, shield and staff end of a spear and much more. Now if there is any way to implement this kind of detailed fighting THEN I would certainly look into this game once again but for now it is MAINLY a game for consoles and it doesn't peak my interest.

								Seems like it has some promise, hard to tell though with so few people to play against and only 4 classes there is not enough variation yet. Still in alpha so let's see where it goes from here. F2P so at least it doesn't cost to watch it develop :) I have to recommend this game to others because if no one plays it then it will never get any better.			"

								Cant say to much because it is in early access so the game is unfinished..But the game is playable and the Graphics are acceptable But not very interesting at this stage..Some things the Finished game needs Needs - Buckets of blood and loss of limbs... Game does'nt feel right without gore- High level Charactor Customisation -lots of weapons, armours and items to add to you inventory- A RPG explorer game\Mode like titan quest or Torchlight would be really  nice to give you some place else to grind your charactor grind you charactor and Maps with 100's of low level NPC's attacking you  like WC Hero Siege as I imagine solely arena battles is going to get old and boring quickly if that is all you can do..  Would also give you the chance to go on quests to get some nicer items that you can use in arena battles.. "

								beautiful graphics and very interesting lore,the controls are very fluid, but i recommend using a controller.It's difficult to find other players though, and the AI seems a bit bugged.hope this game gets the hype it deserves!UPDATE (11 march 2015)The newest patch makes the game even better, new moves, throwables!!, and a huge optimisation (I can now play at max settings with no framedrops). The AI isn't still great, but its getting better, and the developers are very active and helpful, so don't be afraid to try it out even on early acessUPDATE (4 July 2015)with this update skara feels much more like a game. You can now choose traits for your character as you level up, and the UI has much more options than before (though some, like the shop, are not yet available). Also there is a new playable faction, adding variety to the game.			"

								Here is my experience of the game.I start the game up, once I get to the main menu i see select character and head there immediately, fight with the strage controls of the game due to it thinking i have an xbox controller plugged in, once I was done looking at the 4 selectable characters, of which the choice seems to be entirely cosmetic or they just dont tell you what each character does, i looked for the options menu, which i couldnt find. I decided to just join a match, 2 games where running, each playing the LOBBY gamemode, with 1 player each and -1 ping, my game froze for an odd minute or so then when i tried to join one of these games i was greeted by a black screen, five minutes later and still nothing, i closed the game and gave it another shot and nothing changed. and third time is not the charm, tried hosting a game and this time i was left to some lovely art and nothing more.This is not a game that should be purchasable, i personally got it in a humble bundle so I'm not too upset, but this game is just nothing, im sure maybe the combat is fairly redeeming, but the game is t incomplete to let you access the combat, and indie multiplayer only games are always a terrible investment and never relaly a good buy, because there is never anybody palying which will make the game unplayable, literally unplayable "

								I love the graphics, the characters and the idea behind Skara. I have had fun playing so far despite not finding anyone to verse except bots and freakish bosses. Hadn't realised you get trading cards which was a nice surprise to come out of the game to  :) Would be good to be able to alter keyboard/mouse controls as for some reason my mouse wheel refuses to work in this game which makes targeting enemies hard. A single player mode would be nice too but I guess the Lava Coliseum will do for the time being. Worth the small investment, especially considering you'll eventually get the value of your money back in virtual currency!			"

								Honestly, this doesn't really feel good. Battles just feel like flailing attacks around until something happen and all the specials feel really cool and strategic until you learn that once you're locked on they'll pretty much always hit regardless. That chain pull axe move, that leap move and a few others just kinda happen. Then you get the damage and it's mostly up to your own incompetence whether or not you can kill your opponent right then and there. I did some single duels and learned that this game feels super not great in a 1 v 1 scenario. Again, if your character can chain attacks together you should have the round free. Abilities are neat but none seeming to matter at all for doing anything else other than damage or getting you the hit. I think the worst part was when I waited for a minute and a half to get a 3 v 3 game going. Then it started and I'm so excited. Then I notice that everyone except me is a bot and everyone dies in the trap in the middle of the stage anyway because the bots are dumb... I'm not immedietly taken with the game. No offense if the developers are reading this, but go play for honor. You guys really need some of that game feel to make this work.			"

								Early Access review. I probably will not come back and correct this review later. Mostly positive? Yeah right.I can tell that the game at its core seems fine. Decent animations, blocks, rolls, attacks etc. But when I got on, there were only two matches available with ""-1 ping"", whatever that means. That is not how ping is measured, but either way, it means that it's unplayable. Massive 1-2 second input lag and rubber banding was happening during all my matches, I even got booted to main screen a couple of times. My net runs fine and smooth, so the servers are not great at the moment. I am sure that this game will be fine on release when it's got everything polished, but it's absolutely not worth a buy right now. I kind of regret spending $1 on Humblebundle because this was the only ""decent"" game in the bundle. Hold off on buying this until release to see if they fix the servers.			"

												★☆☆☆☆ - ""Dont touch it, its not worth your time"" PROS:- Skara boasts a nice designCONS:- There is no one playing this game, I have loaded on various occasions to give it a chance but found a game once- The one game was full of bots, bots with terrible AI- Some of the times I was unable to even fail to find a game due to the game crashing on its menu.- The combat in my one game was so lacklustre it bored me to death, not enough attack types for a game which has only one thing to do.- No singleplayer, with that in mind along with the fact no ones playing this game it makes it a waste of space.VERDICT? Whilst I can appreciate its still early access and the lack of players is out of the developers control I have to say this game is just unplayable in its current state and quite simply, I expect this project will be ditched due to its lack of interest.

And when it didn't crush into desktop i am amazed! The only problem is I am getting a blank Screen with music on...Well.. I will alt+TAB and wait for the card to drop then delete this one.

								Turned on the game. Waited ten minutes for the game to start. Got a message with a ludicrous number of errors. Game proceeds to shut down.I got this game for free and I feel ripped off.None the less, I pressed on, if for no reason than because ten minutes isn't enough to get a single card.My first problem is how long it takes to get to the options menu.  My computer can't run the game at all at full graphics, so it was really annoying that I had to: 1.Create an account.  2.Select a character.  3.Go through the tutorial screens.  4.Access the menu WHILE A GAME ALREADY STARTED AND WOULD NOT PAUSE DESPITE BEING AGAINST THE AI!  Option access should be the first thing I can do in any game, and barring that, it should be the first thing I can do after I create an account.  At full graphics, the game runs on my computer at an amazing 3 frames per second, so I'm sure you can imagine how frustrating it is to turn the graphics of the game down WHILE IT'S GOING!Second, and I can't really blame the game on this, there seems to be no one online whatsoever.  The most fun I had with the game for a straight hour was when I got up from it to make a grilled cheese sandwich.  Twice.  I don't think solely online games like this should be released without a lot of advertisement.  The actual gameplay is fine, but even on the lowest graphic settings, my computer simply can't handle the game, despite the fact that the graphics are somewhat comparable to Dynasty Warriors, a game that purposefully uses lower end graphics to have a lot of characters on screen on a time.  What is using up all of this?The game is kinda fun on its own, but I honestly can't recommend this game to you unless you have friends who are willing to get on at the same time.  And since not everyone has this luxury, there are some people who simply can't play the game with other people.			"

								This is a bad game, dont bother with it. There is only one attack, and that feels sluggish. Multiplayer didnt work and crashed the game. Tried again and some 'bots' spawned, there are very basic and show no botlike behaviour. I feel sorry for game developers it must be very hard. I cannot understand why anyone would release this sort of drivel though because it only hurts any chances of sucess for the game when or if it is ever in a playable state.			"

								Skara is an arena based battle royale backed by a great story of tribes that have endlessly fought for survival. As a fighter, you are given the chance to represent your tribe in an arena. Its early access has allowed the community a voice in the game's progression, a considerate and welcome change. The developers at 8-Bit Studio are very involved with the community and have considered carefully all feedback. The recent update adds 2 breathtaking arenas as well as a female character to balance the battle and, most notably, it has also reduced lag considerably. I see great promise in the developers and Skara.			"

								I'm not going to lie... not my cup of tea. From the trailer I was under impression that this game will have large battlefields with many warriors, fluid action combat and gore/armor breaking parts etc. What I have found is ( 0 servers so no one is playing it? Or maybe I had bad luck ) small Arena maps, cluncky control system (  i hate the camera and the fact my character if i decide to go backwards turns his back to the enemy! RAGE )  (( I know that there is button to lock on but overall combat sucks... )... very litlle customisation options ( you can only choose characters heavy/medium/light ) Weapons locked to the characters and no progression ( you are not unlocking anything! no new skills, armors or weapons ! ). Very early in development and somehow I don't see a bright future for this game ;( Luckily it's not very expensive but I can't recommend it to anyone .			"

								No matter if it is not finished, the game looks pretty good, even though i had 1 or 2 FPS drops, they weren't too hard, so the stability of the game is very nice. As for the combat system, probably a tutorial for the skills would be nice, i don't know if i skipped it without noticing or if it's simply not there, but i couldn't use my 1st skill, i didn't know how to do it. Despite all possible problems the game may have, as for lack of some tutorials or some further explanation (videos, GIFs, etc) of how do things work, it looks pretty awesome, keep it up like this!

								Do not buy. Period. Game isn't even in a playable state.Game is absolute crap.Not only are the menu controls botches, but there are several points in all the maps that aren't solid, and you can just walk straight through; AI opponents too.The Multiplayer aspect also suchs, with 0 serers or other hosters.The graphics took some work get to to work correctly, and the load time to even start a game was way too long. Seems like the graphics aren't using the GPU, and solely using the CPU, which for a game, is a big no-no.Do not buy as you literaly will not be able to play, or if you do, you won't know what to do, or have a game breaking bug.

								Awful, just awful.After being asked to make a third paty account I weas poped straight into a screen asking me to create a charcter, it was a case of pick 1 out of 3 avaliable charcters, I couldn't customise them in any way. Then the game put me through 3 screens of image tutorials and popped me straight into a game! I want to ajust my settings and found out two things, the game doesn't bother to pause itself when I go into my options and there are about 3 options in visuals to pick from anyway! When I returned to the match It was pathetic, all you do is likk a bot in an area in pathetic fights with the action of watching ants move leaves to their nest. All the game is is fighting easy bots. I went to find a menu, opening options and clicking ""Main menu"" I was taken back to the tutorial and sent back into a game again which was still just fighting a bot! Waste of time this game, it has little potential and shouldn't be on steam.Do NOT buy!			"

								Skara - The Blade Remains is the newest audition in the competetive play gaming genre introducing unique styled combat and match system, with a lot of story behind every single character the game offers players to try. Although opinions for the game are mixed, the game is still in early phase of development, and for the early stages it is in, the developers have done a lot. The combat style of the game is very unique and distinctive. Each character has 3 special abilities, and two default abilities - strong and normal strike. Strategical thinking and outsmarting the enemy is sometimes essential, because not only your survival and combat skills matter. The game has rich environment interaction, and it allows you trick players into traps leading you to victory. If your enemies are not careful enough, you wouldn't need to engage in combat, and just use the environment to your advantage. Speaking of combat, the game allows players to free run, or lock on targets. Locking on targets is a must for best precision. Sometimes locking on targets unlocks passive abilities - like fast dashing, or running jump spear strike. Some characters have passive abilities, like shield defense. Dive into this clash combat adventure in 1v1, 3v3 or 5v5 modes, each one on a different map, with different environmental rules. Discover the current and new incoming characters, and claim to become the best warrior of your faction in Skara - The Blade Remains.

WARNING: Minimum Requirements are NOT a lie!I've tried this out on PC with i3, heavy Oced GTX 750 Ti and 8GB RAM, I can say that there's little difference between performance of graphics presets and in general experience is not very playable, let alone enjoyable. If you expect to play it on a laptop, better it would be some high end gaming laptop since my Lenovo Y50 couldn't handle it either, even though that it's classified as a gaming laptop.On a side note, in the loading screen there is a blatant lie, stating that ""just mashing buttons won't do the job!"". Unfortunately it will, from my experience you can simply auto target random bot or even player and then, the one which thinks least and mashes buttons most emerges victorious, also a simple strategy is just doing some button bashing combo rendering opponent stun-locked and bit by bit knocking him back until he falls off the ledge.

Early Access Review
								To start, I had a LOT of trouble getting this game to load (it would be nearly two months before I got to finally try the game). Once I had the chance to try it, I saw why everyone was reinforcing the ""Early Access"" Label. It is an Early Access release, but while it seems to still need a lot of work it also has good potential and has some fairly active developers - so it seems promising to follow.The game is an FFA/DM multiplayer arena fighter with a neat collaborative boss to fight at the end (so far only available in one particular level - I suspect the other levels will also have a collaborative boss eventually). Graphically, the game has the effects and character design and landscaping of a promising game; it's really pretty. My immediate thoughts from previews and screenshots was actually reminiscent of Vindictus by Nexon/DevCat - the theme and scale feels similar in some ways and I rather liked that. The animations and mechanics still feel a bit clunky and restrictive of the player's options to adapt to a fight. A lot of the attack options you have are very linear and in-flexible and you can't intentionally interrupt them very well without cancelling the attack entirely. Additionally, once you are beyond a certain point into the attack animation, you kind of lose control of your character (so if your attack missed, you basically become fodder for spam attacks from the swarming bots as your character slowly recovers from the attack cool down).After a lot of practice, you might finally familiarize with enough of the animation procedures and timing mechanics to be somewhat effective in battle (or maybe discover an exploit similar to how the bots can spam you once you are knocked down) - however it feels more like a game about timing events based on your familiarity with particular model animations still. It doesn't feel oriented around counter attacking or flexible and dynamic attacks. The male character has a clear advantage using a spear/polearm for their fast attack that easily outranges the dagger fast attack of the female character. Sure the female character can throw daggers and use a charge attack, however both have larger vulnerabilities and skill requirements that make them less effective than the ranged fast attack of the spear. I mentioned ""[exploiting mechanics to win]"" and that was the first one I quickly discovered and relied on.The Arenas are rather big, but not entirely purposeful during fights yet. Once you are in a conflict with a bot, the rest of the Arena outside of attack range is just space that you are not using (unless you manage to dodge and sprint away, but even still that doesn't give the arena's scale much purpose)------------Like everyone says, it's still in Early Access. It does look like it has potential, but in it's current state it's very hard for me to recommend it yet as enjoyably playable. However, I would recommend following it as development progresses.If I could make one request, it would be to expand the graphical settings to be more advanced. I had to play on low quality settings because one of the effects that automatically kicks on from Medium and higher quality consistently plays at nearly the same, very low fps. I suspect it's V-sync or aliasing maybe. Either way, it would be nice to break down the graphical settings to be more customizeable so I don't need to sacrifice all the other graphical features because of one or two particular settings not workign well on my GPU.

								With what is available so far I gotta say, I like this game. There are different attack types so far and I have it on good authority the game will be introducing executions and MAYBE some other neat effects. Problems from my end are simple enough like low FPS but it doesn't make the game unplayable, not to mention it's in development and as things are ironed out things should run smoother. Even if you're not content with the game so far or as it is, I found it easy to get in touch with the devs to talk about their product, given you're going to be constructive in your feedback and ideas and not some idiot troll. Also as I write this review the game is on sale for 6.29$ CAD. That's a steal, grab it up.			"

								This game is rough. Very rough. I only knew it existed because I was sent an email by the developer to play it. The controls are clunky, and it doesn't feel that hits even register against opponents. The art style is bland, as it clearly uses default UE4 assets, so little to no work has been put in on that front. And to say that this is ‘Souls-like’. Laughable.In terms of actual gameplay, there’s hardly anything to do. No one seems to be actually be online, so I as soon as loaded the game up I joined a match… Well, I waited five minutes and got a match against ALL bots. No players. I then proceeded to last thirty seconds before my character got stuck in mid-air during a dodge animation, and then was immediately killed by a bot. Don’t play it, don’t invest money into its microtransactions (oh yes, they’re here!) and if I were the developer, I would pull this game from steam and work on it until it was actually IN a playable state, with content and fewer bugs.

								I only played this game for a bit, but I got hooked instantly.Although obviously beeing a very early version and thus not including a lot of content yet (four characters and two maps/gamemodes), what is there is really solid.The combat can be a little chaotic, but it never feels like you loose the control over what is happening.The controls (I am using a gamepad) feel similar to 3rd person action RPGs à la Dark Souls or the Witcher and are quite intuitive.In terms of graphics it has a clean look and runs on a midrange pc on highest settings without noticable framedrops.Maybe the biggest plus for me is the matchmaking. Even though this is an online early access game on steam - which there are probably thousands of - it usually take only a couple of seconds to rarely more than two minutes to get into a new match.All in all an already fun experience with a ton of potential.

GameplayThe Tutorial you first experience is great and share everything with you, but It's too fast. You will forget everything when the first ""real trouble"" comes, like the game say. I died 3 times in the ""real trouble"". (Real trouble is in the tutorial when you first encounter with the enemy)So this game is about dying... Combat is really slow. The most difficult character (I think it's not difficult) is a stealth assassin, what include a bit faster combat but It's slow too... There's 3 available character in this game right now. Playing with all of them is great, but everyone of them are slow. By the way, combat and other things in this game is very interesting.GraphicsThis game is REALLY nice. But I couldn't experience this during this version. It's unoptimized. I have a computer what can be named high-spec computer. For a stable 30 FPS I should decrease my resolution and put the Quality to the Lowest one. On Very High quality I had 2-3 FPS, but It was really nice and unplayable. On Low settings and Decreased resolution the ""nice"" game was just a bit ""nice"" but It wasn't bad. OK. It's a Beta game, but if I compare this ""optimalization"" to other beta games with nice graphics, It will be the last on a scoreboard.MultiplayingI think this game have a great multiplayer section, but there's no player. My friends got this game, but don't play it. There's 1-2 people on this game online, everytime. So I should play with BOTS. Bots are same, all the time. They are not very difficults and not easy, of course.OtherYou can see how many hours I played with this game. I liked it, but not at all... I couldn't play more than a half an hour. It crashed with a title ""FATAL ERROR"". Great, I said and restarted the game. Played another 30 minutes and crashed again, with a title ""FATAL ERROR"". Maybe some bug fixes can come too... By the way, the game's loading screens were really slow. I waited 3 minutes/loading screens. It didn't matter which loading screen I had got. When I completed a match the loading screen's time was about 5 minutes. When I went to a match the loading screen was about 3-5 minutes. So if somebody have a lot of played hours on this game, the half of it is loading screen, or he have a REALLY-HIGH-SPEC computer.SummaryYeah, we came there...Gameplay: 6/10 - A great fighting game, with a slow combat... Just increase the combat speed somehow...Graphics: 8/10 - It's really nice. But needs optimization, I give 8 because of Beta.Sound: 6/10 - It's not bad, but it can be improved a bit.Summary: 7/10 - I liked It. If somebody asks me ""Do you recommend this game to your best friend?"", I will say Yes. A huge YES.			"

												Graphics are beautiful and the mechanics are a lot like Dark Souls. However, having to reload the tutorial twice to complete it and trying to load up free for all and the game crashes, I've given up.This game has a really good chance to be successful.			"

												So, I'm going to start by saying my opinion is based on the game in it's current state and build. In no way am I saying that this is how I'll feel in the future. As it develops there is a chance that I could change my stance on the game. So in saying that let's get into it.Currently I don't feel I can say this game is very good. There are certainly nice things going for it but not nearly enough. The game has a decent concept, though not the most original around. And it looks nice enough and the only reason to bash it is if you're a graphics wh*re. But that is about where the good stops.Going back to the graphics, for what they currently are...the game runs terrible. I by no means have a monster PC but it's well enough that I have run nicer looking games on higher settings with less stability issues. It also seems hit or miss if the game will launch successfully on the first go. The combat, which should be the shining star in this game is the exact opposite. It's sluggish, slow and at times unresponsive. They claim you can't just spam click but with how it's currently designed, you very much can and still be successful. Connecting to a game is also a hair pulling task. It starts with not enough players. So most of the time you're stuck playing with bots or a single dude who has no place hosting with their internet and its a lagfest. No problem, you'll just play with your friend you might say. Good luck. There is no way to create a lobby and have your friends join. It's all just dumb luck and chance one of you gets a lobby instead of joining a random person and then they can manage to find your game via random clicking and crossing their fingers. I could type my life story about the faults but instead I'll link to a video I did talking about further issues that game has below. But in closing, I'd suggest staying away from this one until they put a lot more work into it. It wasn't ready for testing at all.

												So I played this game and when I did I thought I would enjoy it, oh was I wrong. So, I start into the tutorial all good and what not. Then I get to the final part where you have to fight the guards. Sadly, dodging and blocking are the most unresponsive things in the entire game. Once I finished with that garbage I went to play a free for all. IT WAS HORRIBLE. It  said I had 0 ping, but I clearly had over 300. I kept falling into the lava CONSTANTLY. The dodge mechanic is weak and needs MAJOR improvement for it to actually be a fun and strategical game. In this game current state I do not want to play it. It isn't very fun, there are only 4 characters with dull stories, and the servers are laggy as all hell. Luckily, this game was F2P, so I guess it has that to it. Please devs, refine your game and make the blocking and dodgding actually worth using. The bots could hit me faster than I could them.MARCH 28TH 2016 EDIT: So, I tried the game out again and surprisingly, there was allot less lag and the gameplay felt fun. Now, certainly not polished. The blocking in the game could really use some work, and the classes should get more health, so they don't die in 2 or 3 hits. That's just boring and no fun.			"

												it´s too early to give a incomplete early access game a review. Only some details to mention: The game is a 3d-beat em up in a middle age scenrario with good physic effects and awsome graphics. I´ve played Blade Symphony which is much better and will still be much better in 1vs1 experience -but if you play Skara in Team Deathmatch it could be a different battle fight feeling. Team Deathmatch will come soon and some new characters. The camera view can´t be changed which should be fixed. Some performance issues and walking bugs (run stuttering) prevent fun in the game. So i don´t play the game often untill it´s finished - better you buy the game if it´s a complete and finished game!UPDATE: The game often crashes!			"

Once you click one, that's it, that's your character for the WHOLE game. No going back. Also, you get a great assortment of skills which you can activate sometimes. You also quickly learn that the assassin is the best. Fight for a while and a Minotaur comes down to ♥♥♥♥ all your♥♥♥♥♥♥up.10/10			"

								Feel free to call me a fool but time is money and I've spent enough on this game - and it's free.My first attempt to play it just threw me into a game without warning. Or I think it was a game. It was against two players, and I was what I think is the spearman type character. I didn't pick that, I just hit play, and after loading it just threw me in. At first, my confusion was met with anger as I became the punching bag of two players, and the lag was so horrific that I could not even learn the controls before the game said I was dead.I exited and spent a few months ignoring it.Just recently, I saw it in my library and didn't remember why I stopped playing it. I just remembered that it looked nice. Lo and behold I make an account. And it comes back to me that I never did this before. Cool! I pick a spearman and get on my way.And then a bot kills me. Well damnit. As I learn the controls, I start killing the bot at least once in between two/three deaths. Then it becamse a sparring match, I kill him, he kills me, I kill him. Then I start getting the upper hand. Soon, I'm killing the bot several times over before he even gets me to half health.So I start spending the brief period between the bot's death to explore.And that's when I realize I can't. I don't know what else the game wants me to do. Kill the bot? Make more characters to kill more bots or maybe one player? Why can't I explore? What's the point of this?If I was desperate for a game, this could be a fun little time killer. But I am not desperate for games. I have plenty, I merely wanted to give this one a shot. And having no explanation isn't the worst. But I can't do anything but kill bots as far as I'm aware. I'll pass.			"

								Never got to play it. Everytime I tried, a ""Fatal error occured"". The best part was, it wouldn't even close when this happened, so I had to go into task manager and shut it down from there everytime. I also noticed that the customization, while being very limited, is also so glitchy I couldn't even click everything there either. All and all, the game could be fun for all I know, but the fact that EVERYTHING I tried to interact with didn't work, I'd say it sucks			"

								Skara got some good potential, at the moment while i write this review theres just one map and one class, but that will soon change and they will add more classes with different weapons and abilities along with more maps to play on, bigger maps too.So i cant wait for more of this game. Check out the game if you like some good hack and slash, this one is gonna be good.

								This is a pre-alpha review, so I'm just putting my thoughts out there. I think this game has a lot of potential. There's some great lore, and thus, some great races to play. There's arena combat. Skara seems to be a quite beautiful continent too; hopefully that'll translate into beautiful, tactics-rich arenas.And they've got the graphics on their side. I say: A good game is coming.Edit: Testing the combat in 1-vs-1, I had a good bit of fun. Seeing everything is still very basic, I've got good hopes for the next update: 0.4.6.			"

								i cant recommend a game i cant load...or play**update**Feb.18,2017*since the update i have been able to load the game and play the tutorial... feels like a cheaper version of for honor...but this is my formulated opinion.. it however does have potential to be MUCH better, the only reason i rate is not recommended..i do come across a fatal error, then game freezes to a point i have to open Task Manager to shut it down ... if the stability is fixed ...maybe...til then try it if you may... graphically.. it Def could be better... imo and this is on max settings... im only referring to character models.. not the environments... they are beautiful			"

												um. I can't even start the game. Probably because my computer sucks, but even then, they should have some graphics settings. I got stuck on the screen before you create your first character (I assume)I can't give this a true rating seeing that I can't even play the game, it's horrible.thank for reading.==EditI was able to go into the config files and tweak some things, now I ran it in windowed mode at a lower resolution and lowered the graphics settings and whatnot, and I still get a message about my video drivers. So I went through the trouble of updating them, and it still gives me the message. maaan I was so hyped to play this game.==Edit 2I got spooked by the developer of the game and decided to watch more gameplay to fill in the gap of me not being able to play. Still wish i could choose, ""Undecided"" though, because there's no real reason to give a true rating as I can't play it, but watching gameplay can always help me reach a reasonable conclusion.Skara looks like an arena/RPG based game that seems to use a fighting system that is somewhat unique in the sense that it helps with the whole strategy feel of the game. I can see the potential in this game as a whole, but as i said before, wish that I could have a neutral rating.			"

												This game really has some potential. With the addition of the latest patch the game seems to be closing in on a beta state. The only problems I have with the game is its poor optimization, it's really bad. I just bought a new graphics card and I can play the latest games on high, exept this game. I can't play this game on low without any lag... Exept from that this game is starting to look really good! Can't wait until the game is fully finished!*Update 2016-02-09*Well... After a few patches the game stops working right on startup and there seems to be no way of fixing this. The devs on this game are really lame and can't even fix their own game after a looooooong time. Nah, I can live without this game, uninstalling and leaving it for good.Such a waste of potential.

								This game isn't bad, but there's nothing to call all that fantastic either. I don't feel it's unfair to compare the combat to Dark Souls PvP, just without anywhere near as much polish or customization options outside of four character archetypes. The fighting has a deliberate pacing that could make it very solid for mindgames and countering, but everything feels a bit too clunky to execute any strategies with precision.All customization so far is cosmetic. Aside from a few freebies like the spearman's first helmet, it's all locked behind a paywall. Character and account levels contribute nothing aside from being a rough gauge of how long someone has played or how much they've won. An interesting thing to note at least, is the page that just displays and explains each character's moves in a card format. I'm assuming the developers are trying to impliment an ability card system, but there's nothing else of substance to this aside from said page.Oh yeah, and get used to bot matches, since I don't think anyone else is playing this game much.

												Edit: Managed to play the game, in another pc, but it does actually really uses a lot of your pc, it does require a lot to play it, but I don't know if it should. If, and only if, you have the minimum requirements, you should buy this game. Be awared, it really requires that much.The game is actually good, the battle system flows well and the characters do seem responsive to your commands, although they aren't really charismatic at all. The graphics are nice also and it looks pretty good. The game apparently has some cool customization, like passive skills. I say apparently because the game is still not fully launched yet, it lacks some things in it that are with a ""coming soon"" sign. The game may be a pretty good arena fighting game. Also, the controls are pretty easy to get into, even in the keyboard+mouse.But, since it requires a lot to play, the game doesn't have a large pool of players. It lacks players, it is hard to find players to play this game. And the bots become boring.Maybe they can still improve the game and get over these problems, maybe putting better AI or a single player system, but requiring that much, it can still be a problem for it, it actually makes it a pretty niche game.I recommend this game, it is not bad, it just have some problems to improve. If they manage to, it will be a pretty good game. If not, well, I may change the review again. But, remember, just get it if your pc can play it, it uses a lot of your pc.Original Review from 23/11/15: This game has some nice aspects to it, even if it is a bit too clunky.Although, I had a huge problem with the game that didn't make it run fine on my pc, even though it is a bit under the recommended settings. I can't quite recommend the game because of it, but I look for improvements in this game in all of these aspects and I may change this review later, since it is still not a fully launched game in the moment that I write this review.

								The game appears to be dead, but they have a discord channel here: http://discord.gg/c63VQcN and a twitch channel here: http://twitch.tv/skarathebladeremainsThe game is in a very playable state and has a lot for you if you enjoyed the first Dark Souls or anything like it- it's just a purely competitive game.
