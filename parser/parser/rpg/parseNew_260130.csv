												In Agarest Zero, you play as an extremely generic desu hero and try to pick up all those kawaii waifu's so you can have children to fight the evil monsters that are invading the world.5/5 Sugoi gameBut really, it's a pretty solid tactical JRPG/Visual Novel. For the price of 19,99€ i can certainly recommend purchasing it, especially when considering you get a ton of DLC with the purchase that wasn't free when the game was originally released on PS3.The game is rather long as well, your first playthrough might take about 60-80 hours to finish. You can also port over your character saves from Agarest: Generations of War for some extra stuff.			"

												I like this game. The combat system is really interesting and cool. the character designs are great. The characters themselves are pretty cool. The storyline and setting are great. It's really repetitive. It's really repetitive. I'ts reeeeaaaallllyyyy repetitive. Every battle is basically the same throughout the whole game, just with different monsters. I know, a lot of games are like that. But you really start to feel it with this game. It's really repetitive. After a certain point in the second generation, the game has a huge upspike in difficulty, meaning each battle takes longer to do. I hate how it can take some of the greatest warriors in the continent, working together, a 20+ hit combo to kill a single slime. I'm 50 hours in, and I haven't even been grinding or anything and I've become bored. Maybe I'll finish it, maybe I won't. It's really repetitive.If you want to play this game to experience the story and stuff, I actually REALLY suggest playing it on easy. Maybe the battles will go quicker and it won't feel really repetitive and you won't become as disheartened as I have.It's really repetitive - 6.5/10 "

												This is more of a soft no than a hard one (wish there was a rating system honestly.)  The games okay, I rather like the graphics for the most part, and the plot and characters make me want to keep playing.  That said the combat is what is making me uninstall it.  Just not my thing, and I love these type games.I'll be honest and say that some of this is probably due to my only 4 hours of play time.  But for starters, ingame it is rather poorly explained what the differences between the skills are (why use blast instead of rush, what are my miss chances, is regular damage the same as break damage or is that only for filling the break meter, that sort of thing).  The details screen you can pull up really explains very little.  I could live with this really.  What lost me though the linking system.  I just really don't like this mechanic, makes fights feel far longer and less tactical than they should.  Felt like I spent all my time looking for glowing squares for linking people and trying to maximize the number of combos in the action screen I could pull off than trying to outsmart/outposition the enemy and make use of terrain.  Doesn't help that the view needs tilted up a few more degrees, it's rather hard to make stuff out sometimes even with changing the direction.I really want to like this game, but it's just not happening.

												Agarest: Generations of War Zero is a Tactical Japanese Roleplaying Game a prequel to its predecessor.The story is set in the world of Agarest literally scarred by a war between the forces of light and darkness.The game starts with Sieghart a young commander of the Armies of Light and his division assigned to a special mission to collect some kind of trumph card that would win the war. They get attacked by the armies of darkness during this assignment and after repelling the attack Sieghart finds a girl cornered by a sort of lesser god a ""Larva"" he proceeds to rescue her but gets mortally wounded. In his last moments the girl asks him if he wishes to live and grants him power healing his wounds. This newfound power was more than enough to defeat the weak Larva.As a prequel the game has lots of references and assumes you know most things about its lore, I would recommend playing Agarest: Generations of War first if you plan to play this one, though not necessary as after ending the game you can make a new game+ in Extra Mode which allows you to play a digest version of the first game and you unlock profiles which enlighten you further.The game's art style is quite good, though some of the female characters have provocative clothing, it is far from what most people seem to describe. There is some fan service though which is completely secondary to the game, which are the CGs, appart from some that might be a little awkward, they are all very well done and are a nice little bonus.The voice acting and the translation I am not able to review thoroughly  as I don't know Japanese, but since I've watched enough anime (and asked the opinion of a few friends who understand Japanese) I'd say the translation is good apart from maybe a few exceptions. The Japanese voice acting like in most JRPGs is nice because it usually beats any english dub.The gameplay is the same as the first:- Turn based combat, in each turn you have a move phase and a action phase.- The party consists of 1 to 6 members.- Each turn you gain AP (action points) which allow you to move or attack.- During the move phase you are allowed to move your characters up to their move stat by spending 1 AP per square.- During the action phase you are allowed to attack (and be attacked) spending AP or both AP and SP for special attacks (called Ex Skills).- SP is gained by attacking, getting targeted, slaying an enemy or having a party member slain.- The order in the action phase is determined by a character's AGI and remaining AP for both party members and enemies.- There are also Extended Areas, which are different to each character, when you link characters through these you can strategize in various ways as they allow you to make combos with more than one character and attack monsters that would otherwise be out of the range of certain characters/attacks.- As you progress through the game you unlock fields, different fields have different sizes and different bonuses/penalties.I recommend watching a few gameplay videos or a video of the tutorial (if existant) as it would be much easier to understand.When compared to the first game, Agarest: Generations of War Zero has several improvements:- The game is slightly shorter which made part of the community happy (on the other hand it lost generations (from 5 to 2) and it has less characters, though you can still have Ellis, Dyshana, the protagonists and the heroines of the first game in Extra Mode and the others by DLC).-  Vacation Days which are events where you can interact with your party members in order to raise affection levels or unlock certain bonuses/secrets.- Costumes which are literally costumes for every female character which change depending on their affection level, these will only appear in Vacation Days unless chosen otherwise in the options menu (I regret to say that after unlocking the costumes it isn't possible to chose which one appears it will always be the one that corresponds to the affection level).- Card System, now this in my opinion is the best improvement you can costumize the first main character making him much more versatile than the one from the first Agarest.- The portraits are no longer static and are considerably better.- Beach scenes!- Vashtor in white armor, 'nuff said.Ignoring the last improvement, in all seriousness, the game is enjoyable (In my case I'd say a lot of fun as I've also played it before in PS3 and I'd say the PC version is better as I found it more fluid).Personally I just thank Ghostlight for porting JRPGs to PC since it has few when compared to consoles.

												As with the Origional, Zero is a true work of art. The Generation system is vastly improved from the original, and the affection system adds its own level of stratagy. The gameplay, while at first glance appears simple, is, in a word, ""Multi-Layered"". Mastering Esoterica and Combination arts is key to not only surviving some of the most difficult battles, but also recieving some of the best items in the game. With that in mind, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the Agarest Wiki that contains truely invaluable information on the game itself. While i love the game, I have to mention two dissapointments I have in concern to the actual game itself. First, the monster capture and combination system can be a boon to any player. If only for the Title System and the High End items you can get by using it. However, capturing monsters can be a chore sometimes, and often feels like a waste of time due to the grind required to max it out. Second, the blacksmithing system has one infuriating element that i wish they had eliminated from the origional. That is the Random Item system that occures while smithing. On occasion, while crafting items, instead of the desired item you recieve a random craftable item instead. This still uses the materials, and after 3000 craft attempts, I only recived one item I cared about, or was useful. Instead you generally recive items that are either utterly useless, or are low level and already abundant.As to the Steam download, it has one major glitch i was unable to remedy. Unfortunatly, there is a glich where on many characters in both conversation scenes and in the gallery, the characters images are obsucered by all the other alternate appearances being layered over eachother at the same time. This takes away from the character and story driven expreance that is essential to any JRPG.On a possitive note, the Steam DLC is absolutly fantastic. Without it, many cassual gamers may find the baseline grind to level up and aquire both Gold and EP to be a daunting task. After purchasing the DLC it was almost like starting a new game + without ever having to have played the game. I would recomend this series to anyone who enjoys JRPG's or RPG's in general. For a more epic experience I suggest playing the original and then loading over the completed game data to Zero.All in all, I'd give this game a solid 9 out of 10.As a simple footnote I would suggest that due to suggestive sexual content in this game, parental supervison is advised.

												5/10Agarest Zero is the prequel to Agarest: Generations of War. People who played the old Agarest will find that a few things have changed. Starting with the good improvements. A fast-forward option during dialogue, fully turn-based dungeons with no more analog crawling or suprise encounters, and a slightly more informative esoteric book. A simplified version of the original Agarest is build into the game, and can be unlocked if you play NG+ on hard. As long as you get True End in the Zero universe, you will unlock True End in the Agarest vanilla universe automatically. You can unlock various vanilla characters and combine them into your zero party for maximum choice.There are bad points too. For one, there are only two generations instead of five, although unlike Leonheardt who was stuck with a sword, you will have some control over Sieghart's weapon. The True End mechanic is also different, it being dependent on relationship scores and less than a handful of crucial storyline choices. You will not unlock the true ending unless you are familiar with dating sims; it is possible to get all nine women in the group to love you maximally, but unless you get somewhere close to that you won't get the true ending. The game is faster-paced due to less generations, but not fast-paced enough to warrent repeated crapshoots on the dating sim mechanic only to find out that you fail true end again and again. If you follow the True End guide for Zero on Agarest Wiki to a tee, it is a linear process and you can unlock it. But then Sieghart/Leonis will not feel like they have any consistent preference or personality. It will just be hardcore pragmatic metagaming.On an important tangent, this game may be a little bit less friendly to female gamers than the vanilla game, because of the much more increased emphasis on the dating sim aspect. Women-to-women conversations in this game are also more superficial than vanillla. Female gamers can consider themselves warned.It is a game with pros and cons, but if you liked the original Agarest then you might as well get Zero because it comes with a simplified version of the original game plus the interface improvements.

												Keep in mind this is a quick review to help people decide if the game is worth a look at this price. I've played about thirty minutes or so thus far, but I will keep updating this review as I come across more parts of the game.Agarest is a fantasy tactical role playing game, much like Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem. Straight out of the heart of Japan with its flashy style and exaggerated character designs, this game drew me in right away with its setting and characters. It leads to a slow start; the game making sure that it introduces the characters and teaches you about the combat for thirty minutes minutes before FINALLY getting into the good stuff in regards to the story and character creation wasn't a good call, but it lays the groundwork for the story ahead. The real problem isn't the length of the opening in and of itself, though. It's the tutorial segments. The tutorial is drawn out and doesn't teach you anything you wouldn't know from playing any tactical role playing game. The characters and writing are on full display as you're taught the mechanics, making sure that you're at least slightly entertained, and they give you what you should well expect: flashy and fun attacks with all of the functionality you should expect from a game like this. But it's only exactly what you'd expect, and if you're going to demand total attention from the player like this, you need to be introducing things that players wouldn't know off the bat, and it just doesn't have any features like that in that first segment. Eventually, it does get into some new features, but at the time of writing, after going at this game for nearly an hour, I'd only just finished the tutorial and I'd only learned two things from the game that I wouldn't have known otherwise from playing other ones. Just two. When this game says 60-80 hours, it means it, but if this is the way that they're going to stretch out the playtime, I'm a bit wary. Still, they were able to cram a good bit of story in that time, too, and I actually rather enjoy it so far!This is a story-driven game, and make no mistake, it shows clear signs of the style it was drawn in.  From only being voice acted in Japanese, to the tropes that are made evident from the first moments of the game, it is made clear from the get go that this is a game that's going to follow the trends of anime in regards to its story and characters. If you aren't fond of that, you may be better off looking elsewhere for your fantasy tactical role-playing game fix.  But I am, and trust me, you have never seen a game that makes you think that you're watching an episode of anime more when you get past that tutorial and start the first boss fight. It's surreal to watch.From what I can tell, you're going to be in for an anime style game with stylish combat and a kickass story. If the story doesn't grab you, you're going to be waiting a long time for gameplay to kick in, because you have to go through a LOT of dialogue, but the gameplay itself is solid , and I can already tell the combo system is going to lead to plenty of fun down the road.First impressions? Grab it.			"

												Short summary: This is an amazing turn based strategy game with unique weapons, and a huge variety of characters and unlockable skills. This game is similair to fire emblem combat system, and has a cliche but an entertaining story. There are several events, and incorporates the oh so common dating sims the japanese love as well. One of the best part of the game is without a doubt, the creation of your character, where it is a tarot card system, which randomizes your character in the vague direction you build him to be. Synopsis: Record of Agarest War Zero is the prequel to Record of Agarest War. The tale follows Sieghart, an army commander who gains magical powers from a strange woman named Mimel. Blossoming from this setup, Record of Agarest War Zero is a slow-paced tale treading on familiar territory: the world is in danger and it's up to a small band of warriors to set things right.Combat: Record of Agarest War Zero's shining light is combat. Moving characters into position like a chess board is a challenging undertaking, but a rewarding one. Depending on which square characters occupy, they can link to other characters to unleash joint attacks with powerful results. But it's the calculated movement of sprites into position that makes exciting battles. While the terrain is flat and backgrounds repetitive, the environment is still a non-factor like the original Agarest War. The strategic requirements of success are fulfilling for all strategy fans. (Battles dish out experience like candy, yet money feels constantly tight.)Gameplay:  The Agarest War series is different from other strategy games is that the story is split over multiple generations. When the curtain finally closes on Sieghart's side of the story, it's his offspring with the maiden-of-highest-regard that carries on the tale into future years. You are also forced to progress along a fixed path, forced to stop at each dot along the way for a battle. These often have no bearing on the plot and are simply there to make the journey from one chapter to the next take as long as possible.(although if the battle does indeed get too tedious, pressing q will turn on auto battle. A word of advice is use it on enemies you will dominate, due to the fact that the auto A.I is not the best.)Overall, i love this game, while it may say i only have 10 hours or so, i have the rest of the series on my ps3, with a total over 200 hours, a great game focusing on turn based strategy, and dating sim like playthrough.

												The Agarest Senki/Agarest War series was always a little out of my comfort zone when it came to RPGs, mostly due to the strategy involved in the fights. Thankfully, they made it easy to figure who to place where to maximize your combo efficiency in battle, plus learning new Secret Arts through trial and error has been a blast! This is technically the first game in the series, chronologically, but the second game to have been made. This one is a lot more forgiving than the first by means of getting the True Ending, as there are only two generations, so a lot of the original content from the first game that you had to be forced to do to get the True Ending has been streamlined for the second; giving you a lot more time to enjoy the story at a more natural pace.My one little problem lies in the fact that they seem to reuse character designs and even come close to reusing names as well; namely, the character ""Alice"" is extremely close if not identical to ""Ellis"" in name and design both, right down to having a larva as a bodyguard. Sieghart also appears to be in close relation to the main characters of the first game, not to mention a few of the female leads seem to be borrowed concepts, as well. All that aside, however, I greatly recommend this game to everyone, especially if you want to enjoy something a little different in your RPG library!			"

												This tactics-based game is an improvement over Generations, the overly long first game the series.  It is shorter, the UI easier to manage, and crafting elements are more straight-forward.  My main complaint is the series still doesn't know what it wants to be.  The developer packed so many side-elements into the game that they become chores to manage.  They must have been working with a checklist; capturing monsters-check, grinding-got it, unlocking crafting levels-yup.  It is tiring and takes away from the stronger aspects of the game.  Overall, the game is average with its strength being the battle-system.  Might be worth a Jackson if bundled with all the DLC.			"

												Not one for JRPG's or turn based in general. But this game is a lot of fun. A lot of the wandering around has been cut out and the game is basically streamlined from one combat point to the other that takes you to all your quest objectives as well. The real meat of the game is inside the combat where you are encouraged to use more force then needed to achieve ""overkills"" in which additional items are dropped. The story seems very typical of what I know of the genre. Gods and Demons, end of the world, everyone fighting everything...over and over again....forever. But I am having fun fighting these things. On a side note I find myself smiling a lot of the mixture of 2d sprites laid ontop on hi res enviroments, even the larger ""boss"" monsters have been rendered in hd. Its pretty neat and for 6$ on the steam summer its worth every penny.			"

												The first Agarest game had an identity crisis. Specifically that it promoted grinding while discouraging grinding through it's system of ""Turns"" (# of battles) - too many turns prevented certain events or hindered later progress - which created an absurdly unfair game without any DLCs. However, in Agarest Zero the Turn system was completely removed. In addition, there are not as many random battles from Event to Event, unlike the first Agarest, making Zero a bit more shorter (which is usually bad, but better in this case) - to top it off Zero only has two generations instead of five. Albeit all of this, in the end, Zero feels just like a really long DLC than a new game. Much monsters from the first Agarest, exact sprites and sound, have been recycled throughout the game. Also, the majority of bosses are rendered in 3D and misreably fails to blend in with the 2D sprites. Furthermore, the UI is identical to the first game - a convulted mess of getting around. I'm all in for a green Earth, but this is just too much recycling. If it didn't work before why repeat the same mistake? Agarest Zero, above all, is just Agarest v1.5 with better packaging. Not necessarily a bad game but neither is it a good game. 5/10			"

												So... I actually buy this just to support Idea Factory xD It is one of the few companies who make my kind of simulation games after all xD I have only played this for a while and I have never played the first game either... so this is just a quick note for everyone!Pros:- Japanese voice acting (I'm a sucker for it xD)- Cool tactical combo chaining. If you'd like to chain a lot, you'll need to learn how to use this properly! I find it interesting because of the different layout of Extended Areas for each player and that where they are facing affects it. For those who love to challenge themselves and see how far they can go... this is for you!- Different areas that you can choose where to fight? Not bad!- The animated sprite (Motion Portrait) makes it a tad bit life-like as they talk.- Anime-style handsome guys and pretty girls =P- Free DLCs! Yay!Cons:- The tutorial is soooo long TT Well it is good for those who are not used to tactical games... but for me who have played quite a few (e.g. FFTactics, Tactic Ogres, FE), it is one chunk of boring part right at the start. Be patient!- DLCs right from the start! You become too OPed right from battle number 1 that the last thing to do is saying good-bye to that fun ~ So I would suggest turning off the DLCs or just don't use it!Who is this game for?- Those who love Love SImulation games, Tactic battles, Combo chainers, Anime-lovers, or those who, like me, loves Idea Factory!

												Do you like anime? visual novel-like story telling? game difficulty with a curve akin to right angle?Well do I have a game for you.Jist: Turn-based jrpg focused on creating skill combos with your entire team.Oh and kawaii desu anime stuff, full on vn story telling even get to pick a girl to marry.Pros:•tactical jrpg•anime, that is a pro. right?•the plot and style of the game series has always been very good.•character variety•main character creationCons:•difficulty will give you a right hook out of nowhere•the right angle difficulty curve also applies to the learning curve. Hope you've been collecting and memorizing combos & skills, while staying above the weapons curve too!•you may become emotionally attached to charactersFinal Word:I own every Agarest game and the predecessor game/s and while they are all nice games I have yet to beat one, even after 30-40 hours of gameplay put into them. They are not fair, and will spike the difficulty without a second though to how much time you will have to spend grinding out levels, crafting gear, and gathering materials. These games actively hate the player at times. You will use gamefaqs. You will curse at your tv/laptop when you have a boss fight that was three flavors more difficult than anything you just faced. You will love the characters.I wouldn't recommend buying these games simply due to the battle system being a complete kick to the gonads. I will admit I have more money than common sense when dealing with anime jrpg's. Especially ones by Compile Heart, and will purchase them all. I'm such a hypocrite.			"

												Lets SeeI would only recommend this game to the die hard fans of Agarest.  1st time playing Zero, its very hard, you have to grind hard between the 2 generations.  Theres also a digest mode where you play the original Agarest (which means, you get to play with 2 characters from the original and you'll be playing through 100% of the story).  Features remain the same, same Attacks, Spells & Items.  Totally different story, Its kinda pointless playing digest mode unless there was something missing from the original.  What makes digest mode hard is that it has you only fighting major battles, not the minor battles.  Back to zero, the game itself can be long and difficult for the 2 generatiions, after you get done beating this game, you might think, d@mn, the story was short, but the battles are crazy hard (1st time you play).  Overall, Its a good game to play, I rather stick to the original.			"

Over all if you like turn based games with some strategy and like anime i would recommend this game.			"

												jRPG by very respectable studios: Compile Heart, Aksys Games, Red Company.I would've expected something much more grand from such a fusion, SPECIALLY since this is the second installment of the Agarest universe, and as these companies' individual titles are quite popular on both Eastern and Western markets.However, it is not completely terrible. While it is true some mechanics are quite bad (getting counter hit for 4mil on endgame dungeons and 1-shotting the poor victim), these mechanics are easily circumvented if you know what you're doing.There are quite a few things to keep track of and you can get creative with some mechanics, weapons and skills, which is mostly why I like this game. It has variance and great replayability.If you want a lenghty, challenging jRPG then look no further.			"

Apparently some users have stability issues with it as well. I was willing to give this game a chance at first, but crashes every 2-3 battles quickly convinced me otherwise.			"

												A fun RPG that has a lot of hidden elements in it. There is a small problem with the UI, in which random tiles will appear on screen, and block half the game, but simply reloading your save will fix the issue. The DLC from the pre-purchase makes it almost too easy, so try disabling all of them if you want a challenge. I highly reccommend it for those that have played Fire Emblem, Disgea, and other similiar games.			"

Posted: April 27, 2014
												After several hours int the game, I think I have a basic understanding of the game. Gameplay - Very basic and combo driven.  I like my JRPG's to have combo systems, it adds a little bit of flavor to the game.  The tiled fields are not by any means extremely large, so positioning is rather important when trying to corner enemies or create an eleborate combo that will excessively damage the enemy.  I would like to say that the gameplay very much reminds me of Disgaea.  For those familiar with Disgaea, you may recall positioning characters in certain directions to obtain minimal damage and best damage output, same features here.  The actual playing field is not as elaborate by any means though (no elevation).  You do gain ""field"" options though which can influence the party and the enemies on the field.  Difficulty wise, this game does encourage leveling and item grinding.  Without properly leveling characters, you will meet a swift defeat.  The amount of damage the monsters give and take is comparable to your own MC.  It's quite a bit.  Grinding monsters also generates technical points and money, which can be used to buy weapons, new smithing techniques, alchemy items, and the like.  An actual downside to the combat system is the camera system.  It is extremely rigid, offering only about 4 angles of the field.  While you eventually learn that you can click whichever tile you desire despite the UI and direction of the camera, I find it bothersome that the camera system is not more flexible.  The combat system does not also offer many options aside from using skills, standby (thus generating action points for skills), no defense option, items, and reminding yourself which combo-able skills are available.  Depending on how 'intricate' you enjoy combat games, this could be somewhat off-putting.  Lastly, the DLC which I tested on my characters absolutely break the game.  I can absolutely disregard how much damage I am taking or giving, because it simply does not matter.  It's a bit of a snooze fest when it comes to beating up monsters, even bosses.  Even so, it is important to level the characters so that they may obtain new traits and skills.  An overly equipped lvl5 offensive mage will still fall prey to a group of lvl6-7 monsters if not careful. Of course, I've managed to negate that.  I can simply focus on grinding levels, items, and the story at this point.Story and Characters:  Not incredibly difficult to follow.  Nothing really wow'd me in regards to plot.  Your a relatively distinguished soldier, who dies, is revived by a mage, and proceeds to take a journey to save the world.  As you proceed through the world, you do come across a variety of members who join the party.  Most of them female.  The female characters have an affection system which is affected at various ""events"" and your decision during them.  Furthermore, the Oracle can ""predict"" your offspring and their stats based on your current relationship and stats.  The male characters don't impress me anymore than the females, but the chemistry between the cast as a whole flows rather well.  As of my progress in the game, there is no character development.  I would say the most interesting aspect of the MC's stats are reflective of the choices you make at the very beginning of the game.  You choose particular class which is followed by several ""sub"" stat categories.  These influence a particular stat that will be easier or harder to increase as you level up the MC.  All in all, the game is decent and worth killing time over if you're willing to sit down and take a journey.  The flaws are there, but nothing to fret over.  I'd give it a 7/10.			"

Pros:Good Story. (A lot of text, don't buy it if you dislike reading)Good Artwork.Dungeon System.Affection System.Battle System. (Combo System <3)Digest Mode.Con:Too much DLC. (You can finish the game without any DLC of course.)Review:Story 8/10:I personally liked  the story but, as saying before it as a lot of text! If you like Visual Novels / Tactical RPG, then this game is for you, otherwise it's better to pass this game.Gameplay 8/10:The difficulty of the game isn't that hard, so even a beginner can finish the game, the battle system is classic with a bit of ""unison raid"", like a Disgaea for the people who know it.Music 6.5/10:Some are good, but some are pretty repetitive.Graphic 8.5/10:Battle sprite are a bit odd from time to time, but this is not really a problem, the rest is pretty good though!Play Time 9/10:Well, for this price you can play without problem for 70/150 hours, the digest mode is pretty good and is pretty long too.Final Word:The game is pretty good, I personally highly recommend it, for $19.99 it's a great game, but it's better to buy it when the game got a sold so add it to your wishlist if you don't intend to play it in the immediate. I didn't have a lot of hope at the beginning, but I really had liked it.			"

												I love this series, I been waiting months for this to come out. It does not disapoint. It has all the great things of agarest and new ones like the cards. The tutorial is a bit long but this had lovely skip options for them. The combat is very similuar to the previous game in the series. The graphics are great, the sound very cute and I have found no  lag, crashes or sound errors. I did find one glitch but it was not a game breaking one-in the second town at the adventurers guild it does a crazy split screen of the guild. It doesnt freeze or crash the game or stop you in any way. There is also some nice extras if you carry over your completed game from the first agarest. One which enables you to use a weapon that you can equip the capture spell early one.  the characters are good one-mimi is down right funny and cute. The story line is good and also in theme of the series. the maps are the same layout of travel as in the prior game. warning there is alot of grinding in this game to beat the bosses even on normal setting..........completed game in 115 hours!

												Agarest Zero reminds me a lot of FF Tactics and Fire Emblem Awakening, if not slightly slower paced. I can see how the game might drag at certain points, and some of the 'crafting' systems appear a bit opaque. All that said, there really aren't very many options for PC in this genre, so you need to take what you can get! If you like turn-based tactical JRPGs, then this is a reasonably good game to get (especially if you can grab it on sale).			"

[this is a neat element that it brings, since you shape it as the story enfolds]If you want a JRPG that is heaviily inspired by anime and eastern culture, This might be for you.Ive enjoyed it thus far, and plan to contine even further as there is a lot of abilities/equipment/character shaping, to how you want them to all react with another in battle.8/10			"

												This game is a Tactical RPG, with an affection system with several female members.The main problem with this game is that the heart of the gameplay, the tactical fighting is incredibly boring. Each battle is set on a board delimited with squares (which is usually the norm) and each character has ""combo tiles"" linked with them. That means that if another character is staying in one of those, you can chain both characters and possibly chain skills which become even better skills. Sounds cool actually right? Well in theory yes... but since all characters have different combo tiles, you are pretty much forced to move the team in a certain way to combo, even if the positioning makes no sense. The combo system being the heart of the game, you can't really win without and essentially all battles will turn into a move A to that space, move B there so they can combo, so C has to be there and D there etc... It made the game horribly repetitive even for a TRPG and I abandoned after a few hours...			"

												Personal Rating: 6.5 of 10I have not played any Agarest title previously nor come across it. In my mind a generic JRPG genre means you get to move freely and engage in combat. This game however, is more visual novel style and you only get to control your characters during combat. Travelling is done via selecting dots on the map. The story focuses towards relationship between your members.Combat is very satisfying as they can be challenging and strategic with the wide arrays of spells, abilities, items,  equiptments and combos. Overall the game is great if the above genres appeals to you.			"

												Before I start, this is my first time playing any of the Agarest: Gernations of War. This game truely is fine developed game although I did incounter a bug which truely screwed me over and I'm upset that one little bug screwed 30mins of gameplay that I now have to redo. I'll leave detail about the bug that occured after I list my pros and cons.Pros- Potential Mate for Future Generations.- Combat reminds me of a Final Fantasy - Soundtrack is like Dragon Ball- Steam Badges ""For Badge Collectors""- Title Loot ""Perks / Items etc...""- Great Character Art Gallery- More Waifus to add to your collection. ""Don't take this seriously""Cons- Additional Battles are everywhere are useless unless you are trying to level your party...- No Auto Save... ""C'mon now,,,""- No Full Skip Function ""Just fast forwards though faster""Notes- Auto Battle ""Battles take much longer as the AI wastes several extra attacks on one enemy""- Accept the Starter Pack ""Get some OP weapons for the starting portion of game""- Agarest is a time consuming game, you won't finish this game so quickly.BugSo when I recently defeated the first boss? ""Spoliers"" The wolf at the fountain. I was about to do some equipment modifcations, after I finished and was about the head over to save. My Functions for the menu stop working. Nothing was wrong with my keyboard as I was able to goto the pause menu. The game was functioning fine just my input over the camp menu was frozen which screwed me over 30m of gameplay that I now have to redo... Reminder- Always save even if its a small battle you will never know if you may catch this bug.- Please forgive me if I made any grammar errors and or typos. As I type quite fast and may overlook a few words.			"

												If you like torturing yourself with bad story, repetitive combat, and rock metal riffs on 20 second loops then Agarest: Zero is the game for you.Playing this game is nothing less than a face-melting chore. Even the harem of wanton anime chicks you gather on your forgettable escapade do nothing to make the experience less excruciating.  What's even more painful is how obvious it is that the game wants to be some intense strategy RPG. Agarest is a prime example on how flashy combos and special attack portrait cut-ins don't make a game exciting. In fact, the game punishes you for being halfway proficient at it. Keep animations turned on and you have to wait minutes at a time for combos to complete. Turn them off and you're playing Watching Damage Floaters: The Game The RPG. Don't get this game			"

												A very nice J-RPG, it proves it's worth from its storyline, voice acting, and artwork. Its not a perfect game, though... In battles the particle effects and some of the boards are mostly standard quality for mobile games. This is actually my first J-RPG, so for those who might criticise me for saying, ""keep your cool bro."" Besides the actual gameplay and the optional part of the game is the ""dating sims"" or affection game, its very likely that most japanese game makers like little girls with ""huge boobs""... HENTAI, but ya its worth $20, if you're a patient player, likely to be fine in awkward situations, and mostly likely to not criticise about the game too much. Plus it has FREE DLCs that immediately makes you into a super soldier within 30 seconds into the game. HAVE FUN!			"

												What is Agarest: Generations of War Zero? Agarest, is a game set in the world of Agarest. Simple, right? It is a world ridden with war between the Evil and the Light gods. You start the game in the middle of this war as Commander Zeeg~ (Sieghart.) Who soon finds himself at the feet of an evil Larva, a minor god. Events unfold and Zeeg~ is given the power to defeat this foe.  I am not going to spoil much, but it is almost exactly like what happened to Leonhart from the first game. Agarest is a SRPG, Stratagey Roleplaying Game. The battle system is turned based. So if you do not like turn based games well, I am sorry. This game may not be for you. This title also introduces several new features its predecessor didn't, like the Free Intention system and Extra mode. Extra mode is for people who have played the previous installment in the franchise, Agarest: Generations of War and the Free Intention system is another relationship builder. It will sometimes give items, new CGs, and costumes for your party to use. Also they added in the Action Animation System that allows the characters to move their lips during cutscenes. It is pretty neat for the time the game was actually released, 2009, but for todays standards it is pretty mediocre.  If you were expecting to have 30+ characters like in this first game you will be disappointed. This game only contains two genertaions unlike the previous five, and there are only fiften members that you will be finding in your party. However I do not think this detracts from the game in any way whatsoever. The game is still 80+ hours, like its predecessor and the story is very immersive. Overall - I really enjoy playing the game. If you are a fan of Disgaea or Fire Emblem I thnk you will find this game different with the added relationship systems. 8/10.			"

												First of all, i hope you guys are all beware of the fact the fact that this game is INSANELY LONG! It DOES NOT only contain the story of the so-called prequel, but also a digest version of Agarest: Generations of War, which is 2.5 times longer than the 60 hour of the original prequel. So, if u are not ready to invest at least 300 hours into this game, you may stop right here. The reason why i discourage anyone to buy this game is simply because it really becomes tedious (excluding those fanatic JRPG fans) when you finish the story of a generation. Why? Because 1. the battle repeat themselves incessantly, 2. THERE IS NO STORY! I would just say that, even after finishing the entire prequel, i found only piece-by-piece information about why the hell was i fighting at all! Mostly it was only about doing everything your bosses or some random girl on the road told you to do, which might well involve hours of meaningless and random exploration of the world. It is nothing more than boring. And dont even mention the horrible battle music which repeats itself without a single twitch throughout my entire 30 hour gameplay.To put it short, simply mark my words if u would: a RPG without a good story is just crap, if not a piece of sh*t. As for this game, i would only recommend it to those who has a lot of freetime to killl and enjoy making battle-talented babies with multiple choices of brides ;)			"

												If I could, I'd recommend this game twice!Agarest Zero: Generations of War is an amazing JRPG, and this is coming from a guy who generally doesn't like JRPG's!Usually, traditional JRPGS just have the characters 'dancing' and standing still when 'attacking' one another, and in this game instead you are allowed to use AP (Action Points) to maneuver your party into position to attack, defend, support or counter just about anything. When you figure out how you like your party, then strategy becomes key. Characters can actually die if left alone too long without revival (and you can't get them back, really) and they each have very awesome and amusing dialogue inbetween! The game even follows a sorta-visual novel path, and allows you to make choices for the main character.Very amusing, very challenging (easy at first, but beware later on!) and very addictive. I highly recommend this game!Word to the wise... Beware those damned pixies, they can hurt 'ya good.			"

												Having a hankering for a RPG I ended up picking up this title to scratch the urge. Am I disappointed? Yes.The storyline is bland and generic and offers nothing intriguing or exciting to the player. At this stage I barely know what my goal is (other than looking after Mimel and picking up more (female) characters to add to my party) and I've no desire to find out. The parts that talk about the storyline are tedious and bland at best and ultimately unfulfilling for the player. A solid RPG should have the player wanting to know what the next twist in the game is; Agarest fails to deliver on that aspect. Considering playing on feels like a chore that I want to avoid doing at all costs.The tutorial barely gives you the bare bones of combat which is simple enough to pick up despite being poorly mapped, and the character creation part is totally left uninformed. The player absolutely doesn't know what to do without the help of a guide and to be honest I have no idea what on earth I picked for the MC, Sieg. Combat gets boring and repetitive quickly. If you're a player who dislikes grinding there's no worry as you're forced to grind and play through fights just to get anywhere on the map.Speaking of characters, the characters of the game are bland, dull and boring with predictable, mundane personalities. There's a womaniser without a hint of charm, a little mysterious childish girl and then there's the MC who is the equivalent of bread without butter. The voice acting and somewhat pretty character designs aren't enough to carry the personalityless characters through with the bland script. Another part of the game which is a little more fun is the dating aspect where you woo the ladies you pick up for your party. However, Fire Emblem: Awakening offers the same kind of game as Agarest but with a better script, a easier to follow plot and interesting characters.For the most part, Agarest has a lacklustre script and a poor combat system which ultimately lets the full game down. A much more interesting story with more engaging characters is the minimum this game would need to carry it through with the current combat system. The pixel graphics are somewhat charming, at the very least.My overall opinion? I wish I could refund this game and would do so in a heart beat if I was able to.			"

												So after playing Agarest: Generations of War, I was excited to see what this had to offer. I did pre-order this, and to be honest I got what I expected.If you've played Agarest: Generations of War, this game won't surprise you at all. If you haven't, but you have played almost any tile based strategy RPG before, this game still won't surprise you.The story is... also pretty generic, and this Agarest has only two generations. You are Sieghart, a warrior of the light on a mission to collect the fragments of a magical item with which you can save the world. Sound familiar?Agarest Zero brings minor refinements from the formula for Generations of War, but otherwise has the same strengths and weaknesses as the latter. It is not hard to learn if you haven't played an SRPG before as it really has the standard fare for turn based strategy combat, with no elements that are particularly esoteric. Which also happens to be it's weakness. It has no special uniqueness to it.The art is more or less identical to Agarest: Generations of War. A great deal of detail put into environment and dialogue characters but little to no effort at all put into the character sprites. It is also worth noting that this game uses the Active Animation Adventure system used in Trinity Universe and Hyperdimension Neptunia rather than the manga styled dialogue the first game had.Overall, I think I would give this another 7/10. It is definitely worth the cost for the entertainment value, but the game just isn't improved enough to deserve a higher score.			"

												Not the best JRPG in the market (Disgaea still on top as great JRPG for similar battle mechanic) but this game makes up for it with some very interesting mechanic that makes you want to play till the end.The things I find interesting is the battle mechanic itself, using link to perform special attack while not even needed to stay close with the initiator. This makes battle much easier although it can get harder because if you aren't focused, you've probably cut the link with other party members so character placement and direction are very important aspect in the gameMarriage system and divided by generations is what attracts me to play this game. With a bit of visual novel aspect, they implement it so your social skill is vital for your main character and future bride to gain a better generation in later part.TRUE END is in the game. Heck, every game I play (JRPG) has true end and this drive me to get the better ending for the game. I don't care if I have to replay the game but I sure want to see the true end (just what I did with Mana Khemia and similar JRPG. Didn't see the true end yet but hopefully it won't make it regret it.			"

												After playing 18 hours of this game, the feel of chore comes to mind first after all the dozens after dozens of next to zero challenge fights which atleast should be optional matches, but they arent. After halfhour of mind numbing matches you will get few lines of dialogue about main story, which is really hard to get invested in with all the usual cliches of jrpgs and paper thin characters around it, while at the same time in some parts story also takes itself wayyyy tooo seriosly.Time to time jrpg fans will be rewarded from their effort with some kawaii desu desu stuff with their waifu candidates, but the ratio of content/boring fights feels unbearable, to me atleast. With more boss fights and less tedious grind, this game would've been good or atleast decent experience, but since it isnt, its hard to recommend this game to anyone without a word of warning about the significant boredom factor that this game has.

												I really want to like this game a lot more than i do. Character creation: A unique way to make a character to be sure. It'd be nice if you wree given some kind of information in the game as to what is what....a quick search online will give you a fighting chance on some decent builds. Why are there guns on the cards when the main character can't even use guns?Battles: This is the real meat and potatoes of the game. You spend 99$ of you time here, in fact. The combo system is great, the entire system is put together well.Story: Kind of got me hooked, but I'm kinda lost. The translations are fairly well done, but it seems that some context for things is missing. I find myself just clicking away after briefly skimming the text to get to the next fight, then forgetting why I had to go there.Everything else: Umm...there isn't anything else to this game. It's a battle simulator with some character speech that you can read through, then it's right into the next battle.Buy this if you LOVE jrpg's and want to try something unique (to me anyway). Do not buy if you're looking for something where you get to walk around and explore the world, there is NONE of that. You literally go Story>Battle>Repeat. That's it.			"

												Now, I love rpg's and I grew up on turn based combat, but this game is severely lacking. You basically move from dot to dot on a map with very little variation. Each dot either represents a fight, a village or event. Oh, and I guess there are some quest dots you enter into that just contain the above. There's a solid amount of customization, but it doesn't seem to serve much purpose. In almost 10 hours there hasn't been one fight that required any effort. Then there's the story itself. It feels like it could be interesting, if the characters weren't so cookie cutter and bland. You push through the drawn out fights to get to an event and you get terrible dialogue and hardly any real background on the story. Now I know 10 hours isn't enough to see the whole story, but it's more than enough to get the feel for the game. So if you like repetitive battles, boring characters and ZERO exploration, this is for you. Everyone else should find something else. Overall-4/10			"

												I'd forgotten how♥♥♥♥♥♥the plot of all the Agarest games were. 3 chicks chosen by the gods to bang some guy, and then get sealed in a metaphysical pillar with him for all eternity. What a fulfilling life. At least the guy gets his pick of 3 girls and superpowers. The maidens of the pillar seem to get the short end of the stick.And I suppose this would be all right if the script was interesting, but I've played some of each game, and not only is the translation weirdly archaic, but the script is absolutely lacklustre. There's a psp game called Ragnarok Tactics, known to many as one of the most mediocre jrpg's ever, and that STILL had a more compelling script than this game. Or the previous game. Or any of the games.At least the gameplay was halfway interesting though. Not always fair, but that gives it its own charm.			"

												Ehhh... after playing for a bit I kind of got bored. I dunno, just not my thing. - Combat is okay, could be better. I would've preferred Final Fantasy Tactic's concept over this. Having to seperate a move phase and action phase is a bit annoying.- Kind of brings back 'meh' memories from playing Cross Edge, and that game just seemed like a washed down game.I just don't feel it on this one. 4/10Would I recommend it? Eh, sadly no. This is the first game I feel this way but don't let my review stop you from buying this.			"

												Eh, game play was fun.....if you can get to it. There is so much reading that by the time I get to a battle or something of actual game play I am taking a nap of bordem. The Battle system is fun and can be played so many different ways, but the fact you can auto battle seems like they dont care if you fight or not. This game is more of a graphic novel than anything else.I liked it at first, but then it just because so hard to follow the story line with the never ending text.			"

												First off , this game bears potential to be remarkable. That however , fails to keep up the motivation long enough to endure its biggest downside. of the 78 hours i played , 90% of the time were spent in battle. Not ""ever changing"", challenging battles , that make you curious for more though. It is the same , boring strategy of the same long battle over and over trough the whole game, one hundred times fold. one fight may take 10-20 minutes , the number of fights between the bits of storry parts grow from just 3 to monstrous 15+ , and with monsters getting more hp and numbers, its only getting longer , but hardly more challenging or refreshing in any way. Further more , unless you paid for the DLC for a nice cut down of battle durations, you will likely end up forced to grind for materials - which are needed to craft the newer weapons and skills , because they can NOT be bought from the shop just like that. Unless you want to run around with your lvl 1 sword trough the whole game , you'll be forced to go repeat some dozen times of the battles you're sick and tired of anyways. Note also , that with those 78 hours i did not grind , because the addons came with a sale package.   At first , i was motivated to make no use of them , however... the frustration with the sheer amount of time spent doing boring, long and repetetive battles ended up changing my mind. Note also , that after nearly 80 hours , i have about 20 more hours of gameplay ahead. If this game is played without resorting to DLC weapons , you're in for 120-140 hours of torture. about 14 hours of those are enjoyable content with storry and challenging boss fights. All the rest feels like a horrible content stretching mess , meant to make people pay extra money for DLC packages with proper weapons.While i can't possibly know, wether you will not enjoy this extreemly unballanced ratio of mental torture and occasional fanservice,  i can say for sure that i did not. For a game heavily relying on time spent in tactical battle , it lacks tactical variety.			"

												Ghostlight have once again provided a flawless PC port of another wonderful JRPG, with a full range of resolution options, solid framerate and performance, and excellent default control schemes for both controllers and KB/M.Agarest Zero is a story-driven strategy rpg with a battle system a little more complicated than the standard SRPG systems but fans of Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy tactics will feel right at home.The character customisation system was fun in that it felt almost completely arbitrary, it used some kind of Tarot card type system, where you picked random things and cards which then affected how your character was built (both stats and abilities).Overall, I have had tremendous fun and I highly recommend it to all JRPG fans.

												I can't say I was that captivated by the game. Mix 1 part FIre Emblem and 4 parts visual novel and you have a recipe for a click fest game. The story is an integral part of the game, but I don't feel invested enough in any of the characters to care. The main character is as bland and boring as hat of any visual novel and the old style speaking with modern clothing doesn't blend together. The battle system is fine, but the relevance of various symbols is unexplained, so you have to figure out how the game works. Designing your character isn't explained well, all your choices are uninformed, you've no idea how it will affect you later. For reference, if you're looking for a game that will let you move about, this isn't it. You're led from one battle to the next with some dialouue in between if you're unlucky. Quite glad I can't remember how much money I wasted on ths game.			"

												More of a soft no than a hard one (if this was a 1-10 type rating system I would give it around a 6/10). The combat system seems like it would be interesting, but you start out the game so overpowered it hasn't caught my interest as there is no time to even take damage since you overkill everything accidently. I've been finding it hard to continue to play since the characters and story either so bland or so over the top that it is difficult to care. I find myself dreading any 'events', but then also found myself starting to dread the combat since it was becoming so repetative. After reading other reviews it seems like at some point this game will take a sharp turn with the difficulty and tactics, but if you are looking for a great story and a great combat system right off the bat, I would maybe look elsewhere, or at least remember to stay away from using the DLC gained items until you need them.

												This game is a very linear game with little to no side quest features that I've seen unless you want to count the occasional ""Vacation Day"" where you go around town trying to get the girls in your party to like you or the intermittent ""events"" that pop up which give you a choice that affects how some of the different girls in your party look at you.  Everyone talks about how long this game is but most of that is dialogue and a vary large majority of the rest is battle time.  You go from one dot to next dot on the map doing battles.  Each battle generally takes 15min or so to complete so yes, this is a long game.  Don't get me wrong or anything, the battles are nicely done with good mechanics but each move has a drown out animation.  Flash over function. There are other things to do besides the main story quest but they are basically trophies, titles and monster hunts (which the monster hunts are far more difficult than what they need to be.)  The titles do give you some nice gifts for completing them so its not a waste of time.  I wasn't impressed with how your second generation comes out with stats.  It doesn't matter how much you level your first gen up, the stats don't chance for your heir.I'm normally not one to care to much about a story as most story plots have been played out in all the previous games so you sort of know whats already going to happen but I don't remember a single thing about this one...at all.  For me, as long as they make it sort of interesting I'm ok with the story.  This one wasn't interesting at all.  I can not tell you a single thing, after reading the dialogue of what this one was about.  To sum it up:  Someone was attacking and they needed something to stop it.  No twist, no turns.  That's it.All in all, it isn't a bad game but there are so many better out there.  I bought this one to scratch an itch I had but I still have that itch which I'm afraid just won't get scratch :(			"

												To me, this game is awfully bad. The only point that I find quite interesting is the art, and it is the one that decided me to buy the game. So basically, Agarest Zero takes some element of the classic turn-based RPG and some other of the average heroic fantasy Visual Novel in order to offer its content ; in the same way as Kamidori Alchemy Meister for instance. (Alas, Agarest is well worse than this one…)At the moment, I didn't play much but for what I have played… not once have I had fun.So, firstly, the RPG aspect of the game :— The turn-based gameplay is interesting with it's mechanics but most of the strategic part of the game is left behind by the fact that the fights are heavily gear-reliant. — The battles are repetitive ; if the few first one can make you think about some strategies, you quickly make one or two that will work in most occasions. In the end, the lack of diversity and the massive amount of “long” battles transforms the battle in some sort of torture sessions. — The character creation is too confusing. Firstly, you have to choose between three classes (warrior, battle mage, sorcerer) which is quite understandable even if nothing tells you what these classes are really about. Next… you have to choose five cards that will determine the weapon you'll use and your stats growth. So… for the weapons, you have two icons on each card so you can more or less guess what weapon you will be given. Now for the stats… NOTHING actually tells you what these cards does. In other words, if running countless tries to get the char you want is your thing… this game is for you. Otherwise… well… Good luck. Secondly, the VN aspect :— The story is quite common for what I have seen. Basically, it's just a way to put the game in context but chances are you won't find it more than just average. It's not bad but we have seen way much elaborated stories in the RPG genre. — As I said earlier, the art is well drawn. Backgrounds are well detailed and the fact that characters are not fixed during dialogs makes the game in itsel a bit more living. — The one thing that I hated: the affection system. It… follows absolutely no logical rule. For example, I made some choice with a character, that got me +1 in affection with this one BUT on the other hand, I got -1 with another one that was not even here and that had nothing to do with this choice. It's as if it were totally random… I'll probably update this review later if I progress in the game but for now, if you are seeking a JRPG/VN game, I could only recommand you to search elsewhere.

												Game play is extremely basic, the combats are boring and the story bits are bad. Graphics and animations are trash, although character portraits are decent. The music isn't terrible, but it is boring and I think in the 2 or so hours I've played I have only heard 2 songs. Sound effects are not good. I cannot think of a reason to recommend this to anyone unless they like bad japanese visual novels? If you like stragety games, tactical RPGs, JRPGs, plot, character, music or art, this is not the game for you.			"

												I'm glad I got this game during the Steam Summer Sale. It's long, boring, and repetitive. When purchasing the game, I thought it'd be an open-world kind of RPG like Pokemon or something. No. I was dead wrong.You can only walk the path on the map (kind of like choosing worlds in Super Mario) and it's just one battle after the other and dialogue after dialogue after dialogue. The battle system's pretty good (minus the part where you keep getting bombarded with newer info), and the characters are pretty decent. That's as close to becoming a good game as possible. Those are the only things working for this game.I got so bored so quickly that the storyline stopped making any sense at all. Do yourselves a favour and steer clear of this game.			"

												The combat is positional for combos like Disgaea - which is cool if you are into that, but it just slows down combat WAY too much for me. Also, the game's English translation is poor or the story is terrible. I found myself introduced to like 8 side characters in the first hour and they all were kind of samey. Why can't really great JRPGs like the Tales and Persona series make it to PC instead of stuff like this? Anyway, wanted to scratch my JRPG itch and this did not satisfy.			"

												I don't think I've seen or played a worse tactical turn based isometric RPG in my god damned life.From the top:-Art is ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious. Muppet mouths, creepy soulless eyes even for an anime character, sprites have very rudimentary animation, shortcuts everywhere. No character even has a ♥♥♥♥ing walk cycle. They float around on the battlefield. Attacks are only animated from one direction. In short, it looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥-Music is confusingly bad. Very generic bad rock music one moment, bloopy horns with a vaguely villainous vibe the next, then an annoying synth track for no reason. It's bad. Really bad. Sound effects are even worse, especially in menus. Everything has to have a way too loud, and way too long sound.-Gameplay is generic, watered down, and just bad. Tutorial is front loaded with extraneous info and terrible animation.-Dialogue is forced and weak. Extremely unfunny attempts at humor. The muppet mouths just makes the voice acting terrible. Considering the main draw of this game is to look at anime girls and try to date them, the fact that the art is crap and the dialogue is terrible results in a boring, soulless void which begs the question of: WHY.-Creating your character class is about as insanely vague as it could be. ""Choose 5 cards out of these 24 to define what weapons your character is good at."" Despite the fact the game takes place in a fantasy medieval setting, the cards display modern styled handgun pistols. I didn't play long enough to find out if you actually run around with a ♥♥♥♥ing beretta capping orcs in the face.-Getting back to the art, cuz it's really that bad. The monsters have animu eyes. It looks hilarious. ♥♥♥♥ing terrible.I wouldn't even recommend this game if you're looking for some laughs. I have a migraine now. I don't know how this game got in my steam library but I wish I could delete it forever.			"

												Honestly nothing I had expected due to so many people I know/ others were saying that its a great game ""must buy"", your better off playing Fire Emblem or Disgaea which have more in dept story and better characters. Additionally the game play feels extremely sluggish and terriblely mapped on the PC, probably not the case on the PS3. Also I miss the cardboard cutouts of the portraits as I am not a big fan of the terribly animated portraits and breast animations which try to appeal to you the player...Pros:Non as farCons:This is the First review I've ever written on steam... so yeah!Everything as of right now.Maybe I'll update this review as I progress and actually find things about this game that sets it apart from just one or your cliche Taticals.

												NEVER judge book by its cover... NEVER!!!! Agarest series is probably the greatest example of that teaching we usually get from anime. Pretty much just now finished this game.Positive stuff:- Great VA- Fun dialogs and overall a lot of comedy- Some VERY serious moments which bring up not only -feels-, but also tears. A lot.- Ending (which apparently was not ""true"" ending for me, but omg that ending...)- A lot of stuff to craft, obtain, collect, etc.Negative stuff:- Combat may get repeatetive. Fix: don't play a lot of hours -in one go-. Play in some portions- Women in whatever they wear in the game. Fix: think about that part as comedy or watch more anime or stop playing games from old times.Summary. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game. Some topics and some dialogs and situations are VERY serious and some are extremely dramatic and depressing... combat may be repeatetive, but it's ok. Just play it in portions. Plenty of comedy writing.			"

This is one game in the Generations series and is a prequel to the first game in the series. However you can jump into this game regardless if you have played any games in the series.  The graphics are just beautiful and vibrant on PC, it has full controller support but I do not recommend using it. The game is simple enough that even a console convert like me prefered playing it with the M & K. The main reason is using the controller in the battle scenes is just plain awkward and frustrating to say the least. The game is very grinding natured so if you prefer to just run through in a linear way I would suggest Kingdoms of Amalur or something like that. This is a Japaneese RPG thru and through, so prepare to grind a lot.One real downside to the game is the sheer lack of varied arenas, they use only a handfull for all of the battles which is sad. So if your are thinking mid way in a battle man I seen this before, you have.That said it is still worth it to pick it up, though I would when in a sale or featured game. While it is a quality made game I still feel the $20 + price tag is to high given the ridiculous cost of the DLC. That high price of the DLC is a bad trademark of the entire series to be honest.All in all I give the game a solid 7.5/10 I have to make a few points off for the lack of variance in the battle arenas, thee awkward camera controll, and the high cost of the DLC and game.

												Great game. Never played the game prior to it being released on Steam. Hopefully, they continue to convert the rest of the Agarest games from xbox to pc.-Graphics are decent. Reminds me of the old rpgs more than the newer ones with enhanced graphics.-Story line is alright. I still think the first one was slightly better but than again its my own opinion. -Game mechanics are still the same from the first one which I'm not complaining. It reminds me of FF: Tactics alot though with combos added to the system.			"

												Zero is good...  But doesn't even come HALF as close as the original Record of Agarest War, sorry Zero.   In all honesty the original Record of Agarest War was and still is FAR more superior and still remains the best story in the series to this very day imho, but i'll still give this a fair 6/10 though, wouldn't been an 8 were it not for the bride-choice being all but completely removed in the Digest version of Record of Agarest War (not to be confused with Zero's story), seriously... :/   Again...  sorry Zero but i'm just being completely honest here... ^^;   I can only recommend it to those who REALLY want to know the short prequel story before the main, MUCH better story in the original RoAW. :<    Also...  They say that getting the True Ending in Zero is much easier than in RoAW, I find this to be VERY untrue since, as a matter fact...  The True Ending in RoAW was FAAAAAAAAAARR more easier to obtain than in Zero and I quote from Zero's True Ending guide:  ""However, unlike in Record of Agarest War, the requirements to get the True End are much less strict and much easier to obtain."" I HIGHLY disagree since I don't see one reason why this is true since, it was far more easier (and much more better imho, really :> ) to get the True Ending path in RoAW than it did in Zero, seriously...  Instead I replace the above quote like this: ""However, unlike in Record of Agarest War, the requirements to get the True End are much more strict and much harder to obtain."" And that, to me, is a LOT more true.  Also, I prefer the original design of the original monsters in the original RoAW such as the Dragon, Golem and so forth, just looks better imho. ^^;   All-in-all, I again only recommend Zero to those who REALLY want to know the prequel story before the main, better story of RoAW but if not then just please... PLEASE stick to RoAW 1 and 2, you'll get less of a headache that way... XD lol			"

												The storyline and combat system is great in my opinion, took a while to get a proper understanding on how some things work, like capturing enemies, and some things I'm still a bit puzzled on, but it's great.  The only problem I have with it is that combat feels a bit too slow paced. Like it takes 10-20 minutes to get through two battles and reach the next destination, well, that's what it feels like to me, I didn't time it. Anywho I guess it's becuase I'm eager to get to the next part in the story and these fights in the way are keeping me from my story so it's a bit annoying			"

												I'll recommend this only for the Disgaea players who loves grinding mindlessly and see bigger and bigger numbers. THIS IS A GRINDING GAME:Pros:1. Very Very Long playthroughs and in  general very very long game. 2. Shounen harem manga + Disgaea = This3. Gazillion Customization4. Dialogue options.Cons:1. Tutorial is♥♥♥♥♥ not enough to prep you for this game2. Damage calculation is weird and hard to predict.3. GRINDING (To bonkers level, but you can afk battle that♥♥♥♥♥♥so its manageable)4. Writing is meh to bad (No where near disgaea level humor)If you want a strategy game with so much customization that you want to smack your head against a wall, this is for you.			"

												At first I didn't liked the game . Now the more i play it the more i like it. It has its flaws that is true. If you like tactical fights and (without dlc packs) a hard game..its for you. It has good japanese voice over, very good OST , good characters , good story (if you didn't played other Agarest games) . The tutorial is annyoing because you can't skip it like in Agarest 1 . I have around 250 hours in this game..so I'm far from finishing it (I try to max it ) .  There are lots of collectibles (Gallery, Event Gallery, Titles (around 150) )  so you can always do something in the game. Agarest: Generations of War Zero is the best  episode of the series for me.			"

												The prequel to Agarest: generations of war. I never finished this one cause there is no option to change difficulty level and OMG ITS HARD. The first game has 5 generations, this one only has 2 but ive spent so much more time on this one grinding. It's fine at the start but in the late game every battle turns into what feels like I'm fighting a final boss on nightmare mode....with a team of twigs.....inanimate, normal, decomposing twigs.I still enjoyed this game though, like the first one I recomend it to people who love anime and strategy.I chalenge YOU! You think your try-hard enough to complete this game?FINISH IT THEN! GO ON! I DARE YOU!!!!!!			"

												Reminds me Alot of Fire Emblem with turn based strategy and a afinity chart. On lower difficulty levels grinding isnt really necessary so if you just want the story without worry about combat you can still enjoy it. Characters are enjoyable and have a variety of personalitys. The break days are a nice way to get to know the girl characters and i personally enjoyed them. As i said the game reminds me alot of Fire Emblem and if you are a fan of it or simular games I would definitely recomend this game. If you enjoy turn based strategy games you will probabley want to check it out as well.			"
