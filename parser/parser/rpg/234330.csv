												[Original Review, dated Oct 18, 2014 @ 1:44am]♥♥♥♥ this game. Literally ♥♥♥♥ this game.Why? Because it is actually really REALLY FUN. And THAT is exactly the Problem!How so you ask? Simple! Because it is yet another free-to-play, pay-to-win game. It is a good game disguising a hideous marketing strategy. It is absolutely repulsive.Because you're gonna start playing this game and go ""Oh man! This game is really fun! I want to keep playing it!"" but then slowly the realization starts to seep in... YOU CAN'T. Why not? Well, lets see here... did you lose that last round? Bit of random bad luck and didn't quite make it? Want to try the round again? WELL TOO BAD!! Your heros are out of health now and won't be full again until THREE HOURS FROM NOW. Hey, did the game just give you a sweet new character as a reward for beating a stage? Great! Too bad you're out of spaces for new characters in your hero roster that you can only expand using the game's premium currency! Oh and by the way, your reward expires in five days and then you'll lose it forever, good luck trying to farm premium currency through the stages in game! Oh, I'm sure it won't take you very long if you've got a strong team of heros to keep plowing through with... Oh, what's that? They're all out of health again? Guess you're ♥♥♥♥ed! LOLS!! Seriously, this is the only game I've ever played that gives you rewards that you're never able to actually use.And it all just spirals on downhill from there. You want to get anywhere in this game? ""Give us your money!"" And not just some of your money... ALL OF YOUR MONEY! Because lets face it, it would be EASY to release a normal, playable version of this game for say $15... but they don't want just a little of your money. They want ALL OF YOUR MONEY. There is a never ending supply of money that this game can drain away from you. Because that's how it was designed. And it is a damned crying shame!Avoid this piece of garbage like the Plague. Or Ebola. Whatever horrifying desease floats your boat. XP-------------------[Revised Review, dated 3/24/2016]I'm not sure what drew me back to this game, other than that I still see a few people on my friends list playing it and that annoyed me... aaaand I was just bored enough one day to take a second look. So consider this an ""update"" on the previous review, because I decided to legitimately give the game a second chance and see how it has evolved since last I touched it and if it has improved it's terrible performance.To my surprise... it has.A lot of the inherient flaws I found in the game persist. You still need to pay for roster slots and you never quite seem to have enough for the number of ""cover"" rewards you're given. And as a player starting out (because the game did reset me to scratch for whatever reason, but all the better to review the updates), you will likely feel constantly overwhelmed in most challenges and leaderboards because a signficant portion of the playerbase is already way ahead of you.However, with a bit of proper management, selling off hero/covers you don't really want to use and spending your hero tokens entirely on roster slots, you can make it through the early stages fairly easier than I remembered them being. Additionally, the amount of time you have to claim your rewards has clearly been extended by a wide margin(my original review claims 5 days, the current build gives you 14 days), allowing you much more time to earn hero points through gameplay to unlock the roster slots you need to claim them. And those Hero Points seem to be a lot easier to come by than they were previously. Also, the very welcome addition of a set of 10 Full Heal items (that also restore back up to ten over time like hp bars do) makes grinding various activities a lot easier. Lastly, the removal of ""Environment Tiles"" and addition of ""Team-Up Tiles"" is an great update. You're able to earn Team Up cards through gameplay and from your ""Alliance""/clan, which are powerful one use hero powers that can completely turn the tides of a battle from ""I'm going to lose!"" to ""Holy crap, I just wasted those guys!""Overall, the experience is much improved. With a bit of dedication and smart team building... and, you know, LUCK... you can probably have a fun time with this game and not run into the massive frustrations I encountered in my original review. In a little over two weeks, I've built up a roster of 22 Heroes (from Star Rank 1 to 4), easily twice what I was originally able to obtain, without paying a cent and the next cover I care about making sure I get has 8 entire days left to go before I'd need to start worrying about whether I'd earn enough Hero Points to claim it or not. Unlike the first time I played, I actually feel like that's a goal I can achieve now. So... I have to give credit where credit is due. I've had fun with this, I think you could too.I do not retract my previous review statements. They are a reflection of the time and at that time things were much worse than they are now. And the inherient problems of a game built around microtransactions still exist, even if they have softened the impact they made at launch. Nonetheless, the game has proved itself to me enough that I am now willing to recommend it, so I will begrudingly perform that courtesy.			"

												This game was/is not much different then many other match 3 games except that you use characters to beat up other characters.It was quite fun and a way to waste a few hours just battling it out.  But then they did a few changes which made it so that if you wanted to progress you had to do whats called grinding (for those that don't know, thats when you have to spend 5 or 6 hours playing just to keep up with others playing).  This made things less fun.Now for the biggest change, if you have any characters that can heal the team during combat its called false healing.  Basically what happens is that while in a round, they will heal your characters, but soon as its done, any and all damage that was done to your character during a round gets applied to your characters, which means they will more then likely be instantly down and you have to wait somewhere between 3 and 14 hours for them to heal.So now instead of being able to play for a couple of hours, you're lucky if you get in a couple of rounds that can last about 5 to 10 minutes at most and then you need to wait till the next day (least for those of us with families, work and who require sleep) to play for another 10 minutes and then wait.They wanted to stop people from using their healing characters in story mode to heal their wounded characters and instead buy heath packs, which cost Hero Points which while they do come in game, they are very rare in game and they expect more people to buy Hero Points so they can buy health pack.  This has basically turned the game into pay 2 win game, well it was before but now its much worse.The majority of people who play F2P games will never actually put money into free 2 play games.  Once it gets to the point where they are spending more then a few hours playing and not being able to keep up with their friends, they loose interest and leave, and start bad mouthing the game, which causes people not to go play that game, which means the game looses lots of money.So for now I can not recommend this game.  Maybe if the devs wise up and actually listen to the community and things go back to how they were a couple of months ago, may I will start playing again and maybe even recommend this game, but lots of things have to change.

												After 280 hours played, I'm finally done with the game. But at the very least I should be able to give people a very thorough review of the game.At 280 hours played, the game can't be that bad, right? So why stop now?The core of the game is still really cool. You build up a roster of Marvel heroes and villians and level them up to build a stronger and stronger team. And the devs support the game relatively well with new events and new heroes so there is always something to do.Still, they just pushed it too far. This game isn't really a game, it's a second job. I see no way to play this game casually, either you are all in or you are out. Every two weeks there is a new hero, accompanied by a 10 day long PvE event that's a pure battle of attrition to defend a placement in the leaderboards high enough to get the new hero. If you don't? Without the new hero you'll have already lost in the next tournament. The new always gives a insurmountable advantage for the next. There is no way to escape this sweatshop.And the PvE events are less fun with each iteration. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rubber banding and level scaling makes PvE tournaments an exercise in frustration and disappointment. Have a maxed out Lv141 roster? Enjoy being beaten in placement by Level 50 teams, because their enemies get scaled to level 20 and take 1 minute each while you slog it out against Lv300 enemies with 10k HP each. And then the PvP tournaments... They used to be great. But then they changed the match making algorithm so that now every fight is a tired slog. And since there is now always an Alliance season running, you HAVE to do well in every single PvP tournament non stop or you are letting down your alliance. Alliances are another thing... they are great socially. But the pressure they put you under is enourmous. And again, it's all in or all out. Without being in a good alliance, you'll miss 30% of each tournament's reward! You might as well not bother if you aren't in an alliance.And the time commitment required to stay in the game is 2 hours EVERY SINGLE DAY. And even that is sometimes not enough, with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending times in the middle of the night for EU players which means all your effort is wasted thanks to rubber banding of US players near the end of the tournament while you are sleeping.Just do yourself a favor and don't get involved in this game. It's a bottomless black hole that you can't escape from. Why I quit now and not weeks ago? Season 1 just ended and I could finally leave without ♥♥♥♥ing over my alliance. They are great people and they didn't deserve being abandoned halfway through the season.			"

												This game fails on many levels: It doesn't introduce anything new, story is delivered dry and with little variation, graphics consist of a small handfull of stills per hero and poor to at most mediocre effects, user interface is confusing and very obviously trying to push microtransactions at every corner, and unless you want to spend a lot on taking shortcuts to increase your level and power, you're likely going to get stuck in replays of levels, grinding away for many hours per improvement.Free to play, sure. Pay to win, very much so. Overpriced? Most definitely.I guess another game to throw on the heap of ""let's ride the current hype with minimal effort"".			"

												It's a mobile game port. Mobile gaming is the bottom of the toilet of the gaming industry. Fun game but it is very expensive to get any real progress, which includes ""micro"" transactions up to $99 from what I hear. It also has health for your heroes that drains and you have to wait several hours before it refills before you can play the game again, or of course you can pay their premiums to play more. It's the same formula that 99.99% of ""free to play"" mobile gaming uses which as I said makes mobile gaming the bottom of the toilet of the gaming industry. By the time you've spent enough money on this game you've paid what you would've paid for a full priced new triple A game, or much, much more than that, which is pointless.If any game I've ever seen deserved to have quotes around ""free to play"", this one is it. Or literally any ""free to play"" mobile game that exists for that matter.			"

												When this first came out, I really wanted to like it.  Heck, when it first came out, I DID like it.  I'm going to go straight to my pros and cons.PROS:1) Classic Puzzle Quest gameplay - If you have enjoyed any of the other PQ games, the gameplay is back.  You get 3 characters on your team, who provide 1-3 abilities each.  It's still fun and addicting.  This is not my problem with the game at all.2) Big cast - There are 33 characters and counting in this game.  Each brings something new to the table.  Sure, several of the characters are different versions of the another character (there are 3 different Wolverines), but they usually play differently enough that you won't mind.CONS:1) Poorly timed updates - In a game like this, nerfs are a fact of life.  But nerfing a character in the middle of an event that focuses on that character is a jerk move.  Especially now that they are introducing...2) Tournaments with entrance fees - This might not be so bad if it had been there from the start, but as a new feature, it feels like the wrong direction for the game.  To make matters worse, you can't find out the available characters for use in the  tournament until AFTER paying the costs.3) Rising costs - There are several neat features that were introduced as crutches to help players with weaker rosters, like Shields to protect against attacks in PVP and Boosts (extra starting energy or damage) to give yourself an extra edge.  These started off being available at a decent price, but then skyrocketed without warning after everyone came to depend on them.4) Speed-run - I don't know about you, but I like to play games at my own pace, and you can in this game... for the Prologue.  After that, each chapter is available for a limited time and disappears at the end of that time.  I completely missed Chapter 1 because of this and if you are starting now, it might be too late for you to see Chapter 2 as well.  This is made worse by the fact that some of the fights in these chapters have opponents with levels over 200 (your characters are capped at 141 until you manage to level the very rarest characters) and the fact that some levels are UNPLAYABLE unless you have a specific character in your roster!  Missing part of the story because you couldn't get a 4* Invisible Woman (the rarest character) is unacceptable.5) Slow leveling - When I started playing, this was my biggest complaint, but I adapted to it.  I would have still recommended this if it were the only problem.  However, it is still a problem you should be aware of.  Characters require THREE forms of leveling.  First, you need covers acquire or level up your skills.  Second, there is a very rare form of currency called Hero Points that can replace the need for covers, but you will likely need it for other purposes, because it is very rare unless you pay to buy more of it with real currency.  Third, you need ISO, which is the experience of the game.  At first, you'll think you are getting a ton of it, because low level characters can get a level after a fight or two.  Once your characters start to get mid-level, you will need to win ~20 fights to level a single character by one level.  With 30+ characters that have a max level anywhere from 50 to 230, you will need a LOT of ISO and even buying it with cash won't help because it is crazy expensive.SUMMARYI love the gameplay and being able to play with Marvel superheroes.  I was willing to cope with the slow leveling until the developers started making a ton of poor decisions that favored those who are insanely high-leveled or spending cash.  I want to love this game, and if it had been released as a Single-Player game like all of the others, I probably would.  But the way it is, I just can't.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but the path chosen by the developers makes this one of the most frustrating experiences with a game I have ever had. The hours I have listed on this game are not technically accurate as I had it running in the background for days/weeks at a time. However I have easily put in 100's of hours into trying to like this game, hoping that the devs would fix the issues and it would improve. Ultimately I finally realized that there was near zero chance that would happen because the devs want the game to be this way.First the lets talk about the good - If you enjoy PuzzleQuest you will like the mechanics, the incorporation of the Marvel license is topnotch both with writing and character design. If you can be content with just playing the story missions and only a small subset of the available champions then go ahead. However if you are like me and want to play with the new champions when they are released and play the special events then you will pay. And if you pay realize that it is only a matter of time before that which you paid for is nerfed or sidelined or otherwise invalidated by whatever the newest cash grab from D3 is.Here is how it works, lets say you have a set of beginning characters (called 2 star for their rarity) and are having fun. You see that a new character is being released (omg Nick Furry?! I want to play that one too!). In order to get covers for that character you have to buy them with real money, oh except you can't really buy them straight you have to buy a ""pack"" and hope you get the covers you want (along with a bunch of stuff you don't want). If you aren't willing to go that route then you will have to jump through some very specific hoops, namely you will be ""competing"" with other players for a chance to win the cover. You do this by direct competition (through a very very broken PvP style contest that I am not even going to get into its so bad) or by grinding away at special missions, missions that are designed to be overpowering and that will wound or kill your characters (requiring you to ""rest"" or buy medpacks with money). I don't know if I can stress how grindy these missions will be if you actually want a shot at the new cover, we are talking hours of playtime, but what is even worse is D3 picks the times you need to play. This is ultimately why I had to stop, in order to be successful with the rubber-banding and the like you had to be playing near the finish of each sub-event and each main event. That means you can't even just grind it out on your own time you needed to be hardcore during specific hours (forgot real life commitments). What I finally realized was there is no end game. That process described above is it. It doesn't get easier just harder, and not from a skill level just from a time commitment and frustration level. D3's entire model is to reward low level players greater then high level players to make them think rewards are quick and easy. Once you are hooked however you will constantly lose you chance at the new covers to the next wave of new players getting their hooks set. No only do I not recommend this to anyone I would be very cautious about ever playing anything from D3. "

												I started this game as a fan of PuzzleQuest (old ones) and comics. I've been playing it for quite a long time and the only thing kept me playing was my hope that this game will become better. But it hasn't. 1. PVE of this game has totally invalid MMR which makes 100 level teams to be attacked by 450 levels (newly released 5* characters). It's very very very hard to earn anything because that P2W guys will make sure that you won't get even top 100 with all your crazy effort.2. PVP is ""grind like hell or get nothing"", even with 8 hour refresh interval.3. Tokens they give as a reward bring something useful like once in a month. And I'm talking about gold ones...4. They release new characters every week and even more often, but if you want to play next even you HAVE to get at least one cover of that character. Then you need to buy a new roster slot which cost more for every new one.  Now they have more 100 characters and you need to have 100 slots if you want to play it. This will cost ridiculous amount of HP (or real money).To gain something in this game you need to either play at min 10 hours per day or donate, DONATE a lot and then play 10 hours per day.... When you already have a good roster you can play some events just for fun, but don't expect getting much reward. But if someone just started... pity them...I give it 1 star from 10 just for bearing Marvel name on it. Playing this game complete waste of your time!			"

												There is NO need to buy ANY DLC of this F2P one. Just ignore the micro-transactions. Honestly, you can get unlimited Iso-8/Hero Points/whatever in-game currencies using Cheat Engine to make yourself happy. Collecting the awesome characters is fun, but the user experience is bad. High CPU usage, laggy during loading, and not-user-friendly UI. You can only draw one card at a time and cannot sell them all at once. You have to move and click your mouse frequently to get things done. And it's difficult to get a Legendary character (Invisible Woman), the possibility is about 1% I think. It's difficult to earn Hero Points as well. Versus system doesn't make any sense, you're still playing with AI. And the most important thing is, if you try to level up some of your favorite characters, it will cost you more than 100k of Iso-8 to the cap. I tried so hard to enjoy this Marvel-flavored Puzzle Quest, but I failed. This game shouldn't be called Puzzle Quest IMO.			"

												TL;DR - Avoid at all costs! I'm in too deep but it may not be too late for you.I've been playing the version on iOS since October last year and a lot has changed. The game deals in ISO and Hero Points. ISO is common but you'll need lots and Hero Points are uncommon but both are required. How much you'll enjoy this game will depend on how much money and time you'll be OK with sinking into this hole.You collect covers of characters. Each cover is arranged in a 1-4 star configuration. 1* = common, 4* = super rare. How you can get covers is by either winning tournaments or by earning standard or heroic tokens and lucking in to a cover you require. A standard token would typically give you 1* cover with a sprinking of 2* cover and the day you get a 3* cover go get a lotto ticket. Heroic tokens are hard to come across but you can get anywhere up to 19 Heroic Tokens (personal experience) before you get a 3* cover. Why covers of characters and not the characters themselves? Because you can have more than one cover of the same character! Yes! Lazy! For instance, there are 3 covers of Storm - a 1*, 2* and 3* cover. Wolverine has 3 covers - a 2*, 3* and 4*. Thor has 3 covers - 2*, 3* and 4*, etc.On top of that, most covers have 3 coloured moves and a maximum of 12 covers per chracter. Eg. Iron Man Model 40 (3*) - Unibeam (red), Ballistic Salvo (blue) and Recharge (yellow) (minus Bullseye (2*), Dr Doom (3*), Ragnarok (3*), Loki (3*) who all have 2 moves and a maximum of 10 covers). Meaning in order to max out your character, you need 12 covers and A LOT of ISO to level it up to full level. 1* covers level up to level 40, 2* = level 94, 3* = level 166 and 4* = level 270. Also, each cover takes up 1 roster slot. You can buy more with hero points! You can buy cover packs with hero points/real money. They come in 1, 10, 42 packs. The amount of REAL money for hero points in this game is highway robbery. There is 0 value. If you were to spend money on this game, it would be in hero points but the little hero points you get for your hard earnt money is not even close to worth it. When you purchase a pack (because the only other time you can earn a 10 pack is through the season rewards), it USED TO guarantee at least one 3* cover. But they took that away because screw consumers. They don't want people having all the good covers by simply getting a ""cheap"" (it's not cheap) 10 pack with at least one guaranteed 3* cover in it. No no, we want you to jump through hoops to earn that 3* cover! What it DOES guarantee is a higher chance of getting a particular cover! So instead of of chance being 0.8%, it's 5.6%! They are REAL stats pulled right from the game! So if you get a 10 pack, you still have a VERY HIGH CHANCE of getting NO 3* covers! And this game uses them as the highest currency! From the 7 seasons so far, I have had 3 x 10 packs with 0 x 3* covers. This is what we're all aiming for! 3 and 4* covers! You think your hero points cost you a lot? Yes sure, but what are they REALLY worth?!? They can only buy you CHANCES of getting covers! If you already have one colour and you want another, you CAN SPEND 1250 Hero Points per 3* cover.You have two types of game: PvE (Story) and PvP (tournaments). When you start the game, you can go through the prolog (PvE) which is one of the worst stories ever told. You know that episode of the Simpsons where Burns pulls out the piece of paper from the monkeys typewriter and he reads out, ""It was the best of times, it was the BLURST of times?!?"" well, that monkey seems more capable of writing a better story than what is present here. Quite honestly, I've stop reading all the ""story"" in this game months ago as it's merely a flimsy glue that holds this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game together.It's not really pay to win because you can win tournaments (PvP) with a bad roster. The only difference is how active you are in playing. It's a game that masquerades as a casual puzzle game in the vein of bejeweled but make no mistake - they is no puzzle aspect and it's purely a numbers game that forces you to grind and pray that you finish first. All it takes to win is enough time to persist. You can have a strong team and if the computer feels like you're winning too often, it can decide to drop matching gems in favour of the enemy team. I've lost to a team half my level because the tiles dropped in the enemies favour. If you're up against someone who is too hard, you can skip them until you get someone easy. When you lose a round, it really hurts you because you get 5 health packs on a timer - 36 minutes for each health pack. And if you have a limited roster, it shortens the amount of covers you can use in a tournament. Once you've used up all health packs and your covers, you have to wait OR you can buy more health packs. One method of winning is purchasing health packs with real money/hero points and just continue playing until you've earned a score which is hard to beat. Then spend MORE real money/hero points to secure your position with a sheild. You don't really face people in PvP. You face their roster and the computer uses their roster. So how does the computer know which covers to use from other people's roster? Dunno. You would think it would pull their strongest characters but it doesn't always. If you find yourself towards the top of the tournament, you become enemy #1 and your team has a high chance of ending up in other people's list to face. If you don't have a sheild, you can lose points when your team is defeated by others. The only benefit in having the 3 star characters is more people to use in the roster. When your team gets naturally stronger with more 3* characters, you face stronger enemies so your weaker 2* becomes more useless. Also, it is worth noting that some characters are USELESS such as Bagman Spiderman and Bullseye. Bagman Spiderman has 3 useless moves, each more usless than the next and Bullseye is a 2* with 2 moves which means his max level is 78. And while he can lay down defense tiles like crazy, he can't take a hit which makes him pretty useless. All your 1* covers are useless 99% of the time once you develop an even remotely strong team.Why it's not really pay to win as well is because this game has no end to it. The end is you have all the covers. And they continually release new characters so the end to this game is when they shut down the servers or stop releasing new characters. It also feels like they do very little testing with the new characters/covers they release. We see it often when a new character comes out. It's hard to get excited about it when we know the second a bunch of people flock to the new character, it means its overpowered and will be nerfed.Also, saving is a little ♥♥♥♥. If you want to save your progress, it is only possible through Facebook connect on iOS. I didn't see any feature on PC and I don't know what Android saving is like.If you hate your life and after reading what I've had to say still want to go through with your  cult suicide decision to play the game, go join an alliance. They now cost nothing and the benefits are huge. Although you need to accept that your alliance will never be in the top 10 unless you have contacts and join one of the already established X-Men groups who are always in the top 10. Hell, it's hard to even place top 100 alliance without all 20 players being dedicated to winning.In over a year, I've had to step back from the game 3 times because it has made me that angry and upset. I now play on a very casual basis and I can only ever treat it like that otherwise you burn out. I loved Puzzle Quest 1, 2 and to a degree, galactrix. But this is just dead ♥♥♥♥.			"

												Once upon a time, this was a fun game to play.Hell, it's been some time since I've actually devoted this much time on a game.But, now... this 'game' has become - to paraphrase a forum post from developer's website -, a hybrid of a sick joke and a straigh fraud.Before we start, let me introducte two 'resource' types in this game. ISOs and HPs.ISOs are akin to experience points, which you get by playing. Sure, you can buy.  But technically you can just invest time into the game to overcome that.HPs are hard to come by on its own and to get any respectable quantity, you have to buy.Sounds bad, huh? But no, the beauty of this game was that you could potentially outwit opponents with far stronger characters by timely use of boosts and strategic thinking in organising your team.And do you know what the geniuses at d3p came up with for 'improving the game experience'?1) change the currency of key boost in-game from ISO to HP -> thereby turning game into dime-a-dozen pay2win variety.2) increase cost of other boosts by 100%3) introduce a pvp tournament only open to those who can pay with HP... -> again pay2win only4) ...then nerfing the key characters in mid-competition -> just breathetaking stupidity...and the funny thing?(1),(2) & (3) were given no notice of update what-so-ever.So, the end result is a bunch of guys and girls being shafted by what is (at best) a questionable practise from the developers.If anyone really wants to play Marvel related games, do look for something else.Don't waste time like an idiot as I did on this monumental piece of greedy ♥♥♥♥-up.

												Bait and switch microtransaction galore... you would expect a match-three game to be casual, but actually if you want to get anywhere in this game you must play at least an hour and a half every eight hours every day, every night - its a grindy borefest. The company doesnt care about playerbase, they just want to squeeze money from people before they eventually realize the game sucks and quit.			"

												This game has the potential to be a great match-3 type game.  I thouroughly enjoyed the original Puzzle Quest game so I thought I'd give this a try.  I was really enjoying it until I realized how much money will need to be dumped into the game to unlock things that are needed.  The microtransactions in this game are ridiculous!  I have no problem throwing a few bucks here and there at a dev that has a quality product, but the costs are so bad that it's not worth my time.  Reduce the cost of the microtransactions and I MIGHT play it again.			"

												A beautifully-crafted example of how to ruin a promising game with F2P baggage.[review rewritten to explain more features instead of focusing solely on IAP complaints]Here's the thing: MPQ is one of the (if not THE) best/most interesting match-3 games around. I've been a big fan of Puzzle Quest since the first game. The novelty of taking match-3 and building a battle system around it has never lost its appeal to me. MPQ takes that formula and makes it team-based, adding considerably more depth than the classic 1v1. If you happen to be interested in the Marvel universe, then there's some bonus appeal.Puzzle Quest (and by extension MPQ) is different from the majority of the other match-3 games on the market. In a lot of other games, you're tasked with reaching point quotas or ""painting"" every tile of the board with a match, etc. before you lock the board or run out of pre-budgeted moves or something. In Puzzle Quest, your goal is to deplete your enemies' health points, in classic turn-based RPG fashion.In MPQ, you build up a roster of Marvel heroes (and villains) and pick a team of 3 to take into each battle. This edition has 6 mana colors, and each character has 3 preferred colors and up to 3 special abilities to spend your mana on. There are about a hundred characters available as of this writing, so there are lots of combinations available. In addition to building a team with good color distribution, you must also weigh the characters' max health and what types of powers they have (raw damage, board effects, support abilities).Unfortunately, the microeconomy severely limits your roster. Characters are unlocked via comic book Covers. Receiving your first Cover for a given character will make that character playable (if you have room to keep them), but in an extrememly weak and limited capacity. In order to get the most out of a character, you have to collect at least 13 separate instances of that characer's Covers. The majority of your character Covers are acquired through blind-box pulls. You can also spend rare currency (about $3-4 worth per attempt) for a blind pull from any category that doesn't include any of the weakest characters. Even if you're willing to spend the money, there's absolutely no way to directly buy a character that you want. The best you can do is to buy microcurrency and keep spending it on blind boxes.A character's strength & utility are determined by two factors: experience level & stacks of Covers. Rarer characters have higher starting levels and higher level caps. You can increase a character's level by spending the common currency (ISO crystals). It makes no difference how much you use the character. It's technically possible to completely max out a character without ever using them in a mission.A new character can't level up without acquiring more Covers. Covers are the only way to raise the level cap. Not only that, but you have to find 3 different version of a Cover to get access to all of the character's powers.I'll use classic Storm as an example, because she's useful and popular and she has uncomplicated powers.(When you make a match, every tile you break goes into your mana pool so that you can spend it to cast your powers)Storm's Green power breaks a bunch of random tiles around the board. Each tile deals damage & gives you mana.Her Blue power will stun the target enemy for a set number of turns and also deal damage to the entire enemy team.Her Yellow power doesn't cost anything, but is an automatic counterattack whenever somebody on your team takes a certain amount of damage.Say you just got your first Storm Cover, and it's Green. Now you can add Storm to your team, but you can ONLY use her Green power. You won't be able to use her Blue or Yellow powers until you happen to receive those Covers. If you get ANOTHER Green Cover, you can stack it. This increases the effectiveness of the power (in this case, she breaks even more random tiles when you cast it, resulting in higher damage and more mana gained) and also increases that character's level cap. Each color can be stacked to a total of five, and you have to have 13 total applied to bring a character to maximum level.Because of how Covers & levels are so closely intertwined, you reach a point where newly-acquired characters are straight-up useless. If a lot of your roster is around, say, level 100, and you get a new ""Rare"" character who begins at level 40, you'll need to accumulate at least 5 or 6 extra covers (and spend currency to level up) before that character is strong enough (both in base stats and effectiveness of powers) to contribute to the fight. This is a real shame, because it takes away the possibility of experimenting with combinations and turns it into a meta-game of trying to decide who to pour your resources into until they're viable.The game's difficulty scales up based on the highest-level characters in your roster, so if you luck out and win somebody much stronger than your existing team, you will be punished for it with a difficulty increase even though that high-level character you just won is basically useless (due to not having any useable powers). You may end up having to sell the powerful new character just to make the game playable again.You begin the game with enough space to keep 4 characters. You'll need to spend rare currency to unlock additional slots, and the price goes up with every new slot. The price eventually caps out at roughly $10 per slot. It is possible to get rare currency without spending money. Unlike previous Puzzle Quest games, your team isn't healed after a battle. Damage heals over time, or it can be healed instantly using consumable Health Pack items. Health Packs can be bought (1 for 50 cents worth, or 5 for $2). They can also be handed out as mission rewards. In the original release, several characters were able to partially heal the entire team. These abilities were reworked so that this health  would wear off after the battle and you would still have to either wait or pay to heal back up. Characters like Wolverine who have self-only healing abilities get to keep their health after a fight. The ""Versus"" mode is not live head-to-head PVP. Instead, the game copies a ghost of your team and you battle AI-controlled versions of other players' ghost-teams. You gain points every time you defeat an enemy team, but you lose some points every time your own ghost team is defeated. This is a pretty reasonable premise, except that point losses don't just affect your leaderboard standing, but also your ability to earn milestone rewards. It's incredibly frustrating to be one battle away from earning some rare currency or a weighted recruitment token, only to find out after winning that you've been attacked by twelve other people during your battle and you've lost ten times the points that you just earned. The rub here is that you can spend rare currency (starting at 75 cents) to buy temporary immunity to point loss. If this game wasn't built around a pay-for-a-chance-to-win microeconomy, I would recommend it. Because so many decisions revolve around the microeconomy, the game suffers and the players suffer. It's very easy to complain about the pay models in F2P games, but the exchange rates are particularly disgusting here. It's easy to say ""well, if you normally pay $20-30 for a decent game, then just buy $20-30 worth of currency and call it fair"" except that much currency won't go very far.I love the Puzzle Quest series, and I wish that I could play this game without constantly feeling somebody's hand grasping for my wallet. If there was a version of this game that wasn't built around IAP & only required a one-time purchase, I would absolutely buy it. For now, they'll have to be content with not getting my money, and I hope they don't get yours either.			"

												I enjoy the gameplay.  It could be a really awesome game......  I said COULD be.  But the DLC and the mecanics of the game that make it nearly a must buy totally ruin it.  I was in the top 50 in the opening competition and I have the Black Widow character to prove it.  I have not spent any money in DLC yet but I see the mechanics of the game that make it nearly impossible to play long term without doing so.  This is coming from someone who has spent a good deal of time playing this game.  I've also played previous games in the series like original Puzzle Quest and Puzzle Quest: Galactrix.In order to increase your roster size you have to pay coins, which are nearly impossible to get without paying real money.  If you don't add a character to your roster within 7 days the character goes bye bye.  That means you have to either delete a character that you've probably built up or spend real money.If you want to continue to play you have to keep your characters healed.  However, there's no way to get healing other than wait forever, which stops you from playing, or buy them, which requires real money again.  If you want to build your characters up any faster than a snails pace you have to spend real money again.  Around every corner of this game is a need to spend real money.Folks, there is a good way to do DLC and there is a bad way to do DLC.  This game is a shining example of the bad way to do DLC.  I would have much rather paid $20.00 for a great game then had options to buy non-gameplay breaking DLC such as special skins for the hero's, backgrounds, or gem skins.  As the game stands it deserves every single comment it receives about greedy developers.			"

												A month ago it looked like a good game. It's all downhill from there. This moment it looks more like one of thos sadistic experiments on what can you do to participants before they leave for good. I strongly suggest not to join around this time, and in the future, do your research first.

												This used to be a fun game and it still could be.  Unfortunately, the unmitigated greed on the part of the publishers has surfaced fully and without reservation in a recent patch where team healing was nerfed.Healing used to be possible outside of PvE or PvP combat by going to the prologue and fighting a few battles with a healer and the damaged roster members.  Biff bam boom!  You're back to playing.  Now that healing is only temporary during that battle.  So, it's either wait 3+ hours for your team members to heal or pay for health packs.The AI also cheats heavily, but I consider that more of a challenge to overcome than a reason to stop playing.I already spent $40 (US) getting my roster space up to speed.  I refuse to spend more money on a game that is no longer fun for me.  This latest healing patch moved the game into the ""not fun"" category.If the patch notes and forum indicate the game has been fixed, I would be willing to pick the game back up.  Until then, I am done.			"

												I cannot in good concise reccomend this one, I played it quite a bit on mobile, over 20+ hours in fact, and while the interface and art has survived to the desktop, it is stretched and not as crisp on my big screen. Other than that it is a well crafted match three with a unique enough mechanic to stand on its own as a really good game. But it has been hampered with the atrocious freemium model, where you pay for time or give them hundreds of dollars for an experience that is not worh more than 39.99 outright. It is a shame and I avoid the model like the plague, remove this caveat and let the game stand on its own and as it is it would be one of this gerations shining match three examples. As is I say avoid unless you like paying WAY more for games than they will ever be worth and unless you are fond of letting Publishing companies tell you how valuable your personal time is.			"

												This is a stupid game.  The game itself is fine but the programming has destroyed it.  The adjustments have been so obviously tilted to make you spend more money, no one in their right mind will play this.  I love the game play but it has gotten so obvious that they are programming to help you if you spend a lot of money and not if you play the game.  You should just give them your credit card and let them suck all your cash out of your pocket while you sit with your thumb in your mouth.   The only thing these guys are doing is inspiring hate hate hate.  What are they thinking?  Listen, unless you spend a lot of money, the programming is designed to destroy your abilit to win.  The rewards for winning are just stupid.  Even with a decent set of characters, you absolutely should not lose challenges 9 times out of 10.  The only way this happens is if they assure that you will lose to inferior character sets according to how much money you have spent.  The rewards are irrational.  This is a joke.  You are a fool if you get started on this.  It is a collection game but the best way to collect anything is to buy it, not bother to play.  If you like paying $50 for a chance to get a virtual card, have a great time but this takes a good concept and destroys it.  Play the game.  You will love it.  Then you will hate those who are controlling the economic model.  If you start this game, you are throwing away your money.  Better to poke yourself in the eye with a pencil.   So, no, I don't recommend it at all.			"

												Honestly, after moving to my iPad and playing for over 8 months, I can tell you how good this game was and how bad this game is right now.To start with, the old Matchmaking system is fairly easy to adapt to. You get to see opponents based on the points you have earned. The old system is really harsh for new players to handle at first but you will be able to handle it without no trouble later. Before the recent health changes and the nerf to mulitple heroes, most of the new released heroes (Starting from Iron Fist onwards) are completely broken to the point that destroys the fun out of the entire game.After the Matchmaking changes, only new players can find easy and fair fights while transitioners and most of the players without full level roster could no longer climb up the rank. Some heroes were nerfed to a point which are uplayable. The developer promised a buff for Inivisible Woman a year ago and ended up nerfing her even harder.With all the recent disappointment, many veteran players are leaving MPQ. So if you are a new player and finding this game extremely easy, good luck, because you will find the game so hard to play with once you decide to level up your heroes. So, make sure when you play as a new player, keep all your hero unlevel for the rest of your life. I promise you, it will make your game, very enjoyable indeed. This review shall be my parting gift to the developer and ♥♥♥♥ YOU VERY MUCH!(never in my life have I written a game review with a foul word, this time, I use it glady in your face)			"

												I have played this game over 350 hours, and I have only put $1 into this game, which was when I first started playing. Personaly, I do not recommend that anyone put money into this game because a lot of people have already done that, so the outcome would be rather disapointing, but that is left to your discretion. This game has very interesting machanics for a puzzle game and the fact that it is Marvel is very cool. I also enjoy the animations for the character abilities. Additionally, the story content is usually humorous and fun to follow. The game has changed in a few ways over the last year. First, when I started playing this game it was almost imposible to win in PvP or random events because people that put lots of money into the game had better characters at much higher levels. However, I continued to play and found ways to deal with it. But there is better news for new players. The game has been switched so that players are paired with other players around thier average level. So basically add all your character levels and divide by the number of characters. This machanic also tries to push people away from the idea of getting one high level character because it would offset your team average and put you at a disadvantage in a higher tier. Originally, there were certain lower level characters with overpowered abilities, which have since been nerfed or changed to even out lower tiers because earning certain characters is a chance of luck and not everyone is lucky enough to get those characters early on.I think the game has overall changed for the better, eventhough there were a few changes I didn't like. As a new player it would be much advised to play through most of the STORY content in order to build a decent team and obtain COIN to purchase more character slots (I would advise that you use COIN ONLY to purchase character slots because you dont get a lot and it costs more and more for ever 3rd or 4th slot obtained).I hope this was insightful. If so please rate it as helpful. Thanks and enjoy!			"

												I'm mainly basing this on the iOS version, but I downloaded and launched this game just to write this. I'd love to tell you how the PC version is different, but it keeps crashing every time I try and launch it! I understand the pictures are bigger. Game is the same, thoughLet's start with the problems:- Characters are deliberately unbalanced with a star system where more *** means more powerful.- Higher-star characters are very difficult to unlock without spending money. Leveling them requires you to obtain them several times, so even if you get a rare character, good luck leveling it.- Even if you spend money, you don't get a choice of your characters. They're randomized packs. However, spending money gives you a shot at more powerful characters.- Even within a given star-rating balance is godawful. For example, Hawkeye and Black Widow are both 1-star characters. Hawkeye can do added damage, while Black Widow can stun an opposing character for 5 turns. I'll let you guess which regularly shows up on teams.- Leveling up a character's powers fully requires you to basically unlock that character 11 to 16 times. This is in addition to grinding to level. You don't even get the choice of what powers you're leveling. It's random. If you get a power you've already maxed out, ha ha, ♥♥♥♥ you, so it can take a lot more than 11-16 unlocks.- The single player campaign features huge jumps so that you have to grind in multiplayer to level up enough to progress, or... spend money. The grinding is not fun.- Regularly the game has ""tournaments"". Your competency in these tournaments will be determined by: character level, character star rating, luck, then skill, in about that order. You can earn characters ahead of other people if you're willing to be an obsessive grinding machine; only about the top 10 players actually get the new characters out of, well, thousands.- ""Multiplayer"" is basically just facing other people's characters controlled by the AI. There's no actual multiplayer. You can't pick which of your characters other folks face, either.- The AI is absymal and frequently makes terrible decisions for you to exploit (or for people to exploit against you). It can't even parse making certain advantageous matches (like on the corner of a column / row match).- Your characters heal on a cooldown. You can spend money to overcome this. You can get powerups that give you an advantage in matches, some of which are given free, but you can always spend money for power. You only have so many slots for characters, which you can unlock... slower than you earn characters... or spend money to gain them.- The graphics are sharp but the animations are terrible and barely worth noting. For example, Iron Man has three attacks and two animations.- The ""writing"" is done by noted comics hack Frank Tieri, and it's abysmal. Shut up about your stolen cars, Tony. It wasn't funny the first time. After the sixth time I believe a black hole of humor has been achieved. I liked the Dark Reign event, but this isn't quite that, and has characters nattering on about the terrible ""isotope"" concept used in the FTP Marvel games.On the upside!- Some of the match-3 superpowers are rather clever and thoughtful (if not at all balanced).- You can unlock Spider-Man with a bag on his head.In general: go up, scroll through the sample pics until you get to the secondmost pic from the right, the one that displays a roster. You will never see a screen like that. That screen represents perhaps over $120,000 dollars of investment in the game. That's the level of thought that went into this: showing a sample screenshot that no player will be insane enough to achieve.Unless of course, you have a hacked copy of the game. Did I mention people have already hacked it to have unlimited goodies and cheat their way to victory?Oh, and it doesn't say in the store, but it's a beta / development version of the game!♥♥♥♥in' avoid.

												Solid gameplay and theme, but utimately it is a cash grab designed around forcing the user to pay money to avoid grinding some missions for rare curriencies and items.You will be expected to play or grind for:- The ability to recruit new heros to play with. You'll start with 3 (Iron Man, Storm and Black Widow) and you'll have one empty slot for a hero. After that you'll need to scronge up their pay currency to add an empty space to recruit any heros (including ones you earn that will expire and disappear if you don't get an empty space! Not to mention you'll earn recruit tokens which allow you to get characters for free, but not the empty space for free. If you don't have an empty space, they are WORTHLESS.- Abilities and level ups. Character abilties are unlocked and leveled up after randomly earning comic book covers after missions. If you don't get the cover you need from a mission, you'll have to replay the SAME CONTENT to hope you earn it next time. And if you get 2 Hawkeye comics, but one is Classic Hawkeye and the other is Dark Avenger Hawkeye, those are two different characters and don't level up aside each other (not to mention they'll take up two character slots, which remember you're paying for!).From what I saw, you'll grind up the pay currency by playing the semi-PVP battles. Much like the Marvel Facebook game, you'll fight AI-controlled player teams to place on a leaderboard for the shot at rewards. This isn't as much PVP as it is PVE where someone in the world happened to choose that team. Since this game allows people to gain a lot of power by paying money, the top spaces in the leaderboards (read: where you need to be for prizes) will be filled with 'wallet warriors': people who have amazing teams simply because they paid money. If you want to play this game and fork out minimal to zero cash, expect frustration. There ARE prizes for simply playing the ""PVP"", but you will need to devote a LOT of time to get the good items. For example, winning a PVP match earns about 20-30 'Shield Points'. To get the pay currency for free, to unlock all the good stuff in the game without paying real money, you'll need to rack up ~1000 Shield Points. Enjoy the grind!All in all, the Puzzle Quest mechanics are still solid and the Marvel theme never disappoints, but it is a pay-to-win cashgrab unless you are a superfan of Puzzle Quest and don't mind the grind. In tempting players to fork out cash at every turn, Marvel Puzzle Quest undermines the fantasy of having a league of powerful superheros, which is really the core of the game. I don't recommend this game, but play the game for yourself if you are still curious after my review. It is free-to-play, afterall.			"

												this game is a free to play game based on marvel characters... well... no , this game is really pay to play! you can have new heroes grinding the pve events or the pvp events (in both cases you play against the AI) ,the problem is that you can have all the heroes like a free to play player, but... you can't use them because you have limited roster space! so you often have some good heroes but you have to sell them for very few resources because after 14 days the hero vanish... to buy a new roster space you need hero points, but after the first 25 spaces, the game became really greedy and you need 200,225,250,275,300 ,400,,500,700,1000 points to have only 1 more slot! you can get points grinding the events but you get only 100 points if you reach the first 10 position in an instance with 1000 players... or 50 if you reach the first 50 ,at day, plus 50 if you live in front of the monitor grinding like there is no tomorrow an 50 if you reach the first 50 position at the end of the event. Another big problem is the broken level of difficulty, this is based on your roster...so if you are really lucky and you get a level 250 hero, you have to sell it or you will face enemies that will kill your heroes with only one hit! when one of your heroes is defeated, you need to wait until he is healed, more high is the level, more time is needed,sometimes you have to wait 1 or 2 hours! in conclusion... avoid this game if you don't want to spent a lot of money !

												The puzzle quest formula is ruined with the removal of gold and exp tiles, along with the addition of timed enemy attacks that can be removed simply by removing the tile within the amount of turns given. Pretty shameful downgrade from the past 3 puzzle quest games...			"

												One of the worst pay to win games there is in steam. Do not spend money to this game.PQ mechanics are nice, but if you dont dish tons of money to this, you cannot even complete the single player part of it.If you want to have fun couple of hours with it, only spend coins on roster slots. Dont buy cards (or covers as they are called in game) with coins.Fun game, typical mobile game p2w scam business model.			"

												This game is like Candy Crush, in that you _can_ get through everything for free if you wait long enough, but unlike Candy Crush, where you could keep playing if you passed a stage, Marvel Puzzle Quest forces you to wait, no matter how good you are. Your heroes have HP which persist over stages, and it takes time for the heroes to recover HP. There are some stages where you can possibly go through without losing any health, but you'll get to stages where you just can't prevent damage, so if you want to continue, you'd need to wait for HP to regenerate, and then move on. Paying money is just for 'cheats'; extra EXP, other heroes, instant heals, etc. This game is pretty much unplayable if you're playing it for free.			"

												So, Puzzle Quest + Marvel sounds like a good idea on paper, doesn't it? Well it is, but not with this kind of execution. The short ammount of time I put into the game feels wasted, and here is why:The game tries to leech you out of your money where ever it can. You had a fight and your characters are injured? Too bad, that you have to wait until they are regenerated. Don't wanna wait? Better waste your money on some health packs so you can keep playing without downtime.This is the worst kind of F2P game you can get your hands on, because it actually punishes the player for attempting to play it. Don't waste your time with the download. Play Puzzle Quest and be happy, it's a much better game with less hassle for a small entrance fee.			"

												It's an expensive and oridinary free-game of its genre. It has got most things you can expect, but not much of surprises.The theme of MARVEL heroes is presented through simple CGs and empty dialogues, which are so repeatitive that you eventually just skip them. As the last update arrives, the game gets even more expensive. The prices rise faster than oil. You can have fun without paying anything, but that only means the very essential part of the game, like demo. For the rest, the rivals are adjusted to a diffculty that you can almost only play with powered-up hero to win, which means more cash needed.			"

												If you are here because you saw Puzzle Quest, and don't have a burning interest in playing the next Marvel game, I suggest you turn back and play Puzzle Quest 1 or 2. If you are here for the Marvel Universe, and have no idea what puzzle quest is, then you COULD like it. This game is a match-3 type game, much in the same vein as Candy Crush, Bejewled, and like it's namesake, Puzzle Quest.It says it's a work in progress, so I'll give the dev's the benefit of the doubt, that they'll fix the game's problems. I have played Puzzle Quest 1, own it on 360, steam, ds, and the iOS. I own Puzzle Quest 2, and Galactrix for the DS. And now I have played this game, on steam. So I know what the games are like, and what they have done. I have also played Geomancer, the match-3 game from Square-Enix, but I have not touched Candy crush, because that game has no depth beyond ""HEY LOOK AT ME I GOT THIS SCORE AND MY E-PEEN IS HUGE"", much like bejeweled. I like my RPG's, thanks. I don't mind the direction they took this game in, where they add in an active attack each match. Previously, you would only attack the enemy when you would match attack gems. Otherwise, the other gems were resources to power your abilites. But where this gets confusing is when they do not make clear various aspects of the game, such as when the opponent goes. If you're attacking all the time, will your opponent just not get an attack, and just fill up their resource gems like in Geomancer? And what about attacking the enemy who has the strongest weapon? Will his ability get taken out, so that they can't use it? These are gameplay issues that should be addressed. When your user is CONFUSED on different aspects of your CORE gameplay in the beginning of the game, that doesn't bode well for them continuing to play it and 'experiment' to find out all the rules to the game.Micro-transactions are an okay model. I mean, after all, this IS a free game. I have not tested the viability of different heroes, nor the abilities that come with them, so I can't comment on how balanced it is. But based on what I have read in the other reviews, it seems that it's not looking too good. I would recommend doing research on it yourself. All in all, I expected the game to be way better, but it's medocore at best. A new direction for Puzzle Quest, not necessarily good, but not really bad either. This game didn't catch my interest beyond the novel idea that Marvel and PQ came together, so I got bored of it quickly, once that novelty wore off. In terms of Quality, I would rate the games like so:1) Puzzle Quest.2) Puzzle Quest 2.3) Geomancer / this game.4) Galactrix.			"

												This should have been good.Puzzle Quest is a solid concept, Marvel has a huge stable of interesting characters spanning decades of comics.But... this fails on both sides.Marvel sideThe game is divided into chapters, each of them involves chasing after a new random villain. There is an overarching story about the Green Goblin being the leader of a new organization that replaces Shield which COULD have been interesting... but several chapters in that still hasn't gone anywhere and is more a convenient framing device to wheel various heroes and villains on and off stage.In levels you're either picking your set of 3 heroes from your own stable or get backup from the fitting hero (e.g. Spiderman coming to your aid against Venom), but the selection of available heroes is limited in two ways.Firstly, you can have a total of FOUR heroes to start out and the only way to increase this limit is to spend premium premium hero tokens which are hard to acquire without paying money. It's reasonable that within a chapter or two you're up to six hero slots, maybe eight if you only buy the slots. This means you have a very limited roster of heroes at the ready to develop and to be called into action if you need to change up your tactics.The other problem is that the character roster seems very limited. You get the obvious main characters from recent Marvel films , the big-name mutants, the fantastic four and some random villains from what seems to be mostly the Dark Avengers. Ooh, Squirrel Girl too, which gives it some bonus points. However, there are plenty of characters that did not make the cut. I haven't seen Rogue or Phoenix yet, for example. Did we really need five different Storm, Black Widow, Iron Man and Thor variants instead of a more diverse roster? Don't get me wrong, I LIKE that I can pick which Storm I like best (both her look and skillset, though it would have been even better to pick these separately...), I'd just wished that there had been a few more lesser known characters.Combined with the absolutely secondary and forgettable story it's just a total waste of the Marvel license.Puzzle Quest sideAt least this side should be easy to get right, right? Puzzle Quest 'inspired' games are plentiful and it's clear by now what works in free to play titles and what doesn't... turns out it apparently wasn't that easy.The very core of the Puzzle Quest gameplay is still there. You take turns manipulating a match-3 square board in an attempt to gather resources and defeat the enemy. Puzzle Quest was strictly a one versus one system, but in this game each side can consist of up to 3 characters.Each character has up to three skills, each tied to a colour on the board, and an attack value for each colour that determines the damage it does to the targeted enemy when making a match with it. Fortunately there is no need to switch an 'active character' or anything to maximize your damage. So if you brought Lady Thor and Gamora and match yellow tiles then the game just looks up which character would deal the most damage (in this case Thor) and have that character attack. Which character attacks based on the various colours is also indicated on the stones in case this is relevant for any of the active skills in the battle (which rarely happens).This bit is solid. It suffers from some of the same randomness that plagues this type of game in almost every iteration, where the enemy just happens to luck into a huge combo that drops into place from the top of the screen as tiles get destroyed, but it's hard to fault this particular game for that.What it DOES do wrong is that there are way too many different colours on the board. There are SIX different colours of mana to gather and use for skills and a seventh block type with the team up tokens (that allow for one-shot special attacks that aren't as impressive as they sound). The original puzzle quest had 4 mana colours, damage tiles, experience tiles and coin tiles for a total of seven as well, so you'd think that'd be okay but it tends to fall flat. Going back to the Thor example (she was the rarest character I managed to get and is awesome), she has a cool skill that deals damage to the entire enemy team but it needs 12 yellow mana (or AP as the game calls it). The problem is that there are so many different colours that it's hard to specifically try to gather a single colour (or even two colours to focus on...). It seems more about just making matches than gathering specific mana types.The above would be an okay if imperfect implementation of the puzzle quest side of things... but of course we have to remember that this is a free to play game, so there have to be things in place to limit what you can do so that you either grind for it cough up some money.Prospective players will be happy to hear that there is no energy mechanic in this game... then immediately disappointed again when I explain that damage the heroes receive in a game is persistent and then needs time to heal (my Thor needed several hours after being knocked out). You can start games with injured heroes, but it obviously sets you at a disadvantage. Medkits can be used to instantly heal a hero (outside of battle), but they are in short supply. Beyond the 10 you start the game with I've found ONE from a one-time mission reward. Of course a solution is to just switch to other heroes until your preferred ones are healed, but as I mentioned above, you have very limited roster space available so the game really wants you to focus on single heroes.Which brings me to the next big point, which is hero progression. Remember how in Puzzle Quest you got experience points from fights like in an RPG? Well, this isn't like that at all. Winning a game gets your heroes nothing, but you as the player receive some ISO-8, a mutation drug that might have a justification for being there in the later part of the plot, it's just sort of explained and then dropped entirely at the start. The idea is that you spend this ISO-8 to power up your heroes, and it's easy to see this as a communal experience point pool... except that it doesn't get filled very often.Every mission you play gives you a few hundred ISO-8 for the first time you complete it and might also have another batch in its drop table of random one-time rewards, which means that the total amount of ISO-8 is LIMITED. Sure, you can buy more with real money or by selling off some of your spare heroes, but that kind of goes against the point.Using ISO-8 to level up your hero increases its life and the damage dealt by matching specific tiles, but only up to the hero's current level cap. This limit can be extended 12 times by sacrificing a duplicate card, or almost duplicate anyway. You see, each of the heroes you receive or buy will only have one of its three skills randomly assigned to it. So Thor can either hit the enemy with his hammer, gather a storm cloud (spawning a bunch of yellow tiles on the field) or call the lightning down (using up that yellow AP the previous skill got you), but only ONE of those things until you find another copy of that hero.And before you get your hopes up, there are no places to farm this stuff. You'll be stuck spending ISO-8 or hero tokens (you know, those hard-limited currencies I was complaining about earlier?) to get a random hero. A duplicate hero that has a skill you already have unlocked can be used to develop that skill, making it more effective and sometimes making it do slightly more things (e.g. more tiles when gathering storm clouds). Upgrading skills can also be done directly with hero tokens, getting new skills can not. To have a 'perfect' character you'll need 3 cards with 3 different skill slots and a ton of money OR 13 cards, divided in groups of 3-5 over the 3 skills.Which means that even if you pay, you'll need a ton of luck to get what you want which is just frustrating.Bad mechanics, poor story. Don't play			"

												I have to give this game a down thumb, even though I actually like the match-3 game they've built, because their business model is so bad that it is flat out costing them money by driving away players on the fence, including mine.Here's the money hook with this game: you build up your roster of Marvel characters by winning things called covers. Each new character cover requires a character slot. These slots cost Hero Points, this game's premium pay currency. Those points trickle out, if you don't pay, at a ridiculously insulting rate. I'm still at an early stage of the game where slots cost about 200 hero points (they rise as you go). Last night I put in over three hours of play and get handed 10 hero points as a ""reward"" for my time commitment. Do a little points vs. time math there and you can see we have a problem. It's genuinely insulting, and I cannot recommend carrying on with a game that so blatantly wants to force you into paying to play.It's a shame really. The match-3 game is fine, like a lot of them easy to get into, a little addictive. The Marvel branding is an easy hook, there's a great variety of powers and characters. I actually enjoy the game, and would like to keep playing. But the pay structure is just too punishing to be worthwhile and I refuse to support a developer blinded by greed to the point my wallet is the only legitimate method of advancing the game once a month or so, for eternity. There are basically two successful free to play models. The Dangling Carrot, where just enough reward to keep casuals interested is given, generating revenue. Or The Punishing Stick, where players are starved of neccessary rewards, generating revenue. This game is about 98% Punishing Stick, it has cost them my business, and I very much doubt I am alone. There are numerous ways this game could be somewhat more generous towards early game players trying it out, that might actually generate more long-term revenue by hooking more players. I genuinely think they are hurting their business by being cheap. Keep in mind, if you check my account, I have a shameful 970 hours in Star Trek Online. I have been to the free to play jungle. I have seen some things. I am not opposed to a free to play model, if it is laid out in a reasonable way. This game's model is not reasonable. More power to those of you willing to dump as much money into this as is needed, but it's a bridge too far for me.			"

			Brbteabreak gives a First Look/Impression on Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign, a new game for PC, Android and IOS. Gameplay/Impressions are of time of recording and as this game is a work in progress...		

Microtransactions have been a thing of late when it comes to Mobile gaming and more recently Console gaming. PC gaming, while having microtransactions, has never really been a thing of concern, with a large amount of game options, many costing as much as some microtransactions, PC users have just been able to ignore them. Games which do promote microtransactions on PC have been either hit or miss, this does not exist on the Mobile Market.In the mobile market it's more likely to find a game with microtransactions over non-microtransactions and this is mainly because of the target audience. People on mobile devices usually come from a lower common denominator, and as such their standards are as low my pants while sitting on the toilet. They're casual gamers who don't want to spend the time to play the games they play, and rather skip through them to get ""the full experience"". This allows for ludicrous microtransactions.Over here at the PC Master Race, we don't accept content that was designed to be played while you're trying to get clingers to fall into your toilet. The PC market has matured enough to know when we see exploitation, especially in the F2P space, and as such the flaws in this game become instantly realised as soon as the tutorial begins.If for some reason you have a craving for some Marvel, I would actually still look elsewhere. The story is mediocre at best, lacks voice acting and there is no mention or Dormammu from what I can see.Fun Fact – The word “microtransaction” was used 7 times in this mini review.			"

												Freemium hell. The most frustrating match-3 game and the most egregious pay-to-win game I've ever played. 1. You get cards for new heroes faster than you get slots for them, so you're constantly throwing away heroes you don't have because there's no room. This seems really bad for a collectible game. 2. The designers seem to be adding more and more mechanics to boost the AI and make the game more laborious and frustrating to play. 2a. Healing goes away after each round, so it basically just helps the AI. 2b. Powers which hurt the enemy team and also your own team: These are poison for the player, but the AI can play them all day long 2c. The new specials seem to be free for the AI. Even easy matches can hurt your guys badly, which can't be healed away any more. 3. It seems like the developers are constantly nerfing useful powers, and not giving anything in return. 4. Quality of life issues never, ever get fixed4a. Replaying rounds gives out booby prizes before you've collected all the rewards4b. Can't see which enemy triggered a power4c. Friending is done through Facebook onlyThe game seems to get more and more tedious and grindy after each patch. This is a really, thoroughly terrible game at this point, and for some reason it's only getting worse. Not recommended. Very much don't recommend giving it any money.			"

												Game is decent at best. The advantages the computer has is ridiculous. Constantly color starving you, massive cascades, and extra turns. It happens very often, one turn and the match is over for you. You can do this as well, but no where near the extent it happens for the computer. If you haven't invested much into the game, it is not worth it. It is a free game heavily designed as pay to win. The game is tailored to have you spend money. Of course this is the main purpose of the game. Be it you spend money to try to get characters, to buy slots, to advance your characters to a point that you can compete, or just to heal so you can participate in events. The game is just not very fun, it is tedious and repetitive. If you are not a Marvel fan, it is probably best to avoid this game.			"

												Supposedly this was a good game when launched. Since I've been playing, they have done nothing but made it worse. Characters that were depended on to heal (and therefor increase your playtime) had that ability taken away. Other characters were weakened as well - beware if you depend on anyone to long, that person will be nerfed without warning! Additions such as ""team ups"" were added with obviously no testing put into them - everyone I read online and in my alliance pointed out horrible problems with them day one. This was yet another addition that removes health from your characters, in a blatent attempt to extort more money out of their userbase.DO NOT think this is a ""free to play"" game. It is not a ""pay to win"" game, it is a ""pay to play"" game. The developers have ignored user feedback and implemented changes that constantly make it more difficult to play any session longer than half an hour. God help you if you are in Europe (with horrible ending times) or here on Steam (where you can't play when the developers want you to). To keep their older userbase they add the rarer characters every other week, but this means for the new user you'll have to pay cash up front for roster spots to have any chance to collect these. These rares are hard to find: it also means you'll have a year of playtime before you can compete with those who had their characters built up early on from a smaller character pool.			"

												Do not fall for it! Let me be clear: This game has great potential! It takes the formula of Puzzle Quest and improves on the combat and adds a lot of personality through the Marvel liscense! That being said, what it comes down to ultimately, is a very cynical cash-grab.The moneytization is tailor made to abuse the player in every way. Let me explain:There are two kinds of currency: Violet Iso (regular) Gold (premium) Both can be bought with real cash. Now, both drop after successful missions. But only once! Every reward is locked after one drow. Afterwards, doing missions (which can take up to half an hour) only reward 20 Iso (to give a comparison: a booster pack costs 500 Iso). So, you have to do a mission 25 times to get enough Iso to buy a booster.Now, why not stick with the heroes you get and level them up?Because the only way to level up heroes is by either spending premium currency directly OR getting more copies of the comics, the heroes originate from. And the latter can only be achieved by buying booster packs. Which only give a chance to obtain the right comic. Furthermore, there is only one rarity category that can be bought with Iso-currency. The lowest, of course. And while you do have a chance to get a rare card from this category, the game is very honest about the fact that your chance is slim.And don't forget that you need several copies of one comic to level your hero up.This is a very blatant cash grab, made worse by the artwork. Yes, sadly, the artwork is very lackluster. The artist went for a semi-realistic style with dynamic posing. Sadly, the borders of different colours are very visible, which makes characters look unclean and bloaty and he had issues with contrasts and forshortening, making people look very strange and their clothes feel dodgy. (Take a look at Black Widow or Thor and you should see what I mean)I repeat: Do not spend money on this game! It does not warrant it at all!			"

												Very simplistic game that doesn't even remotely feature the number of many elements that could be found in the original Puzzle Quest. Easily-accessible PvP and tournaments seemed like a nice idea, but you are expected to grind a lot of levels for your super heroes team before you can be competitive, instead of just trying and enjoying it.Almost every additional feature requires you to pay money. Need more slots for heroes? Buy them. Need healing items? Better spend some money. Need to level up and get new skills? The fees are due! All of this can be paid with gold, which is the in-game currency, but you're gonna need a lot of it.Currently the game is a glorified shadow of Puzzle Quest with some Marvel heroes and a rather silly plot.

This character is going to be deleted in 13 days, if I don't spend $2 on this game!Fourth night, I could not earn 25 coins for the life of me!Fifth night, I sold my Hawkeye for unspent experience points since I could not EARN coins for whatever reason. I then put Psyloche in his place. She was level 40 and rank 3 star. She did a lot of damage, but was way less powerful than Iron Man, a rank one star.Sixth night, entire team died after second fight. I can't play again till they rest their wounds. All of the Hero Recruitment tokens are hidden. I can't use a hero recruitment token anyway, cause I have no coins.If you like seeing familiar faces flashed in front of you and beaten up for real cash, play this ♥♥♥♥♥ of a game!I loved puzzle quest!I love marvel!I HATED this game!!!Cons!1.My ENTIRE team was killed each round on night 5.2.It costs REAL money to revive EACH team member, unless you wait for 45 minutes.

			Your character's health is persistent through fights. Your party will die unless you spend money. Here, I got to play 3 games before all my heroes were dead.		

Sure, I could have played better, but then I would have died in my fourth game. The first game/round I didn't record, cause it was just so basic.			"

												The writing for this game is just so bad. I mean, the game is subtitled Dark Reign, so one would think it would follow the story of the Dark Reign story ark, but the story is so distorted that it barely has anything to do with the Dark Reign. And there is no new content at all, events just repeat in a circle...			"

												It is a free to play match 3 game with a nice little Marvel  spin on things.However, once you've beaten the single player campaign you have a choice to make: stop playing or start paying. The grind becomes almost too painful to recommend due to roster space restriction, and the very slow speed by which you unlock Hero points (the currency that allows you to have a larger roster). I've yet to spend a dime, but it is clear the developers are definitely whale hunters. So, enjoy it until the grind starts to hurt. "

												Publishers continue to punish steam users by offering free in-game currency to users on mobile platform only.  I don't see how this isn't a violation of their contract with Steam.  Since a large portion of this game is competitive with players on those other platforms, I cannot recommend this game any longer.  Note my HUGE number of hours.			"

												This game is really fun when you first start playing it.  As you build your roster, you start to realize the only way to be competetive is to spend money.  This seems to be the game developers intention, as it has increasingly been focused on increasing their revenue rather than keeping and/or expanding their player base.  To illustrate my point just check out the DLC.  $100.47 for a supposedly free to play game.			"

												While I still play this game, and (kind of) enjoy it, I cannot recommend it at this point.  The degree to which the developer ignores their players is crazy.  Cheating is rampant and destroying the reward structure of the game. Cheaters are regularly reported, but action is extremely slow to come, if it ever does. (Literally months between initial reports of a player/alliance cheating and any action.)  Additionally, the developer doesn't seem to play test characters or changes to characters, or changes to the structures of their events, before implementing them.  It's like they don't really know what they want to do with the game, so just do things.  The game keeps getting imbalanced in new and frustrating ways.  I've spent around $40 on this free-to-play game, but likely won't spend another dime unless the developer makes substantial improvements in how they treat their players.  (IE- don't make it a cash grab, actually respect your customers.)			"

												Possibly one of the most brutal micro-transaction games I've ever encountered. Hero points are the real money to game currency that is required for everything from character space, leveling up your powers, entry into some game events, character boosts for individual battles, and having a better chance at new characters above a one star rating. Core game is great if you enjoyed Puzzle Quests games in the past. Enjoyment of the core game, however, will not overcome how terrible the dev team is for this game. In addition to microtransaction hell, content is frequently untested/broken. Characters are nerfed without warning and are almost never buffed. No refunds are given to your Hero Points/Iso-8 costs. You must sell them at a 50% loss or deal with it.   New content buffs NPCs to over level 200 which makes taking them down near impossible without purchasing major boosts to up your team's damage and action points.  I will also note that most of your team fully maxed out will have a level cap significantly under 200 unless you're willing to splurge tons of real cash on acquiring four star characters. Their dev teams also publically taunt their players and customers in their forums. Not in a reasonable and fun way (ie. Cloaker quotes in Payday 2) but rather telling players to go ahead and rate their game negatively and spread poor word of mouth. Signed, sealed and accepted mother ♥♥♥♥ers!			"

												The Game was great when it first started even after a year or so. It proved to be very friendly to new players and experienced players alike. They added new stuff along the way with loads of events to keep ya in the game including ones for the newbies so they can have a chance to win big as well. It was once a most brilliant game which encouraged you to play more and also gave ya plenty room to encourage you to purchase some roster slots aside from getting plenty of free ones through missions or getting lucky at that gold draw or even towards your allliance slots for new members untill they started changing things...alot of things. first started with just a no health gain which started quite a bit of commotion and also drastically decreased the amount of time people put into the game from hours to mere minutes decreasing its overall popularity. It seemed like a small thing being nothing big was changed after that cept new heroes with downgraded abilities of their older selves that were far weaker. Apparently they didn't stop there to roll in the cash and decrease amount of players and customers to their list. They took it much farther and it gets worse with each update they make. They then started taking away heroes abilities then went along to replacing them with weaker and less effective abilities including replacing alot of other heroes abilities that did quite well, but not over powered, to something entirely new that did little to nothing now. After all the excessive deep changes were made they caused alot of players to play less or even quit. They then decided in order to hopefully lure more people back or new ones into the game they released Deadpool and a huge event that gave ya a chance to enjoy Deadpool and get one of your own which kinda worked for a time but didn't last for long. They downgraded alot of abilities some more on some heroes especially focusing on the starter ones which were strong enough to help new players along the way towards better ones. They keep compensating it with more chances at new heroes that they release from time to time but was it enough? Apparently not being now its hardly worth working towards when most can't afford to keep in the game long enough to get them unless you pay your heart out for the luck at the draw which is rare you get anything different or better unless its towards the better draws which cost round $40-$50+ to get a slightly better chance which has proven to make little difference which even the normal draws are quite pricey if you don't get free ones from every day rewards. Sadly the game was reduced to nothing but rubble and another facebook game as most referr to it now as and even now stands little to impress new and old players to try or continue playing much or at all. If your looking for a good experience look the other way cuz this game has long lost it and the magic it brought to games that made it wildly popular when it started making itself more at home. The game no longer revolves around skill but more along of power, money, and luck and has no tactics that works like it used to so sad to say I conclude this thorough review saying that I would no longer reccomend this game to anyone unless they insisted on something to kill just a little of their time.

												A lot of people say this game is Pay to Win, but it's a bit misleading. Sure, if you're willing to drop trucktons of money into the game, you'll get access to stuff a lot faster than you would normally, but that holds true for nearly every single free to play game. I personally don't consider this a Pay to Win game.  I'm writing this review to shed some light on this. To do so, I'll go into some further depth of how the resources and the game works. Beware, as there will be a lot of things I touch upon here. I'll leave a short summary at the bottom.You have two main resources in this game - ISO-8 and Hero Points.   ISO-8 is primarily used to level up your characters and can be obtained easily and reguilarily, sometimes in very large quantities. Think of it as your common resource, you'll always need more and it is also the most available.Hero Points are much less common. Hero Points are used for a number of things, and could be compared to a premium resource, if you will. It is used to increase the maximum amount of characters you can have at any given time aswell as purchasing new characters and their powers. Hero Points can also be used to purchase additional Health Packs and to Shield yourself in PvP Events (more on both later).  It is available in limited supply from story missions - often enough to get you started - but the main source of Hero Points tend to be from the events that happen regularily. Events work similiar to the main storyline missions and the main PvP, except they have a set time limit. After the time is up for any event, you will receive rewards based on your placements in the rankings - Rewards consist of a combination of specific Covers (unlocks characters or upgrades their powers), Booster packs (contains random Covers), Hero Points and ISO-8. Apart from the rewards you get for your ranking, there are also progression rewards in most events that reward you at set intervals with ISO-8, Hero Points, Covers or Boosters.Next I'll go into health packs. Normally as your characters take damage in battle, they will slowly regenerate that health back (real-time) when they are not in battle. If a character is downed (in-game definition of a character running out of health) in battle, they also need a certain amount of time to recover from that on top of the time to regenerate their health. However, you can use Health Packs to instantly revive and fully heal any character. Health Packs naturally regenerate up to a stock of 5, but you can purchase additional health packs for Hero Points. You are also relatively regularily awarded Health Packs from missions, daily rewards and progression rewards.Next up we have Shields. Normally in PvP Events, you lose/gain points in the event whenever you are attacked by another player. Shields can be purchased with Hero Points to protect you from point loss due to other players attacking you for a limited time - I do not know if it also disables points gains from defensive victories. Attacking any player while a shield is active will prematurely end the effect.Last but not least are combat boosts. These are regularily and randomly dropped after any kind of combat, as mission drops aswell as progression rewards and come in different flavors. They are generally simple, providing small bonuses to specific areas - more damage or starting AP for powers (AP is generated by matching colored tiles), though there are much larger bonuses available that are far more rare (+150% damage vs specific kinds of enemies). You can purchase more of these bonuses for ISO-8 (and possibly Hero Points, I do not know since I haven't used any rare boosts).  Personally I very rarely use boosts, I have only been using a few in some of the more difficult PvE battles, and they are by no means necessary to stay competetive.Covers are generally what you are ultimately after. They unlock the character in question when you obtain your first one and either unlocks or increases levels of their powers with further ones. They come in four rarities shown by stars, from 1-star covers to 4-star covers. They are obtained regularily, most commonly from Boosters which in turned are awarded as mission rewards, progress rewards, event prizes and a few other sources. Your covers determine the strength of your characters' powers, but most importantly determine the maximum level you can level your character up to. The maximum level possible for a character is based on their rarity and actually leveling up characters uses ISO-8.  Boosters will give you a random cover, with a minimum rarity based on what kind of booster it is. There are two generic boosters that can give you pretty much any character in the game, but there are regularily ""specialized"" boosters available during events that contain one cover randomly chosen from a specific poll of characters, usually characters involved or powered up during the event. You can also purchase additional boosters in the in-game store for ISO-8 (only the basic booster) or Hero Points.  Events prizes and progress rewards will often grant you specific character covers. Event prizes tend to be covers ranging from 2- to 4-star covers, depending on your final rank (along with Hero Points and ISO-8), while progress rewards can reward you with anything from 1- to 4-star covers  (though 4-star cover progression rewards are usually practically impossible to reach within the timeframe of an event).In short, these resources are all either awarded regularily no matter what area of the game you play (Health Packs, Boosts and ISO-8) or regularily as rewards in event prizes and progression (Hero Points, ISO-8, Covers, Boosts and Boosters). The only exceptions are Shields, but they are not much of a resource to begin with.I have spent a lot of time on this game, and while I have paid some money to get more Hero Points (I regularily support Free to Play games that I like), I spent most of it up until now playing for free. From my own experience I can honestly tell you that you can easily stay competetive in the event rankings as a free player, provided you know what you're doing and are willing to sink some time into that particular event. Even with little effort you can generally get a decent ranking (enough for a 2-star cover, a 2-star booster) aswell as a reasonable amount of progression rewards. You never *need* Shields in PvP events to get a good placement, it just makes it easier.  You'll gradually get stronger as you play. At first you'll be using mainly 1-star covers, and as you gradually unlock 2-star covers you'll be switching over to mainly using them. In time you'll have enough 3-star covers to get them up to the level they need to be in order to be useful. 4-star covers are far more rare and are generally reserved as first place prizes for events and can also very rarely be obtained from boosters (I have one cover for each of the two existing 4-star characters, both obtained through boosters), but they shouldn't be your immediate goal to begin with. SummaryIn short, the bottom line is that this is a progression game where you'll gradually unlock new characters and level them up to be even stronger. Nothing a paying player can accomplish is unaccomplishable by any free player, a paying player can just get there faster and/or easier, which from my experience describes nearly all free to play games currently out there. I can say this though, it is a LONG progression you walk. You cannot expect to take the top spots in event rankings when you're fresh into the game, but eventually you'll be competing with the best.Finally, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. There is no doubt in my mind that this game will not appeal to most people, but if you seem to enjoy the premise of this game after giving it a try and can imagine spending a lot of time in it, it can be very enjoyable. Simply, I would very much recommend this game to the right people.			"

												Match 3, Marvel, but.... Microtransactions.The game's mechanics of a match-3 to initiate fights is far from new anymore - but its complicated by the need to ""heal"" injured combatants either by waiting or buying health packs.That's the first clue. The next is leveling up the characters. You do gain some of the upgrade materials and items from missions, certain ones earned at certain stages - but to make your team strong you need to further upgrade the skills, then upgrade the character, and repeat. There is a relative cap, but the distance from what the free to play model gives you and the time it would take to get there is absurd compared to just paying for it. It scales up the higher you go. Pay for more to get less and so on.Hence the microtransactions. Lots and lots of microtransactions.I wouldn't have an issue if it was possible to gain a decent team of your favorite heroes easily, just to enjoy the story, or possible to upgrade them relatively well without spending a fortune... but this game takes it to a whole new level.Be wary, this is a Pay to Win game, and boy you could pay in spades with the level of microtransactions here.Players beware. The lure to pay to win here is way too much for it to be worth it.Other than that, its a standard Marvel-oriented game following the mainstream stories on their own minor twist with the ISO-8 junk I first saw years ago with the Facebook varaint. The story is alright, the game itself is okay. The over-abundance of microtransactions to make you pay a fortune is not really making this game worth it.			"

												<<< Matching colors addict - Updated as of May 15, 2016 - Some new and cool changes in the last few months! (read near the bottom of the review for info on them)If you have been reading negative reviews in regards to P2W (pay 2 win) then they are biased. This game is free but real fans will spend money on it because they want to collect as many characters as they can and level them up fully. If you don't put effort into this game then you won't get too far and you will be discouraged. It takes patience and time to get anywhere. For fans and people who enjoy this type of build up with RPG elements this game is great! It gives you something to check everyday and play for a short while. Any fan of the Marvel Universe should get this game, especially since it is free. Players who pay will have an advantage in the sense that they can level up their character cards faster and buy more slots to recruit new characters, but once you get a bit further you can compete in daily competitions/leaderboards to win new characters and powers, crystals for levelling and gold coins for buying new character cards and extra slots. pros - A good chillin game, just need a mouse       - Made for fans of Marvel (obviously) and matching puzzle games with RPG elements       - Lots of super heroes and villians to collect ranging from one star* to four stars**** and now      with the new update new five star***** characters are available that can be levelled up to 450!       - A lot of strategy is required if you want to win difficult matches against higher level enemies.       - Collectable/usable power-ups and character power cards (usable once in a battle)!       - You can join or create an alliance and there are competition and leaderboards for your crew to compete in for prizes like new character cards, coins, crystal and 2-3 star cards from either the vault which is a random card generator that you stop yourself or a hero card that gives u a random 2-4 star character.       - Light on the PC       - Developers are active always updating the game, adding new characters periodically and creating new competitions and battles daily. cons - Addictive         - If you are color blind you might want to avoid this game        - Random character card received when purchasing new cards        - You will get many doubles which you can sell...but it can get annoying. Back to pros - UPDATE! - You can now max out your character level and pay an extra amount of crystal to make the maxed out character a legend. This allows you to use extra cards (that before would be useless and sold for crystal) to continue leveling up your character. One level per character card. Every level gives you a reward as well. like Command points, crystals, other character cards and coins.                - Command points are used to obtain **** 4 and ***** 5 star character cards. 20 for classic and 25 for modern. These command points are also used for upgrading characters if one can never find the one card they need for one of their characters.Overall score: 8.0/10Chance of becoming an addict (playing it daily) score: 7.0/10			"

												I'm going to start by saying I rarely write reviews but this game has such a bad rep due to people not really taking the time to play the game before posting a negative response. I wanted to try and fix this. If you look at the reviews for this game you will see hundreds of people saying ""pay to win; don't play."" This is what angers me, the game is actually pretty generous to free players. These bogus reviews are from people who launch the game, see the possibility for microtransactions, and post a bad review purely on that.I've been playing this game since its steam release and have never spent a cent. My first two days playing I was able to place in the top ten of a pvp event. Since then I've competed in many events and have never come away without atleast one 3-star or better.I was also able to complete the story within 2 week of downloading the game. It is true that the story rewards and pvp rewards are rather limited, but the amazing rewards for events make up for them.Also for those who thought about the ""pay to win strategy,"" you are wasting your money. It's HARD to get a significant advantage from paying! The amount of money each upgrade costs would require hundreds of dollars to be spent to make a significant difference. About $10 to level up a skill even though you can get the cover to do so by doing events for free.In summary the microtransaction option makes the game daunting to free to play people but if you are willing to put just a little time into the game(2-4 hours a day), you can do better than most paying players within a week. So please take it from someone who plays a lot of free to play games and has never spent a cent on any of them, this is one of the most generous free games you will ever find. Try it before you complain about microtransactions.Update: Marvel Puzzle Quest has changed a lot since I wrote this review. Mostly for the worse. While I do still enjoy playing the game it is largely because I already had a decent force before a lot of the changes were made. The company repeatedly ignores their fan base and makes changes that make the game increasingly hard to play without paying and really expensive if you do pay. I'm going to list the notable changes since this review was originally posted.The Good:1. The ever increasing roster size keeps collecting covers interesting and gives reason to come back to the game.2. PvP seasons: The company recently introduced PvP seasons. These are month long event that keep track of players as they partake in PvP events. The top rated players get fantastic rewards.The Bad:1. Shields: In Marvel Puzzle Quest PvP events run on a points system. At first glance it is simple and  fair. In fact it used to be fair but shields have all but ruined the accessability. For every round you win you gain points. If you lose a round you lose points. This is fine. Being that PvP is actually Player vs. AI player people must be able to challenge computer versions of other players. When a computer version of yourself wins or loses you also gain/lose points according. This has always been annoying but for the most part fair. However, shields allow a player to spend a decent sum of money in order to protect themselves from point loss. In otherwords free players quickly lose points from their AI losing but they can't make those who pay lose any points. This makes it very hard for free players especially when first starting off.2.Gold Characters: Gold characters are enhanced versions of other characters. This essentially means the developers got lazy and wanted to release a new character but didn't feel like designing new character powers. While that alone is annoying it is tolerable. What isn't tolerable is taking a character and nerfing him because he is ""overpowered"" and then release a stronger version of the character right after. For anyone who joined late and doesn't know this is exactly what they did with Thor.3. Boost Changes: Boosts were an easy way to allow free players to stand a fighting chance. A player could buy boosts with Iso(in game currency) in order to assist a strategy using what are otherwise weak characters. However, boosts have changed so that in order to buy the useful ones you must spend hero points(premium currency).4. Healing Changes: In Marvel Puzzle Quest you have always needed to wait for your characters to heal after battle. How long you have to wait varies depending on character level. You have also always been able to pay in order to heal instantly. While this has always given paying members an advantage, it wasn't outrageous because within a couple hours your characters would heal. However, the company has recently made it take longer for heroes to heal making the game even harder to play for free.The Ugly:1. Pay to Enter Tournaments: These are occasional tournaments that have an entry fee. The prizes to be won in said tournaments are outstanding. The winner gets one of every cover in the game. While I like the idea of large tournaments that have a little risk to them I don't like how these particular tournaments are set up. I'm fine with an entry fee but the fee should be in iso. I personally think there should be an entry fee somewhere along the lines of 5000-10000 iso. This is a decent amount of currency so there is a big risk for the players but it is entirely in-game currency so it is accessable to everyone if they are willing to save up for a while. Unfortunately the tournament entry fee is in hero points, so it once again favors those who pay fairly significantly.2. Alliances: Alliances, are this games version of a clan. All events have alliance rankings in addition to individual rankings. All members of the top ranked alliances get prizes. Alliances had the potential to be a great addition to the game. having a community to play with and talk to as well as getting additional prizes for doing so is fantastic. Where the game went wrong is in Alliance sizes. An Alliance starts with 5 player slots. However, the alliance leader has the option to buy additional slots up to 20. Of course to buy these slots you have to spend Hero points. So only the alliances who pay ever win events because they have a larger player base. Adding an additional slot to a guild isn't cheap either; additional slot cost as much expanding you roster size post 20 heroes.So would I recommend this game now? Maybe, it is really hard to say at this moment due to the fact that I started out so early. I do believe it is possible to do decently well while being a free player but I am rather biased because I already had a large army. Furthermore, at the rate which D3/Demiurge are ruining the game within a month it will likely be totally inaccessable to any new free players and possibly even veteran free players.			"

												Ok so Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign. A somewhat port from a IOS game. And it is notable. Few options, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ UI, some bad graphics and animations. Lacking even the basic options, like turning off combat animations. Which can become extremely repetetive after a short time, due to the fact that each hero can have a max of 3 skills. The gameplay combine the Puzzle Quest series with Marvel universe.  If you are a fan of the puzzle quest series or marvel universe, its worth giving a shot. The free to play model they use in this game is really weird and somewhat counterproductive. The worst part being that your heroes does not heal instantly after a match. Instead they heal over time. Having a lvl 50 Iron Mand die ---> wait 3hours.I guess the idea is to have people buy health packs to resurrect/heal the heroes. Summary+ addictive gameplay+ licensed superheroes from Marvel Universe+ loads of weekly/daily/hourly tournaments where you compete with other peoples heroes for prizes+ long and challenging campaign+ dont have to invest any money to be able to do well ingame- Bad UI, graphics, animation- Alot of our favourite Marvel superheroes is not in the game- Impending shadow of a poor free to play model- Weird gamechoices regarding leveling of powers, herolevel and healing- Bad AI (will use skills whenever they have enough resources, even tho it only hurts them)I still recommend the game to fans of puzzlequestish games, and fans of marvel. Game is very timeconsuming and I would totally play it on an IOS while taking a ♥♥♥♥. Just dont expect anything more.			"

												Steam says I have more than 2000 hours in the game, but the truth is it is mostly running on the background. I'd say 500 hours is much closer to reality. Here is what you need to know about the game. It is a 3vs3 match where you bring a team of heroes/villains and try to win by making use of their abilities. You use them by spending the required resources (AP) which you get when you match tiles. The characters are divided in 4 tiers (1* - 4*) with only the 3* and very few of the 2* being useful at the moment. Most characters have 3 abilities, but there are some with only 2 because the developers have left them incomplete for months. The abilities can gain levels by buying or winning covers. The stats of the characters and the effectiveness of their abilities are increased as you level them with the use of ISO-8, an in-game currency used solely for leveling characters and buying boosts you can use in matches. The second currency is called HP (Hero Points) and is used to increase the size of your roster and to level abilities without the use of covers.The good: Fast game / doesn't require too much thinking which makes it ideal for short gaming bursts / you get to use your favorite heroes / very simple rules.The bad: Several incomplete characters with no plan to finish them in the near future / a turn from F2P to P2P since March 2014 / Inconvenient event end times for Europeans / success depends heavily on playing close the end of an event / several exploits are reported which allow cheaters to roam free in the game / market prices for in-game currency are the worst I have seen in a game.Advices:1. Use HP only to buy roster slots. At least until you have 30-35 slots. Never buy tokens (they give random covers). The % to get a specific 3* hero is less than 1% in most cases. You have better results if you level the abilities directly with HP. 2. Never use ISO-8 to buy 1* tokens. You will need it to level your heroes and it will always, ALWAYS be in short supply.3. Always take part in Lightning Rounds since they are the most efficient source of ISO. Try to get to 100 points. 4. Don't max a 3* hero unless you have a diverse roster with at least 3-4 more heroes with levels 85+. When you do, the levels of the teams you fight will also increase a lot.Epilogue: I will not tell how to spend your money, but you have to know that the game has made a turn into a more P2P model after March 2014. The changes in late June change how healing works in the game and restricts your ability to play since there is practically no way to heal heroes unless they have an innate regeneration ability. Heroes heal over time, but with most of them taking 2-4 hours to fully heal. healing packs are your only alternative and they cost HP which is relatively rare. The market prices are ridiculously unreasonable. To fully level a 3* hero you will need ~170k ISO which costs ~$300. The game is quite addictive so be warned. I would advice against letting young children play with it. I bet they can find better things to do and you should encourage them to spend their time doing something more creative. So do I recommend this game? After the changes in the last 2-3 months, I do not.			"

												Game is entertaining, although it keeps you hooked with the idea that you will eventually get to use new and cool super heroes.  Although its possible to unlock new heroes, in order to get the ones you want and be capable of leveling up, you either need a lot of time or to simply pay money.			"

												Moderately fun premise for a puzzle game to tie-in popular and well-loved characters and stories but it quickly becomes a transparent pay-to-win. If that is your bag, I'm sure you'll enjoy Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign but it was tedious at best for myself.			"

												This is a clever variation on match 3 puzzle games; you control a team of characters, and you beat up the other team by making matches. Each character does different amounts of damage from different colors, and every character has three unique abilities which mesh to create the gameplay.The problem is that this is a free to play game, and it is one of those free to play games which is constructed entirely around exploiting the darkest parts of the human psyche. It is all about addiction, trying to get you to keep playing to keep getting more slots for your heroes, and it is just a tremendously addictive exerience as you're always short of having enough slots for all your characters - and if you don't put your characters into a slot, you lose them.This is designed to compel you to keep playing, and manipulate you into playing far more than the game actually warrants.The core gameplay is decent enough, but if you have any addictive tendencies at all, this game will chew you up and spit you out.

												Potentially a very fun game, hampered only by the fact that the monetization method basically requires you to stop playing rather frequently if you'd rather not give them money. I'd be happy to pay a flat fee for this game up front and play it at my own pace; as it is, I'm disinclined to give them any money because they are basically holding their own game hostage.			"

												Update 11/11/16:  Yep, still negative. If you like games you can play in small bits and want an active player community, this delivers both. If you don't mind massive amounts of time and moeny being burned to progress, you'll do well.BUT if you insist on playing, DON'T play it on Steam. Play it on iOS or Android. The devs continue to offer better rewards to mobile players via in-game advertising and Facebook integration. They say Steam API will not support these features .... and offer NO compensation. If you play on Steam you will be one of a small minority, competing against an ocean of better-compensated mobile players.That's this year's disaster. See below for last year's ""high"" point.______________________Short version: Stay away.Longer version:Gameplay is fun but very, very shallow. Content, in the form of characters to burn resources chasing, is continually expanding, while new story content or gameplay expansion remian few and far between. It's extremely repetitive and grindy.This game launched in an anemic and hilariously unbalanced form, and has come a long way in 2 years. It's growing and being proted to consoles. Great.It does still have a fun tightknit community that can be accessed via the dev's forum. That's the best thing about the game, the other people playing it, not the game itself. Hmmm.It is probably the prettiest match-3 game around .... that isn't saying much. The game mechanics, after 2 years of bolt-ons, are held together by baling wire. Unintended results abound and are discovered the hard way by players.Play it casually for awhile and then move on. God help you if you allow it to become a habit. (See those hours logged? There but for the grace of the gods go you.)The worst is the dev's inept attempts at communication. Spectacularly bad. Here is a great example ... This week is the game's 2-year anniversary. It centers on a new event, a battle against Galactus. The blance of the event is laughably out of whack; the ONLY way to win is to make use of exploits (which the inept developer failed to catch ...). Other events running concurrently are suffering from various bugs, and the anniversary rewards have been found to be WORSE than the normal in-game rewards (Happy anniversary!)After the event runs for a day, and the online community is thoroughly hacked off, the producer posts the below. Judge it for yourself._____________________Hey all,Wanted to share a few things about how Galactus works and what we're expecting versus what we're seeing.To start, it seems like a lot of people are on a basic disconnect here, looking at the boss battle similar to how Ultron ran in terms of how things work. Meaning that Ultron should be going down pretty regularly. He's powerful, but his real power lies in the fact that killing his body doesn't stop him. You need to crush every one of his drones and main bodies to win. So winning rounds is a pretty regular occurrence. Game-wise, what this means is that players won fairly easily against Ultron and took their lumps against the drones. The stopping timer there was health packs based on when the drones finally wore you down. What this also meant is that the higher end Alliances would chew through the entire Event in about 12 hours and let it kinda sit for 3 days.Galactus is different. The ""minion"" fights against the villains are relatively simple. They're there as minor hazards but relatively easily winnable. Galactus on the other hand is a massive threat. He's not going to be stopped by gnats. Iron Fist punching him in the toe isn't very painful. So he gets bored and swats them away. In game terms, this means that players are going to be beaten. Winning a round against Galactus is an achievement. You're supposed to lose. Every time you do, you're still chipping away at his life. It's an exercise in damage in aggregate. Over the 3.5 days, hitting him over and over to finally bring down the big bad is somewhat slow, but certainly effective.Overall, most of the higher end Alliances are in Round 6 or knocking on the door to Round 7. Which is actually slightly faster than we were expecting people to get just based on the math. So everyone's doing pretty darned well in terms of progression. There are some teams rockin' the Winfinite, other teams that are pushing through with some interesting strategies (who woulda thought OBW would be a rock star against Galactus?). Not many Alliances are getting anywhere near full clears. Which is actually intended. You're supposed to lose your Health Packs on Galactus, rather than against the minions like on Ultron. It's also why we changed up the play method for this round too so that it's not just a flip flop between Ultron and minions till you win. There's a set number of times you can hit Galactus before you need to take a break to let minions refresh. That break means that you have plenty of times for Galactus drained Packs to refresh while you can go in and get some Black Vortex in. Or play Simulator (up soon). Or get your Devil Dino on when that starts up. It's a different design than the rush of Ultron where that was pretty much all players did while it was open.Long story short, you all are doing really well against Galactus. Yes, the gameplay is different. I'm sure most of you aren't used to going into a battle with the idea that you may well lose. But given that you're still pulling out wins with pretty strong regularity, I don't see any reason this wouldn't continue into Rounds 7 and 8, and on to Cyclops awesomeness.At the outset, going into the boss battle, you're looking at winning like normal. After all, it works elsewhere in the game, and it worked against Ultron. So suddenly getting rocked by Galactus is a shock. Keep at it. If things are really going to go poorly, we'll look at doing refresh timer changes and the like that we can do server-side as a quicker band aid style fix for run 1. After that, we'll figure out what we want to do for difficulty on run 2 (and any other runs that we do in the future, of course).			"

												Can't recommend the game anymore after recent changes.  What was a genuinely fun game has been ruined by changes that scream of greed on the part of the developer.  Because healing spells only last for the current battle, I can now only play 2-3 rounds at a time (if I'm lucky) before I either have to pay real money or wait several hours for my team to heal themselves. Such a shame, as I was really starting to enjoy it, and was considering throwing some money into the game simply to show my appreciation.  Now that it's kinda being forced on me, I can't bring myself to do it, and have been playing much less.			"

No!A great and addicting game if you like puzzlequest style of match 3 and love the Marvel universe. Too bad the developpers of D3P try make you believe it is free to play. The most recent updates shift the gameplay strongly in favor of those who put in a lot of money, thus making it fairly impossible to compete for new characters. If you are willing to overlook this and are searching for a nice game to kill those few hours you don't want tot spent on 'real gaming', this still is a nice game to play. Too bad it is pay2win.

												How I played the game is I didn't like it in the first hour or so of play, but for my hetic lifestyle I found that I was able to come back to it again and again because I'm a huge fan of the puzzle quest series.It was the perfect game for me since I could do other things at the same time while playing the game.  Needless to say why I've put so much time into it (although about 100-200 hours I accidentally afked in the game.)However with the recent changes the game is more like a facebook game then an actual puzzle quest game.  It's just a poor game now.  It's become completely Pay 2 Win and if you want to play the game you need to do a bunch of BS and jump through hoops to play for longer then 30 minutes a day.  Due to this I can't recommend the game to anyone anymore.Before it was a nitch game that I'm sure some people could love (certainly not all) despite the setbacks it has, but now I'd say everyone should just walk away.  Do not touch this game with a 10 foot poll.			"

												I simply love this game and I think it gets undeserved reviews from many people saying you have to buy ingame money to achieve anything. That is not correct at all, it helps of course to buy some coins in the start, but you don`t have to since you will win ingame money by playing the game so you can open more slots for more heroes/villains. I have played this game for over 1 year now, almost every day, and I have used money on it as well, but I think it is worth to spend some money on a free game since that also encourage the developer to work more on the game, so I don`t have a problem spending money on a ""free"" game. As one other reviewer wrote, if you let the game make you become addicted, you will become addicted. This is so true, I really can`t go one day without playing it, but that is what makes a great game I think.But I also understand that this is not a game for everyone, you have to like these kind of puzzle games and you probably should also be a comic/marvel geek. Its great to learn a lot about the characters and you know who will be the new hero when a new hero film is in the horizon. For me this game is almost perfect so I give it 9/10.			"

												It's a pretty generic match-3 puzzle game, which I have no problem with - games like that can be (and often are) quite fun. The problem is that the entire game is clearly pay-to-win from the start and microtransactioned out the butt.Want to level up your hero? ...you can, eventually, if you get the right random drop... or you can pay to level them up. Your hero is injured? Well, you can go play something else for a few hours as you wait for him to eventually heal... or you can buy heals for any injured heroes. If you don't mind microtransactions... I still can't recommend it. There are plenty of games you could be spending your tiny bits of cash on that are way more fun than a simple match-3 game.			"

												Take your average match 3, put some extra 'Marvel Superhero' powers on jewels...some of them triggering on matches, some of them on particular actions. Also there are heroes' own charging/passive abilities with more powerful powers. You can somehow control who is attacking and who is blocking from your own heroes while playing. There are some different game modes including story mode (actually they are partial events from past story arcs of marvel universe...nothing new) and a meh pvp mode&pvp events (you are just facing another player's defensive team, not really facing another player, which is actually ok) Nothing enjoyable for an experienced player of the genre but still kinda addictive.Good game if you like Marvel universe and you just want to pass some time without paying your full attention.

												Game is waste of time since July's update that forces you to buy healthpacks. Don't look at ""free to play"". You MUST buy health packs with real money to stay online and score any meaningful rank now. What was advertised as ""roster diversty"" actually shrinked diverse combination of teams to pretty much two choices: two tanks that everybody would ignore because they take too much time or two heavy-hitters that will either destroy or severely damage your team, so you'll be afraid because you can no longer heal. Healers simply disappeared from any team serious about winning.Authors also enjoy political censure. Colossus initially had hammer and sickle as his symbol - in line with his lore, art and pretty much every other Marvel game, including desktop games. Yet it was quickly removed as some nazi-pride clown complained about it.If you're interested in lore, you also forced to play obsessively or pay up, because that's the only way you will have ""essential"" character - i.e. character required to even start some battles and witness their dialogue. Those are usually top tier prizes from previous event. If you missed your first chance - too bad to be you. Next time this event is run, nodes will probably will have another requirement and original character dialogue will be completely removed, which happened on 2nd Sentry event run, where all the dialogue showing Daken as obidient Osborn's guard dog in charge of internal security was edited out. Of course that's not the single edit over time of game.			"

												I literally can't think of another game with more hooks to try to get you to spend money than MPQ.There are *multiple tiers* of in game currency that you can pay for.If you want more characters (""covers""), you have to buy them. If you want to reliably upgrade the abilities of characters you do have, you have to purchase the upgrades. If you want to level up those characters without a crazy grind, you have to pay. If you want more character slots, you have to pay. If your characters take too much damage and you want to keep on playing, you have to pay for a heal. If you want to compete in PVP you have to pay for boosts.Sure, *some* of those things you can grind for, but the results are often unpredictable. For example instead of an upgrade to an existing character you might get a new character cover. But if you don't have enough character slots you have to buy more. You can try to grind for enough currency to unlock more slots (prices for new slots increase depending on how many you already have), but you have a time limit on your covers, so if you can't unlock a new slot fast enough, the new character you earned just disappears. This is a deliberate time pressure to try to get you to just buy the slot.You spend a bunch of time and currency investing in a character just to find out he has a level cap because he is a lower-tier character, and if you actually want to progress in the game you need higher tier characters. You can try and grind for the (exceedingly rare) chance to get a rare cover to drop, or you can spend money to get one as a sure thing. Again, the game is trying to pressure you into buying ♥♥♥♥.You can try to unlock more rewards by competing in PVP and PVE events, but as soon as you get anywhere near the top bracket you'll find it is impossible to progress and get the real rewards without paying money because the other people at the top are paying for heals and boosts so if you aren't doing the same you can't possibly compete with them, so even the ""free"" rewards are effectively locked behind a paywall.There is absolutely no skill involved in this game, it's all about how much money you are willing to spend. It's probably the most disgusting example of pay to win mechanics and ""gambling"" hooks in something purporting to be a video game I have ever seen.			"

												Just so everyone knows this is a f2p game. It may not be the best in the world of marvel games but it is fun as all get out.Is this game broken :yes .        is this game fair : somtimes . Is this game free to play : yes if you want to roll thay way IS THE GAME FUN AND ENTERTAINING ; DAMN RIGHT IT IS . and last but not least the developers are always trying to make the game better .Remember it was only going to be a match 3 game and it took off like wildfire they wernt ready for that and when they catch up look out this will be the best match 3 game there is.The mechanics of the game are awesome with each hero having different powers and passive skills. there is a wide range of people even though the villians are few. All in all a great F2P game as long as you don't get caught up in the politics on the forum and line chat.			"

												A boring story targeted to people who know the Marvel lore by heart (who usually aren't in the match-3 demo), and yet treating them like idiots with its pathetic writing (unless it was intended). This is usually solved by having great gameplay. Which isn't the case here. Not only is this entry clearly inferior to the other (not exactly great either) games in the PQ series, but it's also badly implemented. My PC runs The Witcher 3 at 60 fps, but can barely handle 30 fps of these bad 2D graphics. And the 'Tap to continue' prompt clearly shows it's a mobile game that was ported without an after-thought.The only good thing in here is the character model sheets. I'm sure you can download them off some dedicated wiki, I'm pretty sure, so who cares.Don't get me wrong, I like the Marvel universe, especially its TV shows, but I have no idea WHO this game is for. Certainly not for me.			"

												As someone who has played the game for a lot more te they should have, I highly recommend against this game. I'm a huge Marvel nerd. I play Avengers Alliance, Heroes, and Future fight. So why a I against this one? It's addictive, but not in a good. It isn't a game which is quite fun. It is a game which quickly turns into a job, of you trying to earn specific characters. The problem, is you can only get these characters by sheer luck, and that fact that they reworked both methods of recruiting them to be less enjoyable is even worse. I ultimately decided to abandoned the game.			"

I hate ""free-to-play"" games that are impossible to actually finish for free.  A good free-to-play should be beatable for free, but beatable faster with boosts purchased with microtransactions.... or microtransaction purchases are just for avatar purposes to help you have a more unique look.Bottom Line: unless you want to spend money to actually be able to play all the way through, don't bother.

												Gameplay is OK.  The fact that it takes over 1 hour to heal over 1000hp is garbage, though.  If you want to heal your team, run the Venom ""Kidnapping""; take a bunch of blues then stunlock Venom, healing at the end before finishing him.  Do this for every 2 characters.Anyway.  So you can pay to heal.  You can pay to level up.  You can pay to level your skills up.  You have to pay to expand your roster.  You [essentially] have to pay if you don't want to run the Venom level after every game.  You have to pay if you want to level up.  You have to pay if you don't want Iron Man, Black Widow, Storm, and the BrownEye (I jest.  Hawkeye.  But he's just horrible in this game.)The grind isn't all that fun.  The dialogue is okay if you only have to see it once or twice, but it's terribad to see the same thing every other battle.  Levelling up isn't even that exciting.  You get a bit more damage.  Some HP.  Levelling up your skills isn't very rewarding or game-changing.I encourage you to check out this game for maybe 3 hours.  At which time you'll start grinding and be rewarded with nothing.  Uninstall, write a review, then move on.			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest easily recommended to anyone who enjoys the match 3 genre or simply wants a good 'zen' game.  The gameplay mechanics are fantastic and the game itself has taken HUGE strides to become more and more free to play friendly over time. Anyone who gets invested in this game might be surprised to learn that it has a healthy and welcome community attached to it through the forums and primarily through the LINE app.  This interaction with other players turns MPQ into more than just a game I pick up and play on occasion. As an extremely hardcore player of Marvel Puzzle Quest I can easily see a lot of the games flaws as they pertain to character balance issues, reliance on lucky cover draws, the feeling that your roster improves and yet you continually face more challenging content rather that 'get ahead', becoming overwhelmed by characters but not enough room to keep them all, and the fact that competitive play demands far too much time from the player.   Those negatives aside the game at it's core is still fantastic to play and well worth recommending. A solid 8/10 experience that can easily hook you if you let it.			"

												Downloading the Steam version, previously I've only played the Android version.The game is a good time-sink. For those calling it pay-to-win; certainly you can buy most of the meaningful resources in the game, but you're not getting good value for your money, and you're kind of missing the point of the game.  $10 will save you, eh, maybe 5 hours of in-game effort, and because of the way the game groups people for the in-game competition, you don't get any actual advantage; you have better characters, but so does the group you're competing with.Which does imply something of the issue: The whole game is a Red Queen's Race.  Enemies level up with your strongest three characters (as best as I can tell), so ""Easy"" missions will always be easy, and ""Difficult"" missions will always be difficult.  The RPG elements are mostly an illusion; mostly, because characters are separated out by their ""Star"" power, and each star-level has a power cap.  So once you develop a two-star roster, your one-star characters stop being useful (mostly); after you get a three-star roster, your two-star roster is less useful, and your one-star roster becomes, outside very specific situations, completely worthless.  If you're spending money to advance your characters, you're wasting your money.Because the point of the game isn't to ""win"" - there is no winning.  It's a time sink, and a well-designed one; you'll be tempted to spend money every now and then to increase the size of your roster (which can be done without spending money, but more slowly and deliberately), to avoid having to make a painful choice between selling a new powerful character, or selling an old favorite character to make room.  If opportunity cost is painful for you, you probably shouldn't play this game; you'll be spending a lot of money.  (Disclosure: I've personally spent $20.  Not because I couldn't not, but because I like the game and like supporting developers.)If, on the other hand, you're accustomed to trade-offs, this game could be a very satisfying way of spending free time.

Cons outweigh pros by FARToo many things about this game make it painfully frustrating and totally not worth playing.The worst thing is how often I'm forced to sit back and watch uncountable cascades or other nonsense because the tile drops are not random. The algorithm they use not only identifies the chosen characters in order to set tiles on the board but also identifies how many of which tiles are on the board before selecting which tiles to drop after a match. Watching which tiles drop a few times lets you quickly begin to predict which tiles are likely to drop next. Being able to predict should help your strategies but, as you quickly learn, it does not.Equivalently to this problem, you are forced to play on the developers terms:You must endlessly grind the same match to get 1/4 rewards.You must begin a fight just to view inventory of boosts AND you must manually de-select the boosts from a previous fight.When you gain hero tokens you must decide whether to open the token (for an incredibly rare chance to gain something you actually want) or keep the unopened token indefinitely. Once you open the token you must then choose whether to sell the hero for ISO, swap the hero for another hero already on your roster (if you don't have enough Hero Points to open a slot for them), or let the hero expire and receive nothing.On mobile devices, you're forced to endure 100+MB updates every other week. Which brings up another crucial point: almost every update adds a new character. Pretty cool, right? Keeps things dynamic by adding fresh meat. Well, aside from EVERY update causing new bugs (oh, crashes cause an infuriating problem I'll get to next), at the beginning, the first 4 slots to add new characters to your roster are free. However, as you keep adding characters, the cost of the slots keep going up. Here's what they cost after the first 4:  Roster Slot Hero Pts   5 25   10 200   24 300   29 400   37 500   45 600   53 700   61 800   69 900   77+ 1000 It's like the devs punish you for collecting a full roster. How does this make any sense? Meanwhile, if you're enough of a sucker to throw hundreds of dollars at these developers, you must still be able to work ... uhh play(?) on the game's schedule just to compete with anyone for the rewards you want... but if you've got that kind of time & money to throw at one single fremium game, what rewards do you need that you couldn't buy outright? Oh, that's right--you can't. There are only 2 things you can definitively buy (which are both outrageously priced): ISO and Hero Points. Game Crashes: Many poorly programmed games are prone to crashes and this one is no exception but D3 adds some twists to this back-alley gut-stabbing. The game may randomly crash while you are in the middle of a match and that's not the worst part. When the crash occurs, the game treats your sudden exit as if you have chosen to retreat which damages your team! Forget that retreat damage is asinine to begin with but now devs add 'injury' to insult by doing nothing about game crash damage. Want to re-initiate the game and try to replay the match with your ideally chosen team? Tough luck! They're either dead or half dead!There is a whole other side of this 'game' which allows players to 'fight' each other (you only play against A.I. on any part of the game) that I won't go into. I've played it only enough to realize how utterly futile it is. If you check out the D3Go forums you'll see the extent of frustration that people have for the multitude of flaws in 'versus' mode.Beyond all that, I see many people rate it high then say ""It's great BUT..."" or recommend it and say it's addicting as though being an addict is a good thing.If I could, I would only recommend this title to people I hate.

												Bottom line: Very slow and grindy from the get-go.Don't get me wrong I know exactly what I'm in for when I download something with the tag ""free to play"". I know that eventually I will come to point in the game where the progress slows down and I have to decide whether to commit my time or my money. I do not expect every f2p game to be PoE or DOTA2. But the thing that disappointed me with this game was how soon I got to that point.In my experience these sorts of free to play games, the good ones, tend to be pretty fast paced at first to get you hooked and learn the ropes. Then as the pace of progression gradually slows down you can start to really appreciate and understand what you can accomplish long term, either through play or through paying. But Marvel Puzzle quest sort of just gives you one semi-fast prologue chapter and then says ""now we grind"".I haven't even beaten the second prologue chapter yet and my best character (Iron-man) takes over an hour in real time to heal up to full health if he’s downed. The battles even against normal goons take a long time now. Even if the battle isn't hard they usually damage my heroes so much that I can't use them for a good while. And the reward for beating them are sometimes just these consumable boosts that do not progress your characters in any way which makes it feel like you won nothing for such a long battle.My most dominating thought is ""if it's this grindy in the prologue how bad will it be when I actually get to play the main PVE/PVP modes?"" I don't know, maybe it's admirable how upfront this game is about what it is (i.e. a typical f2p game) but it's a huge turnoff for me and I guess for others as well.I see the potential in this game, it has some pretty cool ideas and the Puzzle Quest match 3 battles are fun, but it got grindy way to fast. I enjoyed the previous puzzle quest games and hoped this could become my new ""play a quick session every once in a while game"". But it gives such a bad early impression that I’m pretty much done with the game, which is a shame honestly.			"

												I wouldn't recommend paying money for ANY puzzle quest game that involves leveling up characters. Especially when the gameplay itself is still on shaky grounds while requiring more updates and revisions than an Iron Man armor model.With that said... it's a match-3 puzzle game. What's not addicting about it? However, it is my opinion that when Demiurge begins tweaking this game, a lot of what made this game casual starts to fall apart. This is to waste time and have fun / Not to either grind or pay to win. SAVE YOUR MONEY for another game and just enjoy the Free to Play version and don't expect a lot from this game or its devs.			"

												Three months ago when I started this game, I loved playing it. I truly enjoy three-match puzzles and this also introduced me better to the Marvel universe. There are regular events with witty dialogue and the more I played, the more I felt rewarded.Then I had two characters leveled to 85 (the current max level at the time for Thor and Storm) and that's when hell was unleashed. Oh dear.Even though there is PVP in the game, you never play against an actual person. Instead their three characters are controlled by the computer. And since the computer is dreadful at this game, the only way the computer can win is by having victory magically handed to them. Every single day I see the exact same cheating tactics and that is what makes me angry about the gameplay. The opponents gets everything they need for their abilities magically apearing on the top row, they get deadly cascades of nodes dropping endlessly and I have seen them clear one row only to have it replaced completely with nodes of a color they need.I finally had enough of this game. I don't enjoy playing a game where victory is handed to the opponent, when there obviously was no nodes to ensure their victory when I ended my turn.2015 updateOne year after writing the review originally, I decided to see if things have changed for the better. Some things are better, while others have the exact problems as last year.Improvements- Many new heroes. Easier to collect some heroes that were concidered ""rare"" last time I was playing. - Updated abilities for older characters, making some of them better to use. - City nodes are replaced with team-up nodes. You have three team up cards (which can be given to you by your alliance and found randomly) that can be used with team up points. These are far better than the city nodes and have actually helped me win some games.- A daily quest which gives you a chance to get rare heroes or plenty of resources. Things that still are flawedOpponents still cheats horribly. Anytime I try to play anything that isn't 50 levels below me, the cheating AI will kill my team with no effort. They get cascades (nodes endlessly falling and matching), you move one node and they get a perfect 4 or 5 on their next turn and they color starve you, to force you to play ""bad"" while they get what they need through the toprow.Anytime you loose, the game gives you horrible advice how to win. Let's analyze why this doesn't work anymore:Put down protection nodes to decrease incoming damage. Reality: The AI's will clear your nodes within a few turns. The first time I put down Invisible Womans bubble that shields a character from all damage, it was cleared instantly by the computer getting a cascade.Keep your weakest characters in the back to shield them from damage. Reality: The game deliberately forces you to only move certain nodes, which forces your weakest characters to the front. Kill the strongest opponent firstReality: You have to kill whichever character has a cascading ability or the least amount of point to charge their ability. One of the most difficult opponents in the game is Juggernaut, because he combines both of these. His 2 abilities cost very little (6 points). One cascades, the other deals a little damage to himself and a lot to you. So he cascades, deals damage to you, cascades, deal damage to you. The sad thing is? Juggernaut is one of the weakest characters you can recruit on your team, being only a 1 star character. But for AI events, he is buffed up and kills you easily.Prevent the enemy from collecting colors their need.Reality: Either the AI are teamed up with another AI that gives them free points or they simply cascades and get the points they need from the toprow.Collect colors you need for your strongest abilitiesReality: The game forces you to only move certain nodes. Whenever 2-star Storm is on my team, I only need 11 blue nodes to charge her ability. There is very rarely a single blue node when she is on my team. Most of the time, you are only allowed to collect pink nodes, which is one of the weakest colors in the game. And then watch the AI get the colors they needed through the toprow. Other problems with gameplay- Enemy AI usually have few colors to collect, which makes it easy for them to make a lot of damage in little time. Ninjas and thugs usually have abilities that cost 4 mana, they get free mana because they aren't allowed to move nodes and the countdowns are just 2-3 times long. Unless you are really lucky, it's very difficult to clear those nodes in time. Because you rarely have anything to match them with. - The ""match node helper"" will regularly point out a bad move while ignoring a 4-5 match. - Because cascades happen so regularly, you need to waste health packs often. You never know if your character will survive with only half of their life.ConclusionThere's no strategy in this game. You win if you are lucky. Even though technically my characters are 50 levels above the other team and should massacre them.  I feel dumbed down when I play, because I always look for a good move and still loose because my characters can't match colors they need.			"

												The game concept is very fun and interesting. There are many events happening all the time. It would have a lot of potential if not for...- Money grab tactics to progress. Forced to spend Hero Points (hard to earn unless you spend money) just to buy slots to have +1 character. These slots get more expensive with each few slots you buy, until it gets out of hand expensive.- If you want to play for free and win some good characters and Hero Points, you need to schedule your life around the game's events starting and ending time. (EDIT: this seems to have been addressed.)- PvP system is implemented in a way that forces you spend to spend Hero Points to be competitive.- The game seems to progress nicely in the beginning until you hit several deadends which will tempt you to spend money.Try it out if you wish, DON'T spend money at all until you played for at least 2 or 3 months. You will regret it. It has potential, if you don't mind spending money on a game every week and have no real life commitments, this may be a game for you.			"

												Long story short:This was a viable puzzle game.  While it had some issues, these were not too severe.  Loosely based on the Marvel comic event Dark Reign, you did the usual match 3 gameplay to beat up the Dark Avengers ..... over and over again.  Before the most recent patch, this was probably the worst part of the game as there are only so many times you can defeat the same five characters repeatedly.Then the healing nerf hit.D3, in a fit of absolute greed and the worst show of judgement, decided to patch the game so that any and all healing buffs were now ""False healing"" in order to force the player to buy more healing packs in order to continue to play past two or three matches.  This nerf not only crippled the healing characters, it has made characters such as Sentry unplayable.  By eliminating the low-level hot dog stand healing, even people who are just starting out are affected negatively by this change.In the end, there are better Free-to-Play or even match-3 puzzle games to invest your time in than this misuse of the Marvel License.

												You'll see plenty of reviews that tackle what the developers have done to absolutely bend over their once-loyal players. But, I'll still add my voice to that camp.The game starts out deceptively fair for a Free-to-Play. But I've spent money because I wanted to support it, I absolutely love match-3 puzzle games, and MPQ began very strong. I expected to get more out of my real money and time invested. But in the end, the microtransactions carry some of the most ludicrous price tags I've ever seen. Especially once you realize how shafted you are. If you max out a hero's level capacity (Each hero has a maximum level directly proportional to its rarity) you can spend ISO (a f2p resource earned from playing) to level them once the right number of 'covers' (item drops that level up 1 of 3 abilities a hero has) has been obtained.The developers are just NOT providing the level of return investment quality in their microtransactions. And they know it. You have to spend a STAGGERING amount of money or a nigh-impossible amount of game time to acquire competitive max-level high rarity heroes. Look at my total time played. I legitimately have 3 maxed out uncommon heroes and a handful of level 15-50 uncommon and rares. When I look at the amount of hours invested, I'm not upset. It's a great distraction at my relatively low-demanding job, but at the same time, I don't feel the devs have spent nearly as much time developing meaningful addons, GRAPHICAL IMPROVEMENTS (ffs this game is a goldmine) or a truly diverse lineup of Marvel originals.All in all, give it a try if you like puzzle games, but honestly, there are more rewarding ones out there. I'm turning my back on it and putting my disposable income on something else.			"

												Don't be fooled by the free to play label.  The game is fun and addictive, the way most match three games are, but not worth your time.

												I wanted to like this game.  Puzzle Quest is one of my favorite time killers, and this borrows heavily from that game and adds a neat three on three dimension that I found cool.  But the leveling up system is stupidly complicated and based on a degree of luck that sucks all the fun out of it.  You're HP is not restored to full power after each match, which means you either have to wait around half the day for it to regenerate or you can purchase the in-game currency that will let you restore it immediately.  After getting frustrated as hell with MPQ: DR for a couple of weeks, I deleted it from my library.  Save yourself the trouble and don't bother trying it.  Go buy the sequel to Puzzle Quest instead, or maybe Galactrix.  Don't get sucked in just because it features Marvel superheroes.			"

												I am a huge fan of the Puzzle Quest series of games. Sadly this game falls way short of them. It is easy to say, ""Well it is free."" But I would think someone like Marvel, owned by Disney, would want to put out the best quality product in existence, This is not it. The game has little or no balance. It is clearly skewed towards desperation purchases as the continue to move forward in the you either trudge away for hours to maybe get to the next portion or you break down to get stronger characters to beat foes. I understand the in game purchase but when you pay the price at fun it makes the game overall worthless. There is a lot more that can be said but this is just not a good game, Neither of Marvel's free-to-play games are very good.			"

												Been playing this for a very long time. Most of that time I spent spending no money on the thing only started spending money recently because of a job and because of all the hours I've put into it. Despite what people say, you can get very far in this game with no investment as far as money is concerned. Time isn't really a factor either due to the rather recent changes of the events. An hour or so a day will be enough to get you going. Join an alliance and ask what you should do.There is one problem that I have to address though. The steam version currently cannot link to your mobile version. You can still have alliances with Steam/Mobile users, but you will not be able to make progress on steam and transfer that progress onto your phone. If you have a phone that can run it well, pick it up on that instead.I don't think I really need to say much else. Just look at all those hours the majority of the not recommended have put into the thing.			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign ReviewA game titled Marvel Puzzle Quest has a lot to live to up to. Not for the Marvel part, but instead due to the deserved respect and love that Puzzle Quest received for successfully creating a hybrid RPG/Bejeweled-style match-three game. Marvel Puzzle Quest has taken the idea of a puzzle game with with a strategic/role-playing element overlay, and turned it into an intricately crafted, remarkably deep experience.In Marvel Puzzle Quest, you control three superheroes who fight against up to three other supervillains/heroes (or goons, in some of the plot missions). When matched, the six colors of gems on the board grant energy that can be used for special moves, like purple matches helping Hawkeye use “Take Aim,” a skill that ensures a critical hit. Every match also serves as an attack, but the amount of damage depends on individual characters' affinity with the color – which also gives combo attacks a nice superhero fight feel to them, where Iron Man lands a punch and then Black Widow jumps in. Meanwhile, skills that offer buffs to defense/strength, or do damage over time, manifest as changes to tiles on the board, which can be matched and eliminated. Thus, the board becomes amazingly tactical – there are up to half a dozen potential considerations beyond “best match” at any given point.Unfortunately the game ended up being a pay to win game with overpriced micro-transactions.

That sort of thing works fine for smart phones because the nature of the games are to be quick plays; but on a PC you want to sit down and get some serious playtime in a game.  Now perhaps at higher levels and with a wider selection of heroes it's not such an issue; but I found it to be rather crippling at the start. "

												This is a great game completely ruined by the mobile phone game business model. Energy, timers, grinding leveling, this game has it all. It's basic concept is really fun, but overshadowed by what I just mentioned. It's basically a match 3 game mixed with a RPG type battles. This part of the game is actually really fun. I would give this game 10/10 had it been done outside of the f2p model and had instead charged like $20-30. You really can't play this game for more than 20 minutes as once all you're heroes are defeated you must wait for them to ""regain"" health. Which simply means waiting an hour or paying money to heal. Also leveling up on your own is ridiculously grinding. You will often find yourself stuck with no way to progress until you very slowly finally get enough points to finally level up enough to take on an enemy. Most insultingly sometimes you wont even get promised rewards for a victory, the game is just like f*ck you and moves on.HOW DOES ANY COMPANY THINK STEAM USERS ARE STUPID ENOUGH TO PAY FOR A $100 MICROTRANSACTION!!!!!!

												Wow, I admittedly downloaded this game because I was rather made eager by the Marvel and Free package, and whats more it seemed to not be like the crummy Marvel games of yore that make you pay to do anything more than hop.  But alas through my initial enjoyment of the game I realized when the AI takes over for other players, and better yet when you are playing only AI, the odds are drastically in the AI's favor that the select colors they need will drop.  This is okay, I thought, all it means is my time in this game will be a bit more challenging.  Then I saw changes as the game kept updating, the AI still was favored, but now things would happen like my entire team dropping dead on my turn (the first turn) when no match was made and no power fired.  I sent an email looking for an explanation, thinking maybe it was an accidental bug, I got a computer generated impersonel response that was not even pertinent to my query.  I decided to grin and bare it, it actually got better after the next update.  After some time though suddenly it started getting worse, the AI was using powers it had no way of using (no AP) and often dealing 2-3x the damage it should have been, the only improvement from before is I no longer watched my whole team die on turn one, now it was turn five.I finally decided to delete the game and send a carefully worded letter to the techs, this was and is the only Marvel game I ever actually liked, and even was pondering spending money on it.Edit: The email I was awaiting from the game people finally arrived, titled ""Our Friend"" and in German.  I never told them I spoke what little German I do, so this seems like another generic, ""we will make you happy"" attempt.			"

The ""Tournaments"" that you play in are just other player teams controlled by the AI, which tends to make them either total blowouts or impossible.

												Whenever i see someone call this a game i can't help but laugh for at least a minute because in reality it is just a shameless attempt of a money making scheme, with the most serious offence being the health logic.It has a health carry over after each fight, alongside a health pack limit of 5 and generating 1 every half hour (unless you have no value of money and can pay for more.) Meaning you have to stop playing after a few battles. Seriously, who in their right mind thought that limiting play time would be a good thing!Trying to level up the powers of rarer characters is pretty much out of the question if you're avoiding spending money on them, which is ridiculous...The story plummets after the first chapter (not that it was particularly interesting to begin with) and becomes a series of pointless fights with goons and soldiers.Downloading this game as a Puzzle Quest installment or a Marvel game will only lead to disappointment.

												I really can't recommend this game even though I am still playing it and have lots of hours invested.  It really is a solid match 3 game but the meta game is the problem.  If you do not invest money (probably lots), you will progress at a snails pace.  There are so many heroes, and for the most part you will get them at random meaning you will end up with lots and lots of poorly covered heroes.  The higher the rarity, the bigger the problem.  Also you will need roster spots to even recuit the heroes you have won.  These can only be bought with premium currency (which you do get from playing) which means you will often have to sell your hard earned covers or pay real money for roster spots.  This is especially bad early in your career.  Heroes are added every two weeks, so the problem is only getting worse with time, not better as you would hope.The biggest problem with the game though, is lack of new content.  I could live with the above problems if new, fun stuff was coming out, but I am playing almost the same game as I was almost 2 years ago.  Boss battles were added, but they are rare and alliance based (so not much fun if you aren't on a good alliance).  There have only been 2 or 3 stories added since I started (not counting rare, short events that are only seen once or twice a year).  That means 75% of the stories are against the Dark Avengers which means you are fighting the same villians over and over.  And to compete in these events?  You need to beat each pin (battle) 4-6 times.There is also PvP but that is against AI controlled player rosters.  As the heroes are not the most balanced in the world you tend to see certain teams and heroes a lot there.  And they almost always be of similar strength which makes it feel very grindy.  And both PvP and PvE are time based, there is no content that you can play at your own pace other than the short introductory stories that you can only play once.  So to get the good prizes you need to devote lots of time to them.  Whether a paying player or not.So bottom line, don't play this.  The match 3 is fun and can get some people hooked.  Do yourself a favor and don't let that happen.  At least until they address the problems above which isn't likely to happen.			"

												When I saw the other user reviews I thought that their playtimes were ridiculous and that you can't jugde it based on 0.3 hours but when I tried it I found you can judge it on 0.3 hours, the ""tutorial"" doesn't tell you anything about all the numbers popping on screen, it doesn't bother eplaining them, fortunately it's kind of obvious what they mean. It gives off the impression that it's a basic match 3 game but NOPE it's not, it's got various mechanics that might have actually been cool. However they don't bother explaining these until you have already figured them out, with the exception of the powers they do tell you about those.   Speaking about the powers, the ones they start you off with at first seem cool with Iron Man's repulsor blast dealing like solid 63 damage but later on the enemies have so much health it begins to suck. Also the story, I can't say I payed much attention to it because it was dumb but the writing was horrible it was cheesy and boring, not even cheesy and funny just boring and and the beginning they start off with Iron Man, yeah fine whatever but then they throw in Storm, for no reason at all just because why not, lets throw in a completely unrelated character to team up with Iron Man to take down some lame ♥♥♥ bad guys and the enemies have unoriginal names, like soldier and sniper. There is probably a pay to win aspect but I couldn't play it long enough to notice, oh wait yes I could in the first 5 minutes they tried to force me to use some healing thing to heal my hero which wasn't even badly damaged, if you don't heal your heroes they can't fight no matter how much health they have, they could be only 5 hp short and you'd just have to wait for them to heal or use up one health pack if your lazy and eventually enemies deal enough damage to prevent you from playing for a minimum if 4 minutes if you don't use the health pack, how do you get more health packs? You either play missions which you can't do because your hero is injured or you buy them. Don't waste your time with this go play Bejeweled on your phone or something instead.			"

That being said there are a lot of times where I think ""man, this game really is all about luck"", whether it is the rolling for covers or cascades.+Fun and enjoyable, plain and simple.+Love the Marvel tie in, and often adds new awesome characters. (shout out to the silver surfer)+It is not a very attention heavy game, it is something that you can do while doing other things if you want to.+The characters and abilities give a depth to the game that adds to the experience.+There is not time limit on matches, or idling.-Embarrassing when your friends see you playing.-Largely luck based.-IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE TWO ACCOUNTS ON ONE PC.-No ability to share accounts across platforms.-A little bit of a slow start roster-wise.As for the common freemium complaint, for the most part I am free to play, only putting in a few dollars to get one extra space, or trying the VIP program. I see no reason to complain about the features, since it is a free game, and real green dollars are not outright needed to progress. In all I have gotten more enjoyment and time out of this game than some retail AAA titles, and have spent less. It is nice to be able to help and support something that is free and also as a bonus be rewarded.I hit up the Deadpool Daily everyday, and I will keep playing it and enjoying it. I am excited for the new characters and features, and recommend this game to anyone who wants a low commitment daily game to play.			"

												A casual puzzle game with all kind of heroes from the Marvel universe. Takes a while to become a high(er) level player but with time and skill it's possible. In Marvel Puzzle Quest you get new heroes by spending recruit tokens. These tokens get you a random hero and the anticipation always excites me. The joy of getting a rare drop never gets old. Besides the game is free so if you don't like it, you can just drop it and nothing's lost.			"

												Which sadness. This gameplay had a great potential at the beginning with 15 characters and some stories. It has been almost 2 years since I play and I really wasted my time. The fault has developers of a nameless nullity which totally destroyed this gameplay. Only ones people who spend some money can again play. There is no innovation, the useless content with creating new inaccessible characters for 3 months (4 stars more numerous than 1 stars), the new players have no chance and the old as me are tired of redoing and of redoing always the same maps for nothing. To forget or then fire developers and hire creators.			"

												Remarkably, this game has gotten worse and worse regarding stability over the last three years. This game was a hidden gem three years ago, was an excellent game two years ago, and was a pretty good game last year.  Now the game has become so bad that they recently lost their community manager, and the forums are overrun with valid complaints and frustrated people who are giving up the game.Customer support for this game is worse than nonexistent. If the game is buggy, expect to impact you negatively. If you have technical difficulties around an item not showing up in your inventory, do not expect any help.Recent ""innovations"" include such gems as ""view a commercial for this in game reward"", and new game mode start being introduced are so broken but the game will choose not to award any points for a boss if you do not allow the boss to at least hit you first.The game continues to raise the level of characters introduced, which means in game currency inflation has gone wild, but the long time entrenched players are still the only ones that stand a chance of winning any of the major prizes.The game has an alliance concept, which means that in order to get the best rewards, you have to join an alliance with very active players. In a completely non-fun meta game, you can go around forums and find which alliance you should join to maximize your game time ROI.At one point this was a five star game for me, albeit with bugs, balance and alliance issues. At that time, there was a community manager who intervened when I had some unpleasant customer support issues, and the game was reasonably balanced, fresh, and fairly bug free. People who didn't want to pay to win could still have a lot of fun.In its current format, the game is trying to milk as much money out of the new players, and as many ad use out of everyone, as possible. The new VIP system means that for $10 a month you can (maybe) be remotely competitive in this free to play game.In short, stay away.			"

												So I have very mixed feelings about this game.  I have to say, it's worth avoiding so-called ""Free to Play"" games, as they intentionally abuse game design and put it not in the service of telling a story or making a compelling experience or whatever, but rather in the service of getting microtransactions out of the player.  It don't think it's possible to avoid that, save for doing a shareware model where you're playing an extended demo for free.I assumed the above before playing any ""free to play"" games, and I'm more certain of it after sinking time in to quite a few over the past year or two.All that said, Marvel Puzzle Quest is the best of them I've yet seen, and there's a lot of fun to be had from it...but at the same time, it would be a better game were it designed like the mainline Puzzle Quest games that you just purchase and play.  There doesn't appear to ever be an endgame here...it's basically just repeating story elements that ultimately are trying to get you to pay money, but never really lead anywhere.  I've seen stories in this repeated a half dozen times now, sometimes slightly mixed up, sometimes the same storyline/quest has repeated literally twice in a row.And it's a shame, because a lot of what's here is actually great.  I played Puzzle Quest 2 while playing this, and I actually like the basic ""puzzle combat"" gameplay here better.  The art is generally fantastic too (and looks better and the screen layout is much better on PC than on iOS/Android).  This is the most fun I've ever had with the basic mechanics of a single screen action puzzle game.The adaptation of characters' powers to the gameplay is well thought out-they're clearly trying and mostly succeeding in making it work.  I won't lie, it's a lot of fun to collect and power up your favorite characters and have them beat down your opponent.  But it gets frustrating when you realize it’s really towards no end…there’s no endpoint, just that endless repetition of mostly identical story elements recycled again and again.  The most egregious way they try to get you to spend (a lot) of money on it is for slots to hold characters.  They give you a very small number at the start, and since both for gameplay reasons and because it’s cool to have them, you’ll quickly want/need vastly more slots than they give you.  You technically earn the resources to buy slots within the game, but that’s a VERY slow process that’s not very practical-I think since I started playing they’ve made that worse too.  You’re pretty much forced into paying real-world money to be able to have the slots you’d want and need to actually continue playing.So would I recommend this?  There’s so much fun in it, and it’s so well done in many ways…and yet at the same time, there’s no ending.  There’s no resolution to the story.  It’s just a fancy treadmill to get you to pay more, and it’s a shame that this same effort wasn’t put towards making this a “real” game.  Even an MMO model might make more sense for it (as it is actually an MMO in many respects).  I'm putting thumbs down because Steam forces me to thumb it up or down.  I'd rather just leave that blank, and I’d probably give it 3 Stars on the Netflix model because so much is fun and works, and yet so much doesn’t by the nature of what it is…  (And yes 3 stars is positive and thumbs down negative, but...I don't know, I couldn't quite give it 2 stars, were that an option, and yet I also don't feel like I can exactly recommend it...)

												I'm changing my review rating.I had this review as as a recommend with reluctance but at this point it's a no.The game has gone from sometimes unbalanced against the AI to extremely.  Doing away with the terrain tiles has just let the computer have an easier time beating me.And this isn't me being bad at the game.Blatant bugs that let the AI use moves they shouldn't, magical cascades that take out my entire party from full and just the fact that if you chose to use boosts you have no access to terrain powers.  That was one thing about the terrain I had liked, it was the same for both groups.I'm limited by the space I have to try and decide if I want to power my characters or hope I can get enough TU tiles to use one of the boosts I've gotten.I love the Marvel universe because of the movies and I will continue to play because of the time I've put into it, but if you've never played.Don't waste or time or money.

												Honestly I've played the iOS version of the game, downloaded the PC version just to see whats it's like and I've gotta say... it's the same game. I'm not saying that it's a bad thing. I played the mobile version of the game for the last 2 months and I would recommend you to give it a try as it is a simple game to just turn on and play once in a while. My only gripe with the game is that there is no cloud syncing with the mobile version (even when cross platform play is available) as my roster of heroes are not available in the PC version.PS: Please bear in mind that this game is a mobile game in all aspects (from the countdown timer to the healing time). What I would recommend when playing on PC is that you pretend you're playing on a big tablet (if you don't like the idea of mobile games being ported to PC)			"

												A ""free-to-play"" puzzle quest with Marvel characters. If that's all it was, it might have been a fun game. There are a lot of issues working against it though. You're supposed to collect cards, but since you only have a very limited roster, you only want to keep the most powerful cards you can find or just stick with the main couple cards you start out with because they're the ones that level up. If you don't make room for them in your roster, new cards disappear. There's no way to measure your roster's progress on leveling up; when you do level a card up, you have to spend the crystals to actually increase the level. Most of the puzzle rounds have multiple rewards (I guess to push ""replayability"") but evidently the rewards are randomized so that you could play a single round dozens of times but never get all 4 rewards. I don't mind that the cards must ""heal"" when they take damage during a round, but the more powerful the enemies, the more damage, the longer time they have to heal. Eventually you can only play 2 or 3 rounds before your entire roster is down. So you have to grind for rewards but can't grind because your team's down. If this was a tablet game, it wouldn't be a big deal; on the PC, why play a game only as long as it takes to start it up? Of course, this is all not a problem if you're fine with paying lots of real money for the tokens.			"

												I would love to recommend this game, but at it's current state it's a mixed bag. The puzzle element is really solid and damn addictive, I will go more in to the flaws at the end of the review,but if you want to enjoy it(without spending money) there are some tips.1. Use most of the iso you get for training your heroes instead of buying covers, at least in the beginning, it is slow to grind with low level heroes on missions that you have already gathered all the iso from. Also focus on three heroes at the start, so you have at least one team that can defeat more difficult opponents. 2. Use the hero points for roster upgrades, the game limits how many heroes you can have and you very quickly fill all your slots.3. You can't really reset your progress, so a bad start can really destroy enjoyment.4. Start slow, you get some reward daily and they help you progress5. Take part in events, they are really difficult at the very beginning and often require heroes you might not have. but they offer nice rewards and are generally entertaining. More so when you've played the game for a little longer.What I hate about the game.1.Monetization, while not bad as a concept, this game has ridiculous prizes for it's currency, and as usual the more valuable resource is very limited ingame without paying. Events feature heroes that are powered up in them, and if you want to buy them quaranteed, it costs about 20 euros, hero slots start at about 1€ a spot but quickly double that. You get heroes at random, and if you want a copy of specific cover to level up power and also the level cap of the hero, you can spend money for that, 1 star hero is about 1€ per cover, 2 star is about 5€, 3 star cover is closer to 10€ and 4-star cover is about 25€.You also can't buy new select covers for heroes, the powers have to be unlocked via randomly acquired cover or event prize. And after the power is unlocked the power could be upgraded by paying.2.Difficulty on campaign ramps up pretty fast, creating a paywall of some level that feels that appears very early, more so if you had a bad start.3.Campaign length. You start with a tab Prologue, that has 5 maps, each with about 15 battles. the difficulty really ramps up at the 4th one. Then when you finally clear the prologue, the campaign at least so far is over. After that there are only the events and pvp against other player teams that are controlled by AI. so the game becames more of a gotta catch them all, with no other real goal and that is handicapped by monetization.4.LevelingThe whole leveling up system seems to have been designed with monetization in mind. You need iso to level up, the cost get higher and the rate at which you get it becomes slower when there are no new missions to play and old missions give almost negligible amounts. You hero's maximum level is capped by how many covers for him/her you have, and how rare the hero isSome random numbersGraphics 7. They are nice, not groundbreaking, but feel very fitting for this gameGameplay 9. Very addicting once you get the hang of it, AI is kind of stupid at times which i guess just happensWriting and sounds are decent but i mainly play on the background while doing something else so can't really rate them.Monetization 2. everything feels like it has very bad value and not much incentive to use the option. And it really hurts the gameOverall 4. The actual gameplay is great, but is dragged down by lack of content, goals after the short campaign and monetization centric design.			"

												5 Stars. (If you want a game that you can play for hours on end move along, if you want to play about an hour or two at a time, a couple times a day THIS IS THE PERFECT GAME FOR YOU.)Alright, after reading many of the posts here I felt the need to post my own review.This game is the type of game that you are supposed to progress over months. There is a fairly good pace of gaining characters/currency of either type in game. A MAJOR MISTAKE is wasting the in game Coin on trying to buy heroes. ONLY BUY hero slots. I have 35ish hero slights and haven't bought a single thing. In fact, I earn enough gold to buy more ever few days. The prologue has many events that give gold, if you place decently in a pvp or pve event gold.  THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE THAT YOU SHOULD WORRY ABOUT.One major point I want to make is, while you can buy currency, it WILL NOT go far at all. This makes it even better for F2P players because they can always remain competitive. Overall, this is the type of game you play a few times a day, taking a few hour break inbetween to recharge lives. It is an amazing game, that people just need to learn how to EFFECTIVELY use there in game currency.ONE finally thing   D3go.com  is the site where you can find the forums, there are AMAZING GUIDES on farming iso, what heroes to focus leveling, good hero combos, etc.			"

												It's a trap! All and all don't waste your money and time on this game, it's just too random.  Play for free or only use money to unlock roster slots.   Never ever pay to upgrade one star characters.The monetization of this game is frustrating.  Unlocking characters and powers are one and the same and come from a random event called recruiting.  You roll the dice to get a character power, if you don't already have that character, they are added to your roster. So even when you are lucky enough to grab a rare three star character  they are useless until  you unlock their other powers which is extremely improbable.   Also unlocking levels of abilities is over priced.  Unlocking a single ability level on a three star character can cost (1250 points) ~$10 per level.  To compete in multiplayer challenges you need rare characters who can exceed level 50.  With that said, I'm hooked, hundreds of hours.... I can't get out.			"

												Meh.Oh, you wanted more? Okay, mediocre swap-the-gems-to-get-three-or-more-in-a-row game. A few interesting rpg elements, character unlocks and upgrades, but nothing mind blowing or even new for that matter. If you've played Bejeweled you are an expert right from the start. You get to play a 'team' of heros, who each grant different attack values against the opposing team as you complete the puzzle. In addition each hero also have special direct attacks and gameboard effects that do add a second level of stratagy. Once you have defeated the oppsing team with your superior gem swapping, you win, granting various prizes such as more in game money, 'iso-8', or new hero unlocks.GUI is poor with very little help tags or assistance. It looks polished, but a few pop-up tags would have been nice. The interface is confusing with clickable points not clearly identifiable.... making trying to navigate like playing a hidden picture flash game. Yes, this is a simple gem game... and a gamer of 25 yrs had trouble navigating the interface. I'm not proud of it... but there it is :PAs others point out, micro transactions are here, but truthfully not as prevelent as others make it seem. It is a fully playable free game, without limitaions.That said... thats the only thing thats fitting and proper in this download - the price.

												I am a big fan of Marvel heroes, however this game is very tedious and monotonous. It is free to play, so the game steers you toward spending money in order to compete without spending hours on end grinding through the game, This game, overall, is bad.This is a puzzle quest game.  You start off with a few 1 star characters and either earn others by playing the game or buying a chance to get certain characters. Characters range from 1 to 4 stars. Simply match gems to attack, no skill involved. Matchs drag on and useless animations, that you cannot disable, draws out these matches needlessly.MPQ can get frustrating, and is very repetitive. When it is time for you to lose;  you will lose. The computer will cascade massive amounts of gem matches, continue to find extra turns, and color starve you until you lose. This happens often, how else would they get you to spend money to buy heals, a chance for characters, and levels.  I play on and off, but I would not recommend this game at all.			"

												So, today, after 200hours of playing I've lost my whole roster. Which means - Punisher, Hulk, Magnetos, Captain America, Spiderman, Ragnarok and many more(some of them maxed or half trained). As you can see on screens on my steam I was top player, have also played for more than 60 days in a row(know from daily shield rewards - which are bunch of crap tbh).When I have played this game 3 months ago - it was fun on a break. Since then they've changed so many things on minus. It's free to play, but more pay(and play for whole day) to win. Tough enemies, weak player heroes making this game a real challenge, especially on a combo streak from enemy. I was maxing 2 stars Storm for last week - every fckin level needs about 1000 or later 1500 Iso-8, until 85 lvl. But still, after maxing you have to play against enemies - 140lvl, 240lvl - no problem with that, if you're lucky and know how to build your team for a battle. For beginners this game is now unplayable, because of level of the challenge. One of most unbalanced games I ever played.Also develepers still pushing you to pay. You have lost a battle? You need recharge( so wait hours or pay). You want to level up? you need Iso-8. You want to win anything? Just pay!You can say you get Iso from battles - yes, but how much? 100Iso as a reward of won match against deadly 240lvl enemies is piece of crap, not a reward.Also, even if you buy gold, you want to have THIS character.. no no no! That's not that easy. Still you can't buy character you want, just test your luck. You probably get a character you have maxed, and it's useless until then.TL:Dr - don't play, it's crap, pay to (maybe)win.			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign has been out on iOS and Android for a few months now, and recently came out on Steam. While being free-to-play makes it harmless enough to check out, it is not one of the better games of this model out there. Tribes Ascend and Path of Exile are just a few examples of how this model can be applied to a game with great success. Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign gets 2 out of 5 stars. While most will get some passing enjoyment out of this puzzle game’s use of strategy and RPG elements, the sluggish UI and sub-par graphics, as well as the deluge of micro transactions, makes this one hard to recommend to even the most ardent of Marvel or Puzzle Quest fans.Full review at: http://www.hbhud.com/2013/12/09/review-of-marvel-puzzle-quest-dark-reign/ "

												I picked this up on a lark because of how much I enjoy match-3 type games (mindless, easy to play while watching T.V., etc).  Surprisingly, I've found this game to be really fun.  It's similar to Puzzle Quest in that there is added depth to the match-3 concept, and the PvP aspect as well as repeated Events keep me coming back.I'm editing this, as I see a ton of negative reviews due to the micro-transaction concept this game introduces.  It's a F2P game, the company has to make money so I don't see a problem with them charging to play more.  I've sank about $15 into this game and played for 30 hours, which is cheaper than most other forms of entertainment and quite a bit more I've gotten out of other games for similar price.  That being said, you don't need to pay a lot of cash.  Play smart, pick your fights, and you can pace yourself and naturally heal over time if that's your thing.			"

I cannot stop playing this little game (moreso on the phone than on the pc) and actually wake up thinking about it. If you enjoy Bejeweled and/or a comics fan you must play this.

They took a great concept added it to a wonderful backdrop and then set the gameplay to royally screw over the player out of every dime they have.BTW-  there should be a way for the play time of the game to deliniate when someone just has the game started and not actually playing it.

												Meh.Oh, you wanted more? Okay, mediocre swap-the-gems-to-get-three-or-more-in-a-row game. A few interesting rpg elements, character unlocks and upgrades, but nothing mind blowing or even new for that matter. If you've played Bejeweled you are an expert right from the start. You get to play a 'team' of heros, who each grant different attack values against the opposing team as you complete the puzzle. In addition each hero also have special direct attacks and gameboard effects that do add a second level of stratagy. Once you have defeated the oppsing team with your superior gem swapping, you win, granting various prizes such as more in game money, 'iso-8', or new hero unlocks.GUI is poor with very little help tags or assistance. It looks polished, but a few pop-up tags would have been nice. The interface is confusing with clickable points not clearly identifiable.... making trying to navigate like playing a hidden picture flash game. Yes, this is a simple gem game... and a gamer of 25 yrs had trouble navigating the interface. I'm not proud of it... but there it is :PAs others point out, micro transactions are here, but truthfully not as prevelent as others make it seem. It is a fully playable free game, without limitaions.That said... thats the only thing thats fitting and proper in this download - the price.

												A recent update has completely ruined my urge to play. If you lose a fight you have to wait two or three hours for your characters to heal over time or spend actual money to buy health packs to revive them. The game was always had a lot of extras that you could pay for but it was still good very enjoyable as free to play game. So with this latest update it's turned into a ""Pay to Play/Pay to Win"" game because if you can't heal you can't play and if you can't play you can't win.			"

												My first review, cause I'm frustated. I've been playing this for a long while. Until yesterday it was fun and you didn't need to spend money and you could still enjoy the game. This changed completely after yesterdays update,  cause you can heal your characters only by spending real money or waiting 2-4hours for them to heal back to full health. So to enjoy this free to play game you need to spend actual money. Unless the healing update will be changed, I certainly don't recommend getting into this game. At least for the time being, the game is pretty broken, pay to play or wait to play.  "

												This may be a ""Free To Play"" game, but like most of the lame flash games you see on Facebook, this game heavily revovles around micro-transactions. If you're not familar with the abusive nature of micro-transaction dependent games, then read some of the more in-depth reviews (like the ones with 4+ paragraphs) to get more details. The only positive thing this game has over the flash games on Facebook is that:1) the game doesn't lag as much as the ones on FaceBook, 2) this game won't force you to spam all of your FaceBook friends, &3) it has characters from the Marvel franchise. As for the puzzle game itself, I find it infuriating! I am not merely saying this because I am a poor loser. I get my ♥♥♥ kicked all the time in MOBA & fighting games, but I can still enjoy those games. When I make a mistake in those games, I can usually see alternative moves that could have been made & understand how the consequences of the mistake could have been avoided. In this game, when you destroy blocks, new blocks will fall down to replace the destroyed blocks, sometimes the replacement blocks will just conveniently share the same color & coinciding create a chain reaction, doing massive damage. I am not talking about the pieces that are already on the board & merely fall down. I speaking of the new pieces that weren't on the board previously. Because of this, destroying block on the bottom half of the board is usually more advantageous then destroying the block near the top edge of the board.Unlike most puzzle games, such as ""Tetris"", there is no preview of the new incoming blocks that appear from the top of the game board, so there is no way to prepare for them, offensively or defensively. Many times, chain combos will just happen by accident & sometimes for massive damage; sometimes for you, sometimes against you. This can be a HUGE reward that is being giving out, not for any brilliant strategy or careful planning, but just by sheer randomness. Unless one team is heavily more over-powered than the other, without a preview of the next set of falling blocks, the outcome of the match relies too heavily on luck. You might as well be playing a slot machine. I'm still gonna play this game though, just because I'm as much of a sucker as those who do play slot machines.			"

BUT! /read the next part/- the price of things /in-game money, iso-crystals, boosts, heals/ is incredible, totally OP, unbelievable. For this money you can buy a WoW account for a year, 2-3 high quality video games, or anything else. Terrible prices, simply terrible prices.I hope it will be better.			"

												This game is the utter definition of pay 2 win. With cash roadblocks at new characters, new skills, skill level ups, and healing, expect to find yourself grinding the same missions over and over hoping to make enough funny money to have a chance at earning a character that is strong enough to beat the next stage and having to wait up to a hour(at least for 30 and under) real time for your characters to heal back to full health. Since you can't level up without having more skill levels, and leveling up lower level characters is pointless anyways since their skills do not scale with the levels of HP, you're forced into this loop until you get a lvl 30 character that breaks the game for a few hours, until they are too weak as well.  Stick with the first 3 games, because this is game is a great example of what the F2P greedy cashgrab can do to a series.			"

												I don't know what all the F2P haters are complaining about. In the time I've been playing it I've never been urged, coaxed, solicited or strongarmed to spend real money. This game doesn't even feature ads or constant bombardment of things they want you to buy. If you want to buy copious amounts of coins to level up your characters quicker you can but it's not necessary as this game features weekly events that reward you with the same coinage you can pay money for. Anyways, sure there's microtransactions but they're in no way disruptive or ""pay to win"". That being said this game isn't as good as all the other puzzle quest games. The storylines are pretty shallow but you're not going to play this game for the story. This is a nice little match 3 game in the same vein as the other Puzzle Quest games but the events keep things fresh as you can battle other players teams in the weekly tournaments or other special events. There's an array of characters to choose from/fight/win and you can quickly level up during those particular times. So you can pick it up and play a few rounds between the AI or other player's teams and kill some time in between whatever more important thing you're taking a break from.			"

												Mavel Puzzle quest, A new high in developer greed. Took away most of the characters in game away from us and locked them behind an extra level of rng just so they can try to force everyone to collect and level only the latest characters in a limited amount of time to try and force people into a resource crunch so they have to spend money to keep up.As far as I am concerned the game is dead.  Casuals are no longer welcome, only the people that want to spend lots of money. The people behind it are the worst kind of evil and greedy. Only install this game if you are looking for an outlet to throw away all your money to progress.	 "

												It did not take me very long at all to see that this game was simply a wallet drain. The prices are insane for what you get, it is a real shame that there is no story at all to back any of this up. If you have not yet played the first 2 puzzle quest games then I highly recommend you go check them out and leave this hunk of junk alone.			"

												Edit: I should have well over 300 hours in by it now. I am in a casual do-dailies-turn-up-for-events alliance. I am on day 521 of my Rewards. I have 30 champed 3-star heroes. And I still stand by my review below. Game is great, I like the devs, changes by and large make sense. But there is still no cross-play between PC and mobile. No thumbs up for you.=======I really enjoy this Match-3 game, between PC and Tablet I've put in well over 100 hours into it. Got every single reward from the tutorials, placed well in a few Story events (which are an interesting system of different timed thematical storyline events that spit out rewards every day or three) because I have pockets of time through the day which this fills nicely. Even dabbled a bit into the Versus system, where you fight other players' teams for rank and rewards, but the AI controls the opponent teams since Match-3 gameplay doesn't lend itself well to a realtime PvP system at all.My roster's not as developed as long-time players yet, I have a bunch of 2-star heroes, a number of 3-stars with 1 or 2 powers, and a couple 4-stars from event rewards that I lean heavily on. (Star basically = rarity/power rating, with 1 stars being the lowest and 4 being the highest with a 5 now just released in an update). Enemies in story fights seems to scale according to your overall roster level, which is neat, because it allowed even my newer PC account to jump right in to a story event and place high enough to get top tier rewards.The game is F2P with microtransactions, but the MT's are so RNG based that you don't really get to P2W very effectively unless you spend a ton, I think, and even then you can win loads of the same MT items just from several hours put into the story events, or by focusing your free time into an event that you think you can do well in.Yet I hesitate to give this game a positive recommendation. I like it, but one thing really irks me. As a microtransaction-based game, it's unforgivable in my eyes that the accounts from different platforms play together but people cannot access their mobile account on PC and vice versa. If you are making a microtransaction game, especially since I noticed the mobile version already has Google+ and Facebook integration, you have to have this basic functionality since the game's pricing model is based on constantly spending money.So while I like the game, I will not give it my recommendation until this is implemented as I feel that this is a necessary step for them to earn my thumbs up. They apparently have manually merged some accounts ""in the past"" but have since stopped doing so for everyone else.			"

												Despite a lot of negative reviews criticizing this game for the microtransactions, I highly recommend it. The microtransactions are mainly for ""hero points,"" which is a rare currency in the game that is mainly used for increasing your roster size and letting you collect more heroes/villains. I have played for about 30 hours at the time of this review without a single penny spent and I've loved it. Now that we've covered the microtransactions, the real review.Marvel Puzzle Quest is a match three game, like Candy Crush Saga or Bejeweled. Each team has three heroes (or villains) per battle, and each match you make gives damage to the enemy team. You can earn more characters for your team by completing battles, winning PvP and campaign events, or buying them using Iso-8 (another currency which is much more common) and Hero Points. PvP Events are released frequently, which let you fight another player's team which is usually paired up with a hero from that event, like Deadpool or Wolverine. There's also a campaign mode where you fight game A.I. for Iso-8 and sometimes Hero Points.Overall, I'd say it's a really cool game and despite all the negative reviews, you should download it and check it out.

												I got into this one thinking, ""Gee, if the mobile version is any indication, it would be wonderful to have a supplementary version I can switch to at will on my PC and play when I want a fullscreen experience."" While waiting for the download I scrolled down to the reviews and notice not a single recommend. After playing it for more than two minutes it's clear to me why.Having played on my Galaxy SIII prior to this, I assumed (incorrectly) that there would be some way to link my accounts and resume play on the desktop version, perhaps Facebook or Google+ or such. But nope. If you played the game on your smart device, you haven't played it on PC. No such option exists, and it sends you straight through the exact same tutorials I went through on the mobile version, albeit with a rather poorly designed interface (if you can really say there's one to speak of).The horrible design I can somewhat deal with (I expected a superior version to mobile), but upon learning that there was no way to sync between my smart device and this version, complete dealbreaker. I realize people bash the crap out of D3's decision to make the game pay to win, but I actually have put money into it prior, so seeing the branding not scale whatsoever between versions is a pitiful excuse at best. If they fix this (which is unlikely, given the game seems to think you're playing it on a tablet by design and is literally a direct port of the widescreen tablet version), I would possibly love the desktop version until the end of time. As it is, I'm sure not paying money all over again for the same content.			"

												It's your basic match 3 puzzle game like Bejeweled or Candy Crush but with a fun Marvel spin on it.  Addicting and very fun for anyone that loves the occasional Marvel movie and colorful puzzle games.  I've played this off and on for a long time now and it's still a favorite game to relax and unwind with.  The upgrades for the characters give you meaningful progression to work on and theres challenges and new unlocks to always be striving towards.  It even has some PvP for those who want to test their skills at puzzle solving against other players.			"

												The game is what it is. Complaining that it's freemium is silly, because you already knew that going in. The idea that you can't ""win"" without paying is also silly. There's no ""winning"" in an ongoing game. You might win or lose individual battles, but that has nothing to do with spending money. I invest little time in it on my mobile devices, and still manage to get in the top 100 in tournaments fairly regularly. If you want ALL of the covers and ALL of the characters, then yeah, you'll have to spend at some point. But it's perfectly playable with the random drops.The one thing that does peeve me a bit is that there's no way to link mobile to PC. If you can link across mobile devices, you should be able to link to the PC version. I suspect that's because it's on Steam, but still frustrating. Though, if you do want to play a ""new"" game, it's good for that.			"

												This is good attempt to make F2P from Puzzle Quest. There are only familiar PQ battles - no pets, no equip, no locks - only the battles. But they are quite good. And the upgrading Marvel heroes instead equip makes it interesting too. There is one problem though - the new heroes requires a new slots, and without slots you most probably will miss your special rewards. But game was quite generous to give me 7 slots from initial questing money, and later... well, I shell be able to manage it later. But if you want the many different heroes, fast, prepare to pay.As it's F2P, payment or grinding for battle wins expected, as usual. All your heroes lose life force during the battles, and it can be gained only with time - or with the health packs->donations. So if you want a long games, prepare to pay. For me and my half-hour sessions it's all right.The game have quite a big amount of NPC-grinding locations, but most challenges came from PvP battles in special events. Unfortunately, most of time (but not always) it means losing. For my non-buffed heroes one-two battles per day is manageable, but rarely more. But as rewards are much bigger than loses, nothing to complain for me. If I cannot kill today's enemies, I'll farm NPC instead.Bottom line: good PQ-like game for 20-30 minutes per day. Can be frustrating for longer.			"

												As far as casual games go, this one is pretty epic in it's time-consuming...ness. I enjoy it quite a bit, but I've always been a fan of puzzle games, not excluding the 'match 3' genre. This one isn't as in-depth as say... Puzzle Quest 2 which is made by a totally different company, but I think there's still enough there if you want something more than Bejewelled. I think the best part is figuring out which heroes/villains work the best together and trying to build up their combos and such. As far as downsides go, I really don't like the weak AI, the randomness of drops and the money for power aspect. I'll go into each point by point here. The only real challenge comes from the level of your opponent, which determines how much HP they have and damage they do. When it comes to the actual gameplay, you can easily predict what they're going to do as they have certain priorities. They definitely play worse than a thinking person would. I would like it more if they made better decisions, as frustrating as that could be.As far as getting loot goes, you have very little control over what you get. Essentially you do different missions, most of which have four rewards. The first time you beat a mission, you're guaranteed one of them. Typically, you'll get ISO (the game's main currency) Hero Coins (the game's premium currency), heroes or random hero tokens, or boosts. Each time you repeat the mission, you'll have a chance to get a reward that you haven't already received or 20 ISO (which is a tiny tiny amount) This does get frustrating after a while, especially if you're trying to get a specific reward. Now, in order to get more characters, you need to either complete certain missions, trade in recruit tokens of varying quality or progress/place well enough in events (there's usually something going on every day). The problem here is with the tokens. Some guarantee a certain quality of hero, but it's still random since if there's a character you want, there's next to no guarantee you'll get them. They break down the odds on their website, but it doesn't really help. But that's not the worst thing.The worst thing is of course the bane of most free-to-play games. Paying for power. You can buy two things: ISO and Hero coins, the two currencies of the game. ISO is used to level up your characters and buy more low-quality ones. Coins allow you to buy more recruit tokens of higher quality, level up hero powers, (which aside from their actual effects, allow you to raise the character level higher) protect your characters in PvP mode (>:| ) but most importantly, buy more slots for characters. That last one is really frustrating, because you can only increase your character slots with coins, and if you don't want to spend money, you're going to have to inevitably pass up on recruiting certain characters, or get rid of ones you've progressed on in order to get new ones simply because if you don't buy coins, it's a hell of a grind to get more. The worst of the worst is that the coins/ISO are really expensive for your dollar, and I think don't really give you proper value. If you want to make this one of the only games you play it might be acceptable, but if you want to just play casually, I highly recommend not spending the money on it.Myself, I've put in a fair amount of time, so I begrudgingly purchased some coins to help open up some space for more characters on both my steam account and my iPad. ~sigh~Anyways, if you can overlook all the shortcomings, it's still a fun puzzle game, and you CAN get by without dropping any of your hard-earned cash on it. I recommend giving it a try if you're into the genre at all, especially considering it IS free.			"

												8/30/14 - Changed review to positive, though I imagine it still would be much more of a burden for people starting out to have to deal w/ massive downtimes when they don't have the roster to pick and choose, and remain competitive, when they run out of lives and have to wait, I still enjoy the game quite a bit.  I don't like the new healing mechanic that limits your healing to in-battle only regeneration, but, it's not as much of a game breaker as I had expected.  But again, that might be due to the depth of my roster and having multiple options to choose from in order to play-on while out of lives/regens.  Give it a whirl though, it is addictive.As you can see I have been intensely addicted to this game for months now.  And the game WAS fantastic.  However, in what I still cannot comprehend, the dev's at D3 have decided that they no longer want people to become addicted to their game.  They no longer want us telling our friends how fun it is, how they should give it a go and become MPQ addicts like we are.  No... now they have taken any sense of allowing their players the freedom to play when they want, how they want, w/ whatever characters they CHOOSE to play and have thrown it all in the garbage.  I am an AVID supporter of games and developers who show that they care for, listen to, and support the player community which gives them a job, a fan base, and a slew of addicts who advertise this game as a wonderful time-sink to all their friends/family/co-workers for free.  But apparently, FREE advertising doesn't figure into their bottom line and they would rather lose 1000's of loyal players if it means that 1-2 people w/ the fortune and freedom to invest money at will into buying extra lives every time the RNG unluckily kills off all their characters.  Loyal players who will NEVER pay for, what would be, an endless need for health-packs to keep playing at the times these players have allotted themselves to play... are GONE.  The only competition new players, or even players looking to experiment and try different character/team set-ups, will face are going to be these whales that invest so much money into the game that they are UNBEATABLE.  NO NEW PLAYER WILL STAND A CHANCE when the only competition left are those with pockets deep enough to make it utterly unfair.I will continue to log on 1x -2x a day, in hopes that the dev's will realize, acknowledge, and correct this unfathomably inept decision to cut the legs out from any player who is new, growing, learning, or trying to figure out if the game is WORTH spending real money on.  It makes 0 sense.  NONE.  AT ALL.  If this isn't fixed in a week, I will uninstall this game and move on w/ my life.  And, if you check the hours I have put into playing, I thoroughly understand the mechanics behind the game as well as the MASSIVE hindrance this change would put into my own ability to play.  And I'm not someone w/ a poor roster just wanting to get a feel for it and decide if it's worth my time and money.By refusing to let players develop their own style, experiment w/ different characters w/o the feeling that, if they lose, they'll have to wait 2-6 hours before they can play again, this product is going to plunge into the depths of being another 'free-to-play' game which is in NO WAY competitive, fair, enjoyable, or worth our time and money.  People who love this game and play it daily are already dropping out, along w/ their free advertising... New players will be faced w/ unbeatable teams funded by players w/ pockets deep enough to not care, and this MASSIVELY UNAPPEALING wall of dead-time where they can do NOTHING but sit and wait for the game to slowly heal them over a 2-6 hour period.  IT IS PURELY BAFFLING TO NOT BE ABLE TO COMPREHEND HOW AWFUL THIS WILL BE TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO FALL IN LOVE WITH A GAME.  How do you hope to attract, entertain, and KEEP players playing when you DON'T let them play for hours on end?  NO ONE is going to pay money, to a game, that they have 0 chance of being able to jump in, experiment, and get their feet wet in competition that is so far skewed towards players who buy the best characters and level them up w/o any work cause they can afford it.  Those players, like myself, who have put in HOURS AND HOURS of time learning the game, developing strategies to be able to out-last, out play, and still remain highly competitive with those players who cheat their way up using cash are going to be GONE.  I sincerely hoped this is fixed in the next 7 days, or I will feel so dumb for having invested so much time and energy into a game which doesn't consider 90% of their fan-base when making decisions about how to move their product forward.Sincerely, A once loyal and dedicated, and HOPEFULLY FUTURE loyal and dedicated, fan and player.

												~100 hours for this game. Recent patches made it a disaster. When earlier it could be both casual and competitive at the same time, now its gone worse than pay2win, it made a severe turn for pay2play. In tournaments the rich get richer and new players get f***** up real good. Earlier the developers were co-operative with the community and the game was fun and even a newcomer could make a significant impact on the tournament standings and get some awesome rewards.Don't you worry! the game has microtransactions and you will NEED to spend money on this monstrosity in order to progress or get any rankings in the tournaments.Balancing has gone a rough way, the first big changes to characters came up from nowhere dimilishing their potential entirely. Once a overused always seen char went to plain common or even bad, changes just were too radical and unexpected. The most balancing issue was doubling the common booster prices and making the best boosts costing in-game currency which is nearly impossible to get without spending real money, so... want to fight with the best ways? Okay, go ahead and pay 50cents for each fight, doesnt sound bad? Yeah for the most part you will need at least 40 matches in a tournament to get to the good positions, thats like 20 bucks for simply trying to play the game! Character's skills can also be boosted! only 3-20$ for each cover which you need 15 in order to make one of your characters most useful, not mentioning the huge money drop (a ridicilous amount needed) for boosting it's levels.TL;DR Once a fun and an exciting game 5/5 went to greedy as ♥♥♥♥ microtransactions simply for playing the game, dont even consider supporting the developers. As a free to play -player you cant get anything done.			"

												I really enjoy waiting for an hour between rounds while my characters heal... It's bearable at the start when it takes a couple minutes and you can play a few rounds, but it gets steadily worse. The difficulty curve is sharp after the introduction missions, that factor combined with the RNG bejeweled style board means that you'll be watching your heal timer a lot after a failed mission. The demand for cash from D3 publisher is inescapable if you actually want to play the game at any level of efficiency you might need to throw cash at this game. The game gets a plus for having fun game play mixed with Marvel characters, but there are just too many drawbacks to make this game worth recommending. There is a loose RPG system in which you level up characters by collecting comic books, but it's marred by the fact that it too is RNG based (unless you use money).  Some iconic characters are given to you at the start of the game, but everything you get afterwards is all random and the majority of heroes I've received thus far are terrible or useless. You need to continually advance in the game if you desire better rewards, but any impression of success is stymied when you get your seventh 'Hawk-Eye' in a row or some equally as rage worthy hero thanks to the RNG rewards. This game would be much better if there was a way to slowly work towards a hero comic that compliments your roster, one that you can chose and grind towards. Success would feel much better and the grind would be worth the effort if you could finally piece together your Marvel Dream Team and smite some foes with righteous fury. Instead you're forced to use valuable experience, recruitment tokens, and gold to expand your roster never knowing who you're going to get. I've got a 5/5/- black widow and I just keep getting her comic books, it's driving me insane...The gameplay is a bit stiff in comparison to previous iterations of the PQ franchise and some attack animations are slow and repetitive. The graphics aren't anything to write home about and everything just feels slow. This game is a step backwards in almost every area and far too frustrating to be worth time or money. Just get Puzzle Quest 2 and enjoy that game, this debacle doesn't do the franchise justice and is a blemish on an otherwise amazing series of games.			"

												This has major stability issues.  It's gotten somewhat better since it reached release edition, but I've been on Pyweek teams that wrote more complicated games in a week than this without stability issues.I very much want to recommend this game, and have enjoyed most of my 500 hours in it, but until the game stops crashing of its own volition or such crashes stop counting against the player, I can't do so.

												Yes it's very much in beta, but you would be better off playing Marvel Heroes (especially if you've bought any of their DLC) rather than paying for it again in, what is, just Bejeweled with power-ups and a simple story attached.That said, if you treat it as a game you spend a few minutes in? It will be an okay, but not great, experience.  I have to wonder how many children with a Steam account would play this though because, as I see it, anyone who is 15 years old and above would see through the transparent nature of the game and be against these kind of microtransactions from the get-go.  Then again, there are those who are playing Hearthstone and buying card packs for that...so no doubt there are some that will buy for this too.In any event, right now I couldn't recommend this game.  Something to revisit in a few months perhaps, just to see if there have been any improvements.			"

I would have bought this game without the little fees here and there.  If you like puzzle quest games you have nothing to lose, at least have fun with it for a few hours...because after that it spirals downward rather quick.			"

												Since I like Marvel stuff and I enjoyed Puzzle Quest, I thought this would be a no-brainer and tried to stick it out. Unfortunately, the microtransactions just ruin it. You cannot just play or collect in a way that's very enjoyable - people comment about it being ""free to play, pay to win"" and this is very true. For me it's also ""free to play, pay to actually enjoy it"". Probably my chief complaint in this regard is that rather than paying for rewards, you can 'achieve' rewards through your gameplay (which is fine)... unless you don't have room, in which case you need to pay for the rewards you've achieved through gameplay anyway.Could have been great, but very quickly loses its appeal even for fans of both franchises (unless you have money to burn). For those of you that are looking for something to play in short bursts while commuting every day rather than playing for conentrated periods of time, you may have a different experience.			"

												Ok so this game has to be one of the greatest games ever built.  Not only does it offer the addictive fun of gem matching but includes the familiarty and fun of the Marvel universe while still allowing for a deep game experience with RPG type elements of skill building and character leveling.  This game is winner!  Even works on my old crumby computer.  Some may not consider this to be a good thing but this game is 1 of only 2 games I have every bought in game pruchases for in my life.  I just can't let those top tier marvel characters slip through my finger ;)  Honestly though, you will not be disapointed in the free-to-play strategy game.  Also of note is this game is appropriate for all ages.  I can play this in front of my 4 yr old with no guilt.			"

												I do like this game, in fact it is my favorite of all the Puzzle Quest and Bejewelled clone games, but I can not recommend it.First, what I love about this game. The powers. Collecting superheroes, each with their own unique powers to use during gameplay, is fun. And using said powers is easily the main draw to this game. And if that was all this game was, it would be an easy recommend to everyone. But unfortunately it's not. It will take a certain type of gamer to appreciate this game, due to the several hurdles said gamers will have to agree to live with.The cons. This is a very competitive game. As a player, you are expected to compete versus a thousand other players for any type of interesting reward. And you will fail. A lot! You would have to be willing to put in the time, LOTS OF TIME, to grow your collection of heroes, just to be able to compete. And even then, you will still lose. Mainly because winning matches is NOT the way to win the big rewards. Being the strongest (and lots of luck) is. And this is where my biggest complaint falls; this game rewards the older players. The rich get richer, while the poor struggle to survive.There are three areas of gameplay. The Prologue which is entirely single player and then there's the Stories and Versus which is where you will be spending all your time. It's probably best to choose one or the other to focus on for best results, but either way it's still very much an uphill battle. And either way it will be hours upon hours of grind to earn your tablescraps. The worst being how punishing the game can be to those who take a break from the game for severla hours (sleep, school, work, etc.) You can spend 23 hours fighting and securing a top place finish, just to have the rug swept out from under you in the last few minutes. Uncontrollably. Unless you pay.So now we get to the currency of the game. First there's ISO-8 which is fairly easy to come by and mainly used for levelling your heroes. Then there's Gold, which is much more difficult to earn and can be used for either shielding yourself in Versus Mode (which does NOT guarantee anything!) or for adding roster slots so you can collect more heroes to use. You can also spend ISO and Gold on covers (which you use to level hero powers or gain new heroes if you have the roster space.) I do NOT recommend doing so though, since you will gain more covers than you will gain roster slots, meaning a LOT of covers will be going to waste since they come with an experation date. Spend your Gold on roster spaceas and your ISO on levelling heroes and purchasing gameplay boosts to quicken battles. Also note, you will need a big roster because a lot of the Story campaigns will constantly be limitting which heroes you will be able to use.There's also in-game purchases, which I do NOT recommend. You can buy ISO-8 which would be a complete waste of money and also Gold which is much more useful, but I still don't recommend. I did purchase some Gold, but it was more due to wishing to support the game than because it was needed. There is also a new purchase called VIP which will give you daily rewards for a limited time. Browsing over the list of items didn't make it very appealing to me, though it is probably the best over-all deal. If you're looking for an early boost to your game, it would probably help. But again, NOT needed. The only real thing you can give this game is time. Lots and lots of time. A new annoyance though is the constant advertisement for the new VIP purchase though. Almost as bad as the Windows 10 pop-ups!Lastly, there are cheaters in this game. The good news is once found, they are moved to their own private servers. The bad news is before they're found, they will ruin your chances for decent rewards, collecting them for themselves (which is frustrating considering they don't need them because they can just cheat.) Almost every single Story and Versus campaign I've played, one or two of the top spots were filled with players who obviously couldn't be there by normal means. Not even with luck on their side. This is especially frustrating considering how much effort you will need to put into getting the meager spot you end up with.One last thing, this game punishes you for crashing. It doesn't matter if it's from bugs, freezing, crashing, or your internet connection. If you leave a battle it considers you a quiter and punishes you for it. I've even already won a battle, gained my rewards, and had my heroes damaged because of the game server acting up. Nothing on my end. And I've had several battles where the game forgets to shuffle the gems when there's no move, especially after a power is used. The only thing you can do is retreat and lose the battle, no matter how badly you were crushing the AI.So will I continue to play this game? Of course. I'm ""invested."" But don't follow my lead unless you're okay with what you're getting yourself into. This is NOT a casual, or friendly, game.			"

												A great game ruined by micro-transactions.Wait 3 minutes for a finished review or pay $.99An amalgamation of Puzzle Quest and Marvel works wonders.  Finding your characters through comic books is a nice touch, and the campaigns, while contrived, are enjoyable.  After all, Puzzle Quest doesn't need any extra flavoring to be addicting and fun.  Marvel just makes an already great concept better.Wait 2 minutes for a finished review or pay $.50The graphics are colorful and crisp, and just seeing screen caps of your favorite Marvel characters draw you in to your inner child.Wait 1 minutes for a finished review or pay $.25My advice is to stay away from this game.  Game studios shouldn't be rewarded for this type of micro-transaction behavior.  Build the game so you can truely play for free [no buying a victory], and enhance your experience for cash.  I would have been happy to pay $20 or more for this game, and then buy additional campaigns later on - but I don't see an end to the well they want money dropped down.  For that reason, I pass. "

												This is a fairly basic drop-down puzzle game. It lacks the scope of the mind bending Galactrix and yet remains far more addictive due to the appeal of collecting marvel heroes and boosting their ""powers"". It is very easy to throw money at early on and I would advise anyone considering it long-term to avoid putting too much effort into developing ""one star"" heroes since they will quickly become superceeded and the level restriction will eventually make them of little use. Also, the ""value"" of these heroes in terms of selling them on for iso/coin is nowhere even close to what you will spend to make them worth anything in the first place. This aside, the developers keep things interesting with many daily and weekly events and it is perfectly plausible to play this indefinitely without spending any money at all. This makes MPQ:DR a must for anyone who can resist the urge to splurge from their wallet. Don't get too caught up with it and treat it as casual gaming and it will give you many hours of entertainment.			"

												A surprisingly great match 3 game that has a good story along with all of your favorite Marvel heroes. You can (via collecting in game cards through playing the game, or if you really want, by paying REAL money) play as pretty much anyone in the Marvel universe. Daken? sure. Black Widow (I and II) not a problem! paperbag wearing Spider-Man? Yep, he's there too.Play the story, or compete against other players teams, the choice is yours! And when your heroes get beaten up and need a  health replenish, either use an in game health pack (you can win them in game or buy them, your choice) or just play another game for an hour while they recharge their batteries, ready for another fight.It's not a pay to play game, I've put a good few hours into the game and have not spent a penny. If you enjoy match three puzzle games and are looking for something to play to kill a few minutes here and there, you could do a lot worse than Marvel Puzzle Quest.			"

Hiking up the prices of boost, lowering the chances of getting a 3 star character from packs (from a 100% chance of at least 1 3 star character to a 3% to 5% chance to get one in a 10 character pack)  and charging Hero Points for everything is not the best way to earn you fanbase's trust but the game still is enjoyable.Try not to spend your HP in packs.

												Free to play, pay to win taken to the next level.-Pay money if you lose in a stage or wait until your characters recover, recovery time varies from minutes to HOURS!-To level up your characters and progress you need to pay money or be lucky with random drops-Unlocking hero skills can cost 110 Euros or take a lot of luckI was browsing through the f2p games for a bit and wanted a simple game to kill some time since i didn´t really felt like playing one of my games or wasting some time on the internet. That´s how i stumbled upon this seemingly innocent little puzzle game. I always liked superheroes and so i decided to give it a shot. But what was in store for me was actually just a really mean ways of grabbing money. Don´t get me wrong im more than willing to spend a few bucks on a f2p game if i get the feeling it´s a fun game and some real effort went into it. That´s also the reason i own some skins in League of Legends for example.But this here is just a tired puzzle game programmed to bring frustration. It´s hard to explain without having played it, but imagined that you feel cheated in many of the stages. Since there is no time limit you can and have to plan your moves and the basic concept of lining up 3 pieces of the same color can be expanded by planning where the remaining pieces will drop once you remove 3 of them. In some of the stages you are the only one directly moving pieces while the computer just adds pieces with certain effects that harm you, while in others the computer tries to remove pieces aswell. Now i put some planning into my moves trying to maximize the outcome and even chaining pieces and so on, but no matter what sometimes the computer just decides to drop the right pieces for your opponent deliberately. I know this might sound a little like a sore loser, but imagine you spend a few minutes thinking and you make a move that removes a lot of pieces via chains and then the computer just drops 5 pieces of the same color in his turn, dealing even more damage than you did.Ok, ok you might say this is where the difficulty comes from, but it´s just my subjective point of view that it feels incredibly cheap. Also this isn´t the real problem of the game, remember i said somthing about greed and pay to win. When you loose in a stage your heroes faint and will need time to recover after the battle. How long you might ask? How about 2 FU***** hours? Go do your laundry, plant a tree or beat up a hobo, because you will wait or pay. As you level up your heroes they gain more hitpoints but also if they die/faint in a battle it takes forever until you can use them again, unless you pay money... Wow this is farmville standard bulls*** and pretty much what totally kills the game for me.Of course you can own more heroes in case your team gets defeated but the number of heroes you can own/use is limited, how can you own more heroes? Find ingame currency after certain bossbattles or pay money. This ain´t so bad right? After i acquire a hero i´m all set, right? Nope. All the heroes need to level up before they are actually useful in a stage, they all start with low hitpoints and just 1 skill. Furthermore they have a maxlevel capacity of 6 out of let´s say 85, which means you can´t progress until you unlock their higher levels. They can gain maxlevels and skills by finding comicbookcovers after stages, or by buying them. More rare heroes are more powerful and more expensive and can be leveled up beyond the level of your weak starting heroes. Now lets calculate how much 1 hero costs. Assuming you are lucky and get a 3 star hero after buying a random cover for 2 Euros, let´s say Loki for example. Each of his 9 remaing skill points comes at a whooping 12 Euros, which means you would in theory spend 110 Euros on one playable character... wow just wow. For 110 Euros you can buy the lengendary edition of Skyrim... 3 times. Also don´t forget your stronger heroes still need to gain levels until they reach their unlocked maxlevel via Iso-8 but i spare you from calculating that aswell.I have no idea how IGN.com and the other fu**-ups that call themselves reviewers can find this scam of a game even playable, but i assume they haven´t even played it and just wrote whatever the developing company paid them to do.In my opionion you should stay as far away from this piece of sh** as possible.

												This is a frustrating game because there are so many parts of it that could be so good. But that was months ago for me and the longer I play and the longer I see what the devs are doing to the game the less I even enjoy the parts of it that I once did.  Nearly every change since I started playing has been for the worse.It lulls you into thinking that it might be easy or playable when you first start because the matchmaking and enemy difficulty seems to understand how to scale with you at that point but the longer you play the more all of that goes out the window. It becomes this banal uphill struggle for any foothold to just get a measly amount of ISO to level up. And that doesn't matter anyway, the better you do the harder they make they game so you'll do worse the next week until it evens out to just doing boringly.I did spend money on this game, not a lot but that's not the point. This isn't a pay to win game, I mean it could be but only if you put in hundreds of dollars but before an input of that size you're really not getting that much, if anything, out of putting money into this game, Maybe I'm wrong and all the people that seem to win every tournament or even any PvE event are putting money into the game but I don't think so, I just think they started earlier when there was less competition.That's all this game is, an endless and fruitless competition. I've gotten close to even winning a few tournaments but it was a really hollow thing to do that. You have to throw all your time and effort to come away with anything at all and if you play casually you'll get next to nothing because there is nothing outside of the prologue that isn't played against other people and unless you can throw hours and hours and hours a day into this game then past the prologue you'll just founder and flail.It might seem appealing now but don't bother. It will suck the marrow from your bones and leave you wishing you never started. Just go play some old Puzzle Quest games and look up some Marvel Trading cards online to look at, it won't be as enticing but at least it won't leave as bitter as I am at this mess of a game.			"

												~100 hours for this game. Recent patches made it a disaster. When earlier it could be both casual and competitive at the same time, now its gone worse than pay2win, it made a severe turn for pay2play. In tournaments the rich get richer and new players get f***** up real good. Earlier the developers were co-operative with the community and the game was fun and even a newcomer could make a significant impact on the tournament standings and get some awesome rewards.Don't you worry! the game has microtransactions and you will NEED to spend money on this monstrosity in order to progress or get any rankings in the tournaments.Balancing has gone a rough way, the first big changes to characters came up from nowhere dimilishing their potential entirely. Once a overused always seen char went to plain common or even bad, changes just were too radical and unexpected. The most balancing issue was doubling the common booster prices and making the best boosts costing in-game currency which is nearly impossible to get without spending real money, so... want to fight with the best ways? Okay, go ahead and pay 50cents for each fight, doesnt sound bad? Yeah for the most part you will need at least 40 matches in a tournament to get to the good positions, thats like 20 bucks for simply trying to play the game! Character's skills can also be boosted! only 3-20$ for each cover which you need 15 in order to make one of your characters most useful, not mentioning the huge money drop (a ridicilous amount needed) for boosting it's levels.TL;DR Once a fun and an exciting game 5/5 went to greedy as ♥♥♥♥ microtransactions simply for playing the game, dont even consider supporting the developers. As a free to play -player you cant get anything done.			"

												I was realing enjoying the game and would have recommended it to someone looking for a casual gaming experince but not anymore.  Ever since the ""True Healing"" patch was implemented it has crippled the game to the point were it is not fun anymore.I have never lucked into the right covers to build up a large base of 3 star characters so I depended on healing to be competitive with the 2 star characters I have.  Now that is gone and once the timed health packs are gone I am done for the day; I'm lucky if I get in an hour sessions anymore (unless I am willing to spend money, of course) where before I could get 2+ hours in at a time, if desired.When this game was fun I would spend money as an acknowledgement of a good game but since this change they will not get one more cent from me.Unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket avoid this game until they retract the ""True Healing"" change.

A better attempt at a true sequel to the first puzzle quest than Space Quest or Puzzle Quest 2.  The micro transactions ruin it however.  I will mention that the saves are local though...so yeah.

												A surprisingly great match 3 game that has a good story along with all of your favorite Marvel heroes. You can (via collecting in game cards through playing the game, or if you really want, by paying REAL money) play as pretty much anyone in the Marvel universe. Daken? sure. Black Widow (I and II) not a problem! paperbag wearing Spider-Man? Yep, he's there too.Play the story, or compete against other players teams, the choice is yours! And when your heroes get beaten up and need a  health replenish, either use an in game health pack (you can win them in game or buy them, your choice) or just play another game for an hour while they recharge their batteries, ready for another fight.It's not a pay to play game, I've put a good few hours into the game and have not spent a penny. If you enjoy match three puzzle games and are looking for something to play to kill a few minutes here and there, you could do a lot worse than Marvel Puzzle Quest.			"

												Overwhelmingly Pay to Win type of game, you'll have to put up with being beaten repeatedly over and over and over in the PVP setup before you can hope to win anything to start putting up a fight. A number of messages in game are misleading, including in PVP where it states that you will not lose health from retreating but you end up always with at least one of the team members dead.Interesting concept, but the Pay To Play features make sure that you'll be in the Navy Man's Barrel for a very very long time.

												A great game ruined by micro-transactions.Wait 3 minutes for a finished review or pay $.99An amalgamation of Puzzle Quest and Marvel works wonders.  Finding your characters through comic books is a nice touch, and the campaigns, while contrived, are enjoyable.  After all, Puzzle Quest doesn't need any extra flavoring to be addicting and fun.  Marvel just makes an already great concept better.Wait 2 minutes for a finished review or pay $.50The graphics are colorful and crisp, and just seeing screen caps of your favorite Marvel characters draw you in to your inner child.Wait 1 minutes for a finished review or pay $.25My advice is to stay away from this game.  Game studios shouldn't be rewarded for this type of micro-transaction behavior.  Build the game so you can truely play for free [no buying a victory], and enhance your experience for cash.  I would have been happy to pay $20 or more for this game, and then buy additional campaigns later on - but I don't see an end to the well they want money dropped down.  For that reason, I pass. "

												This is a fairly basic drop-down puzzle game. It lacks the scope of the mind bending Galactrix and yet remains far more addictive due to the appeal of collecting marvel heroes and boosting their ""powers"". It is very easy to throw money at early on and I would advise anyone considering it long-term to avoid putting too much effort into developing ""one star"" heroes since they will quickly become superceeded and the level restriction will eventually make them of little use. Also, the ""value"" of these heroes in terms of selling them on for iso/coin is nowhere even close to what you will spend to make them worth anything in the first place. This aside, the developers keep things interesting with many daily and weekly events and it is perfectly plausible to play this indefinitely without spending any money at all. This makes MPQ:DR a must for anyone who can resist the urge to splurge from their wallet. Don't get too caught up with it and treat it as casual gaming and it will give you many hours of entertainment.			"

												Puzzlequest1 was pretty deep and enjoyable gameplay. Puzzlequest2 is more shallow and more polished graphics. And then there is Marvel Puzzle Quest which is nothing more than pure greed. You have to buy slots. You have to pay to revive your heroes. You have to pay for consumables. Worst of all, the savegames are local on your MyDocuments folder. This means it's prone to cheaters and when you erase your computer, you WILL lose all the coins and dollars you've fed to your heroes. This game is not entertainment, it's a cashmachine for the developers that once made a cool game called PuzzleQuest1.

												If you like Puzzle Quest and Marvel, this game is for you. The problem is, as others are saying, it is a microtransaction heavy game. It could be so much better, if they toned down that aspect of it and made the rewards better. I have some high level ""covers"" thanks to the DLC sale and getting a little lucky with recruit gambles. I would really like to see fair rewards, and the microtransactions turned down a bit. The music is very repetative, so that needs to be improved. You can always just turn the sound off and rock out to your own tracks via windowed mode. Much of this game is a combination of luck and patience, or if you are willing to shed some $$$ it can get good. Many FreetoPlay games have this same mentality, i have also seen many fail because of this. D3 - if you want your game to be a success, take my advice and tone down the money-aspect of the game. If you set it all on making a profit, this game will be short lived. However, if you show that you are willing to ease up power up costs and give better story mode/tournament rewards, people may be more willing to support you and it will work out in your favor. I know i would buy more if you did this. I recommend this game for puzzle quest fans, but, remember that unless your willing to shell out some cash, you are better off playing vanilla PQ 1, 2, and Challenge of the Warlords.			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest is, at the core, a pretty fun experience. There are quite a few characters to aquire for your team (a number which continues to grow as the developers add more characters to the game) and they generally come with unique play mechanics that make certain combinations more effective than others.Characters aside, however, this game falls off the bus very quickly. The game is inaccurately marketed as free to play when, in fact, the only players who will realisitcally be competitive in tournaments or see the end of the single player campaign are the ones who have shelled out anywhere between 50-100 dollars. If you hope to max out your heroes and keep up with the ever growing roster be prepared to spend even more money (100 dollars is not nearly enough to max out a decent character's level). Unfortunately this is not a game I would ever recommend to any sane person. The costs are just too high and the returns too low. When, if ever, the pay to win mechanic is removed this could easily be one of the better puzzle rpgs. Until then stay far away. Marvel Puzzle Quest is a huge disappointment.			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign Marvel Puzzle Quest is the newest game in the Puzzle Quest line of games. This series has seen a lot of iterations and copycats over the years, with none being nearly as successful as the original title. This latest is an officially licensed Marvel title with the Puzzle Quest formula. It has the added benefit of being entirely free-to-play. You may of course purchase bonuses like any other free title, but these purchases are not required to play the full game. Is this latest attempt at a Puzzle Quest success worth a look, or should you just let it speed by and fade into the distance? Keep reading, perhaps I can help you decide.  To begin with, the Marvel universe has been utilized pretty well here. You have a team of three characters, each with three possible powers to be used. Typically you begin with one of these powers and you must find comic covers of the character to unlock or upgrade said powers. This also allows you to level up your character a little bit more each time. It’s a system that constantly keeps you feeling like you’re making some kind of progress and it works very well. Winning battles and missions grants you rewards, randomized from a pool of up to four for each story mission, giving you reasons to play missions again and again until you’ve received every reward available. It’s structured remarkably well for any game, let alone a free-to-play title. It’s a nice change of pace to see a free game with a lot of effort put into it. The content level is more than a lot of full priced games have, and the developers deserve some credit for it.  The presentation is decent. Each character is represented by a comic book cover from any number of different Marvel universes, and has a full 3D model as well as a 2D comic profile. Everything is vibrant and colorful and stands out very well in a sea of photo-realistic browns and grays of more recent games. The music is a bit generic, but it’s suitable for a superhero game. There are lots of highs and thumping bass tracks to drive the combat forward. It can certainly get repetitive, but that’s what the volume slider in the options menu is for. Overall, it doesn’t detract from the experience any and fits in well enough that some may not really notice it. On to the meat of things; the gameplay! I’m pleased to say that the gameplay of Marvel Puzzle Quest is, well, fantastic to be perfectly honest with you. It is a very well implemented use of the Puzzle Quest formula with enough difference and excitement to stand well on its own feet. Each color is representative of one member of your team, and has an icon to indicate which member that is. Wolverine, for example, is represented by scratch marks across the gems, while Storm has lightning bolts. Each icon makes sense and stands out well, making it easy to determine who will be attacking. Collecting gems allows you to use character powers, which can drastically change the way a fight is going. More powerful abilities take more preparation time and cause severe damage, while less powerful abilities can be used more often but do less damage or have fewer utility effects attached. There is a story mode separated into four separate mission groups, which will last you a good number of hours to complete. There are also daily and weekly missions and a PVP mode to keep you playing as long as your interest remains. Each of these modes offers its own rewards and characters, and as a result each also adds a huge amount of content to the game.  As for the dreaded free-to-play purchased content that inevitably unbalances these games? Well…it is present, but it’s not nearly as bad as other games often are. You can purchase the two currencies present in the game in bulk quantities, and use those currencies to recruit more and rarer characters or power up your existing heroes. It does unbalance the multiplayer somewhat if you let it, but it’s not so bad that it ruins the game entirely in that department. In order to counter the unbalancing, you just have to search a bit harder for an opponent on the same level as you. It can definitely be a pain in the backside from time to time but it isn’t something that ruins the overall experience and shouldn’t keep you from giving the game a shot.Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign has far more content and playability than a free game should ever reasonably be expected to contain. If you let it, this game will suck you in and keep you playing into the wee hours of the morning without even realizing it. There are far worse ways you could be spending your free time. Don’t let the price tag fool you; this is one game that doesn’t skimp on the content just because it’s free of charge. Give it a shot and you might be pleasantly surprised. "

												I have been pretty addicted to this game, however I've been playing on my Android phone.  I wish I could link my progress with the PC version.  Anyhow, if you like match 3 games and Marvel, this is really a fun game.  It's rough at the start because you need to build up your characters, which you do by earning in-game currency.  Each character gets capped at a certain level until you essentially win another copy of that character.  You use those extra copies to boost their skills, which raises the level cap.  Once you get going, you can take part in global events that constantly pop in and drop out.  That's where you really earn some good loot.  It's a fun time-killer when you have five minutes to spare.  Check it out.			"

												About 85 hours worth of entertainment and not 1 penny spent. I'd like to continue playing on a regular basis, but I have beaten 100% of the prologue and there is no more story. I managed to max out 2 characters, but because of the randomness of the covers you win, it's difficult to focus your efforts on any one character other than the beginning ones. I'll continue to check the weekly (or whatever) events, but even those I can only play so far into before it becomes impossibly difficult to continue (without spending copious amounts of money to upgrade). There are a lot of issues with the setup of the game, but for the most part, there are worse ways to kill time.			"

												This is a fun, free-to-play take on the Puzzle Quest paradigm set in the Marvel universe with most of its most popular characters.  It is designed for bite-size chunks, and offers a lot of progression both in building up individual characters and in building up your roster giving you new options and new combinations to try out.There is a lot of noise and anger within the community here on Steam involving a recent change to healing characters that now keeps people from endlessly grinding out events.  I am adding this review primarily to wholeheartedly disagree with their viewpoint.  Before the healing change, I was about ready to give up on the game.  I have played for a while, and my roster was filled out and developed pretty nicely for a mostly-free player (I have spent some real money to expand my roster size faster, but never to get new characters or develop them -- the characters and XP equivalent come pretty quickly as you play so I never felt the need to spend money to accelerate that).  Unfortunately, I could never devote 8 or more hours a day to an event, so I never had a chance to win.  Players would grind out an event with their #1 best team of 3 characters until their health was low, then grind out a PvE level to heal those characters back to max, and then go back to grinding out the event again.  The enemy teams were almost always the three same characters, the winners' total scores were ridiculously high, and I was about done with the game.Enter the healing change -- any healing during a battle is now temporary to that battle (with a couple of exceptions that can only heal a character back to about 50% of his health).  Now, event winners must play with various combinations of characters and be better at the game (take less damage) than others, rather than simply spend more time than others on the game.  In my mind, this is a significant improvement to the game's health and will make things work much better in the long run.A final word about a game being 'pay2win' -- For most people, when you think of pay2win games, this references some item that gives a player an advantage that can only be bought with real money, not earned by playing the game.  This game includes NOTHING that fits that category.  There is absolutely nothing in the game that you cannot earn directly by playing the game.  The only reason I spent money on it at all was to support the developers for my time spent and because as a collector I wanted to hold on to all the characters I earned in game (they put a 7-day limit on adding a character to your roster to push for money to be spent there, but even the couple of times I lost a character by not adding them during this limit I have always gotten that character again down the road).  In any event, I only play at most about 10 characters, and I have been placing near the top more and more since this healing change occurred.  For reference, you can get 10 character slots with the free real-money currency you earn within the first month or so of playing.tl;dr -- This is a fun, well designed game, and the developers are thinking about the long-term health of the game with their decisions.  As in many free-to-play games, you must spend either money or time to advance and succeed, but both are viable options.  Additionally, you will need to play well and be smart with both your match-3 tactics and your roster decision strategies to have the best chance to succeed in the game and its events.  Thanks to the recent controversial change that many others complain about, you no longer need to devote 8+ hours a day during an event to have a chance to succeed.			"

												~100 hours for this game. Recent patches made it a disaster. When earlier it could be both casual and competitive at the same time, now its gone worse than pay2win, it made a severe turn for pay2play. In tournaments the rich get richer and new players get f***** up real good. Earlier the developers were co-operative with the community and the game was fun and even a newcomer could make a significant impact on the tournament standings and get some awesome rewards.Don't you worry! the game has microtransactions and you will NEED to spend money on this monstrosity in order to progress or get any rankings in the tournaments.Balancing has gone a rough way, the first big changes to characters came up from nowhere dimilishing their potential entirely. Once a overused always seen char went to plain common or even bad, changes just were too radical and unexpected. The most balancing issue was doubling the common booster prices and making the best boosts costing in-game currency which is nearly impossible to get without spending real money, so... want to fight with the best ways? Okay, go ahead and pay 50cents for each fight, doesnt sound bad? Yeah for the most part you will need at least 40 matches in a tournament to get to the good positions, thats like 20 bucks for simply trying to play the game! Character's skills can also be boosted! only 3-20$ for each cover which you need 15 in order to make one of your characters most useful, not mentioning the huge money drop (a ridicilous amount needed) for boosting it's levels.TL;DR Once a fun and an exciting game 5/5 went to greedy as ♥♥♥♥ microtransactions simply for playing the game, dont even consider supporting the developers. As a free to play -player you cant get anything done.			"

												Yes it's very much in beta, but you would be better off playing Marvel Heroes (especially if you've bought any of their DLC) rather than paying for it again in, what is, just Bejeweled with power-ups and a simple story attached.That said, if you treat it as a game you spend a few minutes in? It will be an okay, but not great, experience.  I have to wonder how many children with a Steam account would play this though because, as I see it, anyone who is 15 years old and above would see through the transparent nature of the game and be against these kind of microtransactions from the get-go.  Then again, there are those who are playing Hearthstone and buying card packs for that...so no doubt there are some that will buy for this too.In any event, right now I couldn't recommend this game.  Something to revisit in a few months perhaps, just to see if there have been any improvements.			"

												I really enjoy waiting for an hour between rounds while my characters heal... It's bearable at the start when it takes a couple minutes and you can play a few rounds, but it gets steadily worse. The difficulty curve is sharp after the introduction missions, that factor combined with the RNG bejeweled style board means that you'll be watching your heal timer a lot after a failed mission. The demand for cash from D3 publisher is inescapable if you actually want to play the game at any level of efficiency you might need to throw cash at this game. The game gets a plus for having fun game play mixed with Marvel characters, but there are just too many drawbacks to make this game worth recommending. There is a loose RPG system in which you level up characters by collecting comic books, but it's marred by the fact that it too is RNG based (unless you use money).  Some iconic characters are given to you at the start of the game, but everything you get afterwards is all random and the majority of heroes I've received thus far are terrible or useless. You need to continually advance in the game if you desire better rewards, but any impression of success is stymied when you get your seventh 'Hawk-Eye' in a row or some equally as rage worthy hero thanks to the RNG rewards. This game would be much better if there was a way to slowly work towards a hero comic that compliments your roster, one that you can chose and grind towards. Success would feel much better and the grind would be worth the effort if you could finally piece together your Marvel Dream Team and smite some foes with righteous fury. Instead you're forced to use valuable experience, recruitment tokens, and gold to expand your roster never knowing who you're going to get. I've got a 5/5/- black widow and I just keep getting her comic books, it's driving me insane...The gameplay is a bit stiff in comparison to previous iterations of the PQ franchise and some attack animations are slow and repetitive. The graphics aren't anything to write home about and everything just feels slow. This game is a step backwards in almost every area and far too frustrating to be worth time or money. Just get Puzzle Quest 2 and enjoy that game, this debacle doesn't do the franchise justice and is a blemish on an otherwise amazing series of games.			"

In the early game this is easy because the characters are common, but very quickly you hit a ceiling and must pay. There is no community market, no way to trade your roster of superheroes with other peoples - they hold all the cards and want your money.It's a shame - lots of potential. Hopefully they fix it.

												As far as casual games go, this one is pretty epic in it's time-consuming...ness. I enjoy it quite a bit, but I've always been a fan of puzzle games, not excluding the 'match 3' genre. This one isn't as in-depth as say... Puzzle Quest 2 which is made by a totally different company, but I think there's still enough there if you want something more than Bejewelled. I think the best part is figuring out which heroes/villains work the best together and trying to build up their combos and such. As far as downsides go, I really don't like the weak AI, the randomness of drops and the money for power aspect. I'll go into each point by point here. The only real challenge comes from the level of your opponent, which determines how much HP they have and damage they do. When it comes to the actual gameplay, you can easily predict what they're going to do as they have certain priorities. They definitely play worse than a thinking person would. I would like it more if they made better decisions, as frustrating as that could be.As far as getting loot goes, you have very little control over what you get. Essentially you do different missions, most of which have four rewards. The first time you beat a mission, you're guaranteed one of them. Typically, you'll get ISO (the game's main currency) Hero Coins (the game's premium currency), heroes or random hero tokens, or boosts. Each time you repeat the mission, you'll have a chance to get a reward that you haven't already received or 20 ISO (which is a tiny tiny amount) This does get frustrating after a while, especially if you're trying to get a specific reward. Now, in order to get more characters, you need to either complete certain missions, trade in recruit tokens of varying quality or progress/place well enough in events (there's usually something going on every day). The problem here is with the tokens. Some guarantee a certain quality of hero, but it's still random since if there's a character you want, there's next to no guarantee you'll get them. They break down the odds on their website, but it doesn't really help. But that's not the worst thing.The worst thing is of course the bane of most free-to-play games. Paying for power. You can buy two things: ISO and Hero coins, the two currencies of the game. ISO is used to level up your characters and buy more low-quality ones. Coins allow you to buy more recruit tokens of higher quality, level up hero powers, (which aside from their actual effects, allow you to raise the character level higher) protect your characters in PvP mode (>:| ) but most importantly, buy more slots for characters. That last one is really frustrating, because you can only increase your character slots with coins, and if you don't want to spend money, you're going to have to inevitably pass up on recruiting certain characters, or get rid of ones you've progressed on in order to get new ones simply because if you don't buy coins, it's a hell of a grind to get more. The worst of the worst is that the coins/ISO are really expensive for your dollar, and I think don't really give you proper value. If you want to make this one of the only games you play it might be acceptable, but if you want to just play casually, I highly recommend not spending the money on it.Myself, I've put in a fair amount of time, so I begrudgingly purchased some coins to help open up some space for more characters on both my steam account and my iPad. ~sigh~Anyways, if you can overlook all the shortcomings, it's still a fun puzzle game, and you CAN get by without dropping any of your hard-earned cash on it. I recommend giving it a try if you're into the genre at all, especially considering it IS free.			"

												8/30/14 - Changed review to positive, though I imagine it still would be much more of a burden for people starting out to have to deal w/ massive downtimes when they don't have the roster to pick and choose, and remain competitive, when they run out of lives and have to wait, I still enjoy the game quite a bit.  I don't like the new healing mechanic that limits your healing to in-battle only regeneration, but, it's not as much of a game breaker as I had expected.  But again, that might be due to the depth of my roster and having multiple options to choose from in order to play-on while out of lives/regens.  Give it a whirl though, it is addictive.As you can see I have been intensely addicted to this game for months now.  And the game WAS fantastic.  However, in what I still cannot comprehend, the dev's at D3 have decided that they no longer want people to become addicted to their game.  They no longer want us telling our friends how fun it is, how they should give it a go and become MPQ addicts like we are.  No... now they have taken any sense of allowing their players the freedom to play when they want, how they want, w/ whatever characters they CHOOSE to play and have thrown it all in the garbage.  I am an AVID supporter of games and developers who show that they care for, listen to, and support the player community which gives them a job, a fan base, and a slew of addicts who advertise this game as a wonderful time-sink to all their friends/family/co-workers for free.  But apparently, FREE advertising doesn't figure into their bottom line and they would rather lose 1000's of loyal players if it means that 1-2 people w/ the fortune and freedom to invest money at will into buying extra lives every time the RNG unluckily kills off all their characters.  Loyal players who will NEVER pay for, what would be, an endless need for health-packs to keep playing at the times these players have allotted themselves to play... are GONE.  The only competition new players, or even players looking to experiment and try different character/team set-ups, will face are going to be these whales that invest so much money into the game that they are UNBEATABLE.  NO NEW PLAYER WILL STAND A CHANCE when the only competition left are those with pockets deep enough to make it utterly unfair.I will continue to log on 1x -2x a day, in hopes that the dev's will realize, acknowledge, and correct this unfathomably inept decision to cut the legs out from any player who is new, growing, learning, or trying to figure out if the game is WORTH spending real money on.  It makes 0 sense.  NONE.  AT ALL.  If this isn't fixed in a week, I will uninstall this game and move on w/ my life.  And, if you check the hours I have put into playing, I thoroughly understand the mechanics behind the game as well as the MASSIVE hindrance this change would put into my own ability to play.  And I'm not someone w/ a poor roster just wanting to get a feel for it and decide if it's worth my time and money.By refusing to let players develop their own style, experiment w/ different characters w/o the feeling that, if they lose, they'll have to wait 2-6 hours before they can play again, this product is going to plunge into the depths of being another 'free-to-play' game which is in NO WAY competitive, fair, enjoyable, or worth our time and money.  People who love this game and play it daily are already dropping out, along w/ their free advertising... New players will be faced w/ unbeatable teams funded by players w/ pockets deep enough to not care, and this MASSIVELY UNAPPEALING wall of dead-time where they can do NOTHING but sit and wait for the game to slowly heal them over a 2-6 hour period.  IT IS PURELY BAFFLING TO NOT BE ABLE TO COMPREHEND HOW AWFUL THIS WILL BE TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO FALL IN LOVE WITH A GAME.  How do you hope to attract, entertain, and KEEP players playing when you DON'T let them play for hours on end?  NO ONE is going to pay money, to a game, that they have 0 chance of being able to jump in, experiment, and get their feet wet in competition that is so far skewed towards players who buy the best characters and level them up w/o any work cause they can afford it.  Those players, like myself, who have put in HOURS AND HOURS of time learning the game, developing strategies to be able to out-last, out play, and still remain highly competitive with those players who cheat their way up using cash are going to be GONE.  I sincerely hoped this is fixed in the next 7 days, or I will feel so dumb for having invested so much time and energy into a game which doesn't consider 90% of their fan-base when making decisions about how to move their product forward.Sincerely, A once loyal and dedicated, and HOPEFULLY FUTURE loyal and dedicated, fan and player.

												Since I like Marvel stuff and I enjoyed Puzzle Quest, I thought this would be a no-brainer and tried to stick it out. Unfortunately, the microtransactions just ruin it. You cannot just play or collect in a way that's very enjoyable - people comment about it being ""free to play, pay to win"" and this is very true. For me it's also ""free to play, pay to actually enjoy it"". Probably my chief complaint in this regard is that rather than paying for rewards, you can 'achieve' rewards through your gameplay (which is fine)... unless you don't have room, in which case you need to pay for the rewards you've achieved through gameplay anyway.Could have been great, but very quickly loses its appeal even for fans of both franchises (unless you have money to burn).

												WARNING THIS GAME IS ADDICTIVE! I have spent well over 600 hours in this game so far. It almost consumes my game playing life now. I have gotten friends into the game and they love it as well. We talk about what characters we have, which ones we wish we had, and strategies for fights.  This game is free to play but you can pay for a few things. I DO NOT recommend paying for ISO-8, it can be easily farmed from ""The battle of the Baxter building"". This is what I do for ISO when I am not getting it through normal fights. I do quite well with this method and can get 2,000 to 3,000 ISO in an hour this way.  If you play a lot you might want to consider spending a little money on Hero Points to get more roster slots. I have spent $40 on this game and I feel that is a fair amount for how much time I have spent and how much enjoyment I get out of the game. However it's not necessary to spend money at all as you will win HP fairly often and you can always switch out who you have in your roster if you get a character you like better. It's just personal preference. I have friends who have spent money and friends who have not and our enjoyment of the game is the same. Overall if you like games like bejewled you will like this game. The RPG element adds a little variety and strategy to the game which I enjoy very much.			"

												Marvel plus Puzzle Quest  sounds like pretty cool pairing. The gameplay its here but since it is another free to play game you can count on microtransaction and there is plenty of them. From energy bar making us wait till our hero heals to coins for purchasing and upgrading skills all the way to the crystals for leveling up.Game supports xbox controller but there are some issues with it making use of a mouse a must.Its highly playable and you can sink deep into this title and survivr the transaction wall unless you really want to play online. being matched agains someone who paid a lot means that losing is pretty certain (different hp and abilities makes it nearly impossible to win against someone 10 or 15 levels above you). Still the game is fun an single-player looks  ok.			"

												Game has become a negative posterchild for pay to win. Before people who didn't spent any or just some money for slots etc. had a fighting chance. And even more importantly, they had some time to enjoy the game. Now they nerfed healing, so most Characters with healing skills get their healing only temporarily. Before, you could play 1-2 hours w/o a problem w/o having to use so called health packs.Now, w/o proper healing, after you used your 5 free healthpacks per day, which can easily happen after 2-3 games, as EACH hero (you can use 3 heroes at a time) needs to get healed with one pack. So after 3 games (maybe 10 minutes) you can easily run out of health packs and that was it for the day as it takes hours for the healthpacks to replenish. Most people won't have the time play for 10-20 minutes every 5 or so hours, because they work and basically have a life.If you wanted, like I did before, enjoy an hour or the occasional 2 hours on the couch, playing Dark Reign, you are now out of luck. After 30 minutes tops you run out of health packs and heroes to play. And guess how you only (reliably) get them back? Right, by purchasing them with real money. You can't even use the ""normal"" in-game currency.To level one hero to 50ish (of over 200 levels) costs about 90 € (NINETY), if you do this with currency from the real-money in-game shop.The most infuriating part is, that the devs think us stupid and lie to people, claiming the new system would save them time, because playing a 5 Minute game every few games to heal your heroes to full is much longer than waiting 5+ hours .TL;DR, it's a predatory business model aimed at addicted players who need to continue playing after they ran out of health packs. Keep away till they change that factor. If they do, the game can be fun.			"

												Pro-tip:  ONLY spend money on slots and VIP when you first start the game and your $$ will go a lot further.  Now that they've added 'favorite' heroes, your chances of getting the covers you need to increase the heroes you want has gone up significantly from before.  All in all a fun game that gives something to do on the regular, and although I can see it being expensive as all hell for the completionists out there, especially the impatient ones, the gameplay is enough to keep me coming back daily.

												I love the Puzzle Quest games. So naturally I also loved this new entry based on the Marvel comics. And in a way I do. But it just feels so cheap, and all because it's free. The character designs are well done and if you've played one of the previous PQ games you most definitely know how they play and this one is no different. It's once again all about matching gems. Which is fun obviously.But unlocking new characters, powers and upgrades take a lot of time and you'll be replaying a lot of battles to earn these rewards... or you can use real life currency to save time, which is ridiculous if you ask me. I'm aware of the fact that I own a lot of games and they've cost me tons of money but one thing I will rarely do (never say never) is pay for in-game content. And yes, DLC is a whole different story. But less of a scam because some of it can be truly impressive. But I'm losing focus here.The text in the text bubbles is gigantic which annoyed me. Replaying the levels many times over to get the proper rewards annoyed me. The fact that you can skip through these steps as long as you are willing to spend money on it annoyed me. And it's such a shame, because it can really be a fun game once you're playing a battle.It's free so it's hard to not recommend this game, right ? But I just can't. I can't. Buy PQ2 instead and witness a truly magnificent game. You won't be disappointed.[Rating: 76/100]			"

												I went into this game knowing very well, that ""free to play"" usually means ""pay to win"". Still this game made me angry! Why?First off: The base game is great! It's the standard puzzle quest game play. Basically a two player Bejewelled, where each player has life points and each match-3 (or more) is an attack which  reduces the opponents life points. In this game you play a team of 3 classic Marvel heroes and villains, from the starter Iron Man to Spider Man to Doctor Doom. Each has up to three special abilities, which are quite varied. The abilities are fueled with the tiles you matched up.So far, pretty classic puzzle quest. And overall that's done pretty well and is fun to play.What's no fun is everything around it: You get heroes and abilities by gathering ""covers"". You sometimes get them during the single player campaign or during the so called ""player vs player"" events. It's pseudo PvP really, since the oponent is controlled by the AI, there is no way to customize your team and there is no in-game way of communication except via Steam itself. And even then, there is no way to challenge a specific player.Since it's ""free to play"" you can also get covers by spending one of the two in-game currencies, which can be bought in the shop or found by playing: Iso-8 crystals and hero points. The former can be used to level up your heroes or buy the cheapest ones. The latter one can be used to buy the better ones or buy an additional slot for a hero. The heroes are distributed into four categories, 1-star to 4-star, and usually you can get multiple versions of the same character in the different categories. The better the category, the more powerful they can become.To learn a new ability or to make one more powerful, you need to find the cover of the exact hero with that exact ability on it. And did I mention, that you can't choose specific heroes in the shop? Instead you buy them as a kind of booster pack of one. Or you buy them as a booster of 10 and are guaranteed one specific hero. However those are usually even more expensive than the single boosters.And that's basically the problem of the whole game: You have no control what you get, and that little you get is very, very expensive. And don't get me started if you actually plan to spend money on this game: You can actually get the 2 weakest character covers for 50 hero points each. The ""cheapest"" amount to buy is 200 hero points for 1,49€, so about 0,40€ per cover. You need about 10 to fully power one of them up. This is 4,00€ for a full power character. And that's the weakest ones! It only get's more expensive from here! Sure, you can get a whole lot of hero points for about 70€. But I would never spend so much money on a match-3 game. Especially since you can get the original Puzzle Quests for at most 20€ here on Steam. And even if you spens so much, it only gives a discount of about 50%!  What makes me angry, is that the developers are greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and very obvious about it. Play, if you don't want to spend money, but if you do want to spend: spend it for the originals! "

												Marvel Puzzle Quest (MPQ), is a mobile device port for steam. Is that necessarily a bad thing? I don't think so, but it is something that you need to keep in mind when looking at the UI and graphics. It also effects the pay system, and since this is a F2P game, that's something people tend to focus on. So let's start there:Can you play MPQ without spending money? Yes. Will you be competitive... well, mostly. Let's talk about what real money gets used for: You can purchase the two types of in-game currency with real money. ISO and Gold. ISO is used, mainly, to purchase boosts for use during combat and to spend to level up your characters. It is the common currency of the game and is earned pretty easily. Gold can be used for a number of things. You can purchase additional slots to hold more characters (you are limited to 4 characters at the start and the prices for additional slots increases the more you have), you can purchase some ""super-boosts"", you can purchase health packs, and you can purchase additional covers for your characters. Do you ""have"" to purchase these things? Nope. You do earn some gold through normal game play, and many people (myself included) have found that if you focuse your purchases you don't really hit a wall for a very long time.Let's move onto the gameplay itself. MPQ is a tile matching game that is themed around the Marvel Comic Universe. You swap tiles on a grid board to make 3 or longer chains of the same color/shape (think Bejewelled), you then score a hit dealing damage and (in most cases) generated Ability Points (AP) of that color. Each character that you have selected (three) will have different abilities both passive and active. These abilities are often fuelled by the AP you generate from your matches. Pretty simple. There is an entertaining amount of depth in selecting which team you want to bring to an event, and finding good synergy between character abilities is important.The characters are leveled up by unlocking their skills. Skills are found by getting random drop ""Covers"". Each cover has one skill associated with it. Once you have used that cover to train the character in that skill it will increase the ""Current Max Level"" of the character, you can then use ISO to increase the level of the character. Every level increase raises the max Hit Points of the character, the amount of damage they do and the effectivness of their skills. Once you have unlocked the first level of the skill you can use Gold to increase the skill level (this is the main form of Pay-to-Win that you see in the game, but is limited by the fact that you have to have the base skill first to buy it).Health of your characters is the delaying factor in playing. Not only are you doing damage to your enemies, but they are doing damage to your characters as well. Their health will increase back to max over time, but with high level characters this can take several hours. If you take your three best characters into a match that is over their head and get them all killed, this can mean that you don't get to play again for a few hours... unless you use Health Packs. Health packs allow a character to return to full health immediately. You earn health packs over time, one every 30 minutes, but could buy additionals for Gold.The game provides some basic ""PVE"" missions to get a feel for the game and earn some basic covers and boosts, but the main part of the game that allows you to progress is the ""PVP"" duels and ""PVE"" events. Events rotate every few days and give opportunities for rare and high end rewards, but competition can be tough and some events require having certain characters to participate. Duels are a staple way to put your team against another player. The duels aren't really PVP though, because the same AI that runs the normal missions just uses the team, not an actual player.Long and the short of it: I find MPQ to be very entertaining, something that I have spent many an hour with and am perfectly happy to keep playing. There are issues, some bugs that break events and some exploits that people have found that can let them rank up super fast, and there are concerns about Pay-To-Win, but overall I can say that if you are looking for a casual time waster, this does the job rather well.

												This game is a extremely greedy  to even stand a slim chance of winning a rare card.  Even if your lucky enough to get one you need to pay for another spot to store it on your roster or sell  one your using and each rare has 2 or 3 powers so you need to match it at least 1 time to get the other power..good luck  even on their so called special chances the odds usually are around 1.5% if even that (common heroes odds are around 7%) rare rates are at 0.6% to 0.3% I kid you not always check the ? found somewhere on the picture of the recuitment deal.Even if you manage to join a decent guild and win you find the rewards only semi rare unless you place number 1 or 2 among thousands oh yeah another invisable girl or ms marvel but where is gamorea fury and luke cage.    ps there is no card trading which could have made this game slightly more playable			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest (in general, mobile and Steam) is nothing more than a petty rich get richer pyramid scheme. People who played from day one got to cruise to a cushy position for free and they are inoculated to the countless nerfs and adjustments that hurt new to mid range players in a petty attempt to force them to pay money for what others got for free just months before. Some fall into the trap and pay while others just tell everyone they know at how (supposedly) great the game is to flood the leaderboards with noobs so that they will be elevated into the top 10% more easily. Everything about the game is catered towards paying to overcome those who had it easier than you because they started at a higher tier in the pyramid scheme.The steam version has several advantages over the mobile version, but with a single colossal flaw. By virtue of having more space the in game interface is vastly superior to the hyper-compact view on mobile. The perpetual link to the server forces the battery to drain 8-12X regular drain rate on mobile, which is not a problem on Steam given that we have that constant connection anyway and we are generally plugged in to a power source that will charge faster than it will drain. The problem is that Facebook cannot be synced, so you cannot carry over your mobile save data to your Steam version. This mortal sin is making me uninstall. 0 out of 100 "

												On the surface, it looks like a fairly decent Puzzle Quest/Match 3 style game. But when you dig deeper you find that the game is designed to squeeze you for money every chance it gets. Your heroes' levels are capped by comic covers. The covers are mostly random, or hard to obtain. Plus, despite there being several different covers available, your slots to place them in are extremely limited. The Single-Player game will thus become overywhemling quickly, and stop providing you with any resources, forcing you into the special quests (which likewise dry up fast) or pvp. Those have exploitable methods to try to get more resources, but it becomes a frustrating game of retrying until you get a suitable opponent and then attacking. Not a lot of balance, difficult to advance, very hard on the wallet for a ""freemium"" game, just add up to a product that's best left avoided.This review is a repost of one I had made several months before, which appears to have been deleted in that when I visit the store page, it asks me to submit a review.  Though my old review was still listed in my profile.  Since the time of writing this, the developers implimented a change to the way healing was done in-game.  In order to play, you nead heroes who are healthy.  You can get health packs in game, that regenerate in time, or you can pay for them with the paid currency.  This is a tactic used in many Facebook games.  Simply put, it's a way to force you to constantly pay to keep playing.  And if you want to be ""competetive"", you must keep playing.  Limited time events, both PvE and PvP, require a lot of attention.  That you can't give them if you can't play.  Thus you can't earn the rewards from them.  And thus you fall further and further behind.  The change was that some characters had healing abilities in the game.  This effect let you continue to play, grind for what you needed in story mode etc.  The developers made the change that this in-game healing is temporary.  Once the battle was over, all the damage you received would be reapplied, sometimes killing your character.  Which meant, if you wanted to that character again, you needed to use a health pack.  Otherwise, you would rapidly run out of playable characters.To not believe the ""free to play"" tag on this game.  This game features the worst in the ""freemium"" market practices.  There are far, far better options out there, in both the ""match 3"" gameplay style, and in the Marvel theme.			"

												The gameplay is so much fun - a great time killer. The same old Bejeweled/PQ basic mechanic of 'matching 3 gems or more' is there, a huge appeal for its fanbase. Also, with the quests system, there's a sense of progression unlike the old Bejeweled. You actually need to check your opponents level prior to accepting the quest, rearrange your roster, heal your heroes or arming the power ups to make things easier. In addition to great quests, we also have very decent graphic and badass OSTs. Granted that it's not AAA's 3D levels, but the detailed chars and charming designs are more than enough. The actual Heads Up Display is clear and concise, allowing players to reach the menu they want to use. There's also a simple descriptions to each of heroes' powers so you can understand what you're going to invoke before deciding (since the point placement is permanent and not respecable).The video options are barebones, but really there's no need Anti Aliasing and those fancy Physx Tesselation whatever it's called options. You can use your native resolutions - at least that's commonly used nowadays - to prevent screen tearing. Well, in my case, it autodetected everything so it's click and play.Game performance overall is silky smooth even on my mid-end rig. Transitions between scenes are quite short, no boring loading screen that takes ages to finish and so far zero crash.Now after all good stuffs, here comes the problem, microtransactions. In order to upgrade your heroes within reasonable timeframe, you need to either be lucky with rewards rolls, or grind the best rewarding quess repeatedly, or purchasing DLCs. That's where the major problem is. All would have been a little better if the quest rewards can make up for it so free players don't have to bang against the wall out of frustration.Multiplayer is missing, but I'd imagine it'd be great to have a match up against other people real time matching gems together.Great Free to Play game ridden by micro transactions. It's a real shame, the game has a chance to be other FTP killers on Steam, but severely missed it. In the end though, I'd play until I am tired with the brick wall that prevents me from advancing, or bored.			"

												It's a lot of fun, although more of the same if you've played Puzzle Quest before. Definitely fun for those interested in Marvel (as I am). Not particularly a fan of having to level up with coins but, that's the way it goes in free to play games. Would have liked an option to just right out buy the game. All that being said, I played for two hours and spent absolutely nothing. That's more than fair.			"

												Marvel Puzzle QuestThis game would be amazing if the Computer didn't blatantly cheat, I mean come on,  3 match followed by another 3 match with a 4 match and finally a speacial attack to finish it off is ridiculous , I thought the phone version was bad...smh. Now i undestand the pay to win (PVP) and strategy aspects behind the game and i'm fine with that, I have a problem with cheating the player and forcing the player to drop cash into game knowning that you'll still going to get cheated makes this game unplayable at times and not worth dropping money into period. If they fix the AI issues this game would be amazing but let's face it that's not happening with a cash grab game.			"

												I used to love this game, as it should be obvious from how many hours I have sunk into this thing, but the game has made a definite turn for the worst.  It is in the Puzzle Quest style of gameplay with a few tweaks that take some getting used to (team formation, different type of leveling, matching more gems for the free turn, new timers on gems that you want to eliminate/protect with timers, etc).  I would think that if you were a fan of the first couple of Puzzle Quest games then you might enjoy this game as it scratches that same itch.  Most of the adjustments to the gameplay are interesting takes on the old formula, which I think are pleasant.However, recently the publisher has made the game more of a chore to play than anything.  They are employing several different tactics to try to squeeze more money out of the players, to the point where it has become a hindrance to my enjoyment of the game.  By aggressively trying to find ways to get money by adding new 'features' that limit the playerbase unless you are willing to pay more (and more and more) they have completely destroyed my enjoyment of this game.  I used to recommend this game to my friends, however I can no longer do that and have stopped playing the game myself.			"

												Well, I have this on my PC, my driod, and my iphone. Suffice it to say, its a pretty damn good game. Its simple and straightforward, and it truely is F2P. Now i know there are a lot of people who pay into the game, and honestly, i find it to be good enough to sink some money into. But i personally have never paied into it and ive been quite successful thus far. With the majority of my character covers coming from standard recruit packs (some examples: X-Force Wolverine, Deadpool, Doom, and Hulk). Also, I have an instagram page that i, at one point, dedicated to this game and there are a lot of tips and discussions about certian characters and their usefullness in the game itself, and also some team combos that have proven helpful. Should you want to check that out for more info related to the game, my instagram is squarishvirus. So, in conclusion, i give it a 4.5 out of 5. Only because a recent changed magnetos pink power. Though its still useful, he isnt in the upper tier teams anymore.Thanks and i hope this was helpful and illuminating			"

												Don't see why everyone is saying this game is pay to win, It's not honestly.. It's probably the only free to play game i no that gives you everything if you work for it. Of course there is stuff you can buy but it doesn't give you ultimate powers of a god.. I reccomend this game to anyone who loves puzzles games and please ignore the bad reviews from the little kids that only play fps games.			"

												In a nutshell, its a bad match 3 game as far as the match 3 is concerend, theres just too many varients of the gems and there arnt enough rows or columns...most of the time there is just one move you can make, rarely you can set up a good move with a cascade...the game is about 90% based on your characters, their skills, and building the resources via matching colors.Youll immediately get stung by the old school ""whale RMT"" mechanics that goes after wallet warriors to compete.  Your instinct will be to drop a small amount of money, which youll spend on the wrong stuff (hero tokens) which will cause you to need to buy more slots (the ONLY thing you should be buying).  Youll get a high level hero, think youve won, then realize it ruins your scaling.You need a LOT of hero slots, and those slots are expensive, the rest of the RMT is 100% RNG.  Rather than making an item you can buy to upgrade your heroes, which are seperated by tier, same skills though just higher level cap, they make the hero RNG the same as the skill upgrades.  So youll need many rare hero covers to upgrade that higher level hero and actually have skills, which are more important than good match 3 luck/skill.That one star or two star hero with all its skills unlocked and upgrade potential is far better than the uber rare hero you just unlocked basically...this isnt told to you early on...and its why most of the complaints are about the cash shop..they set you up to fail in this manner, which means...pull that wallet out...you get very little for your money as well (dont even get me started on ISO the material needed to level up, which you can only do after upgrading a skill via rolling another hero cover of the same tier which may or may not be the specific skill you need or want to upgrade)...you can see how it gets fustrating.Not paying money your able to clear the tutorial pve, then youll be stuck doing one daily and not much else to do for a decent amount of time.The game floods you with low tier covers, that eventually you sell off...and are sort of worthless beyond early game.Alliances are either 100% dead or overly competative with high expectations on participation, youll only be able to join with an expensive roster of high teir heroes upgraded fully...which takes ages for free or costs a hell of a lot of money.I drew the line at $20, opened a ton of slots, got a few ""decent"" heroes ill probably never find an upgrade for...but come in handy for pve events where characters are powered up (if you have that specific hero) if you dont its more or less a diceroll if youll get stomped and need to log out for an hour or two, or win and have taken so much damage youll need to log out for an hour or two...damage carries over and heals slowly over time or use a heal pack which drop from pve sometimes or pay up.Im stuck in a between spot on progression, much like if you dont pay early on...i log in to see if the events are for any heroes i have, if so i play them, if not i realize theres very little i can get done in a day.  WHen you realize most rewards are a token amount of ISO (like 250-500 when you need 30k to level a hero) it gets tedious... When you keep getting the same cover for the same hero who has that same skill already maxed, rather than ANYTHING else..it gets old...far too much RNG here...seperate hero characters from skills and just put in a skill upgrade token so we can make use of all our heroes....it makes rare heros almost worthless since youll never be able to upgrade them.Just do yourself a favor, dont bother with the game, if you need to....dont pay...see that progression wall? $20 will get you maybe 10 more hours of play until you hit it again, your rewards wont increase much because of it, and dont even think about competing....for a pve event i was ranked #1 for about 8hours (got lucky and i had all essential heros who were boosted) with 20min left on the event i was pretty far ahead, out of content to do for rewards and points donwscale with repetition...i was done but sure i was going to win some decent rewards (well maybe 500 more ISO than had i just participated and not competed and a chance at a rare hero)  i ended up ranking 38th in that 20min...not that i noticed much via reward...but it was like why did i even bother? 500 iso and a standard token for a low tier hero (one star storm or juggernaught it seems is the 99% on their RNG not worth the iso to upgrade for me)If you can play a few hours every day, and play EVERY day, eventually youll build up a decent roster, with some luck at least...and were talking over months...otherwise pay up big...and even then its a pretty boring game.Oh and the pvp isnt pvp...your playing an AI during it...Also the match 3 mixed with their skill system is extremely fustrating, many skills wont work unless they sit on the board for a few turns, and it seems the AI is really...REALLY...lucky on cascades and skills that randomly destroy tiles that always include your big skill that was going to go off next turn...however when the AI does similair it will be on a tile you cannot possibly touch...you you need to choose a character that can accurately destroy rows (hawkeye) which is kinda lame.If you plan to play 30 min to an hour a day, dont mind long slow progression, and will play for many months...youll get some fun out of it if youve never played a proper match 3 game...otherwise...get a real match 3 game...ironcast is far more entertianing and way less over the long run.Oh and i want to be very clear on their terrible scaling system.  Basically if you open a token and get a high tier character, the game assumes you have all high skill characters, fully upgraded, even if its just one and you have just one upgraded skill.  The game is VERY dependant on skills to progress you cannot compete on just match 3 damage alone.  Having one lv70 character means your lower tier heros fully upgraded at lv50 wont be able to hang in the events, which is how you progress and earn more tokens and coin rewards for more slots.  Your option is to delete the rare hero or struggle to do anything.  You have to horde tokens for months before you should actually open them, something not explained to new players and the most common cause of game fustration.  Typically you only find this out after spending money, or getting lucky on a reward token....youll realize this when you cant progress in an event for coin and tokens because the enemy level is too high for all but one character...and that one character cant carry without a full skill slot as youll be doing match 3 damage for most of the match.  If you play for free or dont want to spend hundreds of dollars...dont open anything other than a standard low tier token and make sure you have like 20-30 slots which will takes many months of free play or about $100....and why have that many slots if you dont have characters to fill them.  The sheer number of heroes means youll be at RNG's mercy to get duplicates, and not just duplicates of rare heroes but ones with the right skills so you can win matches....its insane....			"

												The gameplay is so much fun - a great time killer. The same old Bejeweled/PQ basic mechanic of 'matching 3 gems or more' is there, a huge appeal for its fanbase. Also, with the quests system, there's a sense of progression unlike the old Bejeweled. You actually need to check your opponents level prior to accepting the quest, rearrange your roster, heal your heroes or arming the power ups to make things easier. In addition to great quests, we also have very decent graphic and badass OSTs. Granted that it's not AAA's 3D levels, but the detailed chars and charming designs are more than enough. The actual Heads Up Display is clear and concise, allowing players to reach the menu they want to use. There's also a simple descriptions to each of heroes' powers so you can understand what you're going to invoke before deciding (since the point placement is permanent and not respecable).The video options are barebones, but really there's no need Anti Aliasing and those fancy Physx Tesselation whatever it's called options.

												It´s interesting that some guys write a review who only played the game for 1 hour...MPQ is a ""long-term-game"" where you can slowly improve your heros.+ you can play whole story for free; after that you can decide if you like to go further+ sometimes you get free covers, few gold or tokens just for logging in+ it makes fun to play once you came over the ""critical point"" in game (too weak heros to win at PVP)- there is a point in game, where you have to spend some money if you want to play PVP too.- you have 2 buy 2 times gold for 18 Euro each (minimum!) 1 for new hero slots; 1 for new covers.- you have 2 be patient on leveling up your heros; otherwise you should better play Jewels, Tetris or Bubble Town etc.- some language and grammatical mistakes in bubbles; -designed for portable devices Thats the truth about the game! - so take it or leave it :D   I hope that review can help you about your decision.

												Great game overall, the best one in Puzzle Quest series. If you ever had any interest in Puzzle Quest then look no further.Characters are closely represented with their respective unique powers, and new heroes are added regularly.Events and storyline are just perfect for newcomers and casual players, but players who spend more than a couple of hours a day may find it thin and repeating. With the addition of health system, the server load should be guaranteed and the ranking ladders will not be owned by marathon players.It is truly a free to play game where you have no obligation to spend anything. As for winning, it's down to how much time spent against other players - just like every MMO games out there.

												I enjoy match-3 games, and this comes with all of the benefits and drawbacks that come with competitive versions. (Matches aren't timed, but opponents take alternating turns against you, with possibilities for long strings of watching the computer play when it gets a lucky combo.) The game makes full use of 4- and 5-matches, giving each a different bonus, and recognizing T-shaped and L-shaped 5-matches. (Games that don't do this drive me crazy.)As a free-to-play game, I like that everything in-game is still accessible without purchase. Progression is a bit slower, of course, but it is possible to win ""hero points"" (in-game gold) and expand the slots available for heroes.The unique elements of this game are two-fold:1) A collectable card-game like element of choosing which heroes to keep and level up, and which combinations to use in each battle.2) A chance for gamers not already steeped in superhero lore to get to know Marvel characters and interactions a bit better. It's quickly turning me into a fan!There are two modes of play: ""story mode"" and ""versus"". * Story mode has in-character intro and outro dialog, pulling you into a comic storyline. It's a fun way to immerse yourself in the lore of the Marvel universe. * Versus mode pits your selection of heroes against heroes from another player's roster. It is worth noting that you are not actually playing the other person, but rather the AI using their heroes and abilities. This is a huge positive for me, because I don't have to deal with connection lags, people who afk for long periods, or trolling in a chat window. But if you're looking to match wits against a human opponent, this might leaving you wanting for more. Over 40 hours in, this continues to be a deeply engaging game!			"

												My first review, i'm so excited. Lets begin:This game is very addictive , it's one of those games where you are always checking back and forward to see what's happened next. There are roughly 11 events per season(a season lasting 24 days give or take) and we are on season 10. Events lasting 3 days, straight after each other.Unfortunately this game has some incredibly frustrating flaws such as an unfair, unbalanced ranking system where you can get attacked for a frustrating 110 points(that's like dying 10 times straight in COD by just spawning) and superiority anxiety meaning the guy with the best characters' wins.While this game has a very large roster, it has very little little access to them. There are roughly 60 playable characters but few ways to get them.You get fan favorites like Deadpool, Nick fury and wolverine, Rocket & Groot, Avengers and many more, you even get obscure characters such as Venom, juggernaut, Daken(wolverines son), beast, black panther, Blade(yip - surprised to) , Daredevil, The hood(see in game) , Ragnarok(there's an upcoming movie - thor's clone) and even a dinosaur called devil dinosaur.You get characters from the x men universe (beast, mystique, storm, magneto etc), avengers (all from 2012 movie), guardians of the galaxy (so far rocket/groot, Gamora), fantastic four and more. While this game is not perfect, anyone who loves marvel and knows nearly everything about marvel should definitely play this game(free).  They currently on ""Marvel now"" and “Dark reign” story lines. So they very current as these are very recent storylines in the MU.Thanx please comment on my review.Thanks Dragon Priest "

												I'm not to keen on free-to-play titles, no one here on Steam i reckon, but as a game Marvel Puzzle Quest is not too bad. It's quite fun actually.Now i have read a lot of complaints about the free-to-play scheme and it more or less forcing you to spend money to progress, but the way i see it is that it gives you a fun time and when you run out of health you just take a break for a while. You can keep it free as long as you keep playing it casually.If you're looking for a Bejuweled clone with a Marvel theme that is well implemented, though you can skip the story, then you'll have enough fun with Marvel Puzzle Quest.

												This version of the game features the flaws of the mobile version. As detailed in reviews below, the mechanic for health is an issue, and then there is the AI, which is designed to cheat. It will be able to use abilities it does not have the points for, and Team Ups are messed up in the AI's favour.The final thing which makes me uninstall the game less than half an hour into playing, is that you cannot link your mobile and Steam accounts together, despite the quote from the developer that ""The PC version runs off the same code and servers as the mobile versions. Battle against anyone, regardless of what device they're using"", that couldn't be any further from the truth.So, they hope you will double dip, spending money in both versions. Well, not this guy, and hopefully you won't either :) If you're thinking about installing this version and you're already invested in the mobile version, change your mind.			"

												The game is really fun, fast and a joy for the Marvel Geek. It is free-to-play, which means you can try it with no real danger. I had some luck of the draw when it came to Heroes.

												I wish I could recommend the game with all my hours but I can't really do that. The reason is that the game was fun at the start, but it quickly became apparent how money grubbing the company can be (lowering drop rates of high ranking characters, changing the way healing worked so you have to wait more often, etc.).Another thing I felt was more prevalent here than with other Puzzle Quest games is how much ""luck"" the AI sometimes has getting the right matches. For me it is simply impossible to win from the AI if both teams are the same level.Although you can play about 4 matches a day if you don't use the healing items you can get/buy, it isn't worth it if you want a full Puzzle Quest experience.

												Im changing my review after some extended play. The issues i originally had with the game were that it seemed intentionally diffucult and designed to make you pay in order to play. I had only played it for a few days at the time and it was very frustrating because i coudl only play 2 or 3 matches before i had to quit and wait several hours so that my roster would regenerate its health and i coudl play again. also because of the weak initial charcters i had it was very diffucult to win and therefore made it feel like i made no forward progress. now i have played it for several weeks and while its true that i did have to invest a decent ammount time initially now i have a large roster of charcters that i like and i can play a lot before i have to stop and let them recharge. and now that i have a stronger roster i can easily participate in all the schediled events adn complet the standalone missions. In short this game is much  MUCH MUCH better that i initially thought. and its one of teh games i enjoy playing an hour or so a day and likely will play it for a long time to come. Its totally worth the time it takes to get into the game and i seriously highly recomend it			"

												Very expensive(think $2-300 if you want to get a particular hero by spending)  Yet the design team loves to crap on paying players.   The ""customer support"" team remains anonymous, cut'n'paste, and lies through their teeth about escalations(they don't really, just cut'n'paste a fake escalation and wait a bit).  And the management team assures if you want to get out of a nerfed character they'll provide a sell back for in game currency less than the worth of the character to buy/build.  Basically, a total money trap.  I have never seen a game so fundamentally anti-gamer.			"

												False F2P model. A perfect example on how you should not go with a F2P model. Just stay away. This is just an attempt to grab easy money from Marvel fans. It's sad that Marvel actually allows this type of games. I don't see this game lasting very long.			"

												I think I've given the game a decent chance. It is kind of hard to rate, though; it's fun enough to play casually, but it makes casual play difficult with its problematic scaling that so often doesn't work and a level system that is completely dysfunctional.It really tries super-hard for microtransactions, which I understand are helpful to the developers, but good grief. When the game itself is made less fun and, more importantly, less functional for the sake of encouraging pay-to-win (or at least, pay to have more of a fun game), I feel there has been a fundamental failure.If a game, in and of itself, is fun, microtransactions can enhance that. But the most crucial part where Marvel Puzzle Quest falls short is that the game so often isn't fun, with a frequently cheap AI, problematic scaling algorithm, and restrictions and level-locking everywhere you look.There are many characters to choose from, which is very appealing, and the art and animations are great for what they are. Unfortunately this also is a double-edged sword, since you'll unquestionably find yourself up against the old and familiar obstacle of never really getting characters you want -- and being unable to just buy the specific character you do, even with real money -- and instead getting no end of characters you really don't.I really wish Marvel Puzzle Quest had a more casual play option, but everything is geared to ""encourage"" you to spend real money on making the game a more fun experience, which it should have been from the start. I know it's a free game, but it would be a lot more enjoyable, and I think more people would be more willing to give it a better score and recommendation, if it were a game priced reasonably and given a limited cash shop, but crafted better and more enjoyably. It's just a plain fact that they couldn't find a way to monetize a more casual play option, so it's not there. As a result, playing the game often ends up a frustrating reminder that if you'd just pony up the cash, you could probably have more fun.Meanwhile, Juggernaut's getting his fist ready. Better bend over. Some of the characters are plainly broken outright, and Juggernaut? He's one of them. Not only does he have massive health, but all of his moves are devastating.

												Marvel Puzzle Quest (MPQ), is a mobile device port for steam.  Is that necessarily a bad thing?  I don't think so, but it is something that you need to keep in mind when looking at the UI and graphics.  It also effects the pay system, and since this is a F2P game, that's something people tend to focus on.  So let's start there:Can you play MPQ without spending money?  Yes.  Will you be competitive... well, mostly.  Let's talk about what real money gets used for:  You can purchase the two types of in-game currency with real money.  ISO and Gold.  ISO is used, mainly, to purchase boosts for use during combat and to spend to level up your characters.  It is the common currency of the game and is earned pretty easily.  Gold can be used for a number of things.  You can purchase additional slots to hold more characters (you are limited to 4 characters at the start and the prices for additional slots increases the more you have), you can purchase some ""super-boosts"", you can purchase health packs, and you can purchase additional covers for your characters.  Do you ""have"" to purchase these things?  Nope.  You do earn some gold through normal game play, and many people (myself included) have found that if you focuse your purchases you don't really hit a wall for a very long time.Let's move onto the gameplay itself.  MPQ is a tile matching game that is themed around the Marvel Comic Universe.  You swap tiles on a grid board to make 3 or longer chains of the same color/shape (think Bejewelled), you then score a hit dealing damage and (in most cases) generated Ability Points (AP) of that color.  Each character that you have selected (three) will have different abilities both passive and active.  These abilities are often fuelled by the AP you generate from your matches.  Pretty simple.  There is an entertaining amount of depth in selecting which team you want to bring to an event, and finding good synergy between character abilities is important.The characters are leveled up by unlocking their skills.  Skills are found by getting random drop ""Covers"".  Each cover has one skill associated with it.  Once you have used that cover to train the character in that skill it will increase the ""Current Max Level"" of the character, you can then use ISO to increase the level of the character.  Every level increase raises the max Hit Points of the character, the amount of damage they do and the effectivness of their skills.  Once you have unlocked the first level of the skill you can use Gold to increase the skill level (this is the main form of Pay-to-Win that you see in the game, but is limited by the fact that you have to have the base skill first to buy it).Health of your characters is the delaying factor in playing.  Not only are you doing damage to your enemies, but they are doing damage to your characters as well.  Their health will increase back to max over time, but with high level characters this can take several hours.  If you take your three best characters into a match that is over their head and get them all killed, this can mean that you don't get to play again for a few hours... unless you use Health Packs.  Health packs allow a character to return to full health immediately.  You earn health packs over time, one every 30 minutes, but could buy additionals for Gold.The game provides some basic ""PVE"" missions to get a feel for the game and earn some basic covers and boosts, but the main part of the game that allows you to progress is the ""PVP"" duels and ""PVE"" events.  Events rotate every few days and give opportunities for rare and high end rewards, but competition can be tough and some events require having certain characters to participate.  Duels are a staple way to put your team against another player.  The duels aren't really PVP though, because the same AI that runs the normal missions just uses the team, not an actual player.Long and the short of it:  I find MPQ to be very entertaining, something that I have spent many an hour with and am perfectly happy to keep playing.  There are issues, some bugs that break events and some exploits that people have found that can let them rank up super fast, and there are concerns about Pay-To-Win, but overall I can say that if you are looking for a casual time waster, this does the job rather well.

												Intriguing game, however it seems whenever I take 5 steps forward I take 4 steps back. So progress is slow. While ""pay'to'win"" is possible in this game, I have found all rarities using just the in game currencies. This allows me to compete at a higher level and still rank high enough to get some of the best rewards.There are events every weekend and a separate event during the week, this allows casual players the opportunity to enjoy the game when it suites them most.The ability to collect and train a myriad of heroes and style your play to fit you personally keeps me coming back to this game for more.

												I played through both Puzzle Quests and as soon I saw this game on steam I had to give it a try. It's ggood game. I spent almost 50h on it in 2 weeks. Thankfully there are those health packs that recharge over time and not instant heals. Otherwise it would probalbly be three times that. It's true that one can get the feeling the game is pay to win, but imo it's not. PvE campain is quite demanding and entertaining, anyone can finish it without spending money. After the campaign you should have quite powerful team. PvP is the game's endgame mostly, but it's rather PvE highly influenced by players (u play vs. other player's team of superheros controlled by AI). Decent roster after finishing campain is capable of placing highly (in 1 lightning round (1,5h tournament where all the players can participate i managed to grind my way to top8 placement without spending $ and after only 1 week of playing). It's quite reasonable			"

												I usually only post reviews after spending 100 hours on a game but it is sale season and I can help save some money.  This is a great addictive game.  I loved Puzzle Quest 1/2 and this is better than both.  I even like the Marvel stuff, and I am a huge DC fan.  The meat is that you do not have to spend anything to enjoy this game, technically.  Just be prepared to put in lots of time.  I compare it to an online MMO, much like original WOW was for me.  It took me almost 2 years to max out the game.  Here nowhere near that kind of time but it will take some time, and WOW wasnt free either.  I have no problem chipping in a few bucks to support a company and game I like.  Programmers and developers need to eat too.  I do like the way they level up the heroes with random ""covers"" which is how you get your powers.  You can use in game coins to shortcut this but they are rare and you should spend them wisely.  It is not pay to win, but pay to shortcut I would say.  You don't really compete against anything but the game anyway, even in  PvP.  PvP is handled really interestingly.  You don't fight a person directly but their team run by the AI.  It took some getting used too but gives you loads of opponents to take on.It has tons of events where you can get new and unique characters.  Basically you match colored gems to get action points, which in turn, allow you to use your various powers, e.g. Iron Man's Repulsor Blast costs 10 red AP, so match 10 gems and you can fire off a blast.  If you ever wanted to play with some great characters and fun gameplay that wont tax your dexterity too much, this is it.I have read a few negative reviews and I feel everyone is entitled to their opinions, just remember that many of them haven't even played a full hour on this game so weigh those opinions accordingly.  There are even daily rewards to help you along, in the form of new characters, powers for them, tokens to get characters, etc.  It is a game looking to make money and since I support capitalism, that is fine with me.  I do not have even close the top tier characters but I have 16 at the moment and look forward to levelling them all.If you liked Bejewled, Marvel or even Dr. Mario (yes I am that old), give this game a try, it costs nothing but your time.

												(Disregard my time played, I've spent many hours playing this on my phone, and it's basically the same product)A clever twist on the Puzzla Quest/Match 3 formula, Marvel Puzzle Quest is well-designed and interesting. I wish there was more to do in general (it's clear this game was designed for a mobile format...which it was), but the characters are well-designed for a plethora of tactical and strategic uses just waiting to be discovered. I do have my fair share of criticisms of course. Being designed as a mobile game, the monetization is quite aggressive and I would strongly recommend against spending any great amount of money on the game. On the same vein, if you DO manage to get a rare, powerful character - while they are somewhat useful from the start - it can be extremely difficult to power them up without spending money (that's how they get you!). Besides the monetization, as with any random match three game, it can be a little annoying if the RNG doesn't favor you - refusing to give you the colors you need or by dropping an enemy attack tile in a place you have absolutely no hope of matching, for example.But those criticisms aside, this is a great title for Marvel and Puzzle Quest fans alike.

												This game is great if you want to kill a half hour every now and again. Once your characters are dead or you need heals and  you get 5 free heals every few hours. When they run out it wants you to pay but if you are only going to play this casually in half hour stints then I would reccomend it. The game is quite generous on giving away free characters and bonuses but you ll have to get a team to about level 10 before you start seeing real progress.			"

												As far as puzzle games go, the Puzzle Quest series has managed to combine a challenging puzzle system that meets with the action of superhero combat. As I had only played the original Puzzle Quest before this one, I wasn't sure what to expect. If you've played it before, you wont really be seeing anything terribly new. It plays the same as the others I've played but I doubt if you're a fan of Marvel that you'll care. Its a great game, definitely worth a try if you've never played a Puzzle Quest before!			"

You need this to add new members to your team.). Naturally, you're able to get past these restrictions with microtransactions.Fair enough, if these restrictions weren't in place, every dedicated player would have the strongest possible team in no time.

												Intriguing game, however it seems whenever I take 5 steps forward I take 4 steps back. So progress is slow. While ""pay'to'win"" is possible in this game, I have found all rarities using just the in game currencies. This allows me to compete at a higher level and still rank high enough to get some of the best rewards.There are events every weekend and a separate event during the week, this allows casual players the opportunity to enjoy the game when it suites them most.The ability to collect and train a myriad of heroes and style your play to fit you personally keeps me coming back to this game for more.

												I played through both Puzzle Quests and as soon I saw this game on steam I had to give it a try. It's ggood game. I spent almost 50h on it in 2 weeks. Thankfully there are those health packs that recharge over time and not instant heals. Otherwise it would probalbly be three times that. It's true that one can get the feeling the game is pay to win, but imo it's not. PvE campain is quite demanding and entertaining, anyone can finish it without spending money. After the campaign you should have quite powerful team. PvP is the game's endgame mostly, but it's rather PvE highly influenced by players (u play vs. other player's team of superheros controlled by AI). Decent roster after finishing campain is capable of placing highly (in 1 lightning round (1,5h tournament where all the players can participate i managed to grind my way to top8 placement without spending $ and after only 1 week of playing). It's quite reasonable			"

												I usually only post reviews after spending 100 hours on a game but it is sale season and I can help save some money.  This is a great addictive game.  I loved Puzzle Quest 1/2 and this is better than both.  I even like the Marvel stuff, and I am a huge DC fan.  The meat is that you do not have to spend anything to enjoy this game, technically.  Just be prepared to put in lots of time.  I compare it to an online MMO, much like original WOW was for me.  It took me almost 2 years to max out the game.  Here nowhere near that kind of time but it will take some time, and WOW wasnt free either.  I have no problem chipping in a few bucks to support a company and game I like.  Programmers and developers need to eat too.  I do like the way they level up the heroes with random ""covers"" which is how you get your powers.  You can use in game coins to shortcut this but they are rare and you should spend them wisely.  It is not pay to win, but pay to shortcut I would say.  You don't really compete against anything but the game anyway, even in  PvP.  PvP is handled really interestingly.  You don't fight a person directly but their team run by the AI.  It took some getting used too but gives you loads of opponents to take on.It has tons of events where you can get new and unique characters.  Basically you match colored gems to get action points, which in turn, allow you to use your various powers, e.g. Iron Man's Repulsor Blast costs 10 red AP, so match 10 gems and you can fire off a blast.  If you ever wanted to play with some great characters and fun gameplay that wont tax your dexterity too much, this is it.I have read a few negative reviews and I feel everyone is entitled to their opinions, just remember that many of them haven't even played a full hour on this game so weigh those opinions accordingly.  There are even daily rewards to help you along, in the form of new characters, powers for them, tokens to get characters, etc.  It is a game looking to make money and since I support capitalism, that is fine with me.  I do not have even close the top tier characters but I have 16 at the moment and look forward to levelling them all.If you liked Bejewled, Marvel or even Dr. Mario (yes I am that old), give this game a try, it costs nothing but your time.

												This game gets a bad rep.. and mostly because people are cheap.  Here's my take on it:I know my ""time played"" only says a little over an hour.  But I've easily put 10+ hours into the iPhone version.  And I've never had to spend a dime.  It's a game you can EASILY play for 30 minutes, then come back to, rinse and repeat.  And you would never need to spend money.  I've done very well in the iPhone version and never bought anything from the store.For the PC players.. the game is free.  FREE.  What do you expect for Free?  Have you ever worked at a software company?  Probably not.  Any developer of software would be out of business in a month if they just gave you free games that never asked for micro-transactions.  All you have to do is click the X and move on.Personally, when I tried the PC version, I enjoyed it.  It's pretty much the exact same game, but without the limiting frames of the smart phone versions.  Very big and bright.  But otherwise identical.  It's Bejeweled, and every once in a while a Marvel Hero artwork jumps out and throws some particle effects around.Cons?  Yeah, there are definitely some.  This is a VERY cash shop oriented game that will remind you at every turn that you can buy tokens, iso-8, characters, covers, etc etc etc.  But like most games of this ilk, you can get around that if you don't suck at it, and use your resources wisely.  Sure, there's a bit of luck involved.. and God forbid you would have to spend $5-10 to support the developer of a game you got FOR FREE.  My only other gripe is that the smart phone version of it doesn't sync with the steam version.. it really sucks having to start over when playing it on PC, when I have a bad ♥♥♥ team on my phone.In the end, I give this a 8/10.  It's no Puzzle Quest 2 (but what is) and all I can say is that if money is that big of a problem for you, then video games shouldn't be your hobby.  Maybe get a better job.  :) "

												A lot of people seem to moan about microtransactions, but for me the game really is a blast, and I've spent only about 3 euro (SHIELD's recruit pack, discounted at the time) to get more space for additional characters. While it doesn't seem so at first, there's suprising depth to the strategy - you need to balance your team so that you can use every color of tiles and have the stronger characters cover the weaker ones (so be careful not to overlevel your support, like Storm, to the point where she takes the spot in front of your Wolverine and gets promptly chewed in three turns). Don't expect long playing sessions because of the helath regeneration system, but the deafault heal time plus 5 regenerating health packs usually allow you to play three-four games every two hours or so. And honestly, it's a match three game, so you'd become bored with more. Great for breaks at work and extra nice if you are a Marvel fan, I appreciate the use of comic book covers as skill icons. Shame about the absence of Steam Cloud support, though.			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest is a tipical block combining game that adds to the game the marvel universe/heroes to give some diversity and fun collecting/leveling the heroes.Every heroe has diferent habilities and you can fight in 3v3 battles combining the strenghts of your heroes to progress through the game. You start with 3 basic heroes after doing the tutorial and you have to manage to lvl up using the ISO points you obtain by winning battles. Some battles on the campaign gives you extra heroes or hero points (hero points are the ones you need to have extra slots for more heroes).Its a bit slow at the beginning because every time a hero takes damages, it needs time to restore his hp, so whe you have only 3 heroes it can be a bit slow to advance. But as soon as you have 5+ heroes and reach lvl 10+ with some of them, you can keep playing almost indefinitly without having to spend real money on the game. Paying real money on this game only gives you a faster progression, but you can manage to do everything just by playing the game.If you like puzzle games its worth to try this one, just have in mind the first few hours are a bit slow if you dont invest real money.

												The game is pretty fun, at first, then it gets incredibly frustrating seeing how many people are , from the look of it, months and months ahead of you..except that some actually pay for progress. You don't really have to pay if you don't mind moving along in a snail's pace, but you'll get there, eventually. They started requiring that you use certain characters to be able to progress through certain events in order to finish in a good place (good place has better rewards etc etc) , so you either won that specificy character last event, or you purchased it, or you are pretty much destined to finish in a place other than first throughout the event.You can also link up the mobile version with this one so you can play the same account on both devices, takes a few days to get them synced, however, it took them 8 days to sync mine.It's a nice game, though, hopefully they balance it out between F2P and P2W.

												If you can get past the microtransactions, this game is pretty good. Assembling a team makes things interesting, as each hero and villain have unique attacks. Matching 4 in a row no longer gives you another turn like it did in the original, but instead clears out the whole row or column. And Marvel is Marvel. If you're willing to pay for the vanilla Puzzle Quest, I'd recommend playing that instead.			"

												Very fun puzzle quest variant! The puzzle mechanic is excellent, and team creation is dynamic and enjoyable. Rewards are meaningful, and collecting the ""comic covers"" (i.e., leveling your Heros) is very fun.It is also an excellent implementation of both free to play and micro transactions. Spending real money is by no means necessary, and although it speeds up your progress it does not make you more powerful than equal leveled players who have not spent money. The primary use for real money is to buy extra character slots, but you can earn the necessary currency by playing in the campaign or the semi-PvP daily and weekly events. Although a number of other reviewers have voiced dislike for the time based healing system, I actually really like it. Taking damage to your Heroes is bad, and the game is more enjoyable because of this difficulty backed up with a real penalty! I have yet to spend any real money on the game, and yet have played a ton and enjoyed it.			"

												If you have any interest in super heroes, and collecting stuff then this game is for you. Don't heed people who say it's micro transactions galore. You can play without paying. Everyday there are several multiplayer events in which you can participate for free and win lots of Iso-8 and HP (game's more valuable other currency) if you are successful enough. There is also a huge single player campaign with lots of rewards. I don't know what people are complaining about. There is one thing though. If you are very competitive then you might feel you need to pay to get ahead of others. It will only save you game play time. Others will catch up to you if you pay, but it will take a while. Since I enjoy the game as it is and I'm a casual gamer at heart, I enjoy it a lot. The game is addictive. I also played old Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords. I had enjoyed that one though I didn't finish it. This is a bit different from that one in how leveling works and the fact that you don't have a single character to play with. From what I heard, game's support team is very efficient. I didn't have any problems with the game so far though.			"

												I'm having fun. On the surface, it's a simple colour matching game. Easy, right? Anyone can do it. As a Hard Core Casual gamer, I really appreciate that. No timer, no hand eye coordination and instant decision making required. Yeay!It's also ""Free to play"" or supposed to be. Don't believe it! It's addictive. Like... like... shopping for a shopaholic. I'm a shopaholic. Having said that, I'm well aware of my gaming budget limitations. So i've spent enough on this game to buy a PS4 or so my friend tells me. I don't really care since there are no games on a PS4 that I can actually play and my PS3 works just fine. The games on my Playstation watchlist are all coming out on PS3 anyway. So, my game budget can handle this. I just wish Steam would stop blocking me, all the time. I'm nowhere near $2000.00 in 24 hours.Anyway, back to the game... Past the surface there are strategies and tactics that make the battles interesting. Different enemies change the feel and style of play required to win and so it keeps being fun. It's very grindy if your gaming budget or Steam doesn't allow you to buy what you need to level up your characters. BUT if you're not a PVP ♥♥♥♥♥ it doesn't really matter. Take your time, wind down after work with a game or two and eventually in a few... errr... years... ^_~ you'll get there eventually. I've only been playing for a few weeks, but I've paid for my character levels in cash. You get a present everyday you do play a game or two and if you care to play in the PVP arena, the rewards are more consistant than in the PVE games where the reward randomiser can give you the minimum reward heaps before surrendering the good stuff. It seems to be getting better, but that might just be my imagination. I didn't collect any data to compare last week's drops to this week's.The only downside at the moment is that the PVE content seems very limited. There's a Prologue which I have completed, though not obtained all the rewards and no sign of ""Chapter 1"". There are PVE Events, but because they are of limited time... go on holidays without your computer and you miss them.  If your team isn't at a sufficiently high level, you may only be able to complete the first few fights before the opponents get too hard to fight. Then you're stuck grinding those same few fights, your team can manage, to get enough points to reap the rewards on offer in the time that the Event is on for. There's even PVP Events - lots more of these, with Lightning Rounds and Tournaments you have to pay to play in.  I'm not much of a PVP player and once the teams I have to fight get too hard as my ranking climbs, I lose interest until I can level up my characters to get a chance at winning again. BUT by then the PVP Event, is over. Hmmm....I'm much more interested in Chapter 1 and the continuation of the Story started in the Prologue. Don't tell me they continued the story in past Events, cause I wasn't there to play them and when do they become Chapter 1?That's the MAJOR downside of this game. There doesn't seem to be anything beyond the Prologue.So you ask yourself why I'm recommending this game? Because I'm having FUN! Read a few other reviews and the forums and there are all kinds of grumbles about its inadequacies. BUT when all is said and done, it is a FUN game. It is an easy game to pick up and play, and once you get started, the character and power combinations become intriguing. It gets addictive simply because someone like me whats to collect them all and see how well, or not, they work together.I might wish for more permanent content... maybe there will be. I can only hope. In the mean time I'll be having fun with what is there.			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest is a very fun game.  I downloaded it the day it came out on iOS and I have played the PC Version since beta.  I have been a fan of Puzzle Quest since playing the original on my PSP, and well that plus Marvel really got me interested.  The gameplay is fun, really dig the UI (especially on PC), and there's a fun variety of characters and abilities.  That said, I feel since launch the developers have put in a lot of walls that were not previously there for the sake of them making more money.  I understand that game development is a business and making money is good, but the game was much more fun in previous versions.  That doesn't stop me from playing it like a no good junkie, though.

The game's most interesting feature is that it allows the gamers to compete themselves against the premium users by the events and ofcourse special rewards.The new characters set is also a very good feature.

												Yes it's a little harsh on it's free to play claim, but the game itself is great. With Marvel's vast collection of heroes and villains, once they are able to add more characters, it will be even better. If you pay what you would a normal game, it gives you a head start, but as long as you participate you should get a ton of free crystals just by doing the missions and repeatables. In the beginning I found Thor, Wolverine and Juggernaut to be especially useful in various teams, all 3 are extremely resilient and in the earlier stages of the game Juggernaut's red ability can usually one shot any enemy. I've gotten both Magnetos and The Hood from just basic recruit tokens so you can get lucky there as well. Favorite character so far is 3 star Magneto.			"

I loved Puzzle Quest 1/2 and this is better than both.  I even like the Marvel stuff, and I am a huge DC fan.  The meat is that you do not have to spend anything to enjoy this game, technically.  Just be prepared to put in lots of time.  I compare it to an online MMO, much like original WOW was for me.  It took me almost 2 years to max out the game.  Here nowhere near that kind of time but it will take some time, and WOW wasnt free either.  I have no problem chipping in a few bucks to support a company and game I like.  Programmers and developers need to eat too.  I do like the way they level up the heroes with random ""covers"" which is how you get your powers.  You can use in game coins to shortcut this but they are rare and you should spend them wisely.  It is not pay to win, but pay to shortcut I would say.  You don't really compete against anything but the game anyway, even in  PvP.  PvP is handled really interestingly.  You don't fight a person directly but their team run by the AI.  It took some getting used too but gives you loads of opponents to take on.It has tons of events where you can get new and unique characters.  Basically you match colored gems to get action points, which in turn, allow you to use your various powers, e.g. Iron Man's Repulsor Blast costs 10 red AP, so match 10 gems and you can fire off a blast.  If you ever wanted to play with some great characters and fun gameplay that wont tax your dexterity too much, this is it.I have read a few negative reviews and I feel everyone is entitled to their opinions, just remember that many of them haven't even played a full hour on this game so weigh those opinions accordingly.  There are even daily rewards to help you along, in the form of new characters, powers for them, tokens to get characters, etc.  It is a game looking to make money and since I support capitalism, that is fine with me.  I do not have even close the top tier characters but I have 16 at the moment and look forward to levelling them all.If you liked Bejewled, Marvel or even Dr. Mario (yes I am that old), give this game a try, it costs nothing but your time.

												So, MPQ.. yeah.  It's a game that comes in a lot of stages and as a result is very deceptive about what it is.For the most part it's like any other Puzzle Quest game.  At the very beginning you'll progress through a story mode, where about half of the fights are against minions (characters that do not match gems).  It takes a while but eventually you'll be fighting against villains that  match and use skills.After you build up a few of the starting characters you'll start participating in the player vs player and player vs environment events.  In these events you'll compete against other players for ranking (prizes).  An event ends almost every day, so you'll probably end up playing every day to maintain a high score.  How you play will change a lot as you transition from starting characters (one stars) to mid level ones (two stars) and then into high level ones (three and four stars).  Having a roster of three stars allows you to more easily compete in the tournaments.The game itself is well designed in that it will hit every one of those points that keeps a player playing (events that have a definite ending, a pokemon-esque roster that keeps you intrigued, timers on healing and health packs, and a currency used to level said roster).  Transitioning from one stars into two stars and then two stars into three stars is a fantastic feeling and the gameplay really changes when you do.However, because of how the game is designed, there are a bunch of flaws.  For one, it's almost never ideal to enter an event until just before it ends due to  bracket placement and rubberbanding (your nodes will score a lot more later in an event than earlier, so you'll catch up to a top rank player very very quickly).  Of course, rubberbanding doesn't exist in all of the PvE maps but it's in most.  As for bracket placement: when you enter an event you're put into a bracket with other players that entered around the same time.  Entering late usually guarantees that the top players of your event will not score as high, making it far easier to place higher (and thus get better rewards).The biggest problem, though, is with the system called ""MMR.""  MMR is effectively an invisible score attributed to your account that more or less compromises your win/loss ratio, pitting you against other players with similar MMR.  This sounds like it would balance the game a lot -- and it sort of does -- but in actuallity it makes climbing early stages of brackets much more difficult than it should be, since you'll be fighting similarly leveled rosters for marginal point gains (so you'll be taking tons of damage).Since I've started playing, the transition into two star rosters was made negligible, as two star covers are given out very, very frequently.  Transitioning into three star rosters was also made easier, but it still takes more than a couple of months to break into them after you've made a strong two star lineup.While I greatly enjoyed this game while playing, I ended up leaving due to it taking up a significant amount of my time (minimum of an hour a day, sometimes up to 4 or 5) just to stay competitive.  That, alongside of a fairly venomous (if you arent scoring well enough in any event, most alliances will just kick you on the spot and take in a new member: I was threatened three or four times with removal from my alliance over a point total in a PvE event with rubberbanding.  Low and behold I score a ton of points right at the end and place in about the middle of the alliance, this over the course of about two hours compared to the 6 to 8 each other person in my alliance was putting in, but they were still talking about kicking me lol) end game community just pushed me away and made me say ""Yeah, I'd rather play other games with my friends than devote time to this.""Anyway, hey, the game is well designed but I'm not so sure the developers really care about it being fun so much as making money out of it.  Your mileage may vary and it takes a significant amount of time to get anywhere, but yeah, I had a really good time with it.  Shame that the community really pushed me out, but whatcha gon' do?			"

												Yes it's a little harsh on it's free to play claim, but the game itself is great. With Marvel's vast collection of heroes and villains, once they are able to add more characters, it will be even better. If you pay what you would a normal game, it gives you a head start, but as long as you participate you should get a ton of free crystals just by doing the missions and repeatables. In the beginning I found Thor, Wolverine and Juggernaut to be especially useful in various teams, all 3 are extremely resilient and in the earlier stages of the game Juggernaut's red ability can usually one shot any enemy. I've gotten both Magnetos and The Hood from just basic recruit tokens so you can get lucky there as well. Favorite character so far is 3 star Magneto.			"

												A lot of people seem to moan about microtransactions, but for me the game really is a blast, and I've spent only about 3 euro (SHIELD's recruit pack, discounted at the time) to get more space for additional characters. While it doesn't seem so at first, there's suprising depth to the strategy - you need to balance your team so that you can use every color of tiles and have the stronger characters cover the weaker ones (so be careful not to overlevel your support, like Storm, to the point where she takes the spot in front of your Wolverine and gets promptly chewed in three turns). Don't expect long playing sessions because of the helath regeneration system, but the deafault heal time plus 5 regenerating health packs usually allow you to play three-four games every two hours or so. And honestly, it's a match three game, so you'd become bored with more. Great for breaks at work and extra nice if you are a Marvel fan, I appreciate the use of comic book covers as skill icons. Shame about the absence of Steam Cloud support, though.			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest is a tipical block combining game that adds to the game the marvel universe/heroes to give some diversity and fun collecting/leveling the heroes.Every heroe has diferent habilities and you can fight in 3v3 battles combining the strenghts of your heroes to progress through the game. You start with 3 basic heroes after doing the tutorial and you have to manage to lvl up using the ISO points you obtain by winning battles. Some battles on the campaign gives you extra heroes or hero points (hero points are the ones you need to have extra slots for more heroes).Its a bit slow at the beginning because every time a hero takes damages, it needs time to restore his hp, so whe you have only 3 heroes it can be a bit slow to advance. But as soon as you have 5+ heroes and reach lvl 10+ with some of them, you can keep playing almost indefinitly without having to spend real money on the game. Paying real money on this game only gives you a faster progression, but you can manage to do everything just by playing the game.If you like puzzle games its worth to try this one, just have in mind the first few hours are a bit slow if you dont invest real money.

												The game is pretty fun, at first, then it gets incredibly frustrating seeing how many people are , from the look of it, months and months ahead of you..except that some actually pay for progress. You don't really have to pay if you don't mind moving along in a snail's pace, but you'll get there, eventually. They started requiring that you use certain characters to be able to progress through certain events in order to finish in a good place (good place has better rewards etc etc) , so you either won that specificy character last event, or you purchased it, or you are pretty much destined to finish in a place other than first throughout the event.You can also link up the mobile version with this one so you can play the same account on both devices, takes a few days to get them synced, however, it took them 8 days to sync mine.It's a nice game, though, hopefully they balance it out between F2P and P2W.

												If you can get past the microtransactions, this game is pretty good. Assembling a team makes things interesting, as each hero and villain have unique attacks. Matching 4 in a row no longer gives you another turn like it did in the original, but instead clears out the whole row or column. And Marvel is Marvel. If you're willing to pay for the vanilla Puzzle Quest, I'd recommend playing that instead.			"

												Very fun puzzle quest variant! The puzzle mechanic is excellent, and team creation is dynamic and enjoyable. Rewards are meaningful, and collecting the ""comic covers"" (i.e., leveling your Heros) is very fun.It is also an excellent implementation of both free to play and micro transactions. Spending real money is by no means necessary, and although it speeds up your progress it does not make you more powerful than equal leveled players who have not spent money. The primary use for real money is to buy extra character slots, but you can earn the necessary currency by playing in the campaign or the semi-PvP daily and weekly events. Although a number of other reviewers have voiced dislike for the time based healing system, I actually really like it. Taking damage to your Heroes is bad, and the game is more enjoyable because of this difficulty backed up with a real penalty! I have yet to spend any real money on the game, and yet have played a ton and enjoyed it.			"

												If you have any interest in super heroes, and collecting stuff then this game is for you. Don't heed people who say it's micro transactions galore. You can play without paying. Everyday there are several multiplayer events in which you can participate for free and win lots of Iso-8 and HP (game's more valuable other currency) if you are successful enough. There is also a huge single player campaign with lots of rewards. I don't know what people are complaining about. There is one thing though. If you are very competitive then you might feel you need to pay to get ahead of others. It will only save you game play time. Others will catch up to you if you pay, but it will take a while. Since I enjoy the game as it is and I'm a casual gamer at heart, I enjoy it a lot. The game is addictive. I also played old Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords. I had enjoyed that one though I didn't finish it. This is a bit different from that one in how leveling works and the fact that you don't have a single character to play with. From what I heard, game's support team is very efficient. I didn't have any problems with the game so far though.			"

												I'm having fun. On the surface, it's a simple colour matching game. Easy, right? Anyone can do it. As a Hard Core Casual gamer, I really appreciate that. No timer, no hand eye coordination and instant decision making required. Yeay!It's also ""Free to play"" or supposed to be. Don't believe it! It's addictive. Like... like... shopping for a shopaholic. I'm a shopaholic. Having said that, I'm well aware of my gaming budget limitations. So i've spent enough on this game to buy a PS4 or so my friend tells me. I don't really care since there are no games on a PS4 that I can actually play and my PS3 works just fine. The games on my Playstation watchlist are all coming out on PS3 anyway. So, my game budget can handle this. I just wish Steam would stop blocking me, all the time. I'm nowhere near $2000.00 in 24 hours.Anyway, back to the game... Past the surface there are strategies and tactics that make the battles interesting. Different enemies change the feel and style of play required to win and so it keeps being fun. It's very grindy if your gaming budget or Steam doesn't allow you to buy what you need to level up your characters. BUT if you're not a PVP ♥♥♥♥♥ it doesn't really matter. Take your time, wind down after work with a game or two and eventually in a few... errr... years... ^_~ you'll get there eventually. I've only been playing for a few weeks, but I've paid for my character levels in cash. You get a present everyday you do play a game or two and if you care to play in the PVP arena, the rewards are more consistant than in the PVE games where the reward randomiser can give you the minimum reward heaps before surrendering the good stuff. It seems to be getting better, but that might just be my imagination. I didn't collect any data to compare last week's drops to this week's.The only downside at the moment is that the PVE content seems very limited. There's a Prologue which I have completed, though not obtained all the rewards and no sign of ""Chapter 1"". There are PVE Events, but because they are of limited time... go on holidays without your computer and you miss them.  If your team isn't at a sufficiently high level, you may only be able to complete the first few fights before the opponents get too hard to fight. Then you're stuck grinding those same few fights, your team can manage, to get enough points to reap the rewards on offer in the time that the Event is on for. There's even PVP Events - lots more of these, with Lightning Rounds and Tournaments you have to pay to play in.  I'm not much of a PVP player and once the teams I have to fight get too hard as my ranking climbs, I lose interest until I can level up my characters to get a chance at winning again. BUT by then the PVP Event, is over. Hmmm....I'm much more interested in Chapter 1 and the continuation of the Story started in the Prologue. Don't tell me they continued the story in past Events, cause I wasn't there to play them and when do they become Chapter 1?That's the MAJOR downside of this game. There doesn't seem to be anything beyond the Prologue.So you ask yourself why I'm recommending this game? Because I'm having FUN! Read a few other reviews and the forums and there are all kinds of grumbles about its inadequacies. BUT when all is said and done, it is a FUN game. It is an easy game to pick up and play, and once you get started, the character and power combinations become intriguing. It gets addictive simply because someone like me whats to collect them all and see how well, or not, they work together.I might wish for more permanent content... maybe there will be. I can only hope. In the mean time I'll be having fun with what is there.			"

												Recommend with a strong caveat:I enjoy this game on my mobile device, but am disappointed to find that it does not allow you to sync your steam and mobile version together in order to share progress (especially since progress is a big part of the game).  If this is the only platform/device you want to play on, it can be very fun.  However, running multiple play-throughs on different devices does not really add anything since the progression is based on chance rewards rather than customization choice.Also, I had issues running it in full screen mode.  ymmvEdit: I should also note that the game is quite grindy and uses delay-based mechanics to entice players to spend money to play faster.  If you play casually a couple of rounds per day it isn't bad (though I have heard later levels are more taxing), but you will be impeded if you want to play for long sessions.I wish I didn't have to choose between a binary recommend and not recommend.  This game is great for killing 10 minutes between other things, but suffers from abusive design.			"

												Cons:~ Monetized, and not well. Darn near everything costs and you will never have enough of whatever to do the job. ~ Rewards you cannot use until you pay or earn premium currency for the space to claim it.~ Time-Based System would be acceptable if it were shorter.Pros:~ Puzzle Quest Series' infamous ""Stacking the Deck against you in place of intelligent opponents"" difficulty system seems to have been abandoned. You get lucky drops of new gems just as often as the CPU does. Defeat is not decided for you in advance.~ Interesting improvement system, despite monetization angle.~ Guild system and game modes that reward you for acting together, though apart (sharing powers, guild-wide rewards in their special events). Makes many good things you get into benefits you can share (such as your great high-level card being sent out as a backup to allies).Play it. Cautiously.			"

												Fun game, but it feels better suited to tablets and shouldn't have been ported to PC. A lot if issues that other people are having can be lessen by playing in short sessions, such at 10 to 30 minutes at a time, especially with free heroes that the game will give you every few days, as well as cash shop currancy. With this game being on PC, we're acustomed to playing an hour or more, and this game penalizes that without using cash.One new game mechanic added to the Puzzle Quest system are abilities that effect tiles on the board. Such as Iron Man placing Protect Tiles, that turn the normal gems in to shielded gems to reduce damage to your heroes, or Storm's Attack Tiles that damage your opponent. They still behave like normal gems, in that you can match them to other colors and they'll go away. Some of your enemies also place gems that have a count down timer, and will activate after a number of turns have pasted. Like HAMMER Assassins that will place Sniper Tiles on the board, and will deal heavy damage to your heros after a few turns have passed. This helps you as a player, since you can prevent the enemies abilities by matching those countdown tiles, and removing the ability before it has a chance to go off.The worst part about this game, is that when your heroes are damaged or knocked out in a game, they will have to recover and this can take up to an hour or more without using heal packs. You start out with a dozen or so, but once you run out, you'll have to pay cash for more. Also, improving your hero is terrible. Instead of earning experience in battles, you earn this ISO-8 currancy, and you spend that on heroes to improve their base health and a few other stats. To improve their abilities, you have to either spend a ton of the premium currancy or hope that you get another copy of that hero. Say you have Captain America, and he only has one ability. To unlock his other 2 abilities, you'll need another Captain America, with that ability, and add his to your hero. It requires too much luck to improve just one hero, and Puzzle Quest's bosses are betting that will pay tons of money to do so.Yes, this game has a lot of options to get ahead with cash purchases, and these purchases won't go very far, since most of them are completely random. Say you really want Spider-man on your team, then you have to option of fighting Venom to win a Spider-man with a Fantastic Four suit or throw a few dollars at random hero packs and pray he turns up.I do recommend this game for tablets, since it's best suit to short play sessions.

												A typical free to play - pay to win game. It is quite simple, catchy and a decent time killer game (It combines the classic Puzzle Quest mechanics with the Marvel heroes, as the name itself explains it pretty much). For anything more than that, you need to spend some serious cash. It is worth a try, but  it is not to be taken seriously.			"

												Very fun, and not very pay-to-win like all the reviews say.The PvE story roughly follows the Dark Reign comics, with Norman Osborn, the Green Goblin, creating the subtlely-named Dark Avengers, of which Bullseye is the best by far, in order to do something for someone, I don't know. He is opposed by Iron Man, Black Widow, Storm, Hawkeye, Wolverine, and Thor. It ends with a fairly high level boss fight, which can be easily beaten with stuns or heal abuse because it's a three-on-one curbstomp.After that, you can go through weekly events against other players to earn more ISO-8, which is your experience, or Hero Points, which can get you more slots for more characters. Most of these events have restrictions or characters that get bonuses in stats, encouraging you to use them in your team and keep the characters you're not as interested in.I haven't seen the pay-to-win much in my time of playing. Even if you buy ISO-8 and Hero Points, you're still going to have to keep up against people who have more experience with their characters than you and can set up teams with better gem coverage. And even if you get a full party of rare characters, they don't all work together as well as the lower level characters, and many of the three star characters have weaknesses to their powers, such as Iron Man Model 40's Recharge, which provides gems to use on other attacks, but stuns Iron Man for two turns.Overall, I enjoy this a good bit, and recommend it to others.

												Okay, so this clearly isn't a Triple A title but it can still be good right? Right?The answer is no. It isn't. It has good elements of fun. It's fairly entertaining as you gather new heroes, upgrade the ones you like, have cool and sometimes very useful special attacks. So what's the issue then? It's boring and poorly made.Well first off, the game is basically a Mobile Game ported to PC without ANY of the things a PC port should have. It doesn't have a resolution that would be fitting for a PC and instead looks like you're playing a Tablet game on your monitor. While that may not sound that bad, I've noticed even some of the UI choices are still touch screen like. It overall feels down right aweful to look at for extended periods of time.Next is the gameplay itself, it's very barebones as the best animations you will see is the little Gems going POOF from chain completions. The special attacks consit of your character of choice flying into the center of the screen and waggling a bit with some flashing lights and sounds.Once you figure out if you can enjoy the gameplay or not comes the ways you upgrade your heroes. It's basically random lottery as you have to get another copy of your hero to upgrade their skills, after which you then need to use ISO-8 the magical nonsense item to then increase their level. You also can only have so many heroes before you need to purchase more slots. Now that isn't too bad as it's normal, the problem is you can only use what is basically a ""Money"" currency which is limited as you only get some per day unless you wish to pay for it. The same currency is used for pretty much everything and they will try their damnedest to get you to waste it on heroes, upgrades, level increases, etc. Then they shoehorn in some Healing character nonsense that basically ripped off from Facebook games.The story missions try ever so hard to entertain and keep you interested but the lack of voices, new images and basically an interesting story that hasn't been heard over and over again, brings it down on its knees. The more interesting and rewarding stories are locked out until you play and gather Strong/OP heroes. It's not even recommended that you try them WHATSOEVER until you're very well off into the game as they will not only stomp you out but cause you to need ""Health packs"" just to recover and continue playing the game. The next part of story missions is that they often can be replayed for different loot, the problem is even though it says 1/4 things to be looted you can still gain something that ISN'T an option as loot. I've gotten ISO-20 which wasn't an option instead of ISO-100 or another Iron Man. When all you do is want to have 4/4 in loot and you have to replay the same, easy, boring level repeatedly just to make sure you have everything useful from that mission, it gets very boring.The art direction is okay at best; you have art work that doesn't look the best on these big screens as it's made for much smaller ones. The characters don't have the best animations as they seem more and more like paper cutouts than they do powerful superheroes. It's pretty underwhelming watching them play out an unskippable animation.The sound is basically the same as the art direction, bland, boring and not that interesting. I was really hoping for some good Marvel action tunes.In short, the game starts off okay but slowly turns into a long road through Pay to Play. Not too bad if played in short, short bursts but very boring if you're going to play for hours at a time.3 Broken Gems out of 10.			"

												When I first started this game I really enjoyed it. Could kick back for 30 minutes and play a matching game. But over time they changed the game mechanics so that a casual player will not get anywhere.  In order to get all the rewards you have to join an alliance.  To be in a competetive alliance they expect you to play in all the events.  And to compete in all the events is a 2-3 hour a day commitment.  At this point I followed the dozen or so friends that I had in the game a stopped playing.			"

												I'm not one to be suckered in my free games usually, but having enjoyed games like Bejewelled and Puzzle Quest in the past, I figured I'd give it a try. At first, I played a few times, and then stopped playing for a few months as I wasn't sure if it was really my thing or not. I'm not sure what made me decide to try it again one day, but as you can no doubt tell from the hours I've got recorded playing this game, I kinda liked it... just a little ;) It's likely that it was the whole 'feemium' thing that turned me off to start, but this game is generous enough to make you want to keep playing without NEEDING to spend money.I've never been a comic fanatic or anything, but I've always enjoyed the characters from the Marvel universe, and loved watching the old cartoons like X-Men. Over the years I've been playing this game, I have spent the odd bit of cash here and there, but I don't think the amount I've spent would only come to around $30 I'd say. The team at D3 are continually adding new features and characters which keep my interest, and I am a member of an alliance with a group of firends who play, which makes it a little more fun, being able to discuss things with the group. It also allows you to get extra bonuses, as when your alliance members do well in events, the whole alliance will get rewards.This is a great game to play while having my morning coffee, as it's quick, yet rewarding, but at times during certain events, can be brutally difficult (Damn ninjas!! *shakes fist*). It wouldn't be much fun if it was a walk in the park though!It's also great that they have daily events, which keeps me coming back to see what's new and what else I can get! (This unlocks after you've played through a certain amount of the single player, so don't give up too soon!)If you've ever played match 3 games, and enjoyed them, I can't recommend this one highly enough. Building up an ever expanding roster of characters as fun as the game itself! In my opinion, it's by far the best of all the Puzzle Quest games that have been released, and I even though I have spent many years playing this game, I can't see myself stopping any time soon!I notice a lot of people don't recommend this based on their not being able to sync with their mobile version, but I've only ever played on Steam, and as such, I haven't come across any of those issues. They seem to say that they're given in game currency for free (Hero Points), but you can also get that in the PC version. Perhaps the amounts you get are different or something? I don't know as I've never played the mobile one, so if you only plan to play on PC, don't let that deter you, as you can get free HP in this version too.			"

												It's a pay to win in the most extreme sense.  RNG determines if you get good heroes and even then you'd have to invest  alot of money to roll multiple times to get the good heroes. Even if you get good heroes you have to shell out even more money to level them up. They do daily quests but without a good team you're simply stuck completing low level quests for mediocre rewards. Your heroes are constantly hurt after a battle so you cant just do a bunch of quests; you can do 2 or 3 and then your done for the day			"

												Whether you will like this game depends on what you are looking for in it. Most of the criticism of this game revolves around the 'pay to win' accusations, and in a sense they're true, you're unlikely to win most of the main events if you don't sink some money into buying new heroes, health packs or slots for new heroes, so if you're the kind of person who wants to open it up and play for hours non-stop without paying a thing this game will likely frustrate you. For me I didn't want to spend much on this game, I've spent a total of £6 after 100 hours playing and I don't intend to spend anymore. When I play I'm not in a rush and am happy to slowly build up my heroes over time, I play in shorter bursts to do certain events and can play in windowed mode to rotate it around with other things. Some people get annoyed because if you lose and have run out of health packs the only way to get more is to buy them or wait to win more in certain events. As for the actual gameplay, there's not much to say. You pick three of your heroes against opposition and match the colours up to best suit the abilities of your selected heroes. It's puzzlequest and free to try out if you're unsure. Also note that for the multiplayer you are not actually playing against other people, it is against three of their heroes that the ai controls.			"

												Let me get this out of the way: this is a very nice game. It combines match-3 with cardfight (not sure what they are called) games where you level up your cards. Here you level up your (Marvel) heroes by earning Iso-8 and by earning their skills.There are events that give you big prices (lots of Iso-8 or recruit tokens for more heroes).More heroes. That's why I wouldn't recomment this game. You start with roster of 4 heroes. For every extra hero you need to buy an extra slot for Gold. You guessed it, gold is real money.Four hero slots is nothing. I played less than a day and already had 10 heroes (5 rostered and 5 waiting to be recruited).If that part of the game was any different or if buying with real money doesn't bother you: play this game. It's nice. Good graphics, nice sound effects, good skills and there's even a storyline.For me however that's a dealbreaker. You will not progress enough if you do not buy extra roster space.So...byebye MPQ.			"

												A good Puzzle game that can be fun and addicting, but a lot of bad things inside it, 1st of all a Bullcrappish on MICRO-TRANSACTIONS and this game is full of it, the power boost doesn't stack beyond 10 so anything acquired beyond that gets lost in a void. Starting with 3 to 4 Character slots and acquiring more requires you to spend in-game currency which you will end up depleting in meer minutes if you recieve better and new characters, making you SPEND MORE ON MICRO-TRANSACTIONS and they ain't cheap. Did I mention that the character slots increases it value from 50 to 100 to 150, I don't know what goes beyond that, its just ridiculous.Don't get this game if you don't wanna spend more than $5 which can only get you 3 to for new character slots, so its a waste of time esp. if the slot value increases everytime you buy a new one. ITS A GOOD GAME, BUT LEAVES A BAD TASTE IN THE END. DEVS SHOULD FIX THEIR PRICING...GREEDY BEASTARDS.			"

												Typical puzzle game with a twist. Each super hero has special abilities that are charged up by matching gems of each color. For instance, a super hero may have a power that requires 12 ""red"" gems to charge, so you must match 4 sets of 3 red stones, then that power becomes available to use. There are some interesting strategic combinations that affect the outcome of the game, and the Marvel characters are beautifully rendered.It doesn't take long, however, before you doubtlessly realize that you have hopelessly screwed up your game, either by buying heroes when you should have been buying hero slots or leveling up your existing heroes. This will basically make the game a fun sucking grind early on. The obvious solution would be to start over from scratch. This is easy... if you are playing this game on a phone. If you are playing on a PC, you're basically screwed, because the developers haven't bothered to allow players to reset their progress on PC (at least not a way that's as easy as ""start new game"").Go ahead and look up how to reset the game, and you will find a lot of conflicting opinions, and very little that is likely to work, since the solutions are all from 2013. The quick and expensive way to make your game playable again is to buy tokens to fix your FUBAR game save... so, of course, that's where they want you to go... when phone users can just delete their file and start over from scratch.This game is hopelessly flawed on PC. It's literally stops being fun as soon as you hit the brick wall of battles the game says ""are trivial"" difficulty. Unfortunately, it's yet another underwhelming Marvel title on PC. Stick to the phone if you're going to play it at all.			"

												This is game can not be more pay to win. In fact, it is the a pay to play game with typical waiting for 'health gauge to fill up or pay a price'. Even though the card arts are fansy and card types are abundent, it is no reason for develop to charge this much for a game. Please every one stay away from it. Play the classical puzzle quest, please.			"

												I would rather have paid for the game than the micro-transactions.  They are more numerous than before.  You used to be able to have 6 characters in your roster, now you can only have 4.  You use three for a battle and my thoughts about their reason for changing this is so that you don't have a second team ready to play.  Shame they made it free to play.			"

However, the in game purchases (which are the reason the game is FtP) make later quests almost frustratingly difficult. I would recommend Puzzle Quests 1, 2, or Galactrix over this title for this reason.I would much rather have had it be a $20, one-time purchase over the Free to Play model.			"

												I am not the biggest fan of freemium games since most requrie that you spend money to progress through the game. I wouldn't say that this one is the exception to the rule, but you can certainly enjoy the basics of the game without having to pay money to continue playing. I put in around 30 hours before I decided to pay 9.99 to add some ways to preserve some characters that I started winning. If you're willing to grind or play smart then you can certainly put the time in without spending a dime. I highly recommend playing the multiplayer section in the Danger Room to add some quality upgrades in a relatively easy manner. A couple quick cons - the newest update added a penalty for skipping hard multiplayer battles. It's not a huge penalty, but if you're in management or free mode then it's going to take a bite out of upgrading. I'd also like to see some of the prices come down a bit to make it easier to save your rewards if you don't want to spend money. Otherwise, this can be something to enjoy between FFVII or Metro:Last Light games.			"

												I read up on a lot of reviews before playing this and they heavily recommended against the free to play game because of the Pay-To-Win methods. Microtransactions are present and I can see where they're all coming from however this game is still a good game.For being free it provides the basic advantage of being there for you to play if you've got nothing better to do. The game isn't really one where you can sit and spend hours upon hours playing but it is great for a few minutes between things if you need to burn the time. For example, I play league of legends with my friends and always find the wait between matches about 5-10 minutes long with champion select and the loading screen included. Therefore I can get a few matches of Marvel in and still enjoy the game for what it is.After playing this game for almost a month I can finally see some serious problems as to why people wouldn't want to play this game. Even after a months time I'm unable to really collect higher level characters due to their rarity and the slow process of collecting coins to buy roster points. The game heavily presses for the purchase of coins however they're so damn expensive it would have been better for me to just buy the damn game for $60 to unlock everything. Which to be honest wouldn't even get you everything in this game since everything is given to you by chance.Either way after this month of playing I've still found myself getting one for a few matches and putting it away. Having fun and still progressing through the game even if it is slow. I recommend everyone to pick it up as a game to have on the side but it is definitially not a game I would spend all day playing.			"

												Great game of puzzle 3 match style.When it came on steam I played to be first in the versus events. I change my mind after a few months.Too much time to give to become competitive.I realized its more fun to play casualy doing the Deadpool Daily and playing versus 3-4 fights while collecting heroes.Description of the game :You get covers who represent a character with one of is powers.You can use a second cover of same character to boost the  maximum level of the character and level up the power 1/5 -> 2/5 , or give a new power among a new color. The heroes has 3 powers.There is 6 colors on the board and you need to make matches to fill your AP reserve that your heroes will consume for their powers. The more powerfull the ability , the more it will consume.You also make matches to give damage to the enemie heroes. The powers of your heroes will help doing damage, steal AP, add bonus damage, add protection, scramble the board ... etc.Every hero has 3 colors preference.Select a team of 3 heros for your battles and make them use all colors while keeping a sinergy between them.When they get damage, the damage stays for the next fight.You can wait until they heal by themselves or use Heal Card who can be gain from events or Hero Points.As you gain many heroes and play casual it will not bother anymore.Hero Points can be gain from events by reaching the high scores at the end of events.Mostly easier to gain them by using the Real Money with micro transaction.Same for Isodium (purple quartz). You gain little quantities from any fights. Mainly use for the level up of heroes. If you play casual , you will just accumulate and sell covers of new heroes for those you will gain a preference.Such as Wolverine > Hawkeye.The versus system will get you angry, and frustation once you realise how it really work.You play against AI with team made by dev or players.You gain point by winning, Bigger the difference of points make you gain more points.While your team get attack and lose .. the difference make you lose more points.When you want to do retalation. Their points are lower, so you retaliate for 10 points from a 50 points lost.  You need to wait for them to get more points ... if they go for it.You can buy shields with Hero points. And realise you can't attack anyone from your ladder, which should make you realised you are fighting other ladder who will attack you fault of knowing how aggressive the other ladder groups actualy are.Conclusion , great casual game to play.There no timer in fights and always play an AI, so you can play while other game loading maps.

												Marvel Puzzle Quest is effective at generating a false sense of achievement.  There are many different metrics by which you can make easy, regular progress.  Acquiring new characters, levelling them up, progressing through story missions, and reaching new reward tiers during the events all make it feel like your are gaining something.  Ultimately, though, it feels like a continuous grind with no real end goal.  Like many micro-transaction based games, it is more interesting to see how far you can progress without making a purchase than to buy either of their in-game currencies, so this may truely be a free-to-play game for you.

												For the first couple of days I played this game I was a little frustrated.  It seemed that the items were very overpriced (and they are), and that I couldn't get anything I wanted.  However, If you are smart at how you spend your money, use your items, and which characters you play, you can do very well in this game with little or no cash.  The real game is in the PvP, which isn't PvP at all really.  The Prologue, is just that, a starting to the real game.  Once you get 3 characters around 25-30 you can actually start playing the game which is all in building various teams who's abilities compliment each other.  I started out with Iron Man Model 35, Storm Modern, and Black Widow Modern.  This team will take you very far.  Now the anchor of my team is Black Widow Original.  She can heal and steal AP so I almost always end a fight with full health.  She does very well with Wolverine or Thor.  As you can see I've spent many hours playing this game on my PC (although half or more was probably AFK time.)  I've spent $10 on this game and I've felt it was a good choice.  My husband also plays and he spent $5.  We both spent the money to buy hero coins which we used to open slots for more characters. You will need at least 12 to get started and I currently have 18. 18 slots is enough to keep my favorites.  I never felt the need or pressure to buy for anything else.A note on the PvP, you get to choose who you play.  If you don't like the team, press skip, and you will be presented with another choice.  You can find teams you can beat at any level and since the very dumb AI is controlling the opposing team you can generally beat teams much higher level with smart play.  You get either 70 or 140 ISO-8 for every match you win, and you should be winning nearly all of them since you get to choose who you fight.  With an average of 105 ISO-8  per match and matches lasting about 3 minutes  you can level up characters very quickly in RPG terms.  However it probably seems slow for a casual mobile app.  You get points in tournaments based on the ranking of the team you fight, not their level, so with smart picks and persistence you can rank well and get good rewards early on, but if you have to come in first, you're going to have to work hard and wait a long time.  In addition to the end of tournament rewards, there are frequently progression rewards which you get regardless of your final ranking.  As there are frequently multiple tournaments hapening simultaneously and shield trainer always available, even after you've exhauseted the story line rewards there is always plenty to do and more characters to collect.  I find Marvel Puzzle Quest fun and surprisingly addictive, yet not at all pay to win.  In fact, the items are so expensive that several hundred dollars wouldn't get you very far. So those who do spend mony don't have any real advantage beyond saving a few minutes.  In summary, if you can get over the slow grind to level 30, this game really takes off and becomes much more fun.  Don't spend hero coins or money on anything other than opening up more roster slots until you fully understand what you are getting in return (i.e. hardly anthing). Participate in the tournaments early and often as this is where the ISO-8 you need to level your characters comes from even if you don't place well.  I'm not surprised that the people who only played an hour don't like it, though.  It's not really a play for a few minutes kinda game.  It's much better suited to long sessions on the PC.  It's the most fun I've had for $10 in a while.			"

												Interesting twist on bejeweledThe game play was mostly intuitive, although how exactly the enemies move/fight back is not very obvious, as there are different types of enemies that use different game mechanics to fight you. Also, choosing which ally is in front isn't very obvious either, even tho it's critical sometimes to know exactly who's in the front line and who will get the hit.This game, being free to play, has a leveling system that requires coins, which you can buy in the in-game store or otherwise purchase with real money. I'm not a big fan of free to play games for this reason, so it took away from my enjoyment of the game.The art and animations are pretty good, and the ""storyline"" is ok for a Marvel storyline. It's mostly just a big excuse to put all the Marvel characters together, but it does enough to provide a background for the game.Only not recommending this game because I dislike free to play. However, it is a solid bejeweled spin-off other than that.			"

												It's a match-3 puzzle game that lets you bring your choice of characters, each with their own special abilities, into the match. Depending on the characters, rules will be altered or added to that will alter how the match plays and can have a massive effect on the outcome of matches.Damage suffered is per-hero. Damage carries over between matches, so you can barely win one match and start another only to lose after your first turn if you don't wait for any suffered damage to your heroes to be restored. You can pay real world currency to hurry the healing along, but there's no requirement to do so.The publisher makes money from a cash shop, selling healing items, hero roster space, and random hero draws. You can get more heroes and ingame shop currency from playing the game, but even paying players feel an inventory squeeze if they're even slightly packrat-like.Think Puzzle Quest with a mostly optional microtransaction business model.

												Simpl the best Match-3 game out there, because it adds a new depth to the eternal classic by way of up to three Marvel heroes or villains battling over that board. Each of these characters has an amount of HP, three colors they deal a good amount of damage when they match them, and three abilites that can deal damage, create special tiles, rearrange the board, heal your team, or steal AP (colored tiles matched generate those to power said abilities).You can spend money on this to speed up the leveling or acquisition of new characters, but I haven't spent more than 10$ on this and have won first place in both Versus and Story events before.I can't believe I spent so many hours on this...

												if you've ever played puzzle quest (1,2, kindgoms or galactrix, idk if there are others) then you'll find the gameplay similar (swap stones to match 3 vertically/horizontaly to cause damage to opponent & gain resources used to employ secondary abilities). this iteration of the series strongly borrows from free-to-play mmos/facebook games in the form of microtransactions. characters are upgraded through cards purchased through in-game currency which is gained through rewards for completeting missions or events, or bought through the in-game shop. it also suppliments the typical puzzle quest battle system with a 3v3 marvel vs capcom style team fight, which adds another level of complexity to the game.disregarding the whole play-to-win aspect, the game itself is fun, with great artwork and an interesting variety of iconic marvel characters. at times i find the pace a bit sluggish for a casual game, and the difficulty can sometimes spike unexpectedly, but overall it is a very fun game, without needing a huge investment of time to be fun.

												I had a BLAST with Iron Man while trying to unleash FURY back into the world. I cast a web with Spider Man and fought valiantly against familiar and deadly villains and foes. This is a fast and FURY-us game with many surprises and power-ups.  I had to use SHIELD to lower the H.A.M.M.E.R while searching for the optimum match-ups to enhance my powers.  You earn rewards along the way and bolster your hero's super powers while staying alive to fight another day. All this while dodging sniper bullets and wondering what new heroes and villains are yet to be discovered.  This is a MARVEL to me and it broke the monotony from my much tamer and more usual game play.			"

												This ain't your Candy Crush Saga...Like any of the other Puzzle Quest games, this is a match 3 score puzzle game with the theme of Marvel Heroes. It has a story mode competeting off against the AI in various story scenarios, now with weekly special events allowing players a variety of PvE puzzle games to choose from. And there is also PvP arena, while also simulated by the AI, you'll face off against other player's team, composed of three of their heroes and/or villians. Competeting in these events (PvE and PvP) will place you upon a ranking system in brackets of other players around the world. In these brackets, there are milestones providing various bonuses as incentives to duel creating an addictive puzzle grind for glorious rewards.Generating in-game currency named, ""ISO"" you'll use this to level up your heroes and villians once you've unlocked (recruited) them either by purchasing the booster cards or earning them from playing the game. It's quite exciting earning cards, as each time you'll have a random chance - while some higher %'s than others - of obtaining that elusive hero or villian you've been after.It's a fantastic Puzzle Quest game, and I am a fan of the previous PQ games as well... so perhaps I'm biased, but it's definitely a fantastic match 3 puzzle game and highly reccommended by me.

												Addicting.  Having played Puzzle Quest on my PS3 I was familiear with the RPG/Match 3 hybrid mechanic.  If not, you soon will be, because the game is free, so there is no excuse to not try it out.  That being said, I'm sure the largest criticism will be that it is pay to win, which is not  *entirely* true.  If you play daily, participate in tournaments, join an alliance that is active and stay active....you will naturally earn gold coins (premium currency) and the ISO that is required for leveling characters.  You will end up selling premium covers (2 stars +), because roster slots cost gold coins, and you don't want to pay.  However, if you stick it out, keep playing, you will get those slots and then you just have to pray for good drops from cover pulls.The top players clearly pay or they have more hours in the day than God to play.  The game is meant to be casual, but can be cutthroat, give it a try, its the perfect game when you only have 15 minutes here and there.EDIT 9/10/14So being a player with 33 roster slots, Ive had some more time to reflect.  Clearly, as you progress without spending money, you are easily trumped in most high level encounters in tournaments, but success is not impossible with a little strategy and luck.  Most notably, I've noticed that as the developers continue to add new characters (covers or powers) to the possible roster, the chances that you will draw the same 3 star character necessary to level the one you already have becomes lower and lower.  For example, I've had a level 69 Hulk forever, because I have not drawn another cover due to the low 1% chance in most instances.  In the meantime I've accrued 5 or 6 other three star characters that are basically useless with only one cover outside of special circumstances during rare tournament opportunities.What this means simply is, if you can't afford new roster space to increase room for new characters, you will almost never level those three star characters necessary for higher level challenges.  The devs clearly use this to milk more money and stiff the consumer.  They need to add more two star characters and make three star character opporunities more plentiful.I still play, but with little opporunity for progression at this point, it is getting tedious and boring to play.

												It's a match-3 puzzle game that lets you bring your choice of characters, each with their own special abilities, into the match. Depending on the characters, rules will be altered or added to that will alter how the match plays and can have a massive effect on the outcome of matches.Damage suffered is per-hero. Damage carries over between matches, so you can barely win one match and start another only to lose after your first turn if you don't wait for any suffered damage to your heroes to be restored. You can pay real world currency to hurry the healing along, but there's no requirement to do so.The publisher makes money from a cash shop, selling healing items, hero roster space, and random hero draws. You can get more heroes and ingame shop currency from playing the game, but even paying players feel an inventory squeeze if they're even slightly packrat-like.Think Puzzle Quest with a mostly optional microtransaction business model.

												I've played this game for roughly two years on the iPad & iPhone, and although I've taken a few breaks, I generally play it every day.  I find it to be a somewhat repetitive but still enjoyable game.  Mechanically the battles are done using a match-3 mechanic, like a bejeweled game.  It's not hard, but I'd say it's more challenging than Candy Crush or other similar games.  The tricky part is that there's a paper-rock-sissors element to the characters, and you need to match enough a certain color gem to enable a hero's power to be used.  Like many other free-to-play games, there are two currencies, one common and another rare.  (plus a third, command points, which was recently introduced and can unlock much stronger four or five star characters).The real key to success in this game is patience and persistance.  It's somewhat pay to win, but the truth is that I'd say it's pay-regularly-to-frequently-win, or play-frequently-and-do-ok. If you just keep plugging away, your characters will continue to improve, and you'll stay reasonably competitive for a long time.  It's fairly easy to play entirely for free, though I'll admit I found there was a point somewhere around the mid-two-star level where I coughed up some actual money in order to not lose characters. In retrospect, this was unnecesary, but I didn't realize it at the time. I'd recommend reading through some of the great guides on the marvel puzzle quest forum for advice on which characters to keep and which to get rid of.I think the most fun part of this game, over time, is that the developers truly seem interested in keeping it alive and interesting. I like how they keep introducing new mechanics.  I feel like sometimes they don't entirely think through the result of their actions on the way that people play the game.  For example, right now with new command points, rewards for people like myself working on their four-stars is definitely skewed to PvE rather than PvP.  I don't know if the developers did this intentionally, or just don't realize it.  But whatever. It's still fun, and somehow it's more fun for the fact that they're not entirely polished and thoughtful in their actions.   Some people get bent out of shape about this, but I actually think the chaos that comes with each new game mechanic or meta-change keeps things fresh.  I'd recommend it for the tablet or phone.  It's the perfect game to play once or twice a day over lunch break.			"

												What could be a fun puzzle game ruined by the same cash schemes and artificial time gates of many IOS ports.Between the forced real time recovery of any hero when  they take any damage, to clear grind or pay to win keep buying covers to power up heros aspect, any fun the game has is eroded by it's petty restriciton mechanics. the game makes the more frustrating aspects of puzzle quests even more frustrating because one bad match can make an entire day effectively moot.Worse still is that while stages have multiple rewards to earn, The game will more often than not randomly decide to reward you the item you already earned, and since you cannot re earn said reward you will be given the same pitance you'd get from replaying a stage fully cleared. i've had strings of six+ fights consecutively where the reward I was given was the only one i 'earned' every single time.Without the terrible healing restriction and a way to level up heroes outside of using the same currency you must earn to buy covers the game would be a fun, if inferior sueprhero version of the classic Puzzle Quest. As it currently is the game is just going out of it's way to force you to give them money, instead of making a product you want to pay for.			"

												For the first couple of days I played this game I was a little frustrated.  It seemed that the items were very overpriced (and they are), and that I couldn't get anything I wanted.  However, If you are smart at how you spend your money, use your items, and which characters you play, you can do very well in this game with little or no cash.  The real game is in the PvP, which isn't PvP at all really.  The Prologue, is just that, a starting to the real game.  Once you get 3 characters around 25-30 you can actually start playing the game which is all in building various teams who's abilities compliment each other.  I started out with Iron Man Model 35, Storm Modern, and Black Widow Modern.  This team will take you very far.  Now the anchor of my team is Black Widow Original.  She can heal and steal AP so I almost always end a fight with full health.  She does very well with Wolverine or Thor.  As you can see I've spent many hours playing this game on my PC (although half or more was probably AFK time.)  I've spent $10 on this game and I've felt it was a good choice.  My husband also plays and he spent $5.  We both spent the money to buy hero coins which we used to open slots for more characters. You will need at least 12 to get started and I currently have 18. 18 slots is enough to keep my favorites.  I never felt the need or pressure to buy for anything else.A note on the PvP, you get to choose who you play.  If you don't like the team, press skip, and you will be presented with another choice.  You can find teams you can beat at any level and since the very dumb AI is controlling the opposing team you can generally beat teams much higher level with smart play.  You get either 70 or 140 ISO-8 for every match you win, and you should be winning nearly all of them since you get to choose who you fight.  With an average of 105 ISO-8  per match and matches lasting about 3 minutes  you can level up characters very quickly in RPG terms.  However it probably seems slow for a casual mobile app.  You get points in tournaments based on the ranking of the team you fight, not their level, so with smart picks and persistence you can rank well and get good rewards early on, but if you have to come in first, you're going to have to work hard and wait a long time.  In addition to the end of tournament rewards, there are frequently progression rewards which you get regardless of your final ranking.  As there are frequently multiple tournaments hapening simultaneously and shield trainer always available, even after you've exhauseted the story line rewards there is always plenty to do and more characters to collect.  I find Marvel Puzzle Quest fun and surprisingly addictive, yet not at all pay to win.  In fact, the items are so expensive that several hundred dollars wouldn't get you very far. So those who do spend mony don't have any real advantage beyond saving a few minutes.  In summary, if you can get over the slow grind to level 30, this game really takes off and becomes much more fun.  Don't spend hero coins or money on anything other than opening up more roster slots until you fully understand what you are getting in return (i.e. hardly anthing). Participate in the tournaments early and often as this is where the ISO-8 you need to level your characters comes from even if you don't place well.  I'm not surprised that the people who only played an hour don't like it, though.  It's not really a play for a few minutes kinda game.  It's much better suited to long sessions on the PC.  It's the most fun I've had for $10 in a while.			"

												Fun puzzle game elements, but there seems to be a strong pay to win aspect. The core gameplay is fun, but the pvp events seem to favor those who choose to drop large amounts of money, or have devoted an insane amount of time. Levelling the characters can be frustrating because of how little iso8, akak xp, you get after completing past levels and even new levels. The event PVE's do off good rewards though. Allowing you to get recruit tokens of varying types somewhat easily. There seems to be a decent amount of hackers though. Players who have thousands of points in the event with low level characters pop up fairly often and it can be frustrating.Gameplay wise: It is fun to play in quick bursts, but the leveling and hero acquisition can be frustrating. Pay to win is a little too obvious. Otherwise, I find it fun to play, but I try and take breaks otherwise I get frustrated.			"

												The most fundamental problems with this game are:1) While Free To Play doesn't always equal Pay To Win etc, the main problem with this title is that they give you a heap of extra random characters (and in fact specific ones too!) as rewards, but you can't keep them without paying money... and the rewards have a time limit.  You are able to win some of the precious purchasable tokens as rewards, but nowhere near enough to keep up with the characters you receive.2) While the game lets you play on a variety of places, and in fact makes you sign up with a random external system... there are no in game links to the external system, and they seem to have removed the ability for this Steam version to properly synch with the other devices. I believe some people can and have done this, but either it's been removed from this version, or if you didn't immediately agree then your one opportuniy to do this is never repeated.3) Lack of in-game support.  Sure - everyone who has played PQ or even anything like it knows the basics.  And there is a tutorial mode which is ridiculously hand-holding, but... later when you want to look up stupid technical things, it is quite difficult to navigate.4) Everything suddenly gets tied to PvP, which causes everything to be heavily Pay to Win.  There's not enough story of appropriate level to keep people playing on a PvE level... so you either fork out cash to level, or you ... stop playing?Problem: I love superheroes.  I love Puzzle Quest.  This... is... almost? ish? what people should expect from a free-to-play game that works on phones and tablets (at least these days) but I have objections to games that make you stop playing them as a game mechanic... especially on a PC.

												The most fundamental problems with this game are:1) While Free To Play doesn't always equal Pay To Win etc, the main problem with this title is that they give you a heap of extra random characters (and in fact specific ones too!) as rewards, but you can't keep them without paying money... and the rewards have a time limit.  You are able to win some of the precious purchasable tokens as rewards, but nowhere near enough to keep up with the characters you receive.2) While the game lets you play on a variety of places, and in fact makes you sign up with a random external system... there are no in game links to the external system, and they seem to have removed the ability for this Steam version to properly synch with the other devices. I believe some people can and have done this, but either it's been removed from this version, or if you didn't immediately agree then your one opportuniy to do this is never repeated.3) Lack of in-game support.  Sure - everyone who has played PQ or even anything like it knows the basics.  And there is a tutorial mode which is ridiculously hand-holding, but... later when you want to look up stupid technical things, it is quite difficult to navigate.4) Everything suddenly gets tied to PvP, which causes everything to be heavily Pay to Win.  There's not enough story of appropriate level to keep people playing on a PvE level... so you either fork out cash to level, or you ... stop playing?Problem: I love superheroes.  I love Puzzle Quest.  This... is... almost? ish? what people should expect from a free-to-play game that works on phones and tablets (at least these days) but I have objections to games that make you stop playing them as a game mechanic... especially on a PC.  Sorry - it's a stupid design.			"

												This game feels like not only a Facebook game, but a system to aimed to make you spend money for credits to do ANYTHING.  As a casual game, you can only play for about 10 minutes before all your characters are injured and require time to heal.  So maybe if you're looking for a 10 minute game you play every hour or so, this might be for you.			"

												I am really into puzzle games. This one is rather confusing for me. But, I kinda caught on. Otherwise, it's pretty fun even though I didn't know what was going on. But it also get's pretty hard too. When You get to pick your characters once you buy them sometimes it wouldn't let me pick the one I wanted to use which was not fun.

												The game was fun when I started playing it.  It required strategy to beat some matchups with Wolverine and Thor.  It was possible to beat almost anyone at the same level as you with even the basic three characters of Storm, Black Widow, and Iron Man. Even tougher enemies were no problem if you had boosts. Boosts were availavble for cheap in game currency of ISO-8 which you easily can get playing any level.  Only two of them required the premium currency of coins.  Now boosts have doubled in Iso-8 price and even more of them require coins to purchase.  The developers have totally changed it to pay to win.  Check the number 1 ranked people in the tournaments and see if how many of their people are three star level 133 characters that just came out a week ago.			"

												At first this game was fun and addicting, I played it on Steam, and then I got it on my Android phone too. Eventually, the problems started like being a free to play game, it's built around the concept of spending money now or wait a while. Early on, you can get through the levels and it's fun, but as you get into the game, you'll notice that your heroes take damage in the puzzle battles, so you can wait like 15 minutes for one guy to heal, so ok go and use your other Avengers. The further you get, the more the waiting times add up, and the game wants you to buy health packs with real money. It also doesn't carry over from version to version so if you did spend money on microtransactions on Steam, it wouldn't show up on a mobile version that you own. It's a big waste of time, and potentially money if you go that route. It doesn't offer a great deal of free content before it tries every last resort to bleed you for money.			"

												ok, I wanted to rage about this game so bad, I have played it on my mobile for so long, I cant just quit my 2 year rooster jsut to start over, but hey ... thats greed ... coming from the developer who wishes to drain as much money from your poket as possible. Dont play it as so many have said it has the worse type of pay to win scheme in place, even if you win new heroes it doesent guarantee you will be able to use it unless you pay money to open space in your rooster for them. Its scumbag behaviour. On top of it all now there are a lot of new 3star heroes which if you played anywhere from more than a month you would know that these dont come at a certainty, I have around 10-15 3 star heroes only with 1 or 2 covers (and you need 13 covers to get a heroe to max level). It sucks that you cant convert any number of 1 or 2 star covers to have a 3 star that you actually need. DO NOT PLAY IT.			"

												This game still has too many flaws.  The game overall gives weak rewards and demands alot.  This game leans in favor of the Pay-to-Win playstyle by only giving you the chance to earn/grind small power for free and offering the option to ""purchase"" greater strengths.The puzzle system itself should have another look at because no one player should be able to match 3 colors, then the boards drops all the next right tiles to make an 11-combo match, that's just rediculous.I myself have been able to score 2 free moves in a row by matching +5 tiles in a row.  given that you never actually play against other people, just their computer-controlled teams, it's still unbalanced.If this game gets an update to make it better, i'll undo this review.  Until then this is how i feel.			"

												What could be a fun puzzle game ruined by the same cash schemes and artificial time gates of many IOS ports.Between the forced real time recovery of any hero when  they take any damage, to clear grind or pay to win keep buying covers to power up heros aspect, any fun the game has is eroded by it's petty restriciton mechanics. the game makes the more frustrating aspects of puzzle quests even more frustrating because one bad match can make an entire day effectively moot.Worse still is that while stages have multiple rewards to earn, The game will more often than not randomly decide to reward you the item you already earned, and since you cannot re earn said reward you will be given the same pitance you'd get from replaying a stage fully cleared. i've had strings of six+ fights consecutively where the reward I was given was the only one i 'earned' every single time.Without the terrible healing restriction and a way to level up heroes outside of using the same currency you must earn to buy covers the game would be a fun, if inferior sueprhero version of the classic Puzzle Quest. As it currently is the game is just going out of it's way to force you to give them money, instead of making a product you want to pay for.			"

												Another sad example of a f2p that is p2w. Basic heroes are basically garbage. They do little damage and have very low hp. Even the easiest missions will require the use of health packs if you want to play more than 2 matches in a row. Pvp is a joke. People will say it's about how you play, but when your opponent has 500hp more than you and is doing 5x as much damage, all the skill in the world isn't going to be much use.			"

												Marvel Puzzle Quest is meant to be a puzzle game with RPG-ish elements where you can level up your character and increase the damage of their attacks by spending points on them. The thing is that you rarely get these points (coins in-game). You can tell that this game is the typical free-to-play game when they hit you with the fact that you either have to waste health packs on your heroes to recharge their health or wait 10 minutes to heal your heroes. Marvel Puzzle Quest is really designed as the average mobile game where you come back after your characters are able to be used (i.e. Injustice Mobile). So this is a Marvel version of puzzle quest, which is basically bejeweled except your actions control characters' attacks. There is a cool factor to this where you can increase the powers of your heroes by using resources you collect (Iso-8 Crystals) BUT you can't even purchase these upgrades until you purchase another ""layer"" of your character... AND THE THING IS that you can't do that without COINS, YES RARE ♥♥♥ COINS!!! Level 1 upgrades are 125 coins and I just want to point out that 200 coins costs 2 DOLLARS!!! Why do the creators try to screw us like this? But besides this In-Game-Purchase BS, the story really isn't even interesting, and the dialogue is quite boring. If only the heroes and villains had voices behind them it would be more interesting. This game does have some pros to it buy mostly cons. Not recommended...maybe to puzzle quest fans and very patient people but it doesn't change the fact that this game has tedious recharge times, boring dialogue and an uninteresting story.			"

												Originally it was a moderately entertaining F2P game that was still enjoyable without spending much real money on. The in game economy was always horribly broken. The 100 to 1 Hero Point ratio was not bad, but what it bought you was ridiculous. For an example unlocking one level of a skill in a three star(Rare) character is 1250 HP. Or $12.50. They want $12.50 to unlock one level of one skill of which there are 13 per character. Or around $150 if you want to completely unlock one character. Fine, I was happy to play alound with the covers I could get through tournament rewards and the daily drops. Then came along the latest patch. Instead of fixing the rampant cheating or other various broken portions of the game, they decide to nerf some of the better characters that are relatively easy for the free players to get. No Devs, they weren't overpowered, they were accessible and most of the other accessible characters suck. Again, nerfing happens, most devs have still yet to realize it's better to balance up than down, but any relatively experienced gamer is used to that. But they also decided to start charging HP for the +3AP to all boost. They're now charging the equivalent of $1 for a stack of three boosts that will last maybe 10 to 15 minutes of game time and is very necessary for the casual players. The devs basically too a look at the game stats, saw what the casual players used most, and either made them less effective or started charging for them. I had intended on buying $15 or so worth of HP to support the game and buy some roster slots, but I am definitely glad I waited and they will now never see a dime from me.			"

												I neither recommend or dislike this game for a simple reason, and that is that you CAN get a lot of it without paying. What you cannot do is compete at the higher levels without paying or expand your character space.There are issues with the gameplay, it does seem rather annoying that whatever you do as a player the AI always get the jewels they want. And it is also very, very frusrtating that when you are fighting bosses who need certain colours for thier attacks they miraculously drop for them regularly but not for you, and the only way to beat them is to grind and compete in daily events to potentially win better characters.And therein lies the nub of this game, to use better characters and not scrap the ones you have invested time and ISO in you have to purchase character slots and these go up in price aswell as size as you play daily. So now I need 300 gold to purchase 3 slots, rather than being able to buy 1 for 100.This is all very clever from a P2W point of view, but will simply mean I will move on if I cannot win enough gold to use these characters. But the very, very sad part of that is that the characters have a time limit on their availability, tempting you to spend money. I find that rather manipulative and poor.I have seen players with six pages of characters, and goodness knows how much they have spent. That more than outweighs those of us who play for fun, so let them do it and enjoy a simple game for nothing. "

												Fun puzzle game elements, but there seems to be a strong pay to win aspect. The core gameplay is fun, but the pvp events seem to favor those who choose to drop large amounts of money, or have devoted an insane amount of time. Levelling the characters can be frustrating because of how little iso8, akak xp, you get after completing past levels and even new levels. The event PVE's do off good rewards though. Allowing you to get recruit tokens of varying types somewhat easily. There seems to be a decent amount of hackers though. Players who have thousands of points in the event with low level characters pop up fairly often and it can be frustrating.Gameplay wise: It is fun to play in quick bursts, but the leveling and hero acquisition can be frustrating. Pay to win is a little too obvious. Otherwise, I find it fun to play, but I try and take breaks otherwise I get frustrated.			"

												Like all FTP games, there's a definite paywall here. But I've been playing for over 2 years now without spending a single dime (I'm not prideful that I haven't spent money, but am prideful that I've progressed as far as I have) and still feel as though I'm competitive. A surprisingly deep puzzle game that also features a bit of Marvel magic. Well worth an investment of time; and I'm sure money (if you're so inclined).			"

												Great game of puzzle 3 match style.When it came on steam I played to be first in the versus events. I change my mind after a few months.Too much time to give to become competitive.I realized its more fun to play casualy doing the Deadpool Daily and playing versus 3-4 fights while collecting heroes.Description of the game :You get covers who represent a character with one of is powers.You can use a second cover of same character to boost the  maximum level of the character and level up the power 1/5 -> 2/5 , or give a new power among a new color. The heroes has 3 powers.There is 6 colors on the board and you need to make matches to fill your AP reserve that your heroes will consume for their powers. The more powerfull the ability , the more it will consume.You also make matches to give damage to the enemie heroes. The powers of your heroes will help doing damage, steal AP, add bonus damage, add protection, scramble the board ... etc.Every hero has 3 colors preference.Select a team of 3 heros for your battles and make them use all colors while keeping a sinergy between them.When they get damage, the damage stays for the next fight.You can wait until they heal by themselves or use Heal Card who can be gain from events or Hero Points.As you gain many heroes and play casual it will not bother anymore.Hero Points can be gain from events by reaching the high scores at the end of events.Mostly easier to gain them by using the Real Money with micro transaction.Same for Isodium (purple quartz). You gain little quantities from any fights. Mainly use for the level up of heroes. If you play casual , you will just accumulate and sell covers of new heroes for those you will gain a preference.Such as Wolverine > Hawkeye.The versus system will get you angry, and frustation once you realise how it really work.You play against AI with team made by dev or players.You gain point by winning, Bigger the difference of points make you gain more points.While your team get attack and lose .. the difference make you lose more points.When you want to do retalation. Their points are lower, so you retaliate for 10 points from a 50 points lost.  You need to wait for them to get more points ... if they go for it.You can buy shields with Hero points. And realise you can't attack anyone from your ladder, which should make you realised you are fighting other ladder who will attack you fault of knowing how aggressive the other ladder groups actualy are.Conclusion , great casual game to play.There no timer in fights and always play an AI, so you can play while other game loading maps.

												Simpl the best Match-3 game out there, because it adds a new depth to the eternal classic by way of up to three Marvel heroes or villains battling over that board. Each of these characters has an amount of HP, three colors they deal a good amount of damage when they match them, and three abilites that can deal damage, create special tiles, rearrange the board, heal your team, or steal AP (colored tiles matched generate those to power said abilities).You can spend money on this to speed up the leveling or acquisition of new characters, but I haven't spent more than 10$ on this and have won first place in both Versus and Story events before.I can't believe I spent so many hours on this...

												Solo content is minimum, and 99% of the game is competitive; but all events are extremely dependent on event ending time, and all are tailored for american players.Constant changes in game mechanics make gameplay too chaotic; event rules are not clear; game dangerously drifting towards pay to win.The game is not bad (its a puzzle quest, simple enaugh) as the leveling system. 3/10 for european players			"

												I don't normally go for these ""gem"" games...they make me nervous.  But this is a new take on an old concept.  I found it fun 'cause by lining um up you activate different heroes and different powers used by those heroes.  Plus, there are some cinematics in-between the rounds of gems for flavor.  Apparently there are other types of puzzles in the game..? Didn't play long enough to find out on my first go.  I paid for the first 2 DLC packs but not sure how to tell that I got them.  There was no additional download.  I liked it, but then I eat Marvel for meals.			"

This is like it in the way that your hero(s)have abilities to do a give move to help defeat your enemy.  It also reminds me of Bejewled games with the shape of the puzzle pieces(?)

												Great game, tons of fun. I've got over 60 hours of game play and I've never spend over US$5. This is THE BEST Puzzle Quest game yet. Don't listen to people who say it pay to win, you can buy 100,000 hero points and still never make to a top 5 finish, I had my first top 5 finish this week, AMAZING!Fair warning, either take the long view (log in a couple of hours a week for a long time) or prepare to grind if you want to be competitive in PVP. Well, that's true for all games, paid or free, so that's not much of a down side to the game.			"

												I read most of the reviews, and saw how negative people were because of the microtransactions. Having tried the game, I can say that even though there is a lot of microtransactions, they do not restrict you in any way. So far, I have been able to get most things just by playing, and have been awarded a decent amount of coins just because of playing. Of course, you won't be able to own everything by playing, but you also don't have to buy anything.As far as gameplay goes, the game offers a fine experience, some strategy, and a lot of puzzling, and I find myself enjoying it, especially considering that it's free.The best thing I can say is that you try the game yourself and see if you think that microtransactions bother you or not. In my opinion, I think they are not and that you can enjoy this game decently without paying anything.			"

Bonus couns can be obrain by playing campaign.The game was nice and later need a lot of tactics. BUT now negatives:Game was fun, until new wave of balancing. Changing abilities to balance game is ok when it is phase of beta testing, but not in middle of game, when a lot of players use real money for hero builts.Before balancing good combination of heroes could defeat much stronger heroes, but after balancing good combination of heroes can defeat only same level team. Whatis the worst, that balancing were only 2 and 3 stars heroes, so now many of one stars heroes (low quality heroes) are stronger than 2 or 3 stars heroes.			"

It's pretty fun, I'd recommend it to someone who likes puzzle games and marvel characters. My number one dissapointment with this game is that I started playing it on my Android device and have invested a good amount of time and some money into it, but my account from my android does not yet link to my steam account, thus I cannot transfer between the two. When you play this game, be sure you're choosing the platform you want the most before you get too deep into it.			"

												I neither recommend or dislike this game for a simple reason, and that is that you CAN get a lot of it without paying. What you cannot do is compete at the higher levels without paying or expand your character space.There are issues with the gameplay, it does seem rather annoying that whatever you do as a player the AI always get the jewels they want. And it is also very, very frusrtating that when you are fighting bosses who need certain colours for thier attacks they miraculously drop for them regularly but not for you, and the only way to beat them is to grind and compete in daily events to potentially win better characters.And therein lies the nub of this game, to use better characters and not scrap the ones you have invested time and ISO in you have to purchase character slots and these go up in price aswell as size as you play daily. So now I need 300 gold to purchase 3 slots, rather than being able to buy 1 for 100.This is all very clever from a P2W point of view, but will simply mean I will move on if I cannot win enough gold to use these characters. But the very, very sad part of that is that the characters have a time limit on their availability, tempting you to spend money. I find that rather manipulative and poor.I have seen players with six pages of characters, and goodness knows how much they have spent. That more than outweighs those of us who play for fun, so let them do it and enjoy a simple game for nothing. "

												This game only gets a 3/10 from me. It's fun to an extent, but unless you're willing to dump some serious coin into a game its pretty worthless. Takes way too long to get any good characters (unless you're lucky) and even if you do, you're stuck using a level 40 with one move unless.... (you guessed it) pay money and try to get more cards. I understand that it's F2P but good god why all the microtransactions?!			"

												As fun as puzzle quest types get.If you are a fan of Marvel or a fan of Puzzle Quest types, you should probably try this game.I have lost quite a few hours on it and I am not the biggest fan of the genre.The gameplay is more or less what you'd expect, and the Marvel flavour is fairly nice with an assortment of characters and enough goals in terms of levelling and collecting to keep you interested.Good game.

												Key notes here:  1:  The cash shop is pretty hard in this game, and new players will feel left out if they can not get into an alliance.That said.  If your alliance can rank in the top 500 or so consistently you can all but avoid the cash shop with all the free goods and recruit tokens you can earn.  Taco vault 10 packs are super good if you wont want to drop 50 bucks for a 40 pack.  Team slots are point efficent untill you can only get single slots, and even then you do need alot of them.EVEN WITH THAT!  I love the smooth intuitve game play (well, as intuitive as a tile matching game gets)  there is a good sense of balance when you go against equally ranked teams.  And best of all, it is mostly effort that wins.			"

												I like the requirement for various characters to charge up their abilities via matching a certain number and color of tiles. Team formations can be a little tricky with the amount of characters that are available at the start, however, that's where strategy and technique comes in.			"

												I play this game on mobile and iPad and love it. However, while on the mobile platform you can link to your Facebook account to save progress, this version doesn't have that capability so I cannot play with my account on it. Sucks, as I would like ot be able to play it on my PC as well. As a result, the PC version gets a WNR from me.			"

												Horrible, Greedy, Lopsided GameI want to like this game. I want to like it so much. And there are times I do. This is a rant, pure and simple.And then the overhwleming amount of the time I see it for the money grab it is. One battle where the underpowered AI pulls off a random cascade of combos puts my strongest characters out for three hours and there is nothing I can do.I can't wain tournaments to get 2 star, 3 star or 4 star characters because I'm put in tournaments with people who have strong characters. Even if I do manage to win one, I then have to wait for my heroes to heal. And in that time I'm attacked so many times I'm back to no points in the tournament.I'll admit I have no life recently, so I've spent a whole day trying to get to the top in an event. And it just isn't possible. While I can devote every hour, I will always lose to someone with a few high level 3 stars who is put in the same event as me.It must be really fun for someone who has a lot of money, because as soon as you have good characters, the game rewards you with more through the tournaments and events. I'm beginning to see that no matter how long I play, I will always be behind because the devs give no chance for me to catch up. Those who already have 3 star characters are pulling away and getting more. By the time I have one, who I can decently level with covers, they will have 20.And why can't we turn covers into a free level for our character, rather than have to sell them? I'm sick of getting the same 1 star cover for characters with maxed powers. The only rewards I can get are standard tokens, so at least make them useful in some way.			"

												The good:The game provides a ton of characters that have different abilities. The campaign missions are quite boring, but the online events provide a great deal of variety. It is challenging game. At first you will run out of medkits, but after a while you will notice you have to play smart.The bad:The game could have some 3d characters, more in depth conversations between the missions, and not one line chit chat.

												I've been playing this game on iOS for a month and a half so far (since it came out), and I have to admit that so far the iOS model seems a little better, but the major flaw here is that the iOS version had a much longer and slower learning curve and far more ways to gain characters and level up without feeling vastly behind in the game.  This Steam launch version is the exact same model as the current (updated yesterday) version on iOS, on which I have spent ZERO real money, and my characters are level capped and I am enjoying the game quite a bit.  TLDR: give it time, don't spend real money, missions are the way to go!			"

												This title constitutes a rather pleasant surprise by Marvel due to the fact it is something completely different from what we are used to. By extension if you are willng to put aside action RPG΄s and MMO's for a while you will discover a very beautiful puzzle game with beautiful graphics and even a storyline based on Marvel Comics!

												I've been playing this game on my android since it was released, I've easily put 50 hours into the game, I have 25 roster slots, over ten heroes that are Lv30+ all without spending a dollar. Don't put this game down for microtransactions since you don't need to spend a dollar with all the rewards the tournametns and the PvE gives you.-Update-I still see people are complaining about the Microtransactions. 1) If you play the game daily roughly 2 hours a day and do all the missions in the PVE events and PVP a couple times a day you should get roughly 3,000-5,000 Iso-8, the tool to level up your characters. It costs roughly 20k Iso-8 to max out any 1* Hero and roughly 80k to max out a 2* hero. You will be able to max out any 1* or 2* character within weeks of just playing a couple hours a day. 2. You will also roughly get a few hundred Hero Points in the process, if you are starting out the game. Use them on the 100 Daily Deal Heroic pack. That is how you max out your 2*s. If you have played the game for a while, save the Hero Points for Alliance slots, or join an open alliance. I created a 20 person alliance and only spent twenty bucks on it, I could have waited a month for the same ammount of Hero Points. ((Some people spent a hundred))3. Now for the 3* covers, playing a lot in any tournament or event will nail you 1-3 3* covers of one hero. You will also get covers through the Heroic Packs and any other special pack that you spend your free hero points on. They require alot of Iso-8 to max out. 170k for a rough estimate. HOWEVER the final level still requires only 2500 iso-8, which is something you can easily get within an hour. 4. Guys this isn't a game that you get Lv100 of all the strongest characters within hours of playing. This game is set up more of an MMO where you have to do the slow grind to get to that point. I don't mind it. I currently have 5 maxed out 2* Characters at Lv85, 3 maxed out 1* characters and I have a handful of other 2 and 3* characters over lv50 with two that I just need to grind all the way to max level. I've only spent fifty bucks on this game because I actually felt like it. I didn't feel like I needed to in order to continue this game. To compare with other games I've played, I put almost a thousand bucks in to League of Legends and I had put six hundred bucks into Dungeon Fighter Online before that got shut down. I probably could spend more money into this game, but I don't.			"

												I do not understand why others cry over this. It is a fun casual game that you may play when you don't feel like playing hardcore games. You do not need to invest money in this game, you just have to have a good strategy. Here is hint: Take every event and go as far as you can in them. You will get nice rewards from events. Also, I am pretty excited when I get a new hero with good level or when I level up my favorites. I hope they will put Steam trading cards.In conclusion, it is a very nice game. It is casual, but you still need a little strategy. With my hint from above you may get far.			"

												8/10This is a free-to-play Match 3 game.There are MANY others like it, but I'm a comic book fan, (Slightly more a DC/Vertigo fan but still love some of the Marvel lines.) and this isn't the worst thing to happen to the franchise, or even the top 3 terrible things. *If they got Halle Berry to VO the game, it could get there...)The game itself is adequately executed (as the producers of ""Electra"" should be...) It's ... well, it's Puzzle Quest, with a few Marvel bits thrown in so your power-ups share the names of your chosen heroes' powers (Iron man's Repulsors, etc)The ""Story"" arouond the game... They try, and didn't destroy a load of canon to beat a storyline around the missions.The Free-To-Play bit...Obviously they're going to try to take your money, but they don't throw it in your face constantly, nor do they ask you to ""Share your victory with a friend"" every 5 minutes. If you play a little bit every day you can easily get enough rewards to make up for not paying for stuff, but if you want you can speed up your success. Just remember to save all your ""Hero Points"" for when you actually need them, and you'll have them when you do come upon a need.			"
