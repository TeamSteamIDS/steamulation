												Polished, entertaining game.  Played through it straight twice, and I can see myself playing through it again in the future.  I could list some pro's and con's or repeat what others have already said, but instead I will highlight a few points which may clarify some of the mixed points you will see in other reviews.  The purpose, I hope, is to help potential buyers in figuring out the perspective from which other reviewers are coming from.1.  The game is ""linear"" in that you are expected to go a certain path on the game world, but the path is not in a straight line.  This will throw off some players who are used to the typical themepark RPG set-up where the game holds your hand on how to get to the next area.For a slightly spoiler-ish example:  Early on you will get a quest to kill a high level enemy blocking the road, a road which also leads to another part of the game map.  You are not supposed to kill said enemy at that point, as your party will get slaughtered.  A note tells there is a back way around, which is the intended path.  Thus, some players get ""frustrated"" by trying to brute-force their way through an encounter which is designed to be avoided until later.The game has several of these set-ups (and honestly, get a bit predictable by the end).  If you are the type which prefers the modern take with quest compasses and the game telling you exactly where to go next, this will be a con.  If, however, you enjoy seeing the game map as a ""puzzle"" and discovering how to proceed to the next area, then don't mind this ""con"" you may see in other reviews.It should also be noted that the game does drop clues on how to proceed, so it doesn't feel ""cheap"" as long as you are paying attention.  With the above example, there are 3 or 4 hints that try and tell you to take this back route.2.  Difficulty.  The combat in this game is turn-based whack each other in the face.  Thus, like other games of this type, combat boils down to which side has the bigger numbers.  The discrepancy you will see in regards to difficulty comes from the game starting you out with ""smaller numbers"" than even the beginning fights, which may feel like it is overly difficult.For better or worse, the way around this isn't necessarily advertised.  There are priests in each city which can apply a 24 hour (in-game time) blessing.  These blessings are very powerful early on, because they take your ""small stack of numbers"" and boost it up to the point where early fights are no longer overly challenging.Thus, the best way to get through the early game, to get some early levels and gear on your characters to make fights manageable, is to quest in ""bouts"".  Apply a few blessings, then do a quest or clear an area.  Head back to town, heal up, re-apply blessings and head back out.  You won't need to keep doing this the whole game (in fact it would get extremely expensive and tedious), as later on they are not as needed, but they are the best, efficient way to start out.So don't be fooled by reviews claiming the game is overly difficult or challenging.  The game does offer the tools needed, but the ""flaw"" is that the tools aren't exactly advertised well to the new player.  If you dive straight into the game without blessings, you will find the early game to be extremely unforgiving.  If you get past the early game, you will find the difficulty pacing more comfortable.  Perhaps even too easy.A bit long for a Steam review, but people who read these just want to know what they may be getting if they drop the money, so I wanted to clarify some discrepancy.  I had a lot of fun with the game, but it may not be for everyone.  For me, personally, I've ran into zero bugs or crashes and got a solid 150+ hours out of it, which is more that can be said about a lot of modern 60$ AAA releases. "

												I want to start off by thanking Numantian Games for making a game with such an old school feel and a huge world and play time to back it up. I feel bad buying this game for 19.99, it is definitely worth a higher asking price. Lords of Xulima was an awesome experience.Here are my thoughts on the game, both good and bad:POSITIVE:+ The graphics are gorgeous. They are the perfect balance between old school and modern without being overly flashy. I loved the aesthetics of the enviornments.+ The animations while in combat were much more than I expected. The models of some of the more epic fights are extremely well done. + For the most part, there are a ton of different enemy visuals. Some games tend to just rehash skins for certain enemies over and over with different colors to ""differeniate."" Lords does this a few times, but for the most part, there are a ton of different visuals and it adds to the flavor and keeps the game fresh.+ Open world gameplay. Lords is not completely linear, and it gives you the freedom to roam around and just kind of do your thing. Tons of sidequests/areas to explore. Do what you please!+ As far as gameplay length versus asking price, this game is unbeatable as far as indie games are concerned. 70+ hours of gamplay for 20 bucks? On an INDIE title? That is unheard of. Wow.+ Challenging. I have seen a lot of people on the forums complain about the difficulty of the game (too hard!), but I felt it was near perfect. There are three difficulties and different levels of challenges for all types of players, from casual to hardcore.+ The Lore. Numantian created a beautiful world filled with all types of creatures and Gods and they all have their personalities and roles. +Combat and strategy is well done. You have things to consider like positioning, resource management, different weapon types, debuff strats (should i stack bleeds/wounds/stuns?), skill allocation, among much more. There is a pretty good amount of depth here.The MEDIOCRE:+ The story. I understand this game is not completely story focused and development was probably emphasized on other aspects. I actually liked the story, it wasn't bad by any means, it just wasn't amazing. For the books though, I really enjoyed the ending. A lot. Props on the ending!+ Slightly grindy with the aspect of food. I understand the food system is necessary for this type of game and it adds a lot of strategy and decision making, but it can get repetitive to just grind out food resources in order to conserve precious gold.+ Itemization is a bit boring. Because of the way the stats on gear are designed, they aren't overly interesting or force you to make deliberate choices/tradeofffs. A few stats are just a bit too overpowered and could use some balancing (I won't mention any names).The BAD:+ This is my only big complaint about the game. The way that you obtain loot.. For the most part, much of your gear will come from the vendor. Basically end game is just constantly checking all the vendors over and over again hoping a good item spawns. You will occasionally find a good item naturally from a chest, but it is very rare. Having vendors being the strongest source of loot in the game seems like a poor design. Finding a really strong item on a vendor does not have the same rewarding effect as if the item was obtained after overcoming a difficult encounter.Suggestions:+ Crafting. I really wanted to see a crafting system in Lords. I don't see why a regular base item plus some unique crafting currencies couldn't yield some new items. + I feel like some really cool items could have been created that would have fit the themes of the lore. Something creative like ""Life's Spark - Febret's Touch,"" a unique staff which can only be equipped by certain classes and has unique effects/stats. Explore the design space!Overall Lords of Xulima is an amazing title. If you are a fan of Baldur's Gate style games, definitely give Lords a try. It is the best game of this style I have played in years. Lords of Xulima takes about 60-80 hours to complete. It will just depend on your pacing/how much you are into questing around and doing side stuff.9.5/10			"

												HIGHLY  RECOMMENDEDOne of the best turn-based turn-based battle systems I've played in a long time. Almost as good as Wizardry 8.+10 Character classes with a lot of customization of sub-specialties+Interesting story+You can buy skill points +6 Party members. Front and back rows like Wizardry or Elminage Gothic+Challenging (3 difficulty settings, cannot be changed once started)+Some good puzzles+Unique turn-based combat mechanic with a lot of different status effects+Fantastic soundtrack+Food management+Old-school+Interface scales with resolution-You can't respec skill points. I would be happy to have an option to spend a large amount of gold to do this or make it one of the features of the Talisman of Golot-No zoom option-Minor menu glitchesWas it worth the price? Absolutely.			"

												I grew up in the 80s. I remember oldschool games. I was a teenager in the 90s, and remember the RPG gems of the era, a lost age as far as I'm concerned. Games where the story and sense of exploration, strategy in combat was more important than flashy cutting edge graphics. Games where literacy was important and they came with huge manuals, with a fleshed out backstory and bestiaries of all the monsters.Lords of Xulima hearkens back to that era, the late 90s isometric RPGs, but with the traditional turn based first person ""enemy in front of you where your chars portraits are on the bottom of the screen"" RPG format. Its fun. Its awesome. Ive wanted an RPG like this for ages. Deep story, decent combat, a sense of exploration and wanting to see what was farther down the path. I love this game and would recommend it for anyone who finds modern ""RPGs"" lacking.			"

TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Lords of Xulima (pronounced as 'Shoo-lee-mah') is a 2D isometric old-school role playing game from Madrid-based developers Numantian Game Studios.  The game is a ‘Kick starter’ success story that, as far as I know, had an original goal of only $10,000 but managed to reach a grand total of $35,657 by its end.  The game features a world map gameplay similar to that of Heroes of Might and Magic and King's Bounty, but has a combat mechanic that is more akin to the Might and Magic series with certain areas of the game being blocked off by monsters until you're powerful enough to defeat them or find a way around them.The game places you in the boots of Gaulen, an adventurer summoned by one of the nine (9) gods to go to their divine homeland of Xulima where a civil war has broken out when the god of death declared war against the other eight (8) gods.  Gaulen sets sail with five (5) other companions but to their dismay, upon reaching Xulima, the gods had already left and in their place, terrible lords have taken power who will stop at nothing to keep Gaulen from interfering with the on-going war between the gods.PROS:+ Good 2D graphics and art style but... (See CON #4)+ Well implemented gameplay that is reminiscent of old CRPG titles+ Helpful first mission tutorial and tool tips that covers the game's basic elements+ Challenging difficulties+ Good class system with different skills and abilities but… (See CON #2 and #3)+ Good atmosphere for a CRPG with day and night cycles as well as weather effects on some maps+ Healthy game time+ Large world with a lot of room for exploration+ Good story worthy of a sequel but… (See CON #5 and 6)CONS:- The main character cannot be customized to have another class or portrait- Some classes are almost indispensable for a successful campaign (ex. Cleric)- No skill overview or mapping: This means you can not plan out your builds if it is your first play through unless you look it up in the internet or you're already familiar with the skill system.- Portrait selections as well as some cinematic art works could use a bit more work- The game's story (not gameplay) is linear because there are little choices to be made during important dialogue with the story NPCs- Plot twist was a bit predictable- Difficult early game- Score system that is best ignored if you want a fun rather than competitive experience- Game gets a bit boring at the end but that depends on you as the playerCONCLUSION:Lords of Xulima is a surprisingly GOOD GAME and I have no trouble giving it my full recommendation especially with Classic RPG fans.I can easily RECOMMEND this game even at full price especially since it is only $19.99 or your regional equivalent.  The game can net you at least 60 hours of game time and has a lot of content to enjoy and therefore, making a simple $19.99 purchase worth more than some of the Triple A titles that were recently released.--------------------------------------------------------- Like our Reviews?

Early Access Review
								In Lords of Xulima you control a hero called Gaulen the Explorer and his five friends (these five can be completely created by yourself, with 9 classes at your disposal). Guided by a dream sent by the gods of this world, he sails to a forgotten continent. During exploration, the game is very similar to classics like Baldur´s Gate, but once combat begins, it will look like a mixture of Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy 10 and the newer Etrian Odyssey series.Major Features:- A charming atmosphere, travel through a mystical world and explore secret graves, forsaken temples and more.- Challenging and strategic combat. Very original due to the elaborate debuff system.- Character skills and equipment management are rich and rewarding.- Extremely polished for a beta: bugs are rare, less than in many recently relesed games.Possible weakpoints (depending on your taste):- Story plays only a secondary role. Exploration, combat and character management take the main spotlight.- Hard to get going. You have to manage the party, food reserves and find your way in a huge non-linear world. (If you have troubles, try the easiest difficulty. There you can learn the basic game mechanics without getting your head chopped off for every mistake.)Minor addittion: You CAN run in this game, the trailer shows only the walking speed.			"

												This has been a tough game to decide on whether to give it a positive or a negative, but after some thought I have to go with negative.I was a huge fan of the Might and Magics growing up (World of Xeen was one of my favorite games) and saw this was recommend as a similar type of game. While it might be similar, it simply isn't as good.The biggest flaw of this game is the ridiculously spikey difficulty. I am playing on the recommended difficulty (classic) and find playing it an act of willpower.  First, the early pacing is horrific.  Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised to see how many people quit this game by level 5.  The combat is simple in terms of mechanics, but dirt cheap in terms of enemies.You are the chosen of the gods, well get use to being horribly murdered by bees and spiders.  Sure there are other enemies, but the poisons in the game are obscenely strong and will wipe your party.  I have found countless encounters where the game tells me it's a ""balanced fight"" that are totally unwinnable.  Why not go somewhere else? Well sometimes you simply can't, especially early on. That area is the one you have to suffer through so get use to constantly loading and hoping you get some rolls in your favor.  By the way, the poison isn't even really curable until you get a priest to 15 which is WAY too late in the game.The difficutly is further inflated by the way random encounters work. Basically, any time you can get jumped and have a chance to flee or fight, but sometimes it just means load. This is because your chance to flee is based on your party speed, which if it is lower, will be a small chance of fleeing. Meanwhile, this same stat determines how easily you can hit things, so the same stat that determines if you can run away determines if you would hit the mobs (except casters).  That doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. It really means you will die and load.  While this is happening, you have to wait for your party memeber to get a turn before you can load.  Well guess what, some of the mobs are so cheap they will chain sleep, mind control, stun, etc affects to the point where you never actually get a turn before you die.  I have found it faster to alt f4 if i fail the flee role than to wait for my first turn.This random difficulty seems to calm down some after about level 10, but you will still find poison mobs to be the most frustrating in the game.  In general, the monsters stack way too many of their conditions on a single apply and often to multiple party memebers.  You often feel as you need to win the fight as fast as possible, because you have no way of winning a long fight and some of the effects do not persist outside of combat.There are some effects that last outside of combat and are only curable by the town healer for a ridiculous price until MUCH later in the game, or unless you buy a more expensive potion. I am currently 45 hours into the game and still cannot cure curse, which is unavoidable after certain events. Typically, after you get this cured, the next mob will reapply it and just suck away more of your money.Aside from the combat, that game loves to throw ridiculous puzzles at you and disable saving just to make you restart them from the beginning.  Failed to weave inbetween those mobs 10 levels higher than you? Watch your whole party die in combat and reload and do better next time.  That's not the way you should go based on random art in the background? Have fun back at the beginning.  After a while, you'll just get sick of it and probably google the answer because you don't like having your time blatently wasted.The game does have interesting pick lock and disarm trap mechanics that are difficult, but pretty fair.  However, the detection system is pretty wonky.  You have to level up detection to see the traps, but even with it the appropriate level, you will not always see the closest trap in a timely manner.  Get use to quick saving every few steps in a dungeon because if you set off a trap, you will either die or be on the brink of death.  Since trap detection is only on movement, you will find yourself saving before a trap and just walking back and forth in front of it until your detector randomly decides to see it.Overall, I've had a lot of fun with this game but much more frustration and aggravation, which is why I chose to give it a negative review.  The game itself isn't bad but feels like it screws you over just a little too much. I haven't encountered any bugs in the game or had any crashing.  If you decide to pick it up here is some  advice for you:1. Wiki your party. Some classes are totally useless and will only take a spot.2. Get use to saving and loading a lot. 3. Mark food on the map. This will help save early game costs.4. Prices at the first town for food, sleep, and healing seem to be cheaper.5. The towns sell a one time use portal device for immediate return.6. The bosses are pretty unfair and may require you to leave the dungeon and do something else for a few more levels.7. You can determine the difficulty of a fight by right clicking on a monster. The game never told me this and it is pretty useful but don't take it as gospel. 8. The game doesn't tell you where to go next so if all the new places seem too difficult, see if there is a spot in the old zone you missed.9. The game puts a lot of instant fail criterias in place so when you are warned about certain things, you HAVE to head the warnings.  You will not be able to just power your way through. "

												I am mainly a strategy gamer coming from a background of playing Civ “X”, Gal Civ “X”, EUIV, M&B Warband, Matrix/AGEOD games, X-Com, etc.. I was in between games & looking for something different to play when I ran across this game in a thread about good RPG-Tactical Games. I am glad I gave Xulima a try. It has a nostalgic feel to it and that old fashioned D&D appeal (I date back to the white box/3 booklet early D&D Pen and Paper Days) that some of us old timers still remember. This feel though, is coupled with some very nice (albeit very basic) game mechanics that just simply work for the type game it was designed to be. At first glance, I thought that the combat mechanics were a little “hokey” but they work and they work elegantly. I look forward to the battles and they make you think and plan each combat turn. In addition to the combat and questing, there are some nice surprises in your exploration & adventuring. For us old schoolers that enjoy some logistics, there are some simple but elegant food & rest requirements that work without being tedious. To me, the best part of the game is the old school leveling up and making hard choices in your skill & attribute allocations as you advance. If you are a “instant gratification / pew-pew” gamer that needs high end graphics and action, stay away. But if you can use your imagination a bit and want a nicely done, old school adventure game, Xulima is your ticket. I hope they follow with a sequel…The game is quite addicting....buy the Golot Treasure DLC...its worth it....ProsOld School Nostalgic FeelNicely Done Game and Combat MechanicsImmersionElegant Logistics, basic but not tediousNicely done advancement systemChallenging (recommend the medium or hard settings, don’t play on “normal”)Overall game package just works – good feel, fit and finishHours and Hours of RPG Adventure FunConsSimple but elegant graphics – no huge explosions or 3D action hereIs grindy at timesSome might miss the “follow the green arrow” tips of other games ie., this is a thinking persons game…Combat system may be too quirky for some (again, no “pew-pew” here)Some may miss the “Monty Hall” feel of other titles…you work for your loot here…Some of the game can bog down w/ tedious puzzle like problems to solveYou sometimes get stuck w/out any clear route to proceed, which can be tedious to figure out what to do next "

												Tips for Hardcore and General ReviewPositive's: Old school, challenging enough, quite long, good story, have many features , have secrets, and much more;Negatives: Traps :) , limited valuable classes, weapon quality over levels ; no set items etc.. terrible loots; Gaulen's being classses! , stock prices increases with your level (how nonsense is this)Overall 9,5 / 10 ; buy it :)Tips for hardcore: (no mods installed)I directly started in hardcore; finished game at level 66, did all maps clear (no single moster left, killed princes after killed armies, killed guardians first,even the powerful demon that gives horn which was in my idea the hardest fight to survive etc.) ,have all achives, ranked 99/100 in the end with score 33,183  My party was - (front) Gaulen -Barbarian- Thief (back) Divine summoner , Mage, Priest;Though you can prove otherwise, here is my experience ; ""you cant finish the game without a thief and a priest""; both you must have; and ""you will have many difficulties if you dont master shurikens""; Now, general rules;-Dont buy food; there is enough food in Nabros; and strating area-Get treasures from imps (i killed all imps but not worth it believe me)-Dont harvest plants until level 30; -When you feel you are struck, and all armies left quite powerful, know that there is a fight with some small sacrifices to be done and you will in the end find an area that is simple to you , - In lower levels always get Constitioun blessing and then go explore ( it makes a huge difference)- when you have enough money, buy like 30 torches/lockpicks/cyrstals and always shurikens in early stages, later these will be quite expensive;- Dont rely on loots and stock sellings, - Wounds and bleeding is quite important, so i suggest two classes that one goes for sword (barb. for exp.) and one for axes (Gaulen in my case), and thief with sword;- After level 10 or so, equip shields for back row and no weapons; cause waepon damage is quite low for magic classes, and weapons dont gives stats but shields do :)-Check the world map and try to locate teleporters; and go in that way first :)- Be patient (i m a working man did 1 months to finish the game),- Save often Feel free to ask any questions			"

Early Access Review
								UPDATE: You can toggle running on/off !  I've been surprised about how often I'm seeing comments about ""movement is too slow / can I run?"" I admit, it's the first thing I turned on... and the first thing I turned off as I had to work my way through a particular area or two. :D I really liked that there was a reason to walk as well as run.######I don’t normally write reviews, but having been a kickstarter backer of this game & followed it’s development, played a number of builds, sunk a heck of a lot of time into it and the conclusion I’ve drawn is…. this game is just so much fun! Honestly!! It’s been ages since I’ve enjoyed a game so much.  But seeing as how the other early reviewers have already made some great comments I'm going to keep this short and sweet.  Put simply - this game is just absolutely awesome!! So far I've been in the beta (prior to steam early access) and have had to force myself to stop playing on numerous occasions.  I just didn't want to ruin the full experience - it is just so much fun and so very addicting - even at this early access stage.  I've lost countless hours to it… and never regretted it for a moment.  If you're a fan of classic RPGs, turn based combat, building and managing a party, gorgeous artwork, engaging story & a decent challenge (without it ever feeling like the AI is cheating) then don't wait another moment! The quality of finish is excellent, the game is more than playable and (with this latest release) we’re actually mostly just waiting on a few more tweaks & balances rather than major content.  At least, that's my understanding of things as they stand.  Fear not though, if I'm somehow mistaken, you should be able to experience a good 50 hours or so (of the stated 100 hours) of solid gameplay right now. :-)  Music, artwork, combat, story, etc for that first 50 hours of gameplay is already there... and freakin' awesome.  NOTE: There are multiple difficulty levels so don't be put off it seems a bit too daunting (eg. lower levels mean less requirement to manage party’s food rations, encounters may be composed of less challenging beasts, etc). All levels present a challenge, but seriously if you can pull off a #spoiler (cursed hounds) #end spoiler encounter or two at the higher difficulty setting, you'll actually congratulate yourself!  In fact, you’ll probably start bragging. ;-) PS: ha short and sweet.  I just love the game too much to not keep writing about it. :D  Also it wouldn’t be fair of me if I didn’t mention the excellent manner for which the developers have kept in touch with the community and given careful consideration to the provided feedback.  This game is made by people who care & it shows!			"

Early Access Review
								Lords of Xulima is a very interesting game. You would never guess from looking at the screenshots, but it's a very original and well-thought game, that takes lessons from old-school RPGs and adds some unique flavour.For once, it has a very challenging combat and a nice mix of a Wizardry-like first person combat with isometric exploration, featuring traps, mazes and hidden passages. It also has one of the best resource management system I ever saw in a RPG. Clearly the developers played hundreds of RPGs, and tried to fix issues that old games had. For example, Xulima has random encounters, but only on certain areas. And they are actually limited fights, that scale up in difficulty as you beat them. Defeat all enemies in one area, and it becomes a safe zone, and you even get some bonus XP. And the game is full of other ""twists"" like this.So in short, if you like old-school RPGs try this game. It isn't revolutionary, but it's very well designed and clearly made with passion. If you want more details, I wrote a longer preview at the RPG Codex: http://www.rpgcodex.net/content.php?id=9560 "

								After over 120 hours of play, I'm ready to give my review.  If you played M&M; If you played Xene; if played Wizardry, and you've spent all your gaming years since then looking for a game, any game, to scratch that itch of a classic, old school'ish RPG, this is that game.Real time movement on the map; turn based combat; dozens of skills, spells, stats and classes.  Up to 100 hours of play (if your a completionist); and just the right combination of old style RPG gaming with lots of modern amenities blended in.  Mix in a Development team that actually listens to it's community, and adds patches/upgrades faster than you can say ""Kill That Ogre"", and you just can't go wrong with this game.  Watch any UTube video on this game if your on the fence.			"

								70 hours in and I find it hard to believe that this is Numantian's first game. I had my doubts at first because doing a first playthrough in veteran mode requires a small ammount of grind at times and it's not always apparent where you are meant to go next. But not knowing is arguably part of the charm of discovery. The best thing about it is that you just KNOW this is going to be one of those rare games you will actually want to play again after completing it just to try different party combinations and to see if you can beat hardcore mode (hardcore mode with ironman is going to be a stretch for even the most dedicated player). Aside from its overall ""goodness"", for want of a better term, its been priced absolutely perfectly to fit in with these ""grab great games cheap in the sales"" times. It's extraordinarily good value for money. 90%			"

												I am going to begin this review by saying it is the first and only game I have ever bought pre-release. I read some interesting thoughts about it on the RPG Codex and snapped it up.What does Old School RPG mean? If you think it means I played RPG back in the day and therefore fully capable of playing this one on Difficult - you won't get very far. Back in the day a bunch of us played RPG like Bards Tale 1, Wasteland 1, Ultima IV etc. They were not easy games. Try playing them now.So my first tip is to play this game on normal difficulty and save yourself some angst - unless - unless you can remember all the mantras from Ultima IV and know the optimum party build for each Wizardry and Might and Magic.The game - it's a blobber. Party based turn based combat. It is better than M&M X Legacy.It's a beautiful little gem developed by this small group of people that obviously love RPG games. It comes through in the design and gameplay.I was exploring and came across this structure and went inside. I found a talking skull that asked me its name. How would anyone know that. I was stuck. There are a few teleports around so I explore - going from place to place and mapping as I go. Still stuck. Frustration time right? I look at the overhead map and my poor old brain tells me the different sections sort of look like letters. If you look down from above like a map does. I have letters - but what is the order? Each section has candles - leading from 1-6. I solve the puzzle and progress.I found the puzzle unique and amazing.The game is not linear. But that does not mean you can go where you want. The trick is navigating a pathway through the dangers and my path was different from others. For example, I did not tip toe around the sleep causing mushrooms heavily cursed by all the frustrated players giving negative views. When I finally came across them I ate them for breakfast.Some players get stuck because they do not pay attention to the text. Unlike M&M X, you need to pay attention. Pathways previously blocked open up as you progress. You need to backtrack. The game is not linear.You need to use strategy in this game. RPG Strategy? What is this game some sort of RPGS - never heard of that. SRPG?Off course you can run around and eat mushrooms and pick flowers. Your bard can sing 80s pop music. Can you manage assets? What the heck will your mage do when he runs out of magical energy - defend every turn? Maybe take a short tea break? You stock up on health potions but what are you going to do when you know someone in your party is likely to die because four spiders have their turn in combat before they get a chance to gulp down a potion? Damn healing scrolls - stock up.Are you stocked up on torches and lock picks? Buy food and explore and then come back. Push your limits before heading back. Usually about five days is enough because after that the cost gets prohibitive. Don't rest after each fight like some weakling. Man up.The combat is complex. I could write pages about it. Bleeding, Burning, Burping, Stunning, Wounding, Sleeping.Your little thief from only doing 1 damage per turn with his little dagger becomes the best fighter in the game if you train him on Shurikens. Pointy ninja weapons that disappear after you throw them. Apart from the basic damage they do they also do Bleeding damage that stacks over time. STACKS OVER TIME. Remember that. You can only buy three of these at a time before the shopkeeper runs out - come back tomorrow! Keep all of these until you really need them. I had around 100 in stock before I came across some badass that would not go down.Stacking works on your party as well.Stunning. Some weapons don't do bleeding damage or cause wounds. They stun your opponent. I came across this evil looking Emerald Wyvern who basically could not get an attack in. That was amazing. Makes me ponder a STUN + STUN + BLEED front three. I came across this little Imp guarding a treasure chest who would not get out the way unless I answered a little riddle. Get lost you little squirt. He then grew to a gigantic size and nearly polished of my party as none of the bleed or stun effects worked on him. Eventually I figured out he was weak to burning and basically went into defensive mode apart from my Mage throwing fireballs like a maniac.I could tell you lots of amazing stories about the game. The time I went through the desert and came across a kebab vendor. I will just say Buy It and support this little company.Tips for beginners unless you want to learn the hard way.Harvest those little wheat plants in the first town and sell for profit. That little money will help pay for food or blessings.Blessings - get them for Speed increase and Resistance and Evasion - you get the ideaSkills - train up as many skill points as you can afford - you get four per level up but what would you do with 6 or 8 or 12? Yes. Spend that cash mate. Your thief can pick locks better, train weapons, improve immunity and gain experience faster. They can even do some body building in the local gym.Don't waste your Mage's time training his little puny staff fighting skills or trying to buff his muscles, maximise his potential in magic. He don't need the ability to wear Steel Armour as if everything goes correct - he won't never be in the front row.That little twerp Gaulen - try waiting on picking flowers until he can get 3 herbs per pick. Train his hunting and exploring skills. People complain about the food requirement all the time. With hunting your whole party can transverse many maps with animals without losing food - you gain it!Your Bard - he ain't a fighter - he is a pansy artiste. Stun music, music that make you angry, music that inspires you is the way to go.You don't have to rest 8 hours after each battle to heal up - your cleric can do that - just make sure you have mana potions in stockIt's a charming little gem of a game. Don't think you know it all cos you played Baldur's Gate back in the day.Support these guys and let's look forward to Xulima 2			"

												It's a leveling playing field.The reason I like RPGs over all other gaming genre's is the sense of character progression as you get further and further into the game. When this type of game is properly done,  you start of so wimpy, itty bitty little cave rats can take you down but by games end you should have a character stong enough to take down the game's god. Lords of Xulima understands this concept and gives you plenty of options to level up your character.You can level up,  of course with the normal way by accumulating points from winning battle.You can level up stats by solving the games dozens of questsYou can level up stats by gathering  and using herbsYou can level up stats by drinking from wellsYou can level up stats by drinking from fountainsYou can level up stats by items left over from your victims battle dropsYou can level up stats by praying at statues (one way permanent and one way temporary)You can level up stats by solving puzzles.Some of the leveling up of stats is automatic, and some you get to pick. And there is so much to level up. You can level up stats, attributes, mind, body, prayers, spells, songs (yes the Bard characater is the most fully realized yet), weapons, armor, attacks, thieveries,  field knowledge etc. I would quess there are probably over a hundred things that can be leveled up. However some charaacters (spell casters) have more then others (soldiers).Gameplay wise, its your old school turn based combat and it is well done. But that may be the one qualm I have with this game. There is a lot of combat and by late mid game it becomes tiresome. By the last quarter of the game the high stat/hit point monsters are taking a long time to take out. And while the game has a great story and great lore, it does tend to get lost with the continious battling. And speaking of story I was able to tell the story ending early on in this game but the story rail did not allow me to change my destiny.Still, I had a lot of fun with this game. I loved the color palate. It was bright and fanciful like a Might and Magic or early NES game. And the music is spectacular. The composer, Nicholar De Ferrar, is on the same level as Soule (Skyrim) and Rosenkranz (Gothic). And with some limited voice over work, that was also of superiour quality, the music had to carry you over and it delivered. Qualms aside the game deserves an A rating.			"

Early Access Review
								Lords Of Xulima is an isometric party-based RPG mixed with a few casual elements. For those looking for a game similar to the recently released Might & Magic X or last year’s Legend Of Grimrock don’t necessarily need to look further, because the combat is, as mentioned, turn-based and shown in the same way as those games (although not entirely) and even the difficulty can be hard for the unexperienced or unwary. Furthermore, the game plays like a mix of Hero Of The Kingdom (where you also have to collect herbs by casually clicking around) and classic RPGs, with your central hubs and huge amounts of quests to be completed.As far as the gameplay is concerned: you walk around by clicking on the ground, or by using the WASD keys. By default your party moves at a low (read: walking) speed but by pressing and holding the Shift button you can let them run. You engage enemies by moving into their territory and if you’re walking into an area that originally belongs to the enemies random encounters will also appear. Here you can choose to fight, evade/avoid combat or to use a skill to hide. Obviously, the last two choices don’t always work and require on luck and in-game skills.Besides fighting enemies you’ll find treasure chests and other loot. Some of these chests will be locked and can be lockpicked with your thief and or anyone who has this skill and enough lockpicks on hand. A small Minesweeper-like minigame will trigger.You also have to take into account the food supplies.  Collecting edible plants allows you to add a small amount of food to your supplies. This is shown in a circle in the bottom right corner of the screen. Fill it up and you can walk an entire day around without having to worry that you’re going to run out. Food is used for activities like resting and traveling and when it’s empty you won’t be able to use these as efficiently, or they may not even work altogether. So it is advisable that you fill it up for at least a few days because who knows where you might end up and when you might see the next town where you can eventually stock up again.The graphics have a casual look. Some of the portraits could use a little work, but the world itself looks splendid and detailed. The combat seemingly uses 2D animations converted from 3D models (not sure, though) and they look a tiny bit wooden to be honest. Even if they are technically okay. Other than that I have no issues.Navigation can be a bit hard but that’s mainly because you can get stuck or walk into objects that you shouldn’t get stuck into to begin with, like trees or stones. It doesn’t happen very often but it’s definitely noticeable when it does happen and sometimes you have to backtrack a bit in order to get past the obstacle. The user interface isn’t always entirely clear or user friendly and therefore not as intuitive to use as it should be and some tooltips that definitely would’ve come in handy seem to be missing. It would’ve been nice if there was a checkbox for this in the Options menu or something.  I understand they don’t want to hold your hand, but at least explain some of the buttons or mechanics for the less experienced gamers out there, or for those who have no idea what they’re looking at (trust me, once you’ve clicked a weird looking button you exactly know what to look for next time). I don’t think the interface should be part of the difficulty level (as you can see in the comments below you can right-click on most of the important things to get more information, but this doesn't work for everything you see unfortunately).And why can’t I close ‘Level up’ window without having to select my skills and stats first ? Sometimes I just want to compare things before I choose. This should absolutely be optional, and not forced.I’m also missing things like pop-ups when you level up and/or sound alerts. I know that this information is displayed in the upper right corner, but showing these events on-screen, in the center, in full detail gives a sense of progression and fulfillment. This is just a personal preference, of course.The music is subtle and is well done. I think it fits the game well because half of the time I hardly even notice it. And yes, that’s a compliment. It all feels very natural and well integrated. The sounds used for the creatures and in battle are decent so far, and the narrator is doing a good job at telling the story sequences.Finishing the story should take you quite a while. I’ve taken a look at the map and it’s pretty big. The game isn’t finished at the moment of writing this so we can’t experience the entire thing just yet. But I think it could easily take you anywhere between 25-50 hours. It’s hard to exactly pinpoint at this moment, and it also depends on what sort of gamer you are (do you want to complete all of the sidequests and explore every nook and cranny, for example). I’m somewhere between 8-15 hours into the game and I’m still hanging around near the beginning I think. So there’s plenty to do in this game.Please bear in mind that this still is an Early Access title and despite its small flaws I’m 100% certain most of the things I’ve discussed will be (at least partially) addressed.The game already feels quite polished and I had a great time playing it. So if you like lengthy party-based RPGs don’t forget to check this one out. It might not look like much judging from just the screenshots but you’d be surprised to see how much fun this game actually is.[Rating: 75/100]			"

												All right, I'll start with the positive stuff, having just completed the game.-- it's cheap-- it offers many hours of gameplay-- it's polished, has no bugs at all-- has nice ideas that don't exist in other RPGs, the single person representing the party is nice-- the leveling system is interesting and gives freedom-- the ""face to face"" turn based combat is quite interesting and fun-- it's not ""easy"" like a walk in the park if you play it on the level it's meant to be played (old school veteran)-- the class and weapon system is clean and funNow for the bad stuff-- it's incredibly repetitive, (I won't go into details so as not to provide spoilers)-- it's a grind fest-- they say that it's a none linear game and that you can go anywhere you want, that's wrong, you can only go where you ""can"" go according to your level-- the story isn't deep at all-- there are no choices and no consequences to any actions, all the ""talking"" is pre determinedAll in all, you'll be spending most of the time killing monsters and/or walking around, the story is totally predictable after some time I was only playing the game because I wanted to finish it out of principle. Even though it's polished and has some nice touches, the grind and repetitiveness of it all just got to me.My advice, good value for money game but don't expect anything special.			"

												My first review on Steam.This is a game with great turn based depth. It has similar combat mechanics with the Disciples 1&2 series(the good ones), with M&M series, with M&M Legacy, but it seems way better, cleaner and more fun.It also has interesting puzzles, very neat and crisp 2D graphics and exploration mechanics. But make no mistake, this game is all about combat. And combat it does very very well. If you like a challenge and a game where you must think hard before you just push buttons, then Lords of Xulima is the right game for you.The game is recommended for the Veteran level, because at this level the challenges imposed by the enemy parties require you to use everything at your disposal to win. Be it potion, spell scrolls, buffs, debuffs, usable items, there are many fights in which you must use tactics and think ahead more than a few moves to be able to move forward. Also it is one of the first games where threat assesment is spot on. When you right-click an enemy and it says Troublesome, it will be TROUBLESOME.  The rpg mechanics are well-thought, being a progression based game. The higher you level up, the stronger your heroes get, but at the same time the enemies begind to vary in their attacks, properties and sizes. Each class brings something to the table; there are no useless clases in this game. As there are tons of varied enemy combinations, the game encourages you to make a diverse party, not try to cheese it with 6 archers(that does not work, you need dps tanks in front). you will need heals, thief skill,etc. This game is also very long (50 hours in, almost at half) and, to be honest, it can take a seat near Wasteland 2 and Divinity OS as inovation, feeling and attention to detail. Like those games, it combines the game elements in a way that entices the player to keep playing, ignoring sleep and food to just finally defeat that last monster.The only negative part in my opinion is the mediocre story, but as you play the game, the design is so good that you never notice it during gameplay.I really recommend it, as it offers huge and complex content for a low price.

								First I want to say this: This is my FIRST  Steam review I have done and for a good reason. Because the game is this good.I am truly amazed at how the fine little details this game has. I purchased this right after the UI change and have already put in 20 hours. I'm an old school player have played all kind of RPG games from Baulders Gate to Dragon Age Origin to Arcanum to Divinity Sin to now... this. I barely touched 20% of the content and I'm already 20 hours in.The game is remanence of the old school Baulders Gate except that it has an amazing new UI. It's like Might & Magic X Legacy feel to it but less buggy and less hexy. The game world is huge and story is right to the point. It shows a beliveable world. I can't stop thinking of this game even during work I still do a google seartch 'Lords of Xulima' just to see whats new in regards to news, talks, blogs etc. etc. to fullfill my need till im out of work so I can put in another 6-7 hours of gametime till its about 2am. Then I go to sleep then work and repeat the process. This game got me hooked and I can't wait till I finish it and play in Ironman mode.I wish the developers can get more money/exposure because honestly they deserve this. I also hope they continue to baby this game and produce so much content (And I will be happy to pay them the $5-$10 DLC, with my eyes closed)			"

												A little bit Might and Magic, a little bit Wizardry, a little bit HoMM, and a little bit Baldur's Gate. I find myself saying ""just one more level, or ""just one more dungeon"", usually playing far longer than intended. Challenging turn based combat, open world maps, well designed character system, interesting loot. Fun and fresh.			"

Early Access Review
								Lords of Xulima is a good, old-school style RPG. (Very similar to Wizardry). The Art-Style is charming and the music is very good! The best part of Lords of Xulima is the battle system, which is very in-depth. The game is fairly non-linear, usually there is more than just 1 thing to do, outside of story specific things such as temples, often the only thing that is blocking a path to another area is a monster, so if you are able to defeat it you can advance into new areas without doing them in the intended order. The map opens up a lot once you have defeated the second prince in the game. Story: The Story unfortunately doesn't make a good impression to begin with, It is Pokemon style, you are tasked with purifing 8 temples, killing 4 princes, 4 witches etc. There are a few good pieces of dialogue that give you a back-story into Gaulen's (The main Characters) past, and some nice dialogue between the Bosses and Gaulen which I found interesting, there aren't too many NPCs around in the towns to really give much of a history on the setting of map. It is workable though and the other aspects that Lords of Xulima more than make up for it. Gameplay: Lords of Xulima has you create a Party involving Gaulen (The main character which you must take) and 5 other characters of your choice from 9 different classes. There is enough variation in the classes, and in the skills you select as you're leveling the classes up, to warrant 2-3 playthroughs of the game. The battle system is what really sets Lords of Xulima apart. It is very good, very in-depth, if you are a fan of old turn-based RPGs you will love the LoX battle-system. You control Gaulen through-out the world and fight your way through forests, deserts, snow, demon-infested ruins, dungeons, temples and castles to achieve your objectives, there is a nice variety of enemy types (although some are palette swaps, there is plenty of original enemies to keep you interested) and settings. There are a lot of tough puzzles and riddles in LoX which are very good and make you think, again, like classic old-school RPGs. Everything you do in LoX is limited by your supplies, which you will need to use to rest (to heal) and to move around the map, you can regain supplies by picking them from the terrain, using Gaulens hunting skill after killing monsters, and buying them from towns or looting them, there are plenty of secrets hidden in the maps to have you searching for. The game is hard as you might expect for an old-school RPG, seeing an Ironman mode is very refreshing :)Music: Very good, there are plenty of times where you'll find yourself humming away to the music, especially in the snowy town :) . Good variety of battle music, dungeons sound creepy etc. It is very coolArt: I found the art style very cool and classic looking, but modern enough to be charming. Keep in mind that this game is working on a very tight budget, I think they've done a great job with the music and art. The devs are releasing 1-2 updates per day (Even on weekends) and bugs are getting fixed very quickly. Even though it's an Early Access Game I have never had any problems with crashes. The only bugs I have encountered are localization issues, the developer is a spanish developer so there is 1-2 weird translations here and there, but they get fixed quickly if you post them in the forum.If you are a fan of classic RPGs, get this game, it's great value. I've already gotten 50 hours of it. For £12 that's a bargain.   "

Early Access Review
								This is a review of the beta; I was a Kickstarter backer, and have substantially more hours in than Steam will show.I backed LoX on Kickstarter because I liked the idea and direction.  An old-school style RPG, with everything that entails, seemed an investment of interest to me.  Alas, that is not what we get in this version of LoX.  Let me start with the good.THE GOODThe art.  Character portraits are well-done, the world is very detailed, and every single thing I've encountered is easy to recognize.  All too many independent studios are going for a eye-bleedingly ugly 8-bit pixel art, but this game has an art style much more like Eschalon.  It's quite pleasant.The customization.  You can select a pre-made party, if you aren't really into chargen, and it's a good group.  But you can do much better with a little experience, you can make a party that really supports one another and is strong against what the game will throw at you.The sound.  Though quite loud, the quality of the music, speech, and sound effects is solid.The lockpicking and trap disarming minigames.  Seriously.  Numantian hit that sweet spot; easy to grasp, quick enough not to be a bother, requiring player input to keep some interest, and no long animations to waste your time.THE BADBasically everything implied in ""old-school RPG.""  There is no manual (though of course this will be fixed on full release).  There is no in-game explanation of the game mechanics.  The old-school RPGs that we remember, we remember because the rules made sense, were easy to learn and reasonable to master, and did not get in the way of the gameplay.  LoX cannot claim this, alas.  How does the game decide if you resist a sleep effect?  You'll need to go to the forums for that.  How much does a point of armor reduce incoming physical damage?  No explanation in-game, and the implication that it's a flat reduction doesn't hold true.Movement speed is arduously slow.  It feels like you're actually fighting the game to get from one place to another.  With a speed increase, moving about will be much less painful.The game economy scales to your level.  Old-school RPGs did not do this.  In the first town you meet, you will find that each time you level, essential items become more expensive.  Food, resting, even things like lockpicks and torches.  The economy in fact punishes you for levelling up, for completing quests, for exploring beyond the critical path.Enemy spells are not yet well-balanced, especially with respect to status effects and spell cost.  For example, one of the earlier enemies you will face in game is a caster who will deal powerful damage, with a high combat speed, and also provide solid healing to the front-line fighters, and a massive AoE stun that is difficult to resist.  While it is possible that they will eventually run out of spell points (called Power Points in LoX), during a typical-length battle, they will be able to cast a spell every round; not a feat you will be able to replicate even with a dedicated caster character.Randomized item stats.  If you liked that in Diablo (and every other appearance since then) then you wouldn't consider this a negative, but games that leave you at the mercy of the RNG reward luck as much as player skill, and that's not really what old-school RPGs were about.I hope that Numantian will take this opportunity to fix a few of the more painful problems with this game.  I would really like to be able to recommend it, because at its core, there's some real potential.  But as it is, right now, I would strongly suggest to anyone, no matter how much they like the top-down RPG, that they not buy this game.  It's just not worth your time and money.			"

												I believe this is the first time I am writing a review for a game. I was very sceptical when I saw a trailer and gameplay, and thus downloaded a pirate version of a game. But after 10+ hours of non-stop adventure in this fantastic RPG i decided to buy this game and I think I am gonna buy another copy for one of my friends.This game has a great ballanced gameplay and that what makes it so addicting. You are always managing resources - mana, food, hp, gold. You can't just go and kill everything that moves or steal 20 million gold from a stupid merchant. Everything in this game has a price, and you really need to choose wheather you want to earn a little bit more gold for a greater item in the shop, or venture forth into the magic forest (since you need food for adventures)If you like Baldur's gate, Divinity and old school rpgs - this is a must buy. They say there are 100 hours of a content, I don't know if that is a true. But what I have seen after 10 hours on of gameplay it looks like yes. This game is deep and lengthy.Numantian Games, guys, You did awesome job. I just suggest you work on a presentation (trailer, screenshots and marketing ""warp"" . It is poor now - it makes people doubt). Though thank you for you work, I totally gonna play the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game on different difficulty levels.Thank you!			"

												I have played this game 3 times through. In my opinion it is more enjoyable than either Divinity Original Sin or Pillars of Eternity. I want more however and there does not appear to be any coming.Likes – the turn based system works well. Each class has true strengths and weaknesses.  A fairly good storyline. Functional graphics. Variety of terrains and monsters.Improvement Opportunities – would of liked more sub quests with substance. Store owners rarely sell anything worthy. I would like to see decent quests for better weapons or special items. More  deeper and darker dungeons and caves. Some of the electric and fireball trap/puzzles are annoying. "

Early Access Review
								Lovely oldschool game with wonderful graphics, challenging tactical combat and not to much hand holding.  If you grew up with the classics or liked newer games like eschalon, knights of the chalice, or the spiderweb games despite their non-AAA gfx, but the immersive gameplay, then this might be for you.From the first looks it might seem a little like the infinity engine games, but actually it is more some flair of those mixed with half random, half fixed encounters on the map (the randoms can be avoided at some cost) and the battles itself are more like the ones in wiz6/7 games.  Beside the ranges of the fighter's weapons also their position plays into the ranges so you want or have to reposition your fighters while it battle, which gives a nice twist.While in pre-EA there where some bugs, usually ironed out quite fast by the devs. I played a bit before EA and now I am waiting for the Linux version.  Suggestions at that time given to the devs in their forum where implemented within a few hours.  The devs are very dedicated and sure listen to reason. "

												Did a lot of digging into the game systems and now I finally finished the release version.My final conclusion is: LoX is a very combat centric game similar to Might and Magic X – if you like that, you will probably like LoX. If you expect a deep story with choices you will not like LoX.A summary of Pros and Cons:Pros:-Character system is well designed, gives you a lot of choice. Distinctive and relatively well balanced classes.-Combat System which is easy to get into, while offering a good amount of tactical options-Big game world with different areas, explation is fun.Cons:-The Stoy is badly written. You do not have any choices and your main character's conversations tend to be very silly.-Overview of Skills is not existant in the game. You have to use external information, which is cruicial on higher difficulty levels.-The game slightly pushes to into ""grinding"" enemies.-Food mechanic: You can save a lot of money by spending 5 minutes per hour for gathering food. This is not adding anything to the game but a time sink.-In the last third of the game you have a couple of ""hard fights"" which block your path, after which you have to kill a lot of trash which is not challenging you at all.-Difficulty Curve within the game isn't optimal: It's hard in the beginning and gets easier.-The herbalism skill encourages you to leave all plants behind until you maxed out the skill, which causes backtracking.-In Version 1.5 the game still has two bugs which can appear quite often: A sound effect is carried over until game is restarted. And swapping of character positions in combat is broken if you use the summoner class.-The Score System rewards and pushes towards styles of gameplay which are less fun. Best to ignore the score altogether for the best experience.My complete review in Video Form (German):

												5 Stars...2 thumbs up...However you want to say it.  This game is fantastic.  There have been very few truly great RPGs over the years, and lots of almost-but-not-quite ones.  The greats for me - Pool of Radiance(and nearly all of the SSI gold box games), World of Xeen, Baldur's Gate(1 & 2), Plansecape:Torment, and now Lords of Xulima.  The pacing is solid.  I basically have been leveling up just about the time I start to feel like I need to.  Too many games either level you constantly or make you grind it out.The game runs smoothly and the interface is fantastic.  One example:  Whatever way you want to choose the next baddie to attack, it is there for you - Want to kill off the guy on the right that is threatening your cleric with oblivion; just click on him there in the field of battle - Want to focus your firepower on the next monster idue to try to put a stomping on you; just click on his representation in the attack queue.  It is a little thing, but it is right.The mission feels meaningful, even if it is the old ""chosen hero saving the world"" overall storyline.  It doesn't feel like a generic group of pixels clicking attack buttons.  The classes are unique and each has a flavor (my favorite is the divine summoner - mostly because you've never seen a class quite like that before.The biggest compliment I can give this game - it was obviously NOT written for the console jockey.  Don't get me wrong, I think the game would work very well ported to a tablet, or even a console.  I just does not feel like a console game ported to PC as an afterthought, which is what we have been getting way to much of for the last few years.I'm sure people could find things to nitpick, and if I had one improvement to suggest it would be the way the story is expressed feels a little jarring.  Conversations don't feel natural...the more I think about it, I am not sure this is a negative - The game conversations remind me of listening to a DM in the pen and paper days of my youth - They tend to feel like they are coming from the same guy, just in different voices.  lol.

												This is one of those games where I could play through it on normal difficulty and then immediately play through on the hardest difficulty without a break.  It was good.  It has all the elements of an old school RPG with turn based combat set in a battle window, but with modern top down (aka Baldur's Gate style) world exploration.There were a few non-crucial bugs here and there, but not enough to really care or notice the enjoyment you get while exploring and and battling.  The difficulty is steep early game, but that's the driving factor for developing your characters.  The one downside to the game is that because you do need to have care about your party's development, the party will eventually become really powerful late game, making the last challenges trivial.  The difficulty trul lies within the first half of the game.			"

												Very polished game. Combat is like Wizardry, first person turn. Travel is isometric. No pointers on where to go, missions give you a general idea where to go. Long game. Well balanced. IMO more combat/exploration focused vs story/character development. Good team of developers, respond and turn around fixes quickly. There has been a lot of turnbased games the last couple years, most of them good, this is in the higher end of the good one's, really nothing that stands out as a short-cut or not done right. 3 difficulty settings and they are needed, this game can make you fall to your knees, but I did find the addition of the easier difficulty welcome as the original difficulty made you work for it and I haven't tried the hardcore. Quite a few ways to make up your team of 6, solid character building, decent loot variation. Good puzzles.To me it's is in your collection if you like Fantasy Turnbase. They hope to have a trilogy, I hope so to.			"

												This game came out of nowhere and is probably my game of the year for 2014. Deep, complex and interesting old school style RPG. Old school in spririt yet adds unique modern aspects and twists.  Heavy emphasis of exploration and careful turn based strategy during combat.  The game will create  a ""let me just see whats over here"" time vacuum.			"

												This is a very good oldschool RPG game. Reminds me of Might and Magic and Wizardry 7. So here is the breakdown:The Good:- very addictive- character leveling, complex but not overwhelming- challenging with difficult battles- large world, classic fantasy, sets a great mood- good soundtrack- loads of items to buy/findThe Bad:-would love more character classes (nine I think) and more races (only humans)-some of the backgrounds in the fights look a bit too colorful.. childish.In conclusion I can only say this is quite a gem. Very easy to overlook, but if you like RPG go for it, this game deserves some spotlight as it is a great sucessor to the old masterpieces.			"

												Just finished the game on old-school veteran. This is a rare gem.My score: 9/10.The world is vibrant, the mechanics neat. There are a few nice tricks, like limited random encounters (you can clear an area completely if you're persistent, and you get bonus exp for that), additive statuses like Bleeding, Burning or Poisoned (which are a real game changer), Speed is extremely important, as it in effect influences the number of attacks, etc. Exploring new areas was a load of fun, especially with collecting plants and mushrooms. The food mechanics makes you always on edge, planning and logistics is essential. It is just refreshing.Some people don't like the story. I do. It was solid, nicely done, and the climax is well worth it. All things converge plotwise, the world of Xulima feels very detailed and well-thought.The graphics and sounds were the thing that I didn't like all that much. Animations for monsters and creatures are... well, a bit dated, and it can be seen. But the sheer power and fun I had with Xulima made me overlook it. I'd rather play  a fun game with great mechanics than a lame pretty game with boring or stupid ones. If this game ever gets a remake...This is a great, great game. I recommend it to all fans of old-school RPGs. Had great fun exploring and playing with mechanics.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a very well made old school rpg with a mix of almost every oldschool rpg you can think of, so far the early access version feels like complete game with a fairy balanced combat system, there's many classes to choose from and each one has its own unique spells you start to unlock when leveling up to make your party feel really diverse and balanced, there's also a very good soundtrack and asthetic, you wont be dissapointed if you have any feeling for oldschool CRPG'sThe only thing is by design the game is very challenging and you have to actively search for fights that you can handle in order to gain experience and enough gold to sustain yourself, dont feel that its the games fault if you run into a enemy very early in the game that destroys you in 1 turn because thats by design, you can clearly see in the enemy info screen if a fight is too difficult or a fair challenge by right clicking on a group of enemies before engaging, its a oldschool crpg and you are meant to pull out all the stops to win, this isent your skipping in the flower fields type of game you have Skyrim if you want to do that			"

												Flashy graphics, a world where YOU are the hero, open to your every whim. Opulent graphics, action-based combat and you can get even a nude cheat.That is all what this game is NOT about.Lords of Xulima is a game which is old-fashioned. In a very good way. You lead a party. It has turn-based combat. And in this combat positions, skills, side-effects like bleeding, poisoning and so on are really meaningful and at the same time not annoying. The food system is something I was very critical about in the beginning but now I see how it adds to the tension (in this game you have food reserves and deplete them slowly by wandering about and quickly while resting to heal up again). I admire this game especially for the economy. It is tight but not too tight. There are games out there where gold has no meaning: you have always enough and buying potions and such is more of a hassle than a decision. Not so here. Money is scarce, potions are expensive and you need them.The graphics are not Skyrim but they are beautiful. The back story is not a high point but it does its job, that is giving you a goal and mile stones to achieve it. There are secrets and lots of puzzly stuff. You know these old rpgs where you get a hint, then a seemingly unsolvable situation appears but then you remember the hint and you can progress? Xulima has that in spades.You can save whenever you want. You need to save often. Because you can lose fights. Yes, it is one of these games. No mercy for the weak. Ok, there is a kind of mercy: you can always lower the difficulty. But on the normal difficulty setting (""Old Veteran"") the game is challenging - but just in the right way.I always searched for a game which triggers the same feelings like Might Of Magic and Bard's Tale of old. Here it is. With just the right adjustments for modern times, with an automap where you can make your own notes and a comfortable journal. If you are grown up with Bard's Tale, Might of Magic, Wasteland 1 or Dungeonmaster: buy it. Now. If not, buy it anyway. And take some weeks off. You'll need them.10/10			"

Early Access Review
								Asked by a few people my opinion on this game. I'll try keep it short and sweet.Looking for an 'oldschool' rpg to scratch the itch? This is probably the game for you.You play a party of 6 characters choosing either the default setup or custom classes. Decent mix of classic and hybrids are available from Bards through to Arcane Soldiers. Choice of class effects base stats, starting skills and weapons but can be developed into modified variants depending on how you choose to play. 3 difficulty levels are available and while the game has been criticized for being a bit brutal, playing on normal or easy with the default party should be more then managable and enjoyable for most. Combat is Turn Based and feels very similar to Legends of Grimrock or the Might&Magic Series. Position of units on the battlefield plays an important role with two blank spaces available for you to move units around as you see fit. Traveling on the worldmap acts in pseudo realtime consuming up time and rations as you move. Which is what you will be spending your gold on earlygame, stockpiling food before traveling is a must.Depending on party skills as you travel you will find extra rations, detect traps and just discover curiosities in general. Which leads me to my next point, this game has a strong focus on natural exploration along the same lines of the early divinity games and the eschalon series. Far from being linear you are often moving around trying to find the next 'questline' thats achieveable by your current level, which works extremely well. That's not to say you don't have quests handed out from towns either. Content wise I have been told there is around 50-60% unlocked and 100% already ingame which is just getting some refinements.Graphically the game supports 1440p+ setups and I assume being handdrawn art it really is a joy to play. Small nitpick would be the fact you can't seem to enter inside many(any?) buildings early on, but you do go inside dungeons and other locales. Doesn't take away from the game too much. Voice acting is of a bare minimum but the text and colours used is well written with good readbility. The soundtrack is mostly instrumental and not only relaxing but fitting for each environment and I would love the ability to purchase the soundtrack on steam. :)TL:DREnjoyed any of the games I referenced? Should at the very least be keeping LoX on your shortlist.It is fantastic, ready to play now and personally has me completely hooked.			"

												Lords of Xulima (LoX) is an old school CRPG influenced by the classics like Might and Magic, Wizardry and Ultima.While ToX does contain a good amount of story and dialog, its focus is clearly on combat, exploration, and progression, similar to how Might and Magic and Wizardry games are.  And I'm happy to say that it really shines in these areas.Progression-wise, the game lets you build a party of 6, including a premade main character with a unique class.  You can pick from 9 classes when making your other 5 characters, and each class offers unique abilities, strengths and weaknesses.  You can definitely agonize over what the optimum party config is for hours if you are prone to that madness :).As your characters level-up, you gain skill points that you can spend as you choose.  In LoX, weapons, spells and skills like ""lockpick"" are all treated as ""skills.""  The majority of skills have ""levels,"" with different skills having different max levels.  What this means is that you will probably want to focus on maxing out a few skills so that you don't gimp your characters with a bunch of weak skills as opposed to a few strong ones.All in all, the progression system is nice because you have a lot of wiggle room in how you customize your party and each character within your party.  You also unlock new skills as your characters level up, so this makes leveling pretty fun.  You won't find the absolute crap-ton of skills in LoX that games like Wizardry had, but the fact that you can level up skills independently and that each skill feels pretty unique makes up for this.As for combat, LoX has turn-based combat with the turn order displayed on the side of the screen so you can see who's going next and strategize.  I was really pleasantly surprised by the combat.  It is VERY challenging, and you feel like you really need to consider every action, especially early on.   It's really imperative that you think about how your party is going to work together effectively if you want to succeed in combat.  You absolutely need defensive characters in the front row to soak up damage, or you will find your poor fragile mage getting his or her face kicked in repeatedly.The combat interface feels slick and snappy, and the combat graphics are very impressive for a $20 indie game.  I was really impressed with the combat overall, stellar job here.Next, the exploration aspect of the game,  Exploring in LoX seems pretty good so far, the zones all seem to have interesting things to find, like puzzles, riddles and lots of loot to gather.  The exploration also has an element of danger, because you never know when you're going to wander into a trap, or get ambushed by a monster that will absolutely destroy you.  Make sure to save often!  If I have any gripe about exploration, it's that sometimes there are secret doors and the switches can be insanely frustrating to find, requiring you  to combat over wall after wall with your mouse.In conclusion, I would highly recommend this game to any fan old school CRPGs, or new-old-school CRPGs like Divinity:OS.  It's a really quality indie-RPG that seems to be a cut above most indies.  However, if you're looking for a very story-heavy experience, or you don't want a challenging game, you may want to look elsewhere.			"

												I found this game when i was looking for a classic style rpg. And i dare to say its amber. While playing i felt like time went back and stopped. And its a positive thing!The gameplay is classic in a good way, if you like turn-based games with teamplay you will find it here. The temples and other dungeons are challenging the puzzles will force you to your brain. The world is open in a way, if you are strong enough you can go almost anywhere in Xulima. Some of the sidequests are great, some are average but there is enough to make you wanna explore the whole world.I only played it on normal but the fight was challanging i didnt feel frustrated, but an autocombat feature might have been good, since the game rewards you for clearing a whole area, but the 'easy' fights can be too long sometimes.The story was great, and it kept me going till the end. But the climax wasnt the last boss fight, it was the last picture, which is sad since i want the story to go on:D. The lore is complex and i wanted to read it all and i enjoyed it, what is a great achievement in 2014. Videos only showed pictures but with the game it worked well and the atmosphere was nice.Graphic wise its hard to say anything since the core of the game doesn't need good graphic, but what we got was nice even the grass moved while you walked in it.Trap disarming and lockpicking is great, some games it can be frustrated but it was one of the best i have played yet. The food&rest system works well, but can give you a headache till you figure out how to deal with it.My only disappointing part was the loot system. After you disarm two traps and lockpick the chest what you get? Three pile of gold, which is useful but you expect a good sword or a magical amulet.Overall i say this game is 9/10 for me. Even on normal it gives you around 40 hours of playtime to go through once, but you may even wanna go on later.			"

Early Access Review
								Lords of XulimaConcept:An isometric, turn-based, single-player, 2D role-playing game that is heavily influenced by Old School Classics such as Ultima, Baldur’s Gate, Might & Magic and Wizardry Games. It is set on a mythical lost continent called Xulima, where the world makers lived in ancient times. The game features a vast, challenging world where you will lead Gaulen the Explorer and five of his companions on an epic journey filled with the struggles of Gods and Humans. Create your party with up to six characters, choosing between 9 classes and more than 100 unique skills. Graphics: ★★★☆☆Attractive hand-drawn 2D graphics and 3D Pre-rendered models. Overall it looks pleasing. Sound: ★★★☆☆The music is reminiscent of some of the classic older titles and the sound effects and ambient sounds are nicely done.Playability: ★★★½☆Easy controls and interface with an easy to follow Tutorial. Entertainment: ★★★★☆If your familiar with games of the past like the Ultima series or the Might & Magic games, you will love this title as it takes you down memory lane. Those who are new to these type of games will get to experience the games that revolutionized the gaming industry.Replay Value: ★★★½☆I feel the game has a Good replay value since you party consists of 6 members and there are a total of 9 possible Classes to mix and match with 100 different skills to choose.Overall Rating: ★★★½☆MY PERSONAL REVIEW***This is Based off the Beta and Early version of the Game***The Game is a throwback to some of the great classics of the past all mixed into one Game.  It has a Top-down view like the Ultima games and hand drawn backgrounds like the Baldurs Gate series. Combat switches to a turn-based combat system with a first-person view like Wizardry and the Might & Magic series. You start the game with six party members five of which you can create manually or you can simply click quick start to have the game create them for you. You have 9 classes to choose from each with there own skills. The game offers a lockpicking mini-game which I felt kept me entertained. Playing the early released version of the game is quite fun and I definitely recommend it to both those familiar and unfamiliar with these type of games.			"

												Great game if you have a lot of love for oldschool RPG's.It starts of quite challenging in the beginning, like most of these type of games... a bit too unforgiving. Once you gain a few levels it becomes a more fair and doesn't punish you as brutally as it did at the start. The game doesn't hold your hand and I love it. There are times were I had no clue what to do or where to go (sometimes due to my own fault, not properly reading what was in front of my eyes!), so I'd visit a zone 2/3 times eventually giving up and reading the forums (most of the time I figured it out tho).So if you are a person that gets annoyed easily with trying to figure out where to go, or things not being overly clear I would say: don't get this.  I've heard comments on it being repetitive and a grind, I can understand why people feel like that. It's not an overly complex combat system. I didn't mind it as much because I was having a blast with exploring the map, picking flowers and getting distracted with the side quests/activities. There's plenty of stuff to bring in some variation.Only 'downsides' for me was: sometimes the story can be a bit silly and the cheap version of Russel Crowe' as a voice actor. The tone didn't fit for me (otherwise a well done job)... So not real downsides, more personal preference.I fully recommend this if you are into the genre, if you don't have love for the genre (Boo! :p) there might be other games that suit you better for an introduction. Would love to see more games from this developer.Thanks to Lolo for bringing this game to my attention and especially to Luft for giving me the opportunity to play it!			"

												I'll keep this short, and to the point.This is a decent, if not terribly inspired group based cRPG that is mostly bug free. It allows people to play both pregenerated and individually created characters in the party. Solid game, for a fairly cheap price.The biggest negative for me was that compared to many other games of this type, it is VERY linear. There is basically one path to advance through the story and game. This is done through content being tied very closely to party levels, and ability. Sure, there is the illusion of ""sandbox"" or non-linear questing, but in reality, you can go to the various places whenever you want, but the enounters there will wreck your party if they try to do things in the ""wrong"" order.Pros:- Few bugs- Decent UI- Reasonable graphics- Decent if fairly generic gameplay- Reasonable sales priceCons:- Very linear in playability- Some quests not explained well or have misleading instructions- Wide disparity in usefulness of character classes (some are very powerful, others nearly useless)Overall it gets a positive rating, it is a good game for what it is and what it is sells for. But Pillars of Eternity it is not.			"

												Fantastic! If you like/remember old school classic RPGs such as Bards Tale, Might&Magic, or Wizardry, you will love this game. Final Fantasy/JRPG fans will also enjoy this a lot. Great for anyone who likes a party-based, turn-based RPG. Nice customization/creation of 5 party members (+the sixth member is a fixed class, but CAN be customized). Games these days tend to omit (the great fun of) character & party creation, so it was quite refreshing to see it included and handled well here! I'd have preferred not to have been forced to take the class(Explorer), but this is a minor quibble, and doesn't affect the gameplay experience much (that party member is actually pretty useful).

												I wanted to like this, and it scratches a few itches, but overall I think I'm going to abandon it.After 30 some hours (low-20s levels of maybe 50) it's getting really repetitive. Over those 20 some levels there have only been a couple of events that changed the feeling of the game - oh, look, my mage got their first mass-AoE; now most combats are about the mage spamming that spell.Writing is poor at best, I don't enjoy the ""challenge"" of the combat enough to consider playing hardcore, and the game breaks all sorts of guidelines that I look for in RPG design - with a point-based irrevocable class AND skill system there are lots of skill traps and poor party mixes. Now that I suspect 2 of my 6 party members are never going to be up-to-par, I don't enjoy the game or the story nearly enough to start over with a new party. There are things you *can* do early but you get literally 5x the benefit if you wait until the late game (and yes, that 5x boost is probably more significant in the late game than the 1x boost would have been in the early game, except perhaps at the highest difficulty setting).

												Huge dissapointment.The FeelingI've never felt so much restricted in an RPG. Even though this game is supposed to lead you in a new territory, in the wilderness, you are restricted to follow a path in the woods, strictly leading to enemies that con ""impossible"", or ""lethal"" or ""titanesque"", each could as well be replaced by a wall, the message would be the same: don't go there. It feels more like a ""heroes of might and magic"" style of movement on the map, with a huge troll blocking the way until you grind enough and level up enough in a small zone to get rid of him. That's not my idea of an RPG.The mechanismsThe possibilities of your characters are very few, 1 spell for your magician, 1 song for your bard, 1 attack for your warriors. That's it. The enemies are bags of HP and you have no other way to interact with them than just pressing your unique attack key during your turn an add up damage until they die. The same mechanism used in the last 25 years, nothing has changed. HP and mana doesn't regenerated with time, meaning that in order to resore your HP you have either to sleep for 8 hours, or use a spell or use money to purchase potions. Each resource being finite. In fact you could probably calculate how much gold is available on the first map, how much food is avaialble etc. Entering a city means paying with 100 gold, being hit means having to rest or having to cast,  which means food, which means gold. You can barely loot anything, even fighting armed humanoid won't drop you a weapon, in 3 hours I've only looted one rat tooth. All of this leads to a feeling of being restricted. You have to go there, you have to fight this, you have to rest, you have to purchase food etc, with no other option.  DifficultyA rat will kill one of you character in 3 bites, but this is not where the difficulty resides. The real difficulty is to heal you characters with the few gold, potions and spells available. There is no real difficulty here, in the sens that there is no real skill involved, because there is no real choice. If your group takes too much damage in a fight then you reaload a saved game, since healing would cost too much. It's not really difficult, you are not challenged by the game, you rather have to endure a poor choice of game mechanism.Lasting impressionI'm really dissapointed to see that even with free and performant game engines avaialble for everone there is still such a lack of inspiration when it come to game design. ""Dungeon master"" offered more diversity and a more immersive experience and it was 25 years ago. Brass blade, then what? Iron blade? then steel blade and then silver blade? I can see it coming, just like the lesser heal, then medium heal, etc. TL;DR: There is not enough here to keep me entertained "

								This is great old school game. It feels challenging, polished and well designed, and combines some of the best aspects of the isometric Ultima games + Wizardry style battles. It's in better shape as ""beta"" then many games are when they release. Kudos to the devs.			"

												What a wonderful cRPG.  A healthy mix of Wizardy, Baldur's Gate, and Heroes of Might and Magic.  Tough as nails too, in a good way.You get 5 extra party members out of 9 classes so there's healthy amounts of replayability for different party and weapon combinations.			"

												Great game - reminds me of a lot of classic RPGs, but definitely has its own style and feel as well.Not a whole lot of hand-holding, and oftentimes can be frustrating to find out where to go next; but a lot of fun overall.  Haven't noticed a single bug in 20 hours of playing.  Has that addicting ""one more ..."" feeling to it that has kept me playing for longer than I'd anticipated.  Story is a bit weak, but the game is huge and I'd estimate I'm about 20-25% done at 20 hours.Obviously a work of love, and I'm eagerly looking forward to anything the creators do in the future.  +1 vote for sleeper RPG hit of 2014.

												This is a great throw back to the days when computer rpg's where the king. It has very good presentation considering its indie development. Combat is handled superbly and involves a good amount of tactical decisions. It has that ""just one more turn"" holding power that many games released today dont have. If you are a fan of rpg's with real time exploring with intriguing puzzles and intelligent turn based combat then this one fits the bill perfectly.			"

								-muy buena-Lords of Xulima is a marvelous designed Roleplaying Game with a gorgeous Atmospäre. More than once I got goosebumps.The Musik is fantastic and the Artdesign is great. And on the normal Difficulty it is a real challenge. You looking forward to a healing potion, a leather vest or a better sword, because you need it ! And you will feel the difference.Items have a value in Lords of Xulima, there are not MIllions of Items in every Chest and Barrel. And there is NO Bioware Awesome Button ( When you press a button, something awesome has to happen), You must use your mind, you must read, and you have to develop your Party. If you like this kind of Games  (Old School Party Games) you'll have fun with it. Balancing is not perfect, but LOX is in Steam-EA and this RPG is still not finished. The Devs are very friendly and answer very fast of everey Question. If you like RPG from yesterday (i mean this only positiv!) you can buy this fantastic Adventure.			"

												The good :- Lots of hours of gameplay- Many classes to create your own party.- Built like the good old classic RPG.- Complexe Turn base combat.The bad :- You NEED to invest one attribute point in speed each level. They could simply give you 1 point in speed every level and 1 ability point to choose for all the other stats.- RNG is often a pain in this game. While playing a challenging game is great, it shouldn't be based too much on RNG. Get ready to Quicksave/Quickload very often.- If you don't read a guide about this game, you will probably need to restart your 1st game (playing on Veteran or higher). I would give this game 10/10 but there is some annoying things that force me to give it a 9/10.			"

												Right. So, I bought myself Enchanted edition of ice wind dale, Valkyria chronicles and finally got my collection of wild arms for ps and ps 2 full.. then I out of whim bought xulima....And Then I totally forgot I had those games.If you can get past the somewhat difficult start ( unless you play on the carebear casual mode that is).. you will be kinda hooked. This is probably the only game this year  ( besides trails in the sky and valkyria) I will not regret buying. Probably ever.If you want to play rpg and enjoy degree of challenge and some need to use brain or googling to advance.. this is your game, seriously. Its so good I actually bothered to write a review about it and I never do stuff like that as its bothersome. It's just that not seeing this on sales list is annoying me, specially when I see lot of worse games in there.			"

												This game is the most worthy one I bought in Steam.Yes, difficult. Even too difficult for some fast-food player. But IMO it's very the difficulty Classic Rpg should be.It forces player to think and plan carefully for every step, not only those during the battle or char-building, but also when to go where for what. A brainless roaming or fight without plan will certainly cause disaster while a little adjustment of formation or equipment leads to total different end.And in the game, plot and mission fits each other perfectly. You don't get the bold direction as ""Collect 20 pcs of Boar Skin and Return it to Joe"" , instead you only know an orge block the way to somewhere you(or the merchants) need to go through. Rest of the mission should be explored by player self. Yes lacking 'direction' but full of fun from unknown.A lot of riddle and secrets, not so hard without any clue but still needs think and action. A huge world in elegant 2D graphic. You'll not get anything you need to know on the map but some implication of giant horror or tremendous treasure. You need to explore the world by your move, eyes and brain.A system of char-building based on skill and properties with strict rule of classic RPG. A system of many loots and equipment while none of them is useless or IMBA.Thanks for such a great work. IMO it's far better than many so called AAA game with fancy graphic and no fun. Just wanna you guys know I'll certainly buy the next work even I live in China and payment method sucks.NO More to say but play.			"

												I am really very pleased to give a thumbs up to this game. It has been a long, long time till a game could make me lose track of time and give me a jump-scare when I finally look up at the clock. I used to be 13 hours in by then, but I am sure I will do multiple playthroughs of it.I absolutely love the diverse locations and enemies, and even more so the combat. It has a Disciplies 1&2 feel to it and it works beautifully. There are so many things to explore, discover, including hidden objects and doors, wandering through a forest maze to get to a treasure and so on.The only gripe I have with this game is the loot. It is unfair to kill a boss and get something mediocre, or nothing at all. While looting the Prince of Nebros palace was fun, the big bad guy himself gave me nothing (EDIT: I was a newbie enough at that time to check the secret rooms, so here's a thing for you). Not even a chest in the throne room. I have a bad feeling that I will be forced to buy my gear throughout the game if I want to tweak it to my liking.Get the game guys, and try it. Last time it was like 10€ on sale, and for that price, it is a steal.Ok having finished Xulima, let's see what it does well or poorly:1. Good stuff:- Good classes and underdog classes. All rpgs have those. It is fun to complete the game with both.- Quests tie to areas, so it is very easy to track. You dont get lost.- 80% of the Divine Summoner's summons are actually smart. The healer one will protect the most hurt party member.The Offensive ones will attack at random.- SO many difficult areas to navigate through and use your brain on. Like brain? That thing in your head?- Areas vary. So rarely you will see the same enemies.- Classes are diverse, but play in a similar manner, so you wont feel lost.- You can play some very hard class combos for your own masochistic enjoyment purposes.2. Bad stuff.- The loot. You will gain plenty of cash in this game, but loot is a problem. Buy doesn't compensate for those jumpstart moments when you see a great item.- Some classes are outclassed by others. Arcane Soldier is one. GIve him more burn and freeze please!!!- Classes need some reworking, although they an work like this well. To edit further, this is the first game since MIght and Magic 6 and Wizardry 8 to make me do a 20 hour non-stop gaming spree. Holy freaking hell. And I had to work afterwards...			"

								An oldschool turn-based rpg complete with competing gods, nine classes, and skill-by-level advancement.  This game has been better than Grimrock, Might & Magic X - Legacy, and Wizardry 8 *combined*.My one and only complaint has been in that the 'Explorer', the ranger-type class of the main character, isn't available for your other characters to select.

Back in November of 2013, Lords of Xulima closed a successful Kickstarter campaign to the tune of more than three times the $10,000 they initially asked for. The excitement for this game was almost palpable and since then over thirty updates have crafted this game into something that shouldn’t be missed by anyone who loves old school RPG games and more importantly a really good challenge.I decided to take a look at the game in its final stages of Early Access and hopefully give you a good idea of what’s on offer when the game releases very soon. I’ll do my best to answer any questions if there was something I didn’t cover in the video.			"

												I watched Lords of Xulima for a few months before deciding to get in on the early access. In fact it was only 3-4 weeks before the v1.0 release. It was incredible how interested the dev was in user feedback and how quickly they worked in even major additions like the character quick-bar we now have or how they implemented weight info for shop items you intent to buy. All on user feedback and I have to say it again: amazingly fast. Now on to the game itself:The game consists of an overland map where you move your group of 6 chars (5 of which you can design yourself out of 9 classes) and of a turn-based fighting screen which is best compared to Wizardry 8. Chars get turn depending on their speed. This means you can get more turns than other group members or enemies, if say... your thief is very quick on her feet. You have many tactical options in the form of spells, skills, moving chars around and using items.On the map you have to look out for your food consumption and remember to restock in time. This mechanic shouldn't be a big problem in the easy and medium difficulty, if you are not too much into such things. Different terrains have different food consumption rates (think desert, meadow, forest, road, snow). There are also skills which influence this.This game is oriented on old-school RPGs like Wizardry and Ultima. This means that there is little hand-holding and you have to use your brain and pick your fights. The dungeons have hidden doors and other environmental puzzles. Some of which are hard nuts. This may turn off some people who have never played older RPGs. I recommend to give this game a try nevertheless since it is a real gem. If you want to have a little bit more help you can always get the add-on ""The Talisman of Golot"" which has (among others) the option show you the right direction of your quest. The world is full of little secrets and just wandering off and go exploring is great fun.  The art of the game is very pleasing and more than sufficient for the game to work. You can even use custom portraits now. Just like back in the Baldur's Gate days.Depending on how you play you can get 60 to 120h of game time out of one walkthrough. I have over 100h on the clock now and enjoyed every minute of it. For what you get this game is almost criminally cheap and the devs really deserve it. I can't wait to get more tales of the world of Xulima.If you are interested in RPGs and liked the revived old-school gems that came out this year, you owe it to yourself to give this title a chance. I'm pretty sure you won't regret it! And there are always nice people on the steam forum to help you out with tips and clues if you are stuck ;-)All thumbs up from me! "

												I liked the game.  It was well-done in that old-school Phantasie style I grew up enjoying on my Amiga.  But for the curious, I'll go over a few specifics which I think will provide for a better understanding of the game.Storyline -- Well thought-out and engaging enough to keep me attentive.   It wasn't enough to pull me in and make me feel like I had a personal stake in the outcome -- but I didn't feel utterly detached from the tale either.Game-play -- You can tell the game has been play-tested.  I got the impression that tweaks had occurred throughout the game in specific instances where you could sense something was approaching mind-numbingly repetitive or flatly unreasonable.Money -- One of the major flaws in almost every rpg game is that at some point, money becomes completely irrelevant.  This wasn't the case here.  Again, I could tell the programmers intentionally designed it to always be important.   Some of tweaks were insightful (like buying skill points), while others were hamfisted (2600 gold for 6 days of food?!?)Quests -- Most of them were pretty easy, but enjoyable.  There was one MAJOR exception.  The Hall of Heroes Quest was a complete and utter waste of time and resources.  When I finally completed it, I was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  I didn't feel an ounce of accomplishment -- only a strong disbelief that anyone thought that pile of stink would improve the game.  It irritated me enough that almost stopped playing the game entirely.  Yes, I went from ""Can't wait to play every night"" to ""I'm OK if I stop playing this game for a long time.""  As you can tell, I'm still irritated about and I completed the game at this point.  To anyone who buys this game, don't bother trying to figure it out for yourself -- there's nothing clever or original about it.  It's just an unfortunate blemish.Leveling -- The skill system was pretty straight-forward.  Perhaps it's in the documentation, but I rather wish I knew what skills I could've learned at later levels -- it certainly would've caused me to spend my points differently early on.  Which brings us to ...Exploration -- Look, you're going to die.  A lot.  Save after every single battle.  I come from a school of thought where I tend to view this approach as cheating -- but honestly, it's not in this case.  If you wander into an area that you shouldn't be in, you'll die.  If you happen to meet a tough wandering monster, you'll die.  If you're in battle and you get an unfortunate roll, you'll die.  Exploration is basically a Lemming Mine Detector method.  You go there, die, and then you pick a different direction to go when you re-load it.  It's pretty much the only way you learn where not to go.   I've never been sure if this type of programming is intentional or not, but there you have it.Leveling -- At the lower levels, you'll die.  A lot.  <see exploration>.  It's a common problem you see with rpg games -- you just don't have any strategic options at lower levels.  You walk into battle, attack in the only way you can, and hope the rolls go your way.   Becaue if they don't, you'll die in 1 or 2 hits.  Tough stuff, really.  At the higher levels, you have quite a bit more leeway when it comes to strategy and recovering from bad rolls.  Someone, some day will figure out a way to address this issue. Favorite part of the game:  Probably the Herb gathering.  I'd walk into a meadow without any monsters and get excited.  That's pretty cool.Least favorite part of the game:  Hall of Heroes Quest.  Whoever designed it should be shamed.  So much shame ... "

Not enough reward for the grinding you do, no real freedom, everything is fixed and on rails despite claiming to be ""open."" Most of the negative reviews point out these flaws and more.

												If you like hard Games, stay here. If you don't like hard Games, you can go away.Now you're still here? Great :) I've found a game that could be a game for you.Lords of Xulima, one of the best Stories ever told without any kind of boredom after the first 20 hours of play.The extreme Rewarding System after finishing super hard Tasks is what makes you feel BEAST.The Turn based fighting System with lots of status changing spells, weapons and skills or items.You've got Poison, Bleeding, Burning, Freezing, Stunning, Sleeping and loads of other stuffThis makes fighting much different then final Fantasy 10 f.e. where you almost never use Bio cause you're thinking that increasing attack is much more effective then trying to survive a fight after poisoning an enemy.This is different. You're doing mathematics with all the attrition affects, and Turns or CC effects.So what does this game do right? STORY TELLING, the Narrator and Story is beast and doesn't feel rushed or too slow, you can choose if you do a large pile of story first, or if you do all the rewarding side quests. WITCHES!!!! just a hint.The Gods are great, the Universe is great and the Class system is Great. Awesome Game, Awesome Art, Awesome Music, Awesome Story AAAANNNND if you like hard games, THIS is your thing.			"

												This is one of the best RPGs I have ever played. No other recent games hooked me so much like this one. At the current price (no sale price), it delievers much more interesting gameplay than recent triple A titles. I have just finished the game at level 45 and the story and ending were very interesting.You have to manage your party well to succeed and should level up your character strategically. Combining different armors and spells can change the tides of combats. After beating hard bossess with different strategies and spells, you will be very satisfied.The  beginning part of the game could be tough and your party composition matters. In my case, I worked with Gaulen+2 Soldiers+1 Barbarian+Clergy+Mage. For mage, spells with area effect are useful in dealing with minor enemies that you would randomly encounter.The two minor points that I hope to be addressed in Xulima 2 are as follows. 1. the story is a bit linear and you cannot affect the game world by your choices. I hope in Xulima 2, nonliear story line could be installed. How about factions? Moral choices? etc. 2. Felt grindy at some points during the game.Overall, very enjoyable game if you like RPGs in general.			"

												This is a remarkably polished indie RPG.  It does a lot of really unique ideas and generally hits more than it misses.The most noticeable aspect is its open world, with no difficulty scaling.  The game teaches you right away (literally the first encounter) that fighting everything you see immediately can kill you.  Your characters' strength scales quickly though, and you'll frequently go back and crush the things which previously required a lot of Save/Load failures.  It's quite satisfying, but frustrating when you find yourself in an area you're not supposed to be yet.The RPG system is unique and well designed.  It has your usual characters (fighter/rogue/mage/cleric), along with some really unique ones (divine summoner.)  You can use excess money to improve your skills, and min-maxers will really enjoy how the system works.Graphically, the world is really vibrant and varied.  Which is good, because the game is LONG, and you'll be staring at it for a while.The combat can get a bit old by the end.  You definitely are encouraged to specialize, which means you're usually using a lot of the same skills and abilities for the entire game.  The difficulty keeps things tense, but encounters can become tiresome.The mod tools are very intuitive and you can easily tweak things you are annoyed by.  (such as the random encounter rate or the skill distribution on a pre-generated character.)			"

												Lords of Xulima (shoe-la-muh) is a 2D isometric post-modernist turn based fantasy RPG created by Numantian Games. The lands of Xulima are beautifully presented throughout impressive hand drawn backgrounds all covered in blood. I have not felt so satisfied since Ultima VII. The core mechanics and combat are strikingly well implemented. Without respawning enemies of meaty experience, planning ahead is critical. The only way to progress is by becoming an armored armadillo rolling under / over / through every obstacle. This world is huge, but an unobservant party will miss a sprawling jungle behind one violently lonely rose.Beatings received in Xulima scale well between game settings. I have found the most entertaining difficulty to be Hardcore mode with Ironman enabled. Characters in a party receive a fraction of leveling rewards while demonic cursed hounds might as well render themselves as earth moving ironclad tanks pounding out bolts of electric death.Unfortunately, my Hardcore party hit an unstoppable spike in brutality after a solid thirty hours. I accepted their wonderful and savage defeat by transmigrationing them into a world filled with far less grim synergy. Veteran difficulty is the Goldilocks zone of Xulima and remains severely enjoyable. The difference being one is a world infested with flesh eating bears, while the other is merely plagued.			"

								My favorite game. I may not have all the hours in this game many others do but I love it for what it is. I own lots of games but there is no game i love more than this. The ability to build my party and then have a might and magic turn based combat system where my actions are reflected on the turn bar I am in. An over world map where I can explore for food, treasure and secrets.... I am so in. If you remember the original might and magic combat will be similar. If you liked exploring an overworld map for extras you will like it. If you want to spam weak enemies early on and walk through the game you will get murdered.Random but true note. Best Devs in the game, Responisve yet resolute, they know what they want to make and it doesnt hold you hand but if you want to help them make a better game they are willing to listen. Hard to ask more from a Dev.			"

Early Access Review
								I've only played about a little over an hour (I really want to save it for the final release), but so far I'm finding the game very enjoyable!   Nice mix of Might and Magic style 1st person turn-based combat, and Ultima or Balders Gate style 3rd person exploration.   The game is pretty well polished for being early access, so that bodes well for the final release.   Definitely recommended for fans of old-school turn-based RPGs.			"

												LOX is my secret game of the year 2016 - i loved games like might and magic x legacy, oder Might and Magic 8,  and thats whats its like.Yeah, there are some minor things which they could do better (for example Interface and Inventory!), but all in all this game is addicting by its old school rpg playing like i got addicted in M&M X Legacy.So its a ""you like it a lot or you hate it"" game - try it out!You cant do anything wrong with this small price on steam!

												Just wanted to recommend a gem of a game for all you Might and Magic and Wizardry Fans.  I'm finishing up the first section of the game, and am in the first temple after taking out the first prince.  Lots of stuff to do yet too.The beginning is a bit tough but soon you party gets strong and it feels like a real accomplishemnt.  If you have played Wizardry and Might and Magic, you won't have a problem.  If you are totally new to game like this, I would still buy this and just look for some tips and help if you get stuck at the beginning.  If you like the first person, turn based, party combat, than you have to get this game.The only other isses is that it does seem a bit linear to me, but its not absolutely linear.   (Edit:  As I have played this game past the 25 hour mark, it is a little less linear, as there are several areas that I can now check out and survive in.  And when I'm stuck I can ask that blue orb where I should go next, but hings seem more wide open.)I also like to grind, and areas do eventually clear of monsters, but there is a mod so that you can grind even more, but that wouild make the game easier.  I recommend leaving the game as it is, and just clear each area if you want too, which for me is a lot of fun.  Sit back, listen to some music, and grind away building up my guys and fighting really cool enemies.Might and Magic fans, why are you still reading?  Get this game.  Lets get a sequel!			"

												Definitely a 'old' style RPG, where you're given the choice to start a new game, make a party of your own choosing (minus one character, who is the protagonist of the game) and then you're left to figure things out for yourself. It took me a few times of starting a party, playing a bit, and then going back and making a whole new group. There is no right or wrong approach to party creation, although the game will punish you if you decide to, say, make five casters and the protagonist.You're required to think and actually read the dialogue, the game nips grinding in the bud quite well with scaled areas that have a preset number of hidden and visible encounters. Clear an area, and you obtain an EXP bonus. It is quite possible to put yourself in an impossible situation where it appears that a restart is the only answer, however this typically means that you are missing the next area that you are supposed to go to. A bit of intuitive thinking (as a lot of the game are puzzles) and you can get right back on track.Gameplay wise, the artwork is amazing for an indie RPG. There is the ability to both run and walk on the map, and more often than not I find myself walking, if only to look at the visuals. The world, characters, even combat animations are all gorgeous for the caliber of this game, and every area has its own unique look. The feeling of ""I've been here before"" is not present, unlike some other games I've encountered.Combat is all time and turn based. Pretty nifty system in my opinion, and one that's quite fun. You have your straight up damage, but then there are effects that, depending on the weapon type being wielded, can also come into play. Bleeds, which cause damage per combat turn (and every 10 'seconds' of combat time), stuns, wounds (stackable debuffs affecting ability to hit and evade incoming attacks). Then, you have poison, freezing, setting things on fire... the combat system is a well tuned machine in my opinion.Characters are a bit tricky, I'll admit that I had to go and read one of the guides to get a better understanding... after all, you have 9 classes, and can only create 5 members. You are slightly railroaded here, in that if you don't have a healer of some type, you WILL encounter untold difficulties to the point that you will most likely end up dumping that save file. Core stats and skills run the game, you have 5 primary attributes which in turn affect various stats. The Skill System is also pretty filled out, making you carefully weigh and decide what you want your character to specialize at... The points are limited, and there's always going to be something else you want to put them in that you can't.The only potentially annoying aspect that I've found thus far is that there is a food system in place, which decays based on the land you are traversing at the time. It caps out at 8 'game days' so that there is no extreme stockpiling, but even then, it hasn't been too large of a pain.Definitely recommend this game for anyone looking for an RPG more in the vein of the classics. Simple yet complex, makes you stop and think, and is rather rewarding in my opinion. Would probably put it around an 8.5 or 9.0 out of 10 myself. Already nearly 40 hours in, on my 5th party, this one I'm keeping, and I'm already thinking about my next playthrough, even though I've barely scratched the surface on this one.			"

												Fantastic Game. If you are a fan of Might and Magic, old school D&D games, Kings Bounty, Legend of Grimrock or similar titles, this one is for you. It's traditional dungeon crawling and world exploration, but with updated mechanics and graphics.  Huge world to explore, difficult fights, puzzles, tons of loot, skill trees, items and weapons, etc. I got it on sale, but honestly, if I had paid 3x the cost, I wouldn't have been upset. You can easily get 100+ hours of entertainment out of the game, and you'll probably want to do a 2nd playthrough to try other classes. Probably the most fun I've had with an RPG in years. It's polished, almost no bugs or typos, it doesn't crash, and is just a terrific game.			"

								This game is very good. Old school good, i say. This game is very hard, i never played anything harder in rpg section. It's so hard , thats every won battle is very rewarding, every pack of gold is put to use, every free mushroom that you find is like a little treasure to you. I'm playing on hardest difficulty, and gameplay is like running across the map, trying to find and kill someone weaker then you. Its like a huge, really huge puzzle box, in order to succed you need to find right algorythm of decision. I recommend this game to be played on hardest difficulty and enjoy the power of your mind crushing through the obstacles.			"

Early Access Review
								I ONLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME IN THE SENSE THAT I WILL BE KEEPING AN EYE ON ITS PROGRESS AND I THINK YOU SHOULD TOO!  Heres why.Bought this on a whim, and it is extremely well put together, but the problems it has makes it a miserable experience to play in its current state.  The balance is very poorly done.  I only played it for a couple hours, but the entire time was just me running around trying to find an enemy I can actually defeat, and trying to save up enough money to actually purchase some equipment.  The problem is, when I finally leveled up, prices for everything also went up....Not to mention the fact that the guards charge you an entry fee the first time you enter town, and will do so over and over after a certain amount of time passes. Also, running in this game isn't actually ""running"" so much as it is just speeding up time making you appear faster...but everything else happens faster too.The combat itself needs an overhaul.  I found that even during fights with some of the weaker enemies, only 1 out of every 3 or so attacks would actually land without a miss...a problem the enemies rarely have, making spells my only guaranteed damage..  Most of my combat experience has been me quicksaving before a fight, and trying over and over again until luck went my way and I landed enough hits to kill them.  I also found that when leveling up, it seemed almost counterproductive to level some spells.  The absurdly small increase to the spells power in a some cases isn't even close to being worth the extra mana cost considering the super low mana pools.Another thing, I found the system for purchasing food supplies which are gradually depeleted as you play/rest (camp)/etc to be bugged...maybe?  It seems like purchased food doesn't stack with the food you're carrying.  Say I currently have 16 hours of food left, and I go to the vendor to buy some and I pay 60 gold to buy 1 days worth of food.  That fills me up to 1 day on the dot.  Basically only giving me 8 hours of food.  Which sucks, because it is more expensive to buy in bulk.  1 day supply of food - 60G  2 days supply - 150G starting out.  Those prices also increase as you progress.All in all, this game has a TON  of potential.  And if they could get all the numbers lined out, It'd be a hell of a game.  Again, all of these issues were experienced in just a couple hours of gameplay, so maybe something changes later on...but combat based entirely on chance kills the experience right out of the gate.  Don't drop your money on this expecting anything but an extremely unbalanced early access title.  Again, my recommendation is to keep your eyes on this one, because it could be something awesome.

Posted: December 30, 2016
												First off, LOVE this game.. I'm hooked! I've only put ~15 hours or so into it so far and my party is only level 5-7. I'm going through with Gaulen, Barbarian, Thief, Cleric, Bard, Divine Summoner. I will update this review later but this is what I've gathered so far. For an indie RPG this thing is a masterpiece.Pros:- This game has CHARACTER. It's not just a run-of-the-mill RPG with the same old monsters. The enemies are really interesting and unique looking. At first I thought the graphics were weird, but they really grew on me.- I LOVE the voices and sound effects. There are little mushrooms that giggle at you.. goblins that giggle at you differently.. talking skulls that cackle at you, guards that say ""I AM YOUR MASTER"".. it's funny, endearing, and I love it. The ambience in spooky areas actually creeps me out. I just wish there weren't wasps cause when one ambushes me, I jump out of my seat lol.- ROMEGOR THE GIANT GREETS YOU, YEYUH.- The story and writing are good so far. Not GREAT, but good enough to actually keep me interested, and not be some generic run of the mill, seen it all before, kind of thing, with super long, unnecessary amounts of writing.- There's lots of interesting/creative little puzzles when you're walking around the map.- It's very nostalgic in that it reminds me of old Might and Magic, Dungeons & Dragons, Baldur's Gate, etc. all wrapped up into one. I feel like it borrows a little bit of each type of RPG, and I definitely dig that.Cons:- Grammar. I'm allergic to bad grammar in video games, articles, and books. There are instances where 'their' is used in place of 'there' and so on. A few of the cutscenes could definitely use a once over by an editor/writer. One cutscene used 'It is', like 12 times in one paragraph. There was also a sentence that said something like ""and then he too, also diappeared"" - you only need too or also, not both. I know this is nitpicky but I get so annoyed by it that I have to repeat the cutscene 3 to 4 times in order to seamlessly follow along.  Also.. ""this is not be the last you will hear from the Cursed Hounds""... is a dialogue box that is seen several times... the grammar isn't enough to outweigh all the amazingness this game does have though.- When I first started I didn't realize a lot of things, such as the fact that you can run, and that was one of the things holding me back from actually getting into it. That's really silly looking back, but I'm glad I stuck with it. - I started leveling my thief with daggers, just assuming he'd dual wield them, and then realized daggers in this game suck. So now I have a few useless points in daggers and need to switch to sword/shuriken. There's no way to get rid of the dagger points.- I wish summoner had other spells besides putting out 2 summons and that's it. - I wish more interesting loot dropped.. right now I just buy my gear at the merchants.- QUICK SAVE EVERY 60 SECONDS. Not really a con, just a necessity in an old school game such as this :P- Sometimes it's really hard to tell which trees can be walked behind and which block your path. This might cause you to get stuck not being able to find the correct path in an area.			"

												Lords of Xulima is pretty fantastic if you're a fan of old school CRPGs. It blends Ultima style isometric world exploration with turn-based Might & Magic style combat and delivers over 100 hours worth of adventuring.Xulima’s designs and art assets are extremely reminiscent of the classic Ultima games with numerous familiar character models and items, to the point where one could question whether it’s more homage or theft. The story also progresses in a manner which is somewhat similar to the Ultimas and some of the NPCs even spout similar catch phrases, so fans of the old Lord British series will feel right at home.Combat is turn-based and fairly similar to old school Might & Magic and Bard's Tale games (or Paper Sorcerer would be a more recent example). Your party is arranged in front and back rows, with melee up front and only spells, missile weapons, and polearms capable of attacking from the back. Turn order is shown on the right side of the screen, with your Initiative stats and some randomization determining the initial attack sequence and Speed stats determining attack frequency. Each weapon type has a bonus effect, either stuns, bleeds, or wounds, and different spells also leverage those effects plus others like burns. Attack success is determined by a die roll exceeding a target value which is set by comparing the attacker's Attack stat to the attackee's Defense and Evasion stats.It's actually a pretty cool system that pays homage to classic CRPGs while adding some modern updates, with a bit of extra depth thanks to effect stacking and turn order manipulation, plus an emphasis on resource management for power points, potions, scrolls, etc.World exploration is also fun, each area has a unique flavor with distinct terrain and other characteristics. Towns tend to be small, often just glorified outposts, but overall the world is fairly interesting and the entire game benefits from being hand crafted to show off the land’s unique features.Xulima tends to be somewhat challenging compared to many recent RPGs, you can easily gimp your characters by building them incorrectly, and it doesn't provide quest arrows and other modern conveniences. It's not for everyone but the world exploration and combat is fun enough to make it worth the effort.A few noteworthy negatives… Xulima isn't truly open world, the available paths are far more restrictive than in the classic Ultima games and the world is split up into separate zones instead of being one continuous map. There’s also no monster respawn, once you clear a zone it stays clear, so that prevents the world from feeling as alive and realistic as the old Ultima games and it eventually limits how much you can level your characters. While the game offers a fun mix of classes there are some issues with class balance which tend to marginalize some of the options, and the combat system can be fairly unforgiving if you don't put points in the ""correct"" stats.The Talisman of Golot DLC provides an item that you can use to periodically give your party a little boost. It collects energy as you kill things and progress through the game, then you can spend that energy to request assistance from the talisman in the form of money, food, bonus stat points, or bonus skill points. Also, if you're not sure what to do next to advance in the game, the talisman will tell you which objective you should be pursuing (and those little hints don't cost any energy). And that's all there is to it. No extra quests or other content, just a talisman that collects energy which you can occasionally exchange for a little boon (plus it's tied to an achievement or two).Xulima isn’t a perfect game but it’s a fun homage to some of the classic CRPGs from the 80s and 90s. If you're looking for something that captures the feeling of the old Ultima games, Xulima will have no problem scratching that particular itch.			"

												The short story here is that when I was a kid in the 80's some of the best games I played were Ultima, Final Fantasy,M&M, and Dragon warrior. This game seems to have a little of each of these games in it and has its own flavor. My only problem with the game is the graphics. They seems a little too cartoonish for a game that has a serious story. On the other hand, maybe this is intentional because the best of the 80's was no different. In terms of the 80's, there is even a giant who talks like Macho Man. What really surprised me is that the first real big boss battle I had was with a Beholder from D&D. I think their doing a great job of Old School appeal. As far as the story, its epic. You get that real sense of mission that a good story delivers. The gameplay is traditional and only challenging if your out leveled. It seems to be a great game and I know some of my friends have already sunk in 100hrs. FYI you might have to out in about 20hrs or more killing mobs for xp. We all hate the grind but thts just how the old school rolls.			"

												While my initial Impression of Lords of Xulima was not positive as there didn't seem to be much Role Playing aspect to it my opinion of it kept improving as I played the game.  While the Game is still Role Playing light and Combat heavy and the Role Playing is mostly during combat with the enemies communicating with you and a few villagers communicating with you the game is very well designed.  There isn't much of plot line and the ending plot line means there really needs to be a Lords of Xulima 2 but one of the best things about the game is character customization.  The characters in this game are highly customizable via the ability to add two Stat points each turn to your normal stats such as Strength, Constitution, etc but you also gain ability points each turn that you can put into various spells, lockpicking skills, detect traps skills, learning skills, etc.  The list is huge of things you can put your ability points into making for a very customizable character.  Not just your typical Thief or Wizards but you can have guys that Identify things, Killing machines with Wounding skills and Blood drawing skills, etc.  There are quite a few puzzles and secret doors in the game to discover, there are vast areas of Frost and Desert to explore that are deadly at lower levels and there are 9 gods to appease :) .  You can gather herbs and raise your herb finding skill which is really useful as you can bump up many Stats with herbs.  The game grew on me a lot and I really felt I wanted to play more by the time I finished it.  I felt one of the very best aspects of the game was how you could super customize your characters.  I defintely recommend this one. "

Early Access Review
								As of v0.13.3:Lords of Xulima is a turn-based RPG with some interesting mechanics and pretty hardcore old-school gameplay.It's quite unusual to see a project like this being developed at year 2014. It's hard, it's old school, it's not exactly the most forgiving game, and it does not holds your hand at all. And frankly, I love it :)And once again, we have a kickstarter to thank for this.Storyline of the game is pretty well write but somewhat typical for a fantasy RPG. Although the fact that game features riddles where you have to enter answer yourself, does motivates you to read and remember all the dialogues thoroughly.The core of the game though is it's overworld and combat - since that's what you're gonna be doing most of the time.Turn-based (or rather time-based) overworld features stationary enemies as well as some random encounters.Combat has a very simple set of rules to follow, but can be extremely hard (especially on higher difficulty). And it's definitely damn enjoyable if you like the idea of turn-based tactical combat in general.More detailed look in the video:

												This is an outstanding RPG in the classical ""monster grinding"" sense.  Battles are engaging, and challenging.  Especially early on, expect to use quick save and quick load a lot.  However, this is a modern take on the genre, as annoyance and time wasters have largly been eliminated.  What time you commit, is usually time committed with purpose.If you like RPGs, and you like them with some challenge, buy it now, its a steal.   "

												 I have been playing computer RPG's since they first came into existence and this game is amazing beyond words. It has definitely landed on my top ten RPG's of all time, along with titles like ES Oblivion, Fallout 3, Divinity Original Sin and Witcher 3 and it will remain there foreverLords Of Xulima is a massive, meticulously crafted RPG that is worthy of a AAA title price, but can be purchased at a price which I felt was an absolute steal. You could buy 3 random AAA titles and fail to get 1/3 of the quality gameplay that Lords Of Xulima has in it. The last RPG that took me this off guard (in a good way), was Divinity Original Sin and this games storyline and well polished nature, remind me of that instant classic. I really needed this after having just slogged my way through that crud bomb ""Balrum""Pro's- Amazing, beautiful, original and flat out epic storyline, that spares the player any of that cutesy JRPG crap- Supremely polished gameplay with seamless inventory management, character management and resource management. It is totally obvious that this game was developed by people who cared and people who get it !!!- Insanely fun turn based combat, think old school FF2 & 3 with a modern makeover.- 100% polisdhed and glitch free gameplay I did not experience one single glitch, bug or even crash throughout the whole game.- The game is super challenging, even on medium setting you may have to start over once or twice before you find a good class combo that will allow you to play the game all the way through.- Well balanced, original enemies that are memorable to say the least.- Amazing class system and an amazing and deep character development tree for each classCon's (I mean it when I say I am grasping at straws here)- The game might be a little too challenging for the casual gamer.- The graphics are wonderful and functional, but they definitely took a back burner to polished combat, inventory and logistics mechanics. In the end this game will make you smile from ear to ear and you will remember reading this review and say to yourself ""wow, he wasn't overstating how amazing this game was"". I would gladly pay 3x what they are asking for the game and I am already amped for LOX 2 which Numantian Games has already said will be developed !!! "

												Wow.  This game was a marathon for me.  That 124 hours played represents exactly one playthrough without a restart.  As far as I know, I left no stone unturned on the Old School Veteran difficulty.  I'd say I definitely got my money's worth.+ This game has a combat system that reminds me of the older Wizardry games, with wounds, bleeding, freezing, etc.  added in, and some interesting tactics could be implemented with the extended battle formation.  Clearly the biggest draw of the game for me was the combat.  Great system.+ A party of six allows diversity in party characters, and doesn't require the player to make the vanilla Fighter, Thief, Cleric, Mage party.   While as stated before I only played through once, I believe, based on the skill lists, that so many party combinations are plausible, with plenty of customization available.+ The world map exploration reminds me a bit of HoMM.  The player can get some measure of how bad an idea it would be to attack creature groups on the map.  There's plenty of resource gathering to be done and many places to visit.  + This is a long and beautiful game.  The soundtracks were good.   The maker took some time on this one, and it really gave me the impression that this was a labor of love.  + No crashes at all.  A crashless Indie game speaks volumes about its makers.= The food system seems to annoy some players.  I actually didn't mind it.  There has to be some consequence to resting, and most RPGs allow monsters to ambush the party while resting.  I personally prefer losing food to the threat of ambush while resting.= The last boss was something of a let-down for me, and not much more difficult than the creature groups in the final area.   I can't fault the game maker for this, because clearly I overlevelled (60-61 at the end).  I researched to determine a possible party and the guide authors seemed to indicate the game to be tough, so I killed just about everything I could.= The story was not bad, but like Wizardry and HoMM, I wouldn't play this game for the story.  The characters created by the player won't interact with the story.-  Random-four-legged-farm-animal-excrement RNG!  I couldn't count on 80-85% to be reliable in four-out-of-five attempts.  Either I'm one unlucky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or something isn't quite right with the RNG.  I lost a lot of battles early thanks solely to the RNG and it's tendency to hate.-  There were times where navigation was a tad annoying.  It was hard to move around at times in wooded areas.  Some trees seemed to inhibit movement more than others, and it was occasionally hard to determine the movement path through the woods.  Minor complaint.-  The Kersket Temple must have been the most annoying dungeon I've dealt with in quite some time.  While I appreciated the diversity of the dungeons, having to locate the tiny switches to continue in this particular dungeon got old fast.-  Random treasure takes away from the experience, in my opinion.  The main crypt in the mausoleums shouldn't cough up worthless Midrinium black ""cultist"" hoods and Organic Resistance light gloves (both of which did show up for me when I was hoping for something amazingly valuable, and the gold the crypt provided along with these wasn't even enough to buy a skill point at the time).  More chests needed to have fixed treasure, or have the game pick from a select list of items based on the location and difficulty of the chest, and/or the party composition.Great RPG.  I'm definitely looking forward to LoX2 should it happen.			"

												So many games these days claim to be ""old school"", but Xulima is one of the few that get it right. Hints from the later Ultima games, Wizardry 8, even early Final Fantasy can be found within the game play. Game is challenging, at times difficult but never impossible if you just give your actions some thought. Some people complain about the ""grinding"" aspect of combat, but to me this is something I'm used to with a lot of classic type games. The story isn't the easiest to follow, so you may refer to the journal quite a bit. I'm  30 hours in and probably about 1/3 of the way through it. Quest completion is very rewarding, with most townfolk giving you their own personal accolades and rewards for doing something big. I wasn't sure what to expect going in to playing this, but I'm glad I did. Graphics wise, I think it's absolutely gorgeous. The soundtrack at times is amongst the best I have ever heard, some of the melodies get stuck in my head throughout the day. I'm looking forward to continuing to unlock the mysteries in this game and the sequel that is to come!			"

												I am loving this game! There are plenty of reviews to describe the gameplay, so I'll mention what I think is key. There are a few roles in your party that I think are crucial. You will need a healer to take care of the many wounds, bleed outs, poisonings, and healing. You will need a thief for the many traps and treasures. I highly recommend a bard for party buffs and crowd control. Maybe most importantly, since turn order is crucial, at every single level up, put a point in Speed for every character every time!The right party and skills can be a make or break deal for your ability to enjoy the game. Most of the bad reviews based on the difficulty are likely from players that tried parties missing key elements. Did I mention pumping up everyone's Speed? Yeah, do that.			"

Early Access Review
								Usually and i believe is the first time i post a review but this game REALLY ROCKS. At first i bought it to help (as i usually do) indie developers and their games reach daylight. Some of them i just play a couple of minutes and never come back for more. But with this game it was different. At first glance it seems like a nice blend of might and magic concept at combat level with eschalon series in movement and awareness. But that is where all the similarities end. The mecanics, the mixed dungeons exploring, the carefull design quests keep you hooked and ""coming back for more"" when you loose combats by few drops of health. I  really recommend this game to everyone as i believe it will be a landmark at Numantian Games and hopefully (for me and many others) the beginning of LOX series. Really nice piece of software, worthing every dollar payed!			"

												My all time favorite game. They got so much right, but there are a few wrongs. At least on linux, it crashes, not a lot... but usually just when it is painful. I am a pathalogical saver at this point, so it doesn't hurt too much, but be forewarned. The mechanics work very well, and allow for a wide diversity of parties. It doesn't hold your hand, and can be quite difficult, forcing you to come up with winning strategies. You gotta farm some, but it doesn't feel like a grind. Just enough to make it satisfying when you level up. The puzzles are well thought out. It's also a very long game. I hear people didn't like the term ""open world"" with this game. It is close enough in my book to not warrant criticism. So other than the few crashes, and a few other minor things not worth mentioning, flawless game!			"

												I normally don't write reviews on steam but I felt I had to for this game.If you like oldschool RPG epic journeys similar to Might and Magic you will love this game.  There is a slight learning curve, the start could be a bit smoother and but overall the game is amazing for RPG fans.I'm now about 20% into the game and enjoying every bit.  Lore is great, graphics are good for indie game.  Some things you may want to know before starting are there is no hand holding in this game, the enemies are finite.  If you can't deal with an area come back when your stronger.  There is a food mechanic to prevent you from resting and healing up unlimited times.  For the down points I'd have to say I dont like how spells inflate in mana cost so rapidly, I suppose this forces you to manage food properly.  Not too fond of the minigames for disarming traps and chests but that's a personal taste.  The skill point system doesn't let you lvl up multiple times to ""catch up"" on old skills.Check out a let's play on youtube and decide if its for you.  Overall the good out weighs the bad by a far margin.			"

												Pros:-6, no wait, *5* person party creation-Graphics-Sound-Skills/Classes/AbilitiesCons:-The explorer guy you're stuck with-Battle loading screens-Mana (PP) doesn't regen-Combat annoyances (front left party member cannot attack an enemy on the front right)This could have been a 9, easily if not for the explorer and the battle loading screens.  Lemme tackle these separately:Why on earth are we allowed to create 5 party members of whatever we want, then this explorer is FORCED upon us, whether we want him or not, whether he works for our group setup or not?  At least make his thief skills more affordable so if we want to go that route, we aren't stuck with a gimped half-fighter.  Let me say that I do understand enough about the game to know that the skills only he has are useful, I just wish he had more flexibility.The battle loading screens are even more annoying than they sound.  Part of this game, apparently, is avoiding enemies higher than your level, coming back for them, or risking a fight with them.  If you do risk a fight and lose, you've got to save your game, wait for the battle to load, try the battle, wait for one of your guys to get a turn (which, if you're losing, could take a while), then load your saved game.  It takes way too long.  Is it supposed to be so punitive for trying a harder fight?Those things aside, I guess it still deserves a 6-6.5ish so I do recommend it.  Hopefully the next one will be better!			"

												This review may sound negative so let me start iwth saying that without a doubtt his game is worth the $20 price tag.  It is a lot of fun with a decent story and interesting combat.  PRO's:-Good variety of enemies that can require changing combat tactics.-Random encounters can be avoided 2 ways if you want to avoid it and you can also ""clear"" any area.  After xx encounters in an area the area becomes clear and you get an xp bonus.-Plenty of exploration and a pretty big world.-Puzzles, secret doors, traps and such - In theory a good variety of spells/weapons/abilitiesCON's:-Some classes just seem completely useless compared to others.-For all the opportunity to explore, solve puzzles, and treasure hunt the loot in this game is extremely dull.  It is so bad that multiple chests in one dungeon with give you an identical trash item.  Depending on who you are it can really take away the motivation to solve a puzzle knowing you will get complete garbage.  The only items I have used are sold from towns.-Every boss fight has been a joke in difficulty and the challenging fights seem to be from random encounters.  Some can argue that if you play at max difficulty, dont use certain classes/weapons/spells its more of a challenge, well I could also play blindfolded to create a challenge.Some petty complaints:-Your main hero is a pre defined character by name/portait/class.  I think they should have let us customize him in some way and the game can still reference him as the explorer as they do now.  This guy just looks like such a goober.-I have had this game for a month and from what I can tell the dev's have been completely silent.  Personally that is potentially a red flag that support has ended.All in all this game is a lot of fun and a good buy.  There are some simple improvements that could be made that would go a long way.  Also if this game ever gets opened up for modding I would say it is worth double the price.			"

												In a nutshell I will try to distill the best and worst aspects of the gameThe good:  Fun, engaging combatInteresting story with very nicely done loregreat skill system with added customizabilityrequirement to actually think on puzzles or some combatshuge worldgreat graphics for the type of gamedoesnt hold your handthe dark hounds add an intense level of danger early onThe BadVery grindy.  I actually like the system of clearing, but perhaps allow us to auto trigger a combat if we are looking for a fight?  I mean, its obvious we can track the enemies, maybe a getting warmer sort of thing?The loot.  This has been mentioned many times before, opening the treasure chest in the third sisters house to find an AMAZINGLY POWERFUL... dagger, and a necklace made of the best possible material is rather... blah.  I have no problem with randomized loot, but thats been pretty much the experience the entire game.  Every three days I run through all the vendors hoping theres a new better weapon which is pretty boring, but needed.Energy.  Magic users utility sharply declines as the game progresses with pp costs increasing as much as 25 points between 1 level and the next it drastically curtails the abilities of the magic users to maintain viability without drinking craptons of potions.  If this is intentional thats fine, but allow us to stock up on potions at the vendors rather than giving us another reason to make the gauntlet to grab our 5 pots per stall.  Otherwise allow energy to grant more pp than it currently does.  Perhaps each point gives 4 after level 10 and 6 after 20?I spelled out the bad parts because the good dont need to be impoved upon.  This is an excellent game, and I believe if these minor annoyances are fixed it will become one of the best in recent memory.  Excellent job to the devs. "

								I dont usually write reviews but this game is awesome.First of all it has a deep party creation and leveling-up system. You get to pick out of 10 classes and you can have more than one of each in your party, making a lot of combos interesting. You never get to level up all the skills available for each class, even at max hero level. That gives space for planning and strategy. Weapons get disablng or damaging effects that change the battle and you get to specialize in them if u want. Overall it is quite satisafactory to build a great party and win battles. Each battle is unique and challedging, although after a while it may get repetitive. Still there is always a battle you cannot win no matter your level or equipement and that keeps you going.The story is original and good. Gameplaywise It plays somewhat like kings bounty mixed with Might & MagicI am surprised that even after so many hours spent playing the game i never get enough.			"

												LoX is my game of the year and is in the running for game of the decade.  There is so much old-school yumminess here.  This is the best update of the MM / wizardry formula in years.  It brings back so many memories of those games.  The design is great with interesting trade-offs in party composition and play style. I also appreciate the challenge offered by the higher difficulties.  I do recommend the new comers read the forums here and check out the guides first unless they are familiar with MM style games.

												Great game like the RPGs of old. It does not take you by the hand, you need to think what to do next and in which order and you have to explore a bit to find the correct path!!! After all you play Gaulen the explorer;). Puzzles are present and always interesting. The story is nice (well written) and the interface/look and feel nice and functional.  Really a must buy if you like fantasy RPG where you have to think and organize your party/game as you wish without falling into the hardcore gamming genre!			"

												On the plus side, there sure is a lot of content contained within this game, and while it can get to be a bit repetitive, it's interesting enough to keep you moving forward. It's also incredibly polished and designed by people who understand the appeal of a good cRPG.The down sides are many.For one, class balance is poor. There are some that are strictly superior to others, and one that is nearly unplayable for all but the most masochistic.The leveling process is boring an uninteresting. There isn't a lot of character customization to be done, and once again, there is a strictly superior way to build each class that just makes having a choice pointless. In fact, I restarted my first game after a few hours because I realized I had built everything entirely wrong, and was in for a rough ride if I chose to continue.And then there's the food. My god, the food. There's a reason other games don't worry about things like food, and it's largely because it disrupts the flow of the game, and doesn't offer any added depth. If you want to add a form of resource management to a game to make the journey more layered, go with a crafting system of some sort. Having to 180 back to the shop every few days is just a giant pain in the♥♥♥♥♥that does nothing but annoy the player.But back to the positives.The lore is fantastic. The aesthetic is unique. The game is relatively glitch-free. The combat is VERY satisfying once you've mastered party dynamics. It does a lot of things right.Overall, the game gets a marginal thumbs up from me, but I'd really like to see the developers go back to the drawing board on a few of the talking points I mentioned for the sequel, if we ever see one. They're not far off from birthing a cult masterpiece into the world, given what they've already achieved. "

												I played the heck out of this game and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I echo all those other reviews in applauding its depth, complexity and attention to detail.  As many others have said, the game is linear, and **extremely** difficult in the early stages; you really have to experiement in the ealy stages, manage your inventory wisely, and choose your battles----but, while the game never becomes ""easy,"" the variety in character types and skills does allow for a huge variety of strategies once your characters reach mid-game levels.I wish there were more games like this---not so much this specifici type of RPG, but the kind of low to mid-priced game that doesn't sacrifice quality one bit.  Hats off to the developers of this great game.			"

												A very good implementation of old-school RPG mechanics baked into a fresh and modern game.Character creation is solid and varied, lots of classes to choose from, and deities to follow.Fun exploration based map movement where a single character represents your party.  When you intersect the aura surrounding static enemies on the map, you enter turn based combat.Gameplay is challengig, and no ""enemeis scale"" crap. You have to skip some fights and return later because they are too challengig.Story is strong and told in a nice way with static cutscenes and voiceover, as well as told in dialogues.The game is huge !, after about 12 hours in I still only have ""liberated"" 1/8 temples.Highly recommended !

												Not only other nostalgic old school game. Lord of xulima is a great game by itself. But only for special tastes, many of the features of this game can be pros and cons simultaneously.--It's Too long.      if you've grown up and have some free time, you will need months to see how the story unfolds.--It´s Really hard.    May well be called THE KING OF RELOADS .. any misstep is punished mercilessly ... C'mon, Even the old games weren't so hard.-The Graphics are ugly and rough, lots of variation in the quality of the animations from correct to completely amateur. But gives enough info to get involved with your group.The makers are veery small study, with great ideas and willingness to polish the game with hundreds of opinions during open beta. So many hours of fun with this low price is just a scamming  the developers.			"

Posted: November 22, 2015
												Wow, just finished my first (and probably last *cough*) playthrough of Lords of Xulima. Took me about 80 hours of my lifetime, spread over like, eeeh, 9 months or so... I had abandoned this game multiple times due to unbearable frustration caused by, well, you will see :DI'm gonna start with some basic stuff about the story: you play ""Gaulen, the Explorer"" and his five ever loyal companions (which can be predefined or custom made). Gaulen is chosen by some god-dude to go on an epic quest to... urgh, jeez, go read some wiki or whatever -.-' Just be assured that the plot could hardly be any more all-out and important and epic and fate determining and... monotonous :\ Did you ever watch any crime series on TV? There's always a murder at the beginning, 40 Minutes later justice is spoken, episode's over, see ya next time. Ah yes, and of course there is some super-important plot swirling around in the background, like the inspector, who's actually a writer, is in love with his female partner or something! Thats pretty much how Lords of Xulima feels: do the same thing over and over, watch some storypieces drop by every now and then. So if you are into unforeseeable plottwists and non-linear stories, don't expect too much here! Don't get me wrong, the game does have a really nice handcrafted lore in which the story takes place, it's just your activities in it which are rather repetitive.Mentioning the lore leads me to tell you about the game world. Xulima is an island, it can be traveled in its entirety and is devided into several regions. Despite its size Xulima shows a lot of diversity, from icy snow lands, over lush meadows to dried sand deserts, everything's there. Each region has its own map and is connected to neighbouring ones. Traveling between regions can be done via those connections or through portals, which of course have to be activated before they can be used. Your party, represented by Gaulen, is moved around the maps by clicking or by use of the arrow keys. Talk to NPCs, explore dungeons, collect treasures and do all the other fancy RPG-stuff, but always watch your food supplies! Food adds a strategic element to traveling the world of Xulima, as it is needed to replenish your party after a though fight, or simply to travel the world without an empty stomach (which otherwise causes debuffs and over-time damage, jeey ^^). Xulima is not all open-worlded though, while you could theoretically go anywhere you want to from the very beginning, the game prevents you from doing so by placing undefeatable enemy squads in your way. Sounds cheap, but this is actually a major part of the challenge posed by the game. Finding your way around and opening new paths is one of the dominant early game activities (and really really sucks at some times, you gonna want to quit, believe me).Now enough about exploration, let's face Combat! Might! Magic! Hit chances! Critical fails! Spell failures! Over-time damage! Action modifiers! Inabillity to act! Curses! Death! Frustation! Fighting is a big part of Lords of Xulima. You will have to fight handplaced enemy parties as well as random encounters. The battle system is actually quite simple: every fighter takes his turn in order of the action que and can then perform a single action, like attacking, casting a spell or using an item. ""Buh, lame!"" , ok wait, wait, theres more to it. This game has the most exaggerated amount of bad status effects and things that could possibly go wrong I have seen in any video game yet. Well, of course there's poison and bleeding and burning doing some nice over-time damage, stun or freeze to prevent combatants from acting, or maybe one of your heroes just goes crazy and clobbers his allies, thats of course only if he's not too heavily wounded to get anything right in the first place! And then there are critical fails, actions that fail so hard, that the character attempting it actually hurts himself. Imagine your mage spent a huge amount of power points (thats what you need to perform skills and spells) to cast his most deluxe spell, that would turn the tides of battle in your favor and then it just... FAILS! ... *fizzle*, power points gone, caster takes damage, battle is lost, hurray! Even your bard tends to fail singing songs so hard that he manages to hurt himself (go find an other job pal)! But at least once the battle is over, all the pain is forgotten, well except for lost health and power points, wounds, critical wounds, sicknesses and curses... take a 24h rest, not like food is rare and expensive, and don't mind those sicknesses and curses, the kind priestesses will glady lift them from you for, like, all of your money -.-I don't want to say a lot more about this game, these were the crucial aspects that come to my mind when I think back on my playthrough. But wait, this review sounded quite negative so far, still I'm recommending Lords of Xulima! Why? Here goes the conclusion:It is an excellent video game! Period! Maybe I'm not the most representive gamer on earth, but thats how I feel about it. If you like games that hold your hand, show you your way around with questmarkers and let you swap difficulty if a boss is too hard, Lords of Xulima is not for you. This game hates you! It hates you and it lets you know! You will have to think about how to set up your party and how to skill them, farm for level-ups to get bosses down, solve puzzels connected to the games lore and endure a lot of frustration. But to manage your way through all those seemingly undeaftable bosses and unsolveable puzzles feels so incredibly rewarding, that you will not want to miss the experience of having played Lords of Xulima!!!1one11!!eleven1!

												I would like to LIKE this game.... but there are just too many goofy mechanics.  1) The XP is flatlined not matter what level you are.  This means you want to do quests as early as possible and then go back and farm small little areas once it's easier because there is no penalty for being over-leveled.  Conversely you never want to stretch a tough fight because there is no reward.  At times the XP is almost the same for monsters +1LVL vs -1LVL even the fight is 5x harder.2) The stores have nothing to sell you.  There are too few villages and too few stores with no items and long refresh times.  It means your armor skill and strength are meaningless the MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR is ITEM DROP LUCK.  I found myself with 30, 000 Gold and nothing to spend it on from level 12 to level 17.   To top that off you can save and re-load to reset every chest!!!  I drives you to use a re-load cheat since the stores rarely have anything useful.3) You can't prebuff going into combat.  I have never this before with classes like a bard that is mostly about buffs.  You have to wait to cast them once the fight is on-way.  Another reason not to stretch any fights and always stick to the lowest path possible to your quests.4) The positioning mechanic in combat is clumsy.  The enemy ALWAYS hides on an edge where you can't reach him because of the way the ""battle lanes"" work.  It means archers stack along the sides while your far away party can't encircle and just ""defend"".  It needs a way to slide the battle left or right.5) Its RNG madness.  Too many things rely on simple binary effects rather than partial effects.  The TO-HIT and the ARMOR/EVADE tables are insanely tight meaning you go from nearly being impossible to hit (herculean) to you can't hit anything if you wander into an area that is 1 or 2 levels above you.6) Finally the camping and out-of-battle ""scale"" is really odd.  You can camp clearly within sight of an enemy and even camp repeatedly in the middle of an enemy castle to rest up.  No random encounters and youre fully healed!  Meanwhile you can get a random encounter footsteps from town because I guess no one saw the monsters lurking there!  In addition some quests have you farming for drops but you need to wander in the desert hoping for a random encounter...Oh well.  It has potential but needs some rework.			"

												What each statistic does is unclear.  What each skill does is unclear.  If you make any mistakes in character development, it is impossible to take back short of reloading however far into the past.  There are stat choices at levelup that are flat-out mistakes / traps, and the same with skills.  The way you purchase extra skills and the scaling cost also leads to mistakes in char dev due to a false sense of skill abundance at first.  I've gotten through the game so far only by reloading every fight until the enemy misses enough that I can win.  The game is difficult, but not in a fun or challenging way.			"

												One of the most awkwardly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ RPG's I have played. When I buy a game advertised as 'turn based RPG' I expect three things: Character development (the 'role play' aspect), story and (tactical) combat/gameplayLords of Xulima fails to deliver on each of these three pillars.CHARACTERRoleplay: There is none- you choose your 'character' from 20ish predefined portraits and a name, and thats about as 'deep' as any development of any of your own characters will go.Advancement: A new defintion of the term liniar character development. No choice, no flavor. Adds absolutely nothing to the genre and the game seems proud of it.STORYThe dialogue is longwinded. Walls and walls of unvoiced text from the moment you boot up a game.The story-arch just dumps you into the deep from the very beginning. There is zero introduction of what appears to be the main character. It leaves you wondering wether you missed half of the story before even starting the game. To be fair, I didn't get past the first chapter- maybe it picks up and intentionally overwhelms you seemingly random, self made fantasy lore.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay is repetitive and frustrating (you miss a good 50-75% of the time, your opponents hit 90% of the time). These odds trump any 'tactical' play and leaves you to either outlevel/gear the units you fight, or simply die and reload.As I normally thouroughly enjoy turn-based RPG's of any kind, this was a disappointing experience. Surprised it got so many up votes.			"

												Difficulty: Old school veteranHours played: 90Having completed the game on old-school veteran, here is my take:I like the fact that you are not given loot frequently, as it A) makes it exciting when you do receive some and B) you don't spend ages sifting through the good/bad loot every 30 minutes. Also, I found gold never lost its value, you never became wealthy to the point that gold became worthless, there was always a nice balance. The visuals are nice, sharp and vibrant but here we move onto some negatives.Some of the monsters look almost Disney like. At times, I found my party of 6 armed heroes taken out by a couple of Ravens. The villages you come across are almost clones of one another which doesn't offer much excitement and there are few people to interact with. At times the voice acting and dialogue is cringeworthy. I guess these points can be subsumed under immersion, in that they reduce the immersion of the game. Other annoyances for me were things like traps going through walls or being unfair. I remember many times walking slowly through a hallway with my perception being high and still not detecting a trap until it was too late. Repetition was also an issue sometimes with fighting similar groups of monsters, or disarming traps, picking locks that were similar throughout the game.Back on the positive however, combat was always good and never ceased to be challenging. It was a good experience when you make it through a battle by the skin of your teeth or get defeated and try to work out what needs to be done differently for next time. The music is good and I thought the levelling system worked well. Overall, it was good enough to keep me playing for over 90 hours and if you are willing to overlook the flaws, there is a really solid game just beneath.Rating: 7/10			"

The movement feels kind of stif, but the backgrounds are quite nice, the combat is brutal but fun, but the actual enemy models seem... Odd.Kind of feels like if you mixed something on the vein of Baldur's Gate, with the combat of  Dragon Quest of Wizardry, with a bit of FFX turn order queue manipulation.I need to play it more, but what little I have played, I hae liked a lot.

												Ok, waited for 2nd playthrough, w/ mostly new classes (I've now played every class) and a higher difficulty level before writing a review.Loved this game, and hope the developers are hard at work on the sequel! This was a Kickstarter homerun for me, and I'm glad I got the physical edition (very nice fold-out map, among other things).This game can be quite challenging, especially in the early parts of the game, if you don't know what you're doing. There's very little handholding, so check out the community guides for some very helpful advice on builds and classes etc.My favorite type of game tends to be turn-based strategy games w/ a fantasy setting. This game has that, a decent story, some interesting classes and synergy between them, tons of things to do, and a lot of gameplay and replayability on top of that.If you want to grind (to get ""area cleared"" bonuses, along w/ normal xp, loot, etc.), you can, but the game doesn't force you to. In fact, the lead PC has specific skills to avoid combat altogether (not sure why you'd want to, but it's a nice option at least).I highly recommend taking very good notes on the various maps; especially if you plan on playing a 2nd time (e.g., locations of secret doors, switches that open them, that kind of stuff).This is a game that shows what you can do w/ a modest budget and a love for what you're doing. The only negative thing I could say about it is that the English translations (mostly spellings) aren't always perfect. Most people won't even notice...One piece of advice (I should have followed in the 1st game). Don't pick any herbs (fruit is ok) until Gaulen has maxed out his Knowledge of Plants skill. It will require backtracking on the various maps, but after they're cleared anyway, that doesn't take too long, and the benefits are definitely worth it.			"

It looks adequate, even pretty at times, but where it really shines is gameplay, design, game mechanics (both borrowed from classics and original).  In my opinion it is head and shoulders above Legend of Grimrocks, Might and Magic X and other similar games that came out recently. Not a single bug or crash encountered in 3 days of playing.

												If you liked the Might and Magic series (especially Might and Magic X that has been released not too long ago) or the Legend of Grimrock series this game is another great take to the classic turned based fighting. The story is great, from start to finish, the character development is really great as well, and the game's lore is complete and satisfying. The puzzles in the game are challenging, just enough so you never get stucked to a point where it pisses you off.The class system is great. You must assemble a team of 6 characters, in which the first one is mandatory the explorer, and the 5 others you get to choose from 9 other classes. Every classes can be built many different ways and a plenty of team configurations are possible.It ran without slowdowns on my laptop and i'm really glad i choosed to get into this game, really worth the 100+ hours. I had issues at first, but the developpers are really easy to contact and get help from.Worth every dime if you like the style. I recommend 100%.			"

												This is definitely a game for the old schooler RPG players in the vein of Bards Tale, Might & Magic 1-5, Wizardry vein.  This one was a tough one to rate because at first I was enjoying myself and then after a while with all the backtracking... it just felt a bit like a grind, especially after I got about 80 hours in and still no end in sight.  Final fight wound up being a tank-n-spank, and slamming potions.  So for whether I thumbs up and thumbs down.  I'll give it a thumbs up if you're the type of player that's into the old school style.Good things- very challenging on Old School veteran- doesn't hold your hand (also can be seen as a bad thing by some)- variety in character classes- some real devious puzzles- you have some measure of freedom in how to exploreNot so good things- a ton of back tracking- doesn't hold your hand- one puzzle wasn't obvious how the clues related to the final solution- very punishing if you get your party composition or skills wrong and no way to fix them- a couple useless classes- memory leak as of this version on the MBP Yosemite where after some play time, the game will hang just after a fight			"

												Alright, this is my first review.  I love strategy games and dont replay games, one walkthrough is enough for me.  After all the reviews I read about this being a difficult game I decided to go with hardcore/ironman playthrough.... and I concur lol  I like a challenge.   Be prepared for many restarts, at the beginning at least, once you reach 10 lvl things get better.   I decided to stick through this game cause i liked the battle mechanics, the character lvling, the graphics/artwork and the story is alright too.  If you enjoy turn based rpgs with a dungeon crawler feel/battles and like a challenge, get this game.			"

If you like 4x games, hard rpg's, or old school games, you'll definitely get sucked into this one as well. The only criticism I can give is that the game is a bit too long (How many people can sink in 100 hours on one rpg?).			"

												Great game if you like old school party building, challeging dungeon like areas, and nontwitch based success i.e. turnbased combat.  The monsters look great and vary both artistically but more importantly in abilities.   Weapons can really change the damage per turn and so does stat building on gear, so upgrades feel like upgrades.  The leveling and class system make for a ton of viable parties and lots to explore, so many hours of content.  You'll be learning the hard way the first time thru, just like you should =P as instructions on how to kick butt may not be included.			"

												I am going to give it a recommended rating even though I think the game has some flaws that may frustrate people.But overall I do not regret the purchase so far it has given my quite a few fun hours. The game does many things right. Combat is pretty fun and a radically different experience can be had when playing with different classes. I love that the game is fairly simple but still offers plenty of challenge. The maps are nicely drawn and engaging. My problems stem from the obscure puzzle like approach to questing - this confuses the heck out of me. Time and again I find myself not knowing what to do next. How do I get into this tower? How do I get to the next zone? How do I get into the castle? How do I cross the woods? Each time I have to tab out of the game and scour the internet for advice. I would love it if this game just kept the hack/slash attitude and toned down the puzzles greatly. I don't need puzzles in my hack and slash and I don't think others do either.  Another problem is that the food mechanics feels very punishing for exploration - makes one regret exploring the map. I think the food should be reserved to restoring health only and not used when just walking around.I am still playing the game even after the above - that means that there is a good game to be had here. My main regret is that the game could be so incredibly better if they only made a little more accessible. I don't recall ever having to tab out from Baldur's Gate for example to finish a quest...

												This is an extremely well-done old-school style RPG.  Lots of exploration and feeling somewhat directionless about what you are supposed to do, but this isn't a bad thing, because the world is big enough and open enough that you can just wander until you get a clue.  However, it is VERY possible to run into a combat encounter that your party can't handle (none of this scaling enemies nonsense) and you will get stomped into the ground rather quickly.  However, I'm enjoying the heck out of this game.			"

Lords of Xulima is challenging, addictive and fun, and a reminder of that golden era. I can definitely recommend it to the fans of the genre and those who just wish to be immersed into a game for a few hours at a time.Positives:-Beautiful art style-Challenging fightsNegatives:-Limited maps-Pre-made main character			"

I will write another update soon but so far the game runs smooth and has all the great hallmarks of a great game in the vane of Might & Magic, Ultima and Wizardy.  Will get further into the game and make an update, that said I am really enjoying Lords of Xulima and it is exactly the kind of game I have been wanting.   I own Might & Magix X: Legacy since beta and I enjoy it but Lords of Xulima has it beat hands down.   I hear there are 100+ hours of gameplay so I look forward to at least 50x the legnth of fun I have already had so far playing this awesome indie game.			"

												This game definitely has a very ""old school"" RPG feel to it.The art work is in a very original style, and the combat system allows for several different party formations and strategies.  The story is good, and has an ability to make you want to keep playing to see what you'll unlock next, and where the narration will take you.  Some have described the game as ""too linear"", but I didn't feel that much.  At the beginning, yes, but it allows you to get a feel for the game play, and get used to managing your party.  Soon players will find that the world begins to open up to them, and the whole set up makes discovering a new area to explore all the more exciting.  Puzzles abound, with many in game clues that are obvious once you discover their secrets, but you will have to read.  Find a random note on some dead adventurer's body?  It's not by chance.One thing to note:  Level 1 is VERY difficult.  If you're not careful with encounters, and keeping your characters fully rested, some of your party members will die.  That said, there are in game mechanics to over come this, and make the early game difficulty a non factor.I've played several RPGs that started out great, and then begin to lose their luster mid game.  Not so with Lords of Xulima.  I find myself wanting to continue on to the next quest, and unlocking the secrets of the next area.I would recommend this game to anyone who likes old school, turn based RPGs and is looking to recreate that feel without going back to ""retro"" graphics and game play.  Lords of Xulima provides that feeling, while keeping a fresh perspective on how a modern RPG should play.One of my favorite games to play, and sure to be a future classic.  Definitely a world worth visiting, and revisiting.			"

												OverviewThis game has absolutely no redeeming qualities - the plot is bland, the character creation leaves a lot to be desired and the gameplay contains only the bad parts of old rpgs.After the TL;DR part, here's me explaining the bad things more in-depth:-Plot""Hey, it's me, god. Some dude beat up all of us, can you beat him up for me?"" That's literally all there is to the plot. Gaulen also has no personality beyond fulfilling this mission. Since the game wipes out your party for trying to not follow the red line, you have no means to influence that, either.-Character CreationEven if there's nine classes in total, I can't help but feel there was no balancing involved. I haven't played all of them yet (not that I want to waste any more time with this than I need to), but I'll give a brief overview of each of chars:Gaulen the ExplorerMain character. He's basically a fighter, but also has a bunch of overworld boons. Not that interesting, but at least the only forced character is not a liability.Azura the PaladinStanding in the middle to heal. The only problem with that is that I need to invest into the healing aura to keep it useful, making its skill cost creep up faster than my maximum PP, so that I can use it less often. At least she has enough armor to keep herself alive (tough luck for her fellows in the front row)Kallindra the Arcane WarriorShe has what I'd like to call the Black Mage problem. As her only skill is one that does damage, in addition to being not as strong as a true fighter, she must spend PP to accomplish what a fighter can do without spending PP. While she isn't weak when just hitting things, her skill is pretty mediocre and quite frequently fails (reminds me of random tripping in SSBB).Boreas the ThiefI believe any group without a thief is weaker than one that has him. He can pick locks and detect traps, which allows you to get loot without massive wounding and also not taking humongous damage in dungeons. Furthermore, he even gets a skill to lower buy prices and raise sell revenue (which is crucial given how scarce money is). The bow sucks at Level 1, but as he skilled it, it gains wounding that cripples strong enemies.Mike the WizardHe has the Black Mage problem I mentioned with Kallindra. The game keeps the oldschool idea of a damaging mage while most modern games make spellcasters focus on crowd control. While I don't oppose this idea, the scaling of PP makes it really hard for him to do his job right.Maia the Divine SummonerThe only class with any form of originality in it. She summons creatures that are the avatars of the gods to help you for a few turns. Her energy growth was decent enough that I could have her help out in tight battles, too. I'd love to have a better explanation for what the summons are for, though (I had a tank beast and a healer chick at my disposal).-EnemiesThis is the number one point where most RPGs fall flat - no matter how unique and interesting a game makes the character creation, enemies seem to solely consist out of HP and Attack values and maybe a status problem or a multi-hit ability. Lords of Xulima is no different. Enemies generally have no more than two actions and have little variety in how they're arranged. Success solely depends on you having higher numbers or, if the numbers are roughly even, that you roll better on hitting than the opponents do. An example how I'd do encounters (an example):Front Row:Worker Bee, Monster Rose, Worker BeeBack Row:Monster Lily-of-the-Valley x2The worker bees have high evasion, but low HP and are weak to lightning. Their main action is gathering pollen (which recovers the HP of the rose or the LotV), which they can throw at your dudes for little damage and stun. Provoking them makes them sting you, which does quite a bit of damage and poison, but instantly kills the worker bee.The monster rose mainly shoots spikes to do low-medium damage to the entire front row. Hitting it in melee makes your attacker take damage in retaliation. At lower health, it uses a single target petal shot that does shadow damage and can wound. It's health is quite high and it's weak to fire and resists light/divine.The LotVs have rather low health and poison melee attackers. They shoot pollen at you that can cause stun, dealing medium-high damage. They swing their blossoms in melee if forced into the front row, dealing less damage and removing the chance to stun. A friendly LotV can force them to go into the back row if there's someone to stand behind. Immune to poison, resists shadow and weak to fire.This is a battle where you can strategize - do you blast the worker bees with lightning so they can't heal? Or do you save  the magic for the melee-punishing rose? Pick apart the LotVs with ranged strikes to keep them from murdering your group? Or do you neuter them by provoking the bees with your tank? Protect your group from poison or rather stun?If I can think of creative enemies without any drafting, the maker sure as hell can.-Other things-Having a tight food clock and constant expenses punish exploration and cripple you for looking into old places, forcing you to use a guide to know where to go at all times.-No custom portraits? Acceptable, but disappointing.-It's amusing that the game lets you access quickload in the middle of a battle. Did the maker expect savescumming the encounters?			"

Product received for free
												Right off the bat, I was having an issue with the resolution not conforming to meet my PC.  I finally got it to full screen, but the game itself still wasn't full screen, but I decided to deal with it.  While in full screen, the game would flicker every few seconds.  In the broken windowed mode you'll see below, it didn't have said issue.  I alt-tabbed out of the game, then back in, and the game's window broke somewhat.  The game was no longer full screen, instead it looked like this - http://image.prntscr.com/image/8c6e19bd136a444facc0347412e95802.png  This also led to another annoying issue: the game stayed on top of every other window.  If I brought up my browser, the game remained up and overshadowed the program.  Maybe this is because I'm not a developer, but I'm not understanding why it's so hard for developers to make their games alt-tab friendly.  Now, if I have to alt tab, I essentially have to close and reopen the game each time.  Moving into the actual gameplay, Lords of Xulima start off with a story, which was well-made and does a good job of introducing us to the game that we'll be playing.  You can move either with point and click, WASD, and/or the arrow keys.  It's nice to see they are allowing us to choose how we want to play in terms of controls.  One thing that I immediately fell in love with was how the dark areas on the map disappeared the further towards them you walked.  I've always loved this mechanic, and am pleasantly surprised to see it being used.  The first time I played this game was at one in the morning, and the music was only helping to make me tired and want to sleep.  The music, along with the ambient sounds, is incredible!  I wouldn't mind leaving the game open for a while during the work day and just listening to the sounds it has to offer.  It is extremely pleasing to the ears.The combat system is amazing, but I was kinda struggling.  It is pretty difficult the farther you get into the game.  The few battles were easy, but it got harder as I moved along.  In the beginning, I was very confused about how the combat system worked with your party.  After a little bit I finally figured it out, and fell in love.  On the topic of combat, each one of the characters in your party has their own strengths and weaknesses to certain enemies.  This was a really nice thing to see them do.  You can't just throw one guy out and he kills the entire enemy team.  You have to actually think about who you're throwing out. The final thing to note, you can't just bypass guards and avoid paying...at least in the start.  The guards will WRECK you pretty bad.  You won't even put a dent in even one of their armor.  You have to train and level up your guys, which is nice.  I, personally, love the grindey parts of these games.Positives: Reminiscent of older/original games. Beautiful music Good fighting system Hard/challenging Workshop support Trading cardsNegatives: Is not alt-tab friendly.  (At least for me) Even when the game's window is in full screen, the game itself is not.For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's, and check out our Curations.

Early Access Review
								*EDITED*After trowing a few hours in the game and understanding it mechanisms i am changing my review.Definitely i was a little frustrated at the beginning of the game due to it mechanisms and difficulty. Not being able to understand the game makes it even harder.What can i say? The game is great and absolutely brilliant, a really throwback at classical RPGs.Its a very rush and unforgiving world but vincible. The unbalance thing of the game is only notice at the start when you have no idea of what to do, its necessary to understand that in this game you got to preserve every resource that you find.I'm liking it mysteries and secret stuffs to be found, and defenitly recomnd the game if you like classical RPGs with oldschool approach and a hard unforgivable world.     _____________________________________________________________________________________Dont get me wrong, i liked the game, its really good.Why negative? its too much unbalanced the initial party could even kill simple rats... the game is designed to be hard, i support that idea, but the balance of the game will be a very challenging feat to achieve, and i really hope they do. The game is very impossible to kill anything, my statment is from the begining of the game of course..... Will wait till some balance come or the game will be dead for me.... ""Punching a rock will not make it break it"", Hard, not impossible.			"

												13 Hours in - game is good ;)This is assuming you like old school rpgs with turnbased combat. If not, well go play some fps game, hehe.Only issue i have encountered is a lack of info on where to go for main storyline missions. A bit vague, and the game does not hold your hand. Be prepared to reload, and wince everytime you rest, seeing your precious food rations go down. Sort of reminds me of Demon Souls style, just not so punishing. (Aka you die a lot, but when you die, you reload from last save, no worse)No bugs or crashes either so far for me - and these days with AAA publishers releasing crappy buggy games, it is nice to see a new developer managing to get a game out with so few bugs (that is atleast for me, and so far in the game)Only 13 hours in but so far so good. A solid 8/10 atm.			"

An interesting, original world to explore, a great deep RPG system and tactical combat that keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you enjoyed M&M, Wizardry, or BG definitely try it out.It is definitely challenging, but in a good Dark Souls-ish way that rewards you for thoughtful party development and tactical approach to difficult battles.If you stay awake wondering ""which weapon should my fighter use"" or ""which spell to learn with my cleric"" - this is definitely the game for you!Overall, can't recommend it enough.

												Great old-school RPG that delivers 100h+ of gameplay, an intriguing story-line, open world, very good isometric graphics, great writing, and extremely challenging battles especially in hardcore mode. Ypu can build your party many ways. However one wrong choice can completely change the dynamics of your party. I would have prefered a more ARPG fighting system like Ultima 7, Dungeon Siege, and or Griam Dawn over the turn based combat in a 3D simulated screen. I would like a better loot system similar to Grim Dawn with prefixs and suffixes. The world could feel more alive similar to Ultima 7 and I would have prefered a better class system similar to Final Fantasy X or Path of Exile to allow all types of different build, and I would have enjoyed a online co-op system similar to Icewind Dale but overall, for their first game, it's a really enjoyable experience. Even with the lack of voice acting. The writing and story will keep you playing. This studio deserves your support.			"

												RPG that is fun to play. Combat is enjoyable turn based party combat. The graphics look nice and are smooth flowing. I would reccomend it for anyone who liked the 8bit and 16bit era of rpgs. There are some light puzzle elements but nothing too crazy. The story is different enough that im interested in how it plays out. Overall im having a lot of fun playing it.			"

												Update after 100+ hours of gameplay:The game gets very tedious and grindy after a while. So much so that I just want the game to finish already. There's too many random encounters late game but unfortunately these are needed for xp so you can level up enough to to beat the harder mobs. Ths is just a repetitive space filler IMO. Also, reading the forums will make it obvious there is balancing issues with the chars. Needing to build a party with a particlar loadout (ie: 3 soldiers) to beat the game is poor balancing. Keep this in mind.Original review:Really good game ! Perfect for anyone wanting a modern turn based RPG old school adventure. A few points:1) It's challenging. You need to think. There are times when things seem impossible - but there is always a way around.2) Not every monster you come across must be fought then & there. Some are too hard and must be revisited later.3) This game requires a lot of 'path finding' - finding alternate ways to reach your destination (walking around traps, tough mobs, thickets of trees etc).4) Ensure your party is well balanced. All attributes are necessary. 5) Prioritise purchasing of mana potions.6) Use the blessings from the town spiritual healer as often as possible - they make a huge difference.7) The talisman of Golot DLC is worth it. The gold giving ability it provides is a massive help.			"

												13 Hours in - game is good ;)This is assuming you like old school rpgs with turnbased combat. If not, well go play some fps game, hehe.Only issue i have encountered is a lack of info on where to go for main storyline missions. A bit vague, and the game does not hold your hand. Be prepared to reload, and wince everytime you rest, seeing your precious food rations go down. Sort of reminds me of Demon Souls style, just not so punishing. (Aka you die a lot, but when you die, you reload from last save, no worse)No bugs or crashes either so far for me - and these days with AAA publishers releasing crappy buggy games, it is nice to see a new developer managing to get a game out with so few bugs (that is atleast for me, and so far in the game)Only 13 hours in but so far so good. A solid 8/10 atm.			"

												This game is an amazing return to the times where content was more important than form. An interesting, original world to explore, a great deep RPG system and tactical combat that keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you enjoyed M&M, Wizardry, or BG definitely try it out.It is definitely challenging, but in a good Dark Souls-ish way that rewards you for thoughtful party development and tactical approach to difficult battles.If you stay awake wondering ""which weapon should my fighter use"" or ""which spell to learn with my cleric"" - this is definitely the game for you!Overall, can't recommend it enough. I hope that its success will let Numantian create for us more games of this quality!			"

												I really enjoy this game.  I'm mid 30s, so it reminds me of a reboot of the old Xeen Might and Magic games, with better classes and skill building.  Some complain it is too hard.  They are wrong.  You do need to think and build a team, but it's not nearly as hard as Baldur's Gate II, which isn't that hard either.    This game will give you hours of old school RPG fun.  Definately has that one more battle, one more level up feel.			"

												Aweome game cannot praise it enough. Old school, puzzles, traps, hidden areas, secrets. You name it all and you will get all in this gem. I really like how the difficulty can screw you over if not careful, manage your party and items in order to proceed to next area and it does require a lot of thought in finding the right skills in order ro fight tougher enemies as you will die a lot in the game. A homage to Old games and cannot wait for the sequel. Saying that I am really enjoying the story as well, grand plot, old fashioned epic fantasy which keeps you interseted in the world and above all very lengthy quest. Recommend to all.			"

												Thank you to all who have brought me this game. Having the most PC fun since the glory days of Might & Magic.Exploration  possible - and without benefit ( ha!) of huuuuge floting arrows pointing out the only available route.Combat with time to think  and sans hoppy -skippy -jumpy -uncontrollable -press -button -madly -what- just- happened rubbish. No crashes or glitches, major or minor, yet apparent.For perfection I would like to be able to carry more! Do love to have a selection of weapons and goodies.But then that comes under tactics I suppose. Not too easy, have to think on occassion but no major high frustration stuck points as yet. As I cannot decide on an ideal party there should hopefully be plenty of replayability. Love it. Recommend +++. Fun/£ very good value.			"

												Lords of Xulima is an old-school RPG that can be quite tough but otherwise plays surprisingly smoothly for such an ambitious indie release. You play an explorer from a war-torn land who is recruited by the Gods to sail to their divine island Xulima (pronounced with the Chinese 'Xu', i.e. 'Shoelima') and defeat the rebellious Yul, Lord of Souls. Along the way, you'll kill witches, seek out divine artifacts, explore trap-laden mausoleums, and, of course, get loot and level up your characters.In terms of enjoyment PER MONEY, LoX is a great offering. I got it for $5 and played 60 hours, none of which I regretted. But in terms of enjoyment PER TIME, it's not so great. By 10-20 hours, you've basically seen all the mechanics the game has to offer and so the remaining 30-40 hours begin to feel like a grind. I don't regret buying the game or playing, but I am left wondering if my gaming time might have been better spent on a richer, denser title.PROS+Great value, esp if gotten on sale.+The graphics are simple, but charming. The enemies' 3d battle animations in battle are nice.+Battles move quickly / smoothly. No long drawn out animations.+Good music. There's a couple themes that really set the mood.+Story ending is great.+Varied environments (Desert, Snow, Jungle, Forest, Islands, etc) keep things fresh+The game maintains a good pace between quests / tasks / exploration.+You can't just kill every enemy you encounter right away. Sometimes you need to go around or come back later. This provides a sense of progression.CONS-90% of this game is fighting battles. If I played 60 hours, then 50 of those hours were battles.-Battles tend toward simplicity. Especially by the end, you end up using the same tactic over and over.-The story is purely linear. No choice.-The story has, essentially, zero characterization.-The story is VERY slow to reveal things to you. And every villain says the same thing: ""You fool! You're on the wrong side! [insert vague / ambiguous phrasing]."" Eventually you'll wonder, Why don't these guys be a little more clear?-Minimal flexibility in stat & skill assignment. Every class should increase SPEED every level.-Itemization is not good. 99% of your equipped items will be bought from vendors. There's no epic magic items and looting chests is boring because it's usually junk.To summarize, this is a good title. I don't regret buying it. I enjoyed playing it. But I'm quite certain I would have enjoyed my time MORE in a different title that was shorter but with a richer narrative and deeper mechanics.			"

The game makes a lot of fun and seems to be well done and balanced,   for now the first hours of gameplay it makes more fun to play as other games these days .The only Contra (-)  is walking arround with only one member,  can´t choose / change the first Hero .  Walking can´t be done with one click to a point / target at the screen,   we need to hold down mouse button or arrow key ,  that´s all I can say Contra.			"

												A definite recommend for old-school PC RPGs. There is a little learning curve as to how combat works. I would suggest reading a guide about characters and skills or how combat works before starting. I had to start over about 2 hours in once I learned how things go.  My advice is to put one point into the Speed attribute for every character, every single level update.The game does maybe drag a little near the end when you're tyring to clear out the finite random battles for that given area. But if you were brought up in RPGs from the 80s and 90s and don't mind a challenge, this is a must own.			"

								This is one solid game. The other game it reminds me is Wizardry 7... with a bit up-to-date graphics. It has this ""old style"" vibe to it but it does not make me enjoy the game.

												First review I've ever written for anything in my life. And for a good reason.-----This game is RIDICULOUS in how good it is.-----With the lack of quality games recently, I'm becoming the type of person that picks a game up and is bored of it within an hour, tops, because I usually can already tell what the game is, where it's going, and feel like I've already experienced the best it has to offer. For this reason, I typically don't spend money on games and end up playing mindless flash games on the internet.This game is just wow. I downloaded it and just played it for over 5 hours straight. It sucked me in. It's perfectly challenging.I cannot recommend this game enough if you are a fan of RPGs in ANY facet. This could end up being one of my favorite RPGs of all time, and that's saying a lot as I've played and beaten well over 50.I feel like I STOLE the game only paying 20 bucks. I would have paid 50. And I've already only played it for 5 hours.Well done, Numantian Games. I cannot believe this is your first published game. Un-freaking-believeable.I don't think you can top it. I hope you keep putting more time into this game; it could seriously be one of the best ever.			"

If you want to be frustrated and get your group butt kicked a lot then play this game.  I have it set on normal play and have attempted a few different groups of pc's but still get whooped to the point that it is no fun.  I'm stuck in the same areas every time.   I'm guessing if you don't set your group up a specific way you cannot beat this game.  That doesn't leave a lot of freedom in character creation.  Who has time for that?  My goal is to get lost in a game not marry it.I hope the creators address the balance issue.  I'll revisit it when I see an update roll through.			"

												What a great reimagining of the classic western CRPG. I'm about 17 hours in and thouroughly enjoying it. Newer RPGs typically homogonize the experience, so that regardless of how you build your characters, you can't really min/max, become overpowered, or even find yourself UNDERpowered. They keep all the fights at about the same difficulty so that you don't really feel like your leveling choices matter.In Xulima, you CAN make bad decisions. You can go the wrong way. The puzzles are not obvious. There's a real challenge. Sure, there's a little RNG, but that's all role-playing games.The story is great too, truly engaging.Great job to the devs. This is the best new classic RPG I've played since Eschalon 1/2/3.			"

												Lords of Xulima is an old-school isometric party-based RPG with turn-based party combat in the classic RPG style. You control a party of six looking to end a war on your homeland and end up getting caught up in a war between gods in far off lands.While Lords of Xulima is a good game, it's not necessarily a great game. The combat system is a nice and fresh take on a 25+ year old system. The world is large and well detailed. The game definitely doesn't hold your hand, requiring some decent wandering to figure out sometimes where to go next. (hint: make use of the in-game world maps, shows you at  a high level where a lot of things are). The exploration and plant mechanics are interesting and there's a lot to discover about the world.Unfortunately, the story isn't particularly interesting. While the ending is good, the lead up is really just a series of ""defeat X bosses. Ok, you did that, now defeat their Y bosses. Ok, you did that. Now defeat their Z bosses"". With only one set character and 5 generated/built characters, only your one main character speaks to NPCs or has any personality. There's a ton of artificial gating in the world to keep you out of areas you shouldn't be yet. You sometimes don't realize that a path that was gated is now open because you progressed in the story. Thankfully, the game does have a good amount of fast travel between most regions having a gate you can warp around to and each town having ""hearthstone""-like crystals to allow you to quickly return to the town.Look to spend about 40 hours on a playthrough. A lot of that will be grinding levels. The levels come somewhat quickly, but progression in the game is slow. The story is linear, though there are side-quests you can do in pretty much any order. The replay value is very low, except to try on harder difficulties. I recommend the ""Old-School Veteran"" mode. It was a decent challenge, particularly at the beginning.6/10. I'm glad I played through it, but it's not a game I'll remember much of a year from now.			"

Baldur's Gate, Divinity 2, Pillars of Eternity+ Hand crafted work of art+ Challenging yet fair gameplay+ Excellent writing that does not insult me+ Stays away from tropes+ non-grindy - you run out of things to kill- More polish always welcome- Longer endgame and more enemies- Runs slow- Moments force you to clear all random dungeon encounters			"

												This game actively dislikes you and gives you a rough time with level design and with tough fights at the low levels.    The graphics have a bizarre look to them like they were made in a really cheap 3d model studio.    This game doesn't hold your hand and forced me to reload like a dozen times as I moved one pixel too far in the spore fields at the beginning.  Also I love it and can't stop playing it.  It has perfect old-school rpg feel with some pretty intricate combat strategies that you'll appreciate once you realize you screwed up your first party's weapon distribution.   If I had to pick a game this is most like, I'd say this is nearly the HD remake of Phantasie 3.			"

												This game is hard to review, because it fascinated me with its oldschool feeling but on the other hand was quite boring or even frustrating a lot of times.Pros:- Real oldschool feeling- nice resting/food system and nice money into skillpoints system- nice graphics- nice music- some decent puzzles in oldschool styleCons:- a bit grindy, many unnecessary battles stretching the game out- battle is decent but not if you do it 100000 times always the same way- story is very flat, the dialogs pretty bad- some annoying puzzlesOverall, this could have been a very good game if half the battles were not existing... it still is a decent game for oldschool rpg fans.

												Lords of Xulima is a true indie gem. It doesn't at all play like an indie game (perhaps thanks to the generously overfunded kickstarter campaign), even though it's the first game released by the developers.In a nutshell, LoX is a classic console RPG re-imagined for the modern gaming age.What really makes this game unique is the rich combat system. It takes already-established systems and greatly expands upon them to build a brilliant tactical system. For example, while most Final Fantasy games have a front-row/back-row system, the impact of it is minimal, and it's so automatic that some players won't even know it's there. However, it's front and center in LoX, and has a massive impact. Enemy melee attacks can only target your front row, and your melee attacks can only target their front row, usually only from your front row. Furthermore, neither you nor the enemy can have a unit in the back row without another unit in the front row to hide behind; kill that front unit and the one behind it moves up.The game uses a turn-time system whereby faster units get to take more turns. I'm really baffled as to why more games don't use this. (It's quite similar to Final Fantasy 10)There's also the rich debuff system; each weapon type inflicts one of three debuffs, each of which can stack to no limit. There's Bleed, which is a permanent damge-over-time effect which can easily do the majority of damage to a big character, Stun, which delays the unit's next turn and prevents attacks against it from missing for the duration, and Wound, which decreases the unit's stats. Some enemies partially resist some debuffs, and some flat-out immune one or two, but I've yet to find an enemy immune to all three, not even bosses. This is especially nice; your typical classic boss is immune to everything except raw damage, so bosses in LoX are more than just simple slugfests.A word of warning: LoX is hard. Min/maxing, intelligent tactics, and some amount of save scumming will be vital to success.			"

												Really captivating game. It's smart, intensive, full of challenging combat and head-scratching puzzles. Lords of Xulima will keep you on your toes most of the playing time. The graphic is Ok and perhaps is the weakest link of this game. Yet for most of the time you wouldn't notice it. I'd say so far I enjoy Lords of Xulima more than I enjoyed Might and Magic X Legacy. And to think that this game was developed by small unknown team is even more surprising. Highly recommended.  "

												One of my favorite games of 2014.  The game is not incredibly complex, but harkens back to games of old like the Wizardry and Might and Magic series (which the developers are admitted fans of).  The combat is fun and many fights require strategy to defeat without the fights being getting very repetitive.  Combat is a mix of random encounters and static encounters (which you can see on the map).  You can fight enough of the random encounters that they stop spawning (which gives you extra experience) - so they don't bother you forever.  The game is not flawless.  There are some points which are obvious road blocks which you aren't meant to pass without proceeding elsewhere (or levelling up) first.  That's fine - but there's not always an indication or hit of where to go next.  Some areas are intentionally meant to be time consuming to get through, such as the deserts and tundras which require tons of food to get through.Regardless, a great fun game - especially for those who enjoyed the classic RPGs of the late 80s and early 90s.One tip: Level your speed skill heavily on all characters (every level up, or close to every level up).

												This is a really well made RPG. I was surprised by the depth and scope of this game when I started playing it. The art style suits this type of game very well and the music is very soothing making playing this game a very enjoyable experience. It also a quite difficult game, which requires strategic planning and levelling of characters. The enemies don't scale to your level, which means that exploration is dangerous as it is exciting. There is always a general direction the story is taking you, but that doesn't mean there is isn't a fair amount of exploration to be made ""off the tracks"". Oftentimes, you need to explore independently because otherwise you won't be able to take on the enemies further on. This difficulty makes it deeply rewarding when you actually succeed in defeating a boss or making it to the next area.This RPG title introduces a host of different spins and ideas on the genre which I think are valuable for RPGs to come in the future. I would also love to see Numantian Games make more titles as they demonstrated true skill and passion in the design of ""Lords of Xulima"".			"

Early Access Review
								If you enjoyed old school rpgs such as the Final Fantasy series, Chrono Trigger etc then you will want to pick up this game. Have only played a little more than 20 hours and not even a quarter of the way through but I am thoroughly enjoying it myself. The learning curve is a little steep but not so bad once you learn to make use of the tooltip system (hint: Right-click to show the tool tip straightaway without having to hover over for a sec). Remember to save often and keep more than one save file as this game only quicksaves upon changing an area.Pros- Very polished visually and acoustically- Fleshed out immersive gameplay with plenty of optional side quests and challenges.- Engaging and highly strategic combat system- Great character building system- Plenty of hours of gameplay and lots of replay value for the price- Classic RPG feel- Fairly open world (strong enemies are used to keep on the path of the games normal progression but if you are able to defeat them you can go wherever).Cons- Takes a bit of time to get the hang of if you haven't played similar games before- It is possible to lose a lot of progress if you don't save regularily (hasn't happened to me but I can see it being a possibility)- Some players may not like the games scaling economy where prices slightly increase as you level upThis game belongs in the libraries of classic rpg fans or people looking to play a classic rpg.

								If you're looking for a departure from the modern, linear questlines and finger-mashing, Lords of Xulima just may be the game for you. It is a smash-up of games like Ultima, Might and Magic, Baldur's Gate and many others. It pulls many of the qualities that made the early RPGs so great and gives it a 2014 spin.Create your party and venture into the wilderness. Be sure to bring plenty of torches, lockpicks, and food. This game will quickly let you know when you're in over your head and will force you to explore your options in the world instead of bull-rushing a questline.Two thumbs way up on this one.			"

												I wish steam had a neutral rating.  While I did give this a thumbs up, it is barely a thunbs up. I am also writting this review after giving this game a break for a few weeks.  I didn't finish it because I got bored of it.  I wanted to give it time to see if I could get back into it because I wanted to see how the story turned out.   As of this writting, I do not plan on playing this game again to finish it.The good:It has an interesting story (which is sorely lacking from so many games these days) and an intresting world to explore.   It does a good job at drawing you in.The Bad:The game-mechanics are opaque.  You have no idea what skills / powers will do before you purchase them.  The descriptions can give you an idea, but you really do not know.  I am convinced that there is some kind of level mechanic in combat calculations because some encounter will kick your♥♥♥♥♥ and then you level up a few times and suddenly it is easy when nothing else much changed about your party.  The loot is also fairly uninteresting.  Its mainly +stats on most gear and some +damage on weapons.  It is just very dull loot.The Ugly:The game is gated such that there is really only one path to go at any given time.  However this path is not clear.  Basically the gates are monster stacks which will destroy you.  As you ""open up"" the world, you get a much larger area in which to test these monster packs to find the one pack that you can beat.  It gets quite frustrating at times.The combat itself, which you do oh-so-much of, is terribly dull.  At some point many encounters will become trivial to you, yet you fight the same kinds of monster packs over and over and over.  It gets tedious quite fast.  This is the reason I put the game down.  There were a few more ""gates"" of uber monst packs around, and while I was trying to find the one I could beat, I was plagued with endless random encounters that were trivial to beat.  I just cound't deal with anymore and put the game down.  As it turns out, it will be for good.  Still though, I got a tremendous amount of play time considering the money spent.  This is why I gave it a yes vote instead of a no vote.			"

												Hours of compelling and addictive oldschool tactical turn-based rpg goodness, with a lot of attention to detail in crafting the world, its lore, and its gameplay mechanics. It's one of those games that demands that you keep playing it, even when you're knackered and should have gone to bed 4 hours ago. More polished and non-buggy than I've seen a lot of games at release lately (including AAA games), provides more content than many modern RPGs (including AAA games), and has a combat system that on the middle difficulty and above absolutely insists that the player thinks about tactical decisions carefully and rewards gamers for playing cautiously and thoughtfully and picking their targets well. It doesn't pull punches on difficulty, which is great, and the maps are nicely made for a decent amount of exploration (and with lots of hidden secrets and fun stuff to do when you wander off the roads).And I'm so glad that the devs didn't water down and effectively sacrifice any prospect of robust and tactical gameplay by insisting that players co-ordinate their party of multiple characters in combat in real time so it can 'look more action-packed' and frenetic on video footage (dear Bioware: stop doing that, most rpg fans do actually like to think and are capable of doing so).If you like crpgs with tactical turn-based combat like the classic crpgs had, I'm fairly sure you will enjoy LoX and find it staggeringly good value for money. If it were full price I would still consider it good value for money based on the amount of content, detail, and hours of engrossing gameplay.			"

												this is a very good game although will have you taken back a little by the fact it is a little repetative to say the least(lots of grinding) and the game is a bit more linear than you will want to believe before purchase, with that being said you cannot ever say this game will leave you feeling shortchanged on money per time spent as ive about dunked 100 hours on one playthrough and im not done yet( NECESSARY GRINDING ).  the biggest complaint im going to leave is that stats and skills aren't always apparent that they are doing any good as lots of people seem to be confused in early game character leveling wether they are doing the right thing for always seeming to fall short....i think this is done correctly by design to always give a challenge until late game when your finally near the end will you see a difference and be a monster in battle. Overall i myself enjoy rpg's and this one has had my attention the minute i got it during christmas and has carried on strong for a continuous month of play so if thats not enough to get you interested im sure many of the other very positive messages will convince you!!!!Oh by the way as a completionist i do recommend the upgrade package that offers the talisman for a couple bucks more as i DID NOT get that and i CANNOT GET ALL ACHIEVEMENTS without that purchase so for all the other completionists DON'T MAKE THIS MISTAKE!!!(i hate not being aware that i cant get all achievements/things done in game so now i have to play again after said purchase)			"

After that, the grind kicked in.The story is quite horrible for an old school isometric RPG (I expect a superb story of such games, always) and the combat is very repetitive, so there is very little making you want to keep playing after a certain point.Yes, the game is hard, but I knew that and really enjoyed the combat system/theorycrafting, playing on old-school difficulty.Pros:+Nice and simple art style (I saw that many dislike it, watch some videos to decide)+Night and day cycle and dynamic weather+Atmosphere+Hard strategic combat+Music is good but a bit repetitiveCons:-No auto combat like in many turn based JRPGS (would really help with the grind)-Story is horrid-Main character is the weakest class in the whole game, no matter how you build him-Most puzzles forced me to google for answers while alt-tabbed (I don't play isometric cRPGs for puzzles, sorry)-Big class inbalance, you have to do research before creating classes that look/feel good to not end up with a bad choice-Very easy to build any of the party members wrong/bad, making them horrible in combat in an already hard game-Some fights are still cheap even if your party is built perfectlyIf you do decide to buy this game anyway, be advised that you will have to read a lot of guides and do lots of theorycrafting while creating your party, in addition to reading about many in-game mechanics, since you are given very little explanation in game about how things actually work.I feel bad for giving this game a negative review, I tried really hard to like it but would like to save other people the time. I honestly think it's not worth it, there are much better isometric cRPGs out there.			"

												I want to love this game.  I think if I put it on easy I would; I am trying to beat it on hard; it's not fun.It is stressful; I am always scrapping for cash so that I can get back inside the city and don't lock myself into a situation where I'm starving in the woods and wounded, unable to fight my broke♥♥♥♥♥past the city guards.  I don't like feeling rushed in RPGs; so, maybe that's my neurosis.I got it on sale and if it's on sale, get it.  I can't give it a full rating because I haven't played it on easy yet.			"

												this is a very good game although will have you taken back a little by the fact it is a little repetative to say the least(lots of grinding) and the game is a bit more linear than you will want to believe before purchase, with that being said you cannot ever say this game will leave you feeling shortchanged on money per time spent as ive about dunked 100 hours on one playthrough and im not done yet( NECESSARY GRINDING ).  the biggest complaint im going to leave is that stats and skills aren't always apparent that they are doing any good as lots of people seem to be confused in early game character leveling wether they are doing the right thing for always seeming to fall short....i think this is done correctly by design to always give a challenge until late game when your finally near the end will you see a difference and be a monster in battle. Overall i myself enjoy rpg's and this one has had my attention the minute i got it during christmas and has carried on strong for a continuous month of play so if thats not enough to get you interested im sure many of the other very positive messages will convince you!!!!Oh by the way as a completionist i do recommend the upgrade package that offers the talisman for a couple bucks more as i DID NOT get that and i CANNOT GET ALL ACHIEVEMENTS without that purchase so for all the other completionists DON'T MAKE THIS MISTAKE!!!(i hate not being aware that i cant get all achievements/things done in game so now i have to play again after said purchase)			"

												If you are looking for a recent ""old-shcool"" RPG like a Wizardry or a Might and Magic, this is proably it, in that I don't think there is anything else out there. Party Based, Turn-Based Combat from a first person perspective, this might be it. And I really want to like this game, as it is faithful to old-school while adding something new. But I cannot recommend it, as it just takes itself too seriously.It is hard, very hard, unecessarily hard. For some people this might really make it more appealing. But the game has really come down to only two things, have I saved recently and resource management. Everything is based on gold, every hitpoint you have really does boil down to how efficiently you can use it, and the cost to replace it. You can replace hps with food, with mana or at an inn, but all come with a cost.  And every battle is hard. At least at level 6 they all are. There is no resting after every few battles, you need to rest after each fight. unconsious party members don't get exp for parts of battles after they go down. And the monsters progress in difficulty very fast. And there is no place to go grind easier monsters a bit and catch up, let alone get ahead. With all of that said, I made it to level 6. I can make it further, every battle comes down to a very tough fight that a little RNG love going your way means victory, a quick save and move on. But that is not fun. Fighting a long hard battle out, and having it come down to a point where you are just barely going to win, only to have your soldier critically fail and kill himself, instead of the enemy is not fun. Having to start a battle over and over again that the game says is balanced fight is just not fun.  "

												Lords of Xulima certainly delivers on its promise to be difficult.  As many have pointed out, it definitely caters to a more ""hardcore"" fan base.  As fans of the Might and Magic or Ultima series can relate, there will be a lot of time spent trying to understand your characters, their skills, their uses, their scaling, their interactions/synergies, and learning a few other tips and concepts that would normally be outside the bounds of common sense(I’m looking at you herb skill).  In this day and age that means wiki, guide, and forum reading, rather than the previous trial and error systems, to hammer out the workings of your characters.But skipping over all the debates of sleeping off death but not disease, low drop rates, or finite xp, it boils down to seeing Lords of Xulima like this:If you believe ""hardcore"" means the game has a million ways to 100% screw you based off one decision you make, this game is for you.  If you believe ""hardcore"" means the game gives you a 1% chance of beating it and you have to figure out how you want to make that 1% happen, then this game isn't for you.			"

												An otherwise entertaining oldschool party-of-six, turn-based combat RPG, immensely let down by ridiculous art direction, hilariously ugly enemy designs and very amateurish overall visual production, from dull, repeating world backdrops and bad blending and shading to hideous font choices.The graphical side of things is a little too poorly executed for my taste to give this a thumbs up, when even a 17-year-old game like Baldur's Gate 1 looks better and has more detailed backdrops. The game's mechanics are actually enjoyable but the visual side of things tipped this into a ""thumbs down"" for me.			"

												Lords of Xulima is banking heavily on a demographic who are nostalgic for the games it pays homage to and does so at the exclusion of any one else. Without nitpicking about the lack of interesting abilities at your disposal, and in the case of melee fighters the lack of power points to actually employ them, the game is a frustrating slog for far longer than it has any right to be.You will be mashing the quick load/save buttons constantly in both dungeons and those areas in the overworld that are rife with random encounters.Perhaps I was at the precipice that the game finally starts to grant you some decent AoE offensive/healing abilities to make combat less tedious but I wasn't in the mood to get dicked about by the RNG for another million rounds.

												Even with the very little time I spent playing Lords of Xulima I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this game. There are just so many things this game does.  Some will be listed below but again I am not that far. I will likely post a full review when I beat the game. -Exploration is done in 3rd from a top down perspective.  Battles are of course down in Might Magic style meaning 1st person turn based combat.-Music. The music from when you take your 1st steps in the game is just amazing. - Lockpicking and trap disarming. Okay Bethesda I love ya but take note. This is how you do proper lock picking. Basically lockpicking is a game of Minesweeper and trap disarming is to click a gear when it turns green. Simple but really fun. -Combat. Being able to switch party memebers around in combat is a genius idea. I mean let's your cleric is about to die simply put her in the back and let herself and than put back where she was. Again these are just a few of the very awesome changes that I have noticed. In short I encourage you to pick up this game. And plese do yourself a favor and pick it up before the Steam Sale is over.  You can get the Deluxe edition for a really low price.  "

												A game that was o nmy wishlist for a long time but I thought it was overpriced for its content. But at 10$, I thought it was okay so I finally bought it.The game is nice enough to be played on a regular basist. But like many level-up games like this, you will only play it through once or twice since there are no choices to take nor any alternate endings I beleive.It is still a decent game, decent enough to pay 10$ for it, but not more than that. Paying more than 10$ for this game is simply not worth it since there are far betterr games that are cheaper on Steam, some are older some are same age others are newer.It is still a game that I recommand getting your paws onto, but not at a price over 10$			"

												Challenging games can be a lot of fun. Xulima does not master its challenge level in that way. Instead it comes off as torturous, and the only reason to continue is because you are full of spite or you wish to justify the hours you spent on it.If you do play, before you do anything else, comb the internet for advice on adventuring and party creation. If you build your party wrong, you will die a lot and be frustrated. You will probably die a lot anyways. That's the sort of game this is. Save, fight a battle, rest, save, spring a trap, load, walk back and forth until you detect the trap, save, attempt to disarm the trap, etc. You will also want to use those guides so you know the optimal way to improve your characters as you level up, because if you don't optimize you will be dying a lot more. This summarizes how a lot of the game is played, from the very start you need to know what you are doing and plan your characters' lives out through at least level 30. Any sort of organic growth or exploratory game play is actively punished. Want to try a new weapon? You will be dismal in it unless you've been leveling your skill in it from the beginning, and if you've been leveling two weapon skill then you've just been throwing your points away. Same thing for harvesting herbs. You would expect that the game would encourage you to harvest as you do to practice your skills. Instead, you want to wait until the end of the game to harvest herbs because then you will have maximized your skill in this and be able to reap the most profit. Of course, once you do venture out, you will find that your party is likely under powered. Nearly everything else will be more powerful than you, even if you do optimize your build. This will likely lead to saving a lot and resting a lot, the latter also forces you to forage for food, possibly going back to loop through the same areas to build up your food supply because food becomes too expensive to buy.As with many RPGs there is a grind. Sadly, we expect this. Xulima is no different. As the game only has a finite number of encounters, there is only a finit amount of god and experience points. So you will have to continually walk back and forth over an area (possibly while the land tries to kill you with environmental hazards) until you finally get them all. At least it comes with an XP bonus.Finally, the game lacks direction. You are generally left to your own devices to bumble around to try and figure out what area you should go to next, which is to say which creatures you have a chance to defeat. This trial and error naturally leads to more saving and reloading.If all of that does sound like something you like, then know that Lords of Xulima plays like a top down Might and Magic, which is pretty keen. Don't expect anyone other than your main character to have any personality though.			"

												Horrible game. Most likely my fault I always have the highest expectations. Its like HoMM or Kings bounty but with just one party. Completely frustrating and overly restrictive. More of an adventure then an RPG. Even the RPG aspect of it is extremely restricted for example you can only level skills once per level even if your character is drowning in skill points. Trying my best to enjoy it but I cant seem to find anything really appealing about it. The story thus far is♥♥♥♥♥♥ 100 hours of game time is probably spent walking to one possible win to another. Just another game trying to reinvent the wheel when we have seen even the largest developers fail and lose it all. The Talisman DLC is like a cheat box where you gather points and trade them in for money or more skill points that just stack up in the progression screen. I can only push my self so far so maybe there is more to it but I honestly could care less. Hope the dev decides to allocate his skills to a more open and enjoyable game.			"

												I want to like this game so badly. The oldschool feel but with updated mechanics and graphics is really appealing to me, and what I've seen thus far of the story is fantastic.  However, the fact is the devs really half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥optimizing the Linux port so it runs VERY poorly.  So poorly in fact, that it sucks all the fun out of the game and makes just walking around a tiring slog.  In the starting town I'm lucky if I get 12 fps, and I've seen a number of other people with similar complaints.The devs seem absent and unresponsive to reports of problems.This might be all right if you're running Windows, which apparently runs more smoothly. But if you're on Linux, this is a definite Do Not Buy.			"

												I haven't played the most recent updates, but the game was not very balanced well, and just tedious at times.  It also performed horribly for the 2D game that it is.  I'm going to blame that on all the .Net/mono baggage it's carrying.I can't tell you at all about the current version, because it won't run on my system anymore.  Under Linux, it inexcusably tries to *change the desktop resolution*, and ends up only drawing part of the screen in the top left corner.  Dudes... it's 2016 and no one is using CRTs; don't change the desktop resolution.  That wouldn't be a complete show-stopper, but the game *cannot* be played in a window!  There's no option!  Wow.

												I wish I could recommend this game, but I can't. Firstly, lets start with the good parts: story. I like the story of this game. I find it intriguing, and mainly the reason I'm still playing this game. Can't say how long that will last. And this swiftly brings us to the bad stuff: mostly everything else. Combat is the probably biggest flaw I find. Many people seem to like playing this on the ironman challenge because of the games diffculty. But it all comes down to rng. Since you see when a fight's coming up, I always quicksave. Then during the fight I always have the same strategy, if I lose I reload and reapet. At one time I win, meaning that it all boiled down to rng and not skill. Fights are hard, almost too hard. I play on normal, and grind as much xp as possible too keep a head. Before the fight, you can see how difficult it will be, and most fights are challenging or higher. A lot of mobs that are way to high level for you too fight all around, making you have to zigzag through the map. During the fights, as I've said, it boils down to rng. Every attack, except the mages spells, have a hit precentage. It feels like it's lower than what it says, 70% feels more like 50 %, but that can be my frustration. The enemy usually have a higher precentage, and also take a lot more damage to you than you to it. You have the advantage of being more people, but also, you can always count -1 since the healer does nothing more than heal, because when it's his/her turn, someone needs the healing. Sometimes when you're about the attack, you recieve a ""critical failure"" and instead of damaging the enemy, or you know, missing, you instead take damage yourself. As if the legendary group destined to save the world fall on their own weapons. Needless to say, I have never seen this happen to the enemy. Only your group will suffer from this. But all of this doesn't matter since it is just to do a quick load and pray to the rng gods. Sometimes enemies can sneak up on you, but your main character have a camouflage ability, where you can spend some action points and hide from the group. A few minutes ago when I played, my talisman (will talk about him later) told me that the shadows are stalking me. Suddenly, I'm ambushed to a fight I cannot escape. This felt weird since you initate combat by approching a visible enemy. The other ambushes you get the option to evade. Luckily I won that fight, but if I hadn't, it would have been just to reload and lose the progress. The food system is also really weird. The most popular mod right now tries to fix this, and it really needs fixing. Firstly: since you need to rest and heal after every fight, your crew is eating through the food like there's no tomorrow. You can of course stock up on food, for a high price, but be careful! 150 gold for a 3 day reserve means 150 gold for the reserve to fill up UNTIL you have 3 days worth of rations. You recieve the difference between what you have and 3 days. If you have rations for 2 days and 23 hours, you pay 150 g gold for 1 hour of food. if you have 1 hour of food left, you pay 150 g to receive food for 2 days and 23 hours.  To buy one more days of rations (so you have 4) costs another 200 g. But to fill up so you have 1 day costs like 30 or 50. I also bought this game during a sale, so without knowing what I was buying, bought all of the dlc. The DLC is pay to win. One of the DLCs are basically guides and walkthroughs of the game. The other is the Talisman of Gotot, an item that can help you by giving you gold/food/skill points when you ask for it. The DLC does not involve any other kind of contet. I have not yet gotten frustrated enough to stop playing this game alltogether. But if given the option of a refund, I would have taken it without second thought.			"

After The Video Review: Lords Of XulimaI normally do this anyways and I had a lot to say so I just kept it in this format.The Good: Old school style with new school mechanics:it has kind of an old school feel of ultima in a way but it’s supported by new age combat and graphics.Interesting combat game-play:basically if your enemy is using a melee weapon and he’s to the far left of the screen he can’t attack the far right without moving first, which costs half a turn to move. In addition to that it’s all turn based combat with weapons and skills that can stun and while not as comprehensive as say final fantasy x and it’s turn based system it’s still pretty good.The voice overs are pretty good:often the proper voice can make or break a game, but they pretty much nailed it here the narrator and the voice of god sound very appropriate and usually are dipping with dramatic feel to it.The environments are pretty well detailed and everything looks good:it actually a good thing to be a developer on Steam and not have your game look like it was done in MS Paint and here it looks really well done, with good detail in pretty much everything you encounter and every where you go.It has a Steam workshop:there is too many mods and for the most part they haven’t done too much in terms of really outlandish stuff, but it’s always nice to have.The Bad:The outright necessary grinding:I’m not kidding here you WILL grind in this game you WILL kill every enemy in every area if you want to continue on your quest there is no maybe here.but wait there’s more! the enemy's are finite and you get a bonus for killing all of them that you will need, so you LITTERY have to go everywhere to fight every enemy.The lack of skills:the ones they do have are more trial and error and outside of the divine summoner class it feels like most characters really don’t have a lot of skills in the beginning and as they level up they still feel really under powered.Complete lack of explanations:most of the skill icons you can’t click on so you don’t know what they do same with the icons on the weapon stat’s, even concepts like when poison or bleeding will affect you is never explained, Also it never gives you a look at what skills you character will receive way down the line so you're never sure what you're building towards.Often times completely unrealistic with its difficulty:somehow even after you take down nearly EVERY enemy in EVERY part you can go in a map if you didn’t build you didn’t min/max your characters correctly then congrats you get to start all over again from the beginning of the game.it has such an unforgiving difficulty that even if you have been playing CRPG’s your entire life you're still going to lose, that being said however you're probably going to restart to get your revenge (after you buy a new keyboard).The DLC feels like a slap in the face:I swear it like the devs when they making them were like “aww is it too hard for you? that’s ok you can just spend more of your money too make it allll better.” It has a weird stutter when you run:this could just be my computer but it has a really weird jerky stutter when your character starts running again it could be just me but it’s weird.The Summary:This game just is not approachable by anybody who isn’t direly serious about needing a challenge in a CRPG and Dark Souls & Bloodborne just aren’t your thing, everybody else just needs to stay away from this title because the only thing you’ll find with this game is frustration and a lot of broken keyboards, but if you can make it past all that there is a good game here albeit one I can’t recommend but a good game all the same.Final score: 7/10 Good			"

												For all the reasons I like to play this, and there are quite a few, I also get incridibly frustrated with this game and end up rage quiting at times.  It's old school, I like old school, the old school ruins this game for me.  The game stresses customization and options.   You have a party of 6 characters and there are 10 classes to choose from.  You have to pick the explorer, but he can be a very different explorer depending on the other classes in the group.  This is awesome.  But the game is hardcore, very hardcore (old-school).  Out of the thousands of possible combinations that should be somewhat viable formations, only a handful are actually survivable, even on easy mode.  A couple of the classes are just bad.Quick-save now, quick-save often.  Did something just happen and I want to keep that?  Quick-save.  Didn't quick-save in the last 2 minutes since your last death, well you're dead again.  Running from battles is actually makes up a huge portion of the game.  That's why the explorer is MANDITORY.  But even running doesn't always save you from certain death.Read the guides here on Steam.  They all explain the game as if every little desicion you make is extremely vital to your success with the game.   And that's because it it.  There's very little room for waste.   There's a food mechanism, exploring is done by quick-saving the game everytime before leaving the main path.   You many find nothing, or your may find death.  Either way you will be loading the save file.It's really too bad that the bad outweighs the good for me.  This game is fun when it wants to be.			"

After a while it just gets weird because there's no challenge at all. Things are either impossibly difficult or very easy after 1-2 levelups and you just go through roadbloacks that ""unlock on level 10"" etc. I wouldn't recommend it for full price at all.			"

												I bought it because people recommended it. The game was fun the first few hours, but when the game is so extremely linear you feel more and more frustrated when you play the game. In which spot is the content now so I can advance? You can sadly only do one task at a time. You also need to harvest vegetables after each mission. 40 of them!!! How fun is that!? When you click the vegetables your character don't even go there and pick it up. You need first to move your character to correct spot and after that click the vegetable. You need to do that for 40 of them. What did devs thought of? If I don't harvest, it will hurt your economy badly as you need to pay 100 gold entry fee each time you go back to the village where the next not so fun quest is? Why do I need to pay a fee each time I enter the village and need to communicate about the same thing over and over again. Not so fun. Very repetive game. However I think if they would have done it little different, it would have been a good game. If you are a person who likes to do repetive linear tasks I highly recommend this game. Otherwise not. "

												Ultimately this game breaks out into two types of people.Those who enjoy a high challenge and those that thought it was a casual game like HoMM.There's very little direction, which thus far has been incredibly ungratifying while being incredibly time consuming.With finite encounters, if you hit a wall due to a poor level choice you can't easily recover.I kept trying to go back and hope that once I got passed the initial difficulty hump it would get better, but while the encounters became much easier everything else was just incredibly slow.100% would not recommend this game for anyone looking for a casual RPG.

												Lords of Reload is a better title.  If you like rolling the dice and reloading every time it fails, then this will be fun for you.  The game creators couldn't come up with a challenge, so they added chance.Hope you can hit with that 75% chance.  Nope, four misses in a row so I lose the fight.  So you face the same fight multiple times.  But, they don't want you to get to a point where chance isn't a major factor, so fights are limited.  I hate grinding, but I hate not having the option even more, which I know sounds strange.Play yahtzee instead.			"

												Can't really recommend, though I'd give it more of a neutral vote if I could. If you're looking for a throw-away fantasy RPG experience, I guess this'll do, but there really isn't anything at all here of any value beyond that. The game basically consists of finding the next fight that you can possibly survive, surviving it, and repeating that process hundreds of times. There's otherwise not a lot of thought that you can put into it. I don't think the game has a single multi-floored dungeon. It also has some really awful voice-acting, to where you'd be better off voicing things yourself.			"

Cheap tricks like stacking poisons by fast mobs while you are limited to a single cure poison spell later in game. Nausea or sickness are healed with expensive cures or must wait much later for a spell. Towns are clones with slight variations. Resource management is always the challenge and becomes very tedious and simply not interesting. Not sure why so many positive reviews, but I have trouble enjoying this game.			"

												It has a great look and feel with interesting RPG mechanics, but the combat is just too harsh and unforgiving. I gave it 9 hours of slogging but I just can't look forward to barely scraping by in every combat. I played on the lowest difficulty and I can't imagine why anyone would put themselves through it. Mobs that hit your highest defense characters for 1/3 their health and simultaneously set up a bleed for another 1/3 per turn?... Come on I only brought one Cleric! Paladins are useless, weak in both combat and healing. And either I was consistently shafted by the combat dice rolls or there's something fishy going on with the RNG, when I typically have a reported 60%+  to 80%+ change on hitting but gosh, 90% of swings still miss. Another thing I don't like is the constant need to have a food supply. That doesn't add fun to the game, just adds worry to every step I take and limits my choices.It has real promise, I like the engine but I think the combat should be overhauled and just remove the Paladin class since you need to take a Cleric anyway and the Paladin's too mediocre at everything.

												I won't go into the general pros and cons of this game because everyone has covered them pretty exhaustively here and there's really no need for me to cover them again. However, I want to go over my own particular gripes with the game, not because I think my opinion will be of use to anyone, but because I want to express some small act of defiance for a purchase I regret.I'll admit I didn't give the game much time, but it didn't take me long to figure out why I wouldn't like it. I create my characters, drop into the game, and find that my entire party is represented by some boring schmuck who proceeds to speak for everyone in the conversation that shortly ensues. What kind of roleplaying game lets you create a party and then sidelines them to focus on the blandest man in fantasyland? It appears to me that your characters have no presence in the story whatsoever, their only purpose being to back up the bog-standard chosen one in the combat sequences. Some may find this to be of little significance, but it really upset me. When I pick up something that proclaims itself to be an RPG, I expect that to mean more than some character portraits and stat management.I'm sure Lords of Xulima is a fine game, but for a roleplaying game there was a disturbing lack of roleplaying, and I wish I hadn't bought it.

The amount of FPS I get from it is horrible and that's a 2D sprite based game. As soon as you fight anything that flies the games slows down to a crawl. Besides that, the odds are fixed poorly. The game's balance is hanging by a thread regardless of which level of difficulty you play on. It happens often that the game crashed after an important battle for some reason. You need to keep multiple saves in this game.The only positive I can agree about is the length of its story. Unfortunately, I haven't seen enough to say whether it's really original content or not. Right now it looks like a regurgitated story line.Only bother if you're looking for lengthy game experience on Windows.			"

												I don't recommend this game for the simple reason that if you are the type of person whoe doesn't spend effort to do research before buying this game or you read only a few reviews for to decide if you would like a game, you will not enjoy this type of so called ""old school"" game in the first place.Yeah yeah yeah, I am a loser, I am dumb, this game completely owned me and destroyed me in its intended difficulty.   Now I am facing the decision to start a new game in normal and run through the game mindlessly, OR continue painfully ATTEMPT to reload and reload and reload the game.This is the type of game that wake people up for the REALITY that they are not the cool hardcore people that they think they are, or how they used to be when they are still young.  And such enlightenment for such a small price, really save you a lot more money in the long one because you will avoid games advertised as ""old school"" forever.			"

												I do not recomend this game.If you have a multiple monitor set up then you will run into problems.  There is no support to speak of.Once I got the game to work by disabling my 2 other monitors, I was actually able to play the game.Gameplay was pretty banal.   Mostly centering aorund button mashing.I bought this game for $15 on sale and it was way too expensive all thins considered,  This game is so bad I wish I could get my money back.Stay away from this title.

												I bought this game due to someone I know enjoying it and figured I would give it a try. I have to say, I regret doing so.The game is so straight forward and lacks any sort of new ingenuity. I know it's supposed to be a ""throw back"" game, but damn. It's just too much.Your characters classes are dull. It gives the hint of leveling up freedom to bend the classes somewhat, but with the point system your basically making one type of character, or making a super weak useless character that ""breaks the mold"".The story seems deep at first, but I found it was sort of ""meh"" after a point. The in game NPCs are horrible.There is a certain Might and Magic vibe to the game. If you were REALLY into the M&M games and want to play something like them again. Perhaps this game is for you. If not, I can't suggest it.			"

												I'm VERY disappointed with this game.  I invested a lot of time (although the 453 hours is obviously an exaggeration, lots of the time I just left it running for days when I wasn't playing) in building up my party, playing in Hardcore Ironman mode.  At first, the game was difficult and challenging.  The problem is that with sensible play and strategy, the game just gets easier and easier and easier.  By the end, I was just going through the motions, when I couldn't possibly lose a fight, and would be unlikely even to lose a single character (who could easily be revived anyway), even in boss fights.  I would say at least the last half of the game was without challenge.  What is the point??  I wish I had known in advance that the game would become super boring and pointless.			"

												I'd like to say this is a standard RPG and reminds me of Neverwinter, but aside from the appearance that is a lie. The story is pretty typical where you have an evil god and the rest are fighting against him. The 'chosen' humans get involved and do the work for the good gods and defeat the evil god. And then plot twist. I didn't run into any bugs or plot holes, but the character builds are skewed badly. I don't regret kickstarting this but I do regret not cheating earlier. Pros:- Details of expected plot twist are unexpected- No bugs- Shop prices are typically good- Scrolls and skill books to offset magic uselessness- Going over the weight limit doesn't actually cause any problems- Skills (eventually) become available to help(-ish) offset the stat issues- Multitudes of skills- Pretty graphicsCons:- Character stats are unbalanced (SPD and AGL should have just been rolled into DEX. And why would CON affect your carry weight instead of STR?)- Magic is useless - persistently low MP pool on all characters, high MP costs for low damage. And the only thing the 'magic' stat affects is the MP pool- Predictable plot twist- Preachy and obedient main character (I really hate zealots)- Not enough skill points per level - when skills can cost 4+ and you only get 4/lvl?- Skill point trainers instead of skill trainers, and the gold requirement rises exponentially- Food - I like being able to rest and heal, but you lose food too quickly to make later (mandatory) areas anything but a grindRecommendations to anyone playing:Use the editor to do the following:- Drop the magic costs, and up the power- Up the Divine Prayer, Energy Absorption, Exploration and Hunting level limits- Up Divine Prayer secondary power rate and Energy Absorptions primary rate- Increase the random encounter rate to 10 - this way you'll be able to actually clear an area without running out of food 6+ times- Increase the food limit and drop the food consumption- Up the Skill Points gained per level			"

												First of all, no windowed mode. I've got a Linux PC with 4 screens, and the game doesn't let me change the resolution or the active scren, so everything looks messed up. And though it shows up on a single screen, it tries to use all the memory at once, so it gets terribly slow and laggy. To be honest, I just don't want to go through each and every config file to find a  string that can make it all look better, I googled for a little bit, so as far as I understand, you can't just go ahead and set it up as you want it. When I turned 3 screens off, it detected the right resolution and worked much better, but do I really have to do that every time I want to play this particular game? Nope. So, if you have a multiscreen Linux configuration, be prepared for a big and laggy mess. Really sorry to see that in 2016.			"

												Ok, I've only played for about an hour (dunno why it says less than an hour, but anyway). Plot Since this is a RPG, the main thing here is the plot, which is simple and falls very short. Suddenly some big guy choose you to go to a strange place and you are supposed to destroy the evil lurks within (not exactly that, but you get the idea). Name places', nor characters names, are consistent or makes sense. GraphicsI didn't like the graphics at all, but I imagine someone could like them. There are a strange mix between illustrations, and hand-drawn and Gaulen animations are clumsy.CombatMechanics are simple, but fights are boring. Just click, and occasionally use an ability. Monsters are repetitive too.  Fights are hard, but not rewarding, besides, how is possible that I'm being picked by some sort of god, but I can barely manage a party of three goblins. I don't know, it doesn't make sense.You just have to walk around to find which fights you can pick, and then go into the next one, and then rinse and repeat. Characters fall flat, specially the ""the hero"" Gaulen, that doesn't have any kind of personality on his own.I just played one day, today I found the game using space in my hard drive, and haven't been touched since the day I installed it. The game is simply not fun at all.This makes me sad, I've backed a lot of games in kickstarter (not this one though), and I'm getting constantly disappointed :/PS.- it doesn't work very well on Linux (unoptimized), though I didn't encounter as much problems as other players.

												Small review just to highlight some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in this game.Whenever the game shows a percentage for you, like 60-70% chance to hit, don't trust it. It probably means 40-50%. Every action has a critical failure chance (like 10%) where you hurt yourself and the rest of the time you're going to miss for whatever reasons.So you think 70-80% is pretty good? Think again it means you'll either miss or hurt yourself half of the time. And you'll roll low on damage the other time.And no, this is not ""normal"" or ""typical for a RPG"" or ""oldschool"". I have played plenty of RPGs before, Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Wasteland 2, Fallout series ... I know what 60-70% chance to hit is like. And this game's RNG is clearly not accurate. I can just spin up the game any time and get my parties to miss 3-6 times in a row despite the odds should be in my favor (and there are no character with ""wounded"" status either, in case anyone is wondering).Expect your entire party to go on miss streaks at least one round every single fight. Yeah and that's really the entire game's difficulty - suddenly everyone goes on a missing streak, casters fizzle their spells and then you die.If you still think that's fun or acceptable, go read other reviews, they'll do this game more justice.

												This game is a test of your patience. I failed that test. I restarted multiple times trying to enjoy the game but I just can't. The start of the game is laughably difficult in terms of your people dying from most encounters. ""Death"" is very soft in this game, you can rest to ""revive"" but the game uses that as an excuse to be able to just blow you up since revival is a rest away.This game also gives you very little direction. I don't need my hand held but SOME indication of where I need to go would be helpful. I had to save, then just run around EVERYWHERE trying to find a new place to go that wasn't blocked off by an ""impossible"" (the rating the game gave the monster) fight; or by a random encounter that just wipes my party or a NPC that won't let me pass.I feel like I gave it an honest effort. I WANT to like this game but it's so a slog at the beginning that I can't.			"

												I wanted to like this game.  I really did.  But it is just fundamentally badly designed.  One of the main draws of the genre is exploration.  This game LITERALLY makes you pay for every single step you take.  Food is expensive and you have to pay the guards every three in-game days, even to LEAVE town.  Not to mention that if you accidentally don't make an ideal party, start over.  I've been playing C-RPGs since Zork and have put thousands of hours into games like the old Gold Box AD&D SSI games, as well as Wizardy, Ultima, and pretty much everything else.  They were trying to make a game like that.  Basically they just showed how to screw up a game like that.			"

												So, I really want to like this game.  I dig the turn based combat and old school feel, however the game is overly difficult.- I'm at a point right now where my characters are level 5 and I really can't advance because the map is static and enemies don't refresh.  - I've gotten some jobs from the local town, however they are impossible to complete.  - I can't go anywhere else on the map because there are guardians blocking the choke points preventing further movement.- I have no clue what I should actually be doing.  There is dialogue and history told, but I'm unclear what the next step is or what my ultimate goal is.  Coupled with the inability to move around the map or powerlevel  up to defeat enemies, I'm pretty much at a standstill.  I might try and play now and again and review if anything changes,  but honestly, this game is too expensive to recommend.  Guess I'll continue looking for a game like this that's actually playable.  (FYI, I'm an old school RPG gamer from the Ultima 1+ days, so this style of play is right up my alley) "

Early Access Review
								THE GOOD:Sound, and voice are well done.Well drawn and pretty to look at and exploreLockpicking and traps are well done.Old school feel.THE BAD:OH GOD how more clihe can it get?!?Another game where gods have chosen poorest schmuck on earth and his friends to save the world (again). To gain first level you go killing rats and spiders (sigh). And so on...You have to pay for EVERYTHING npc's do in game and it gets more and more expensive wit level (they're on to you). You can go harvesting field for money - not very heroic, bit boring.No very much choice on first levels apart from hit this guy with hand held object and hope you dont miss.I was hoping for some originality and smoother gameplay while keeping that old school feel. Why cant we skip this first few boring levels where there is no strategy? That was very boring part for me. Also i can see how this is going to end:  we will defeat bad guy in epic battle after hours of grind and collecting mushrooms on tha map. I do not have much reason to play apart that i already got the game and it's pretty to look at. Hope it will get better with next few levels.			"

												Horrible, just horrible.  Terrible game play and the graphics remind me of the first RPG I played in the late 90's.  I feel like I've been ripped off by this game.  I know this isn't Steam's fault, but I feel like I've been let down, I feel like Steam's quality control process should not allow horrible games like this into the store.The combat system is a joke, the loot mechanics are silly.  The people who made this game should feel bad about what they've done.  Everything about this game feels lazy and ""phoned in"" as if their only intention was dup'ing idiots like me into spending $20 for something I can't return.This has seriously turned me away from purchasing games on Steam.  I think I'm going to stick with dumping my money into mobile games.  The mobile games may be just as much of a scam as this low-rent robbery, but at least they're up front about their scam and their games don't look like highschool grade, first draft garbage.I would not recommend this game to anyone.

												Too punishingly hard to be fun; even on the easiest setting. Didn't enjoy it and gave up very early into the game.			"

												Alot of bandwaging going on here with this game.The game actually looks nice, except for the low res world map you walk around in.The problem lays in balance etc, one group is laughingly easy , then suddenly next group is impossible, plus the quests arent laid out good, for example you can not go forwards as you will get beaten badly but no more quests are here or nothing to grind.I see this in alot of indie games like this, they start well but quickly sink into a anoying unbalanced anoying experience.

												This game is absolute turd cake. The worst cutscenes. Terrible, repitetive combat mechanics. Art looks gross. Even so, I sank 80 hours of my depressed life into this game. But then i changed computers and it wouldn't fetch my saved games from the cloud? So i have to start over again. Thankfully I bought this on sale but its still not worth the money i paid for it.			"

												It's hard, but worth it.  I love the interface, the story is good (kind of generic fantasy, but that isn't a bad thing at all) and the game play is intuitive.  Totally worth the price.  I'm only 6 hours or so into it and completely hooked.  It makes me want to go back and play some old Might and Magic.I am definitely looking forward to more games from these guys.			"

												So I just finished the game last night, and I was sorely disappointed in the ending of the game. Through the entire game I was faced with challenges and puzzles, only to be presented with a horrible ending as that. Hopefully some free dlc will be available to finish this story.			"

												Lords of Xulima takes me back to the 1980's of CRPG's.  That is high praise from an old timer.  This game is a combination of Might and Magic, Wizardry, The Bards Tale and even some Heroes of Might and Magic.  I would just like to thank the makers of this game and I am glad they did not make it too easy or hold your hand with the quests or where to go.			"

												As you can see I only played 3 hours so this is no review but my first impressions of this game. If you like games like Ultima, Wizardry, Elminage, Realms of Arkania, Might and Magic 4/5 (Xeen) or M&M X, I'm sure you will enjoy this game too. Very impressive design and battlesystem. It runs in 1920x1080 without borders (have no clue about other resolutions), looks great and the battlesystem is just what I like most in a turn based RPG. Your party consists of 6 people, one is fixed and non-editable but the other 5 you can put in every class you like. Hover your mouse over each object like rocks or webs, cause there may be an item or gold hidden behind it. I've made a 'my first steps' video on youtube, basically to make my friends aware of this game. I'll drop in the link in this text too. 9/10

												Only just started the game, but it's very fun. Right away you can tell that there is so much depth in this game. The music so far is better than just about any other fantasy game I've played. To me, the game so far is really immersive. It really feels like I'm on an adventure with my comrades and it's realistically challenging yet rewarding. The graphics are just right for this time and in this particular game they couldn't be better in my opinion. The gameplay is very smoothe and very polished. For the price tag, it's an obvious buy for anyone who likes old school fantasy rpgs.			"

												Good modern take on an old school genre. The game does have it's flaws though:- The food system is annoying, - The early game rng will make you want to break your keyboard, - The story is pretty mehHowever there is a lot of good in it. - The game looks good, - The classes are interesting, and the options for skills last for a while. - There is a lot of exploration and a pretty big world to do it in- The game is just fun "

												If you want something that'll take you back to the glory days of Might & Magic and Wizardry, you could do a lot worse than this.It's not a particularly deep game, but that's not the point. It's a nostalgia trip and it works pretty damn well on that front.So yes, if that is what you're looking for (and if you're going through the reviews for this game it's pretty likely that you are), I can definitely recommend this game.Pros:+ The world is pretty damn big and exploring it is fun.+ Different classes really do feel very different in how they work in your party, and none of them feel like you wasted a character slot.+ Good music.+ Good amount of variety in enemies, gear and so on.Cons:-  Flat main character, flat NPCs. Characterization is not this game's strong point.-  Combat can be a little too luck-based at times. The same boss battle can be an instant wipe one time and an easy win another. Expect to do a lot of reloading.- Some very exploitable mechanics.- Simplistic plot with very predictable twists.			"

												A great old-school style RPG. The story is generic but well-developed, though it focuses a lot more on combat than dialogue. It doesn't hold your hand at all and leaves it up to you to create a good party, level them up properly and not die horribly. It's pretty difficult so if you don't play efficiently you can quite easily get stuck later on without food and gold (if you use too much). There's lots of exploration as you don't get much direction and have to find quests and where to level up best by yourself. There's also a lot of secret rooms, puzzles and treasure. I literally had to get out some paper and start making maps for one of the puzzles x.x			"

												A very refreshing game, after only 20 hours in and I've barely scratched a quarter of the overall content it's definitely my kind of RPG.  There is no doubt it pulls a lot of old school design and influence for the making of this game. The answer is not always obvious, you have to read and think about what each quest is required.  Brute force is not always the answer and the answer may not be all that obvious at first.  Exploration, attention to detail and understanding solid group dynamics is the key to beating this game.  This game takes me back to many old school games like Darklands, the Might and Magic original series and Wizardry.  It uses a top down view for moving around, with the team view for combat, being turn based it really makes you consider tactically what you should do for each fight.Lots of skills for each class to specialize into to make each character distenct with options.Riddles, deadly traps, puzzles and enormous creatures that can kill you with a single blow.  It's not for the faint at heart.			"

One can always level on random encounters, you never feel like ok now i just run through the rest of the game. For me this was one of the best rpgs i had lately. Also very good story behind the game.			"

												It would be hard to explain how much I've enjoyed my 17 hours (in just a few days!) with this game. The graphics are good enough, it hasn't crashed once, and the combat system is positively wonderful. At first you feel like your party will never be able to kill anything of importance and little by little the party comes together to form a well-oiled fighting machine. The contextual help built into the game (just hover your mouse over anything) is a welcome change from the 90s era games that lacked such things. Well worth the asking price and definitely more fun than a lot of AAA titles I've purchased over the years.			"
